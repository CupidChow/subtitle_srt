1
00:00:01,632 --> 00:00:03,121
The Japanese...

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,735
...shot six bullets into my body.

3
00:00:07,013 --> 00:00:10,516
These wounds are from the assassination
of Terauchi Masatake in 1920.

4
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:12,176
Two bullet wounds.

5
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:14,964
This was from Huangpu District, Shanghai
in 1922.

6
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,545
This one is from Khabarovsk in 1927.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,754
This one is from Ichigu Explosion in 1932.

8
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:23,353
This shot next to my heart was in 1933.

9
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:25,683
You say I sold three comrades.

10
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,594
But you know nothing!

11
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:31,131
You have no idea how I felt
when I sent them away.

12
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:37,369
I risked my life for this war, your honor!

13
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,040
Great, thanks.
Leave your profile over there.

14
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:41,267
Yes!

15
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:42,949
I'm rookie actor, Lee Jungi!

16
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:44,244
Please remember me!

17
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:47,840
Excuse me, sir.

18
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:49,833
We have to start shooting the movie soon.

19
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:51,444
Where are we going to find a body double?

20
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:52,494
Yeah.

21
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:54,179
Hold on.

22
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:56,896
Hey, you.

23
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,675
-Come over here.
-Me?

24
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:08,113
W-W-What are you doing?

25
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,445
What's your height and weight?

26
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,495
181cm and 71kg.

27
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,089
181cm and 71kg?

28
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:15,926
Would you like to star in a movie?

29
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:17,277
I have a part for you.

30
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:18,254
Really?

31
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:21,592
Whichever role you give me,
I'll my very best!

32
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,813
Good.

33
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:25,185
But the thing is...

34
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:28,555
You'll be a body double for a bed scene.

35
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:30,907
It's not even just a bed scene.

36
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:33,397
A body double for a bed scene?

37
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:37,007
-That's a bit...
-Right?

38
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,448
-You can't do it, huh?
-No, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:41,695
You have the same build as our male lead.

40
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:42,836
So, I asked you just in case.

41
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,438
-Okay. You can go now.
-Thank you.

42
00:01:49,044 --> 00:01:51,444
We've already rented the location
and set everything up.

43
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,747
I told Sujeong we'll be shooting
on that date.

44
00:01:57,547 --> 00:01:58,551
Wait.

45
00:01:58,734 --> 00:01:59,943
Sujeong?

46
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:03,423
-That pure and voluptuous Shin Sujeong?
-Yeah.

47
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:06,747
Then I'll be shooting
the bed scene with her?

48
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,575
Yeah, our female lead is Shin Sujeong.

49
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,989
I'll do that bed scene!

50
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:12,667
I can go full naked!

51
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:13,693
Okay, good!

52
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:15,702
You know nothing!

53
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,603
Don't miss a spot.

54
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:29,525
Okay.

55
00:02:29,614 --> 00:02:32,236
And put more on my back.

56
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:34,125
-My back is the most important.
-I got it.

57
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:36,366
But you have to keep your promise.

58
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,553
-Get me Shin Sujeong's autograph.
-Okay.

59
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,461
Don't miss any spots.

60
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,813
Stay still.

61
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,064
I'm home.

62
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:48,866
What the hell?
This is a very unpleasant scene.

63
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:51,963
Jungi's applying lotion
because he was cast in a movie.

64
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:54,556
What role needs a smooth back?

65
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:57,753
He's a body double for a bed scene.

66
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,880
A body double for a bed scene?

67
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:04,351
-Unbelievable...
-Let go of me.

68
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:06,300
Watch what you're saying.

69
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:08,288
Do you know who my partner is?

70
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,367
It's Shin Sujeong. Shin Sujeong.

71
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:16,036
Even if I was just a staff on the set,
I'd be like "Thank you so much".

72
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:18,917
Of course.
It's no other than Shin Sujeong.

73
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,303
Gee, men...

74
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:26,831
I'll get going.

75
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,615
Okay.

76
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:28,601
Where are you going?

77
00:03:29,904 --> 00:03:32,328
-Today's your first baking class, huh?
-Yeah.

78
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:33,813
Have fun.

79
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,415
Don't fall asleep during class,

80
00:03:35,504 --> 00:03:37,117
-and listen to the teacher.
-Got it.

81
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:38,485
Do you have everything?

82
00:03:38,574 --> 00:03:39,529
Yes.

83
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:42,580
I have my wallet and my phone.

84
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:44,987
-Do you know the way?
-Of course.

85
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,392
It's...

86
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:48,225
It's...

87
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:49,642
Here.

88
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:51,931
That's the bus number
and the bus station you get off at.

89
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,934
Directions to the school is on there too.

90
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:57,504
Thank you, Donggu.

91
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,506
See you later.

92
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,629
-Take care.
-Yes.

93
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:03,908
-Watch out for cars.
-I will.

94
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,436
What was that?

95
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:11,066
You're like newlyweds
seeing his wife off in the morning.

96
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:14,026
Tell me about it. And you got her a map.

97
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:17,157
I can smell something suspicious.

98
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:19,515
Nothing's going on.

99
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:23,563
I didn't want her getting lost
and calling me for help again.

100
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,139
Stop sniffing.

101
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:28,356
It was a joke. Why are you getting angry?

102
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:30,060
You have so much anger.

103
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,772
Yeah, that makes him seem
even more suspicious.

104
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,940
What are they talking about?

105
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:38,538
I like Yuna?

106
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:41,040
I was acting out of pity.

107
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:43,215
Like helping out a poor person.

108
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:45,045
Yes, that's it.

109
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:48,488
I'm too kind.

110
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:50,223
Too kind.

111
00:04:50,388 --> 00:04:53,043
Are you all writing this down?

112
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:54,527
Knead the flour with hot water.

113
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:03,470
Thank you.

114
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,999
It will make my skin
look like a baby's skin.

115
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:13,040
Nice.

116
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,158
Donggu.

117
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,164
Can you put this on my butt
when we get home?

118
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:20,260
You're crazy. Why would I ever do that?
Are you crazy?

119
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:22,422
You're making such a big fuss.

120
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:23,923
Help me apply it.

121
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:26,092
Isn't that Yuna?

122
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:29,138
Thanks for the ride.

123
00:05:29,226 --> 00:05:30,787
-Get home safely.
-Bye.

124
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,408
-Yuna.
-What are you doing outside?

125
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:36,602
Were you waiting for me?

126
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:38,071
Of course not.

127
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,902
We bought diapers for Seol.

128
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:41,476
Who was that?

129
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:43,900
I met him in the baking class.

130
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:45,942
He gave me a ride home
because it was on the way.

131
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,822
You're so popular already.

132
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:50,191
Popular?

133
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,121
Why did you take a stranger's car?

134
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,219
She met him in the baking class.

135
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:59,325
And why do you care
if she takes a stranger's car?

136
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:00,438
Well...

137
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,062
She's being a nuisance.

138
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:06,582
I told you if you keep troubling people...

139
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,595
That it will become a habit?

140
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:09,255
I got it. I'll be more careful.

141
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:10,570
All right!

142
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:14,541
Don't yell!

143
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:22,627
Why?

144
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,062
You don't like it?

145
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:27,845
I wish there was a more provocative scene.

146
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:30,023
I don't know what you mean.

147
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:31,576
Here.

148
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:33,967
Watch this movie for reference.

149
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:35,851
"Free Wife 2017".

150
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:37,840
"I want to play tonight, roughly"...

151
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:39,145
That's right.

152
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:42,406
Okay. I'll use it as a reference.

153
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,183
Don't work out too much until we shoot,

154
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:49,983
and maintain your weight. Okay?

155
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:51,239
Yes, sir.

156
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,025
The male lead will be here soon.

157
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:54,606
Your hair looks like his too.

158
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:55,918
We'll go over the details together.

159
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:58,484
You don't need to worry.
You two are really similar.

160
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,396
Hey.

161
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:03,597
Hello, sir.

162
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,585
Say hello.

163
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,499
This is Lee Jungi, your body double
for the bed scene.

164
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,796
Hello. I'm Lee Jungi.

165
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,762
I'm Kim Wooseong. Nice to meet you.

166
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,733
I'm a fan.

167
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,309
Hey, you lost a lot of weight
in just a few days.

168
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:24,841
I lost some weight because I was sick.

169
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,430
I can't get it back on.

170
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:27,821
Really?

171
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,747
How much did you lose?

172
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:33,020
I weighed 71kg before,
but now I weigh about 60kg.

173
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:35,458
What? How much do you weigh?

174
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:36,716
71kg.

175
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:40,060
Seems like I'm going to have
to find a thinner actor.

176
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:42,990
Pardon?

177
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,517
That can't happen.

178
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:48,668
Sir, I'll lose the weight.

179
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:50,515
You can lose 10kg?

180
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:54,187
I'll lose that weight no matter what.

181
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:56,580
You have to lose 10kg in a week?

182
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:00,286
Do you really want to lose
that much weight for a bed scene?

183
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:01,633
Yes, because it's...

184
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:04,411
...Shin Sujeong.

185
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,203
No further explanation is needed.

186
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:10,295
You'd jump into a fire for a bed scene
with Shin Sujeong, wouldn't you?

187
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:14,266
I'd gladly fall off a cliff too.

188
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,527
Yuna, are you home?

189
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:18,865
I'm not expecting anyone.

190
00:08:21,977 --> 00:08:22,810
Smells so good.

191
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:25,517
Sanghyeon, what's all this?

192
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:31,423
I baked too many doughnuts.

193
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:33,113
So I thought I'd share them with you.

194
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,673
Thank you.

195
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,414
Yuna, who is he?

196
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:42,283
You gave her a ride home, right?

197
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:44,866
-You guys take the same class.
-That's right.

198
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:46,369
Hello. I'm Lee Sanghyeon.

199
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:48,294
-Hello.
-Hello.

200
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,420
So, you're Seol?

201
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:53,033
How adorable.

202
00:08:55,736 --> 00:09:00,210
You drive her home
and bring her doughnuts.

203
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:01,929
Are you interested in her?

204
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:03,083
A green light?

205
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:07,063
Yes, actually...

206
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,103
I'm interested in her.

207
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:18,088
That's just how I feel,

208
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,132
so don't worry about it, Yuna.

209
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:22,789
It's so hot.

210
00:09:22,877 --> 00:09:25,335
May I use your bathroom?

211
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:26,664
Of course.

212
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:27,887
It's over there.

213
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,762
Excuse me.

214
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:33,741
These are doughnuts of love.

215
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:35,999
What was that?

216
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:37,458
He likes you.

217
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:39,472
No, it's not like that.

218
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,433
He just said he was interested in you.

219
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:43,413
Go for it. He seems nice.

220
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:44,284
Dusik.

221
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,185
How can you tell that he's nice?
You've just met him.

222
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:48,020
He has a weird look in his eyes.

223
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,700
-Yuna, be careful of him.
-Why?

224
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:53,289
Who are you to tell her that?

225
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:56,398
I'm just worried about her.

226
00:09:56,503 --> 00:10:00,422
If he turns out to be a weird guy,
it'll ruin her life.

227
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,693
Shut up. Stop talking nonsense.

228
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:05,712
-Have a doughnut.
-No, I don't want it.

229
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:10,152
-I said I don't want it!
-Don't yell at me.

230
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,213
Don't waste a doughnut!

231
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:13,179
-Geez.
-Geez. Why didn't you just take it?

232
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,322
"Han Seojin, Bong Dusik, Han Yuna"

233
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:26,226
"Han Yuna"

234
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,604
What are you doing?

235
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,139
Why are you brushing your teeth
with Yuna's toothbrush?

236
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:44,398
I've got cotton mouth.

237
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:46,790
Then you should've asked us
for a new toothbrush.

238
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:49,682
-Why are you using Yuna's toothbrush?
-What?

239
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,537
Oh, was this Yuna's?

240
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:55,267
I had no idea.

241
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,722
How can you not know?

242
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,546
It says 'Han Yuna' right there.

243
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,796
Her name was written on it?

244
00:11:04,678 --> 00:11:05,926
Oh, geez.

245
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:11,003
I really didn't know.

246
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:12,288
Excuse me.

247
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,004
You can read it so clearly.

248
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,347
What's wrong with that guy?

249
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:24,642
I had fun today.

250
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:26,575
I'll get going, Yuna.

251
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:29,275
-Bye.
-Get home safely.

252
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:31,185
-Bye.
-Visit us again.

253
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,492
Get home safely.

254
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:35,100
Yuna, Yuna.

255
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:37,435
Sit down.

256
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:38,559
Yuna.

257
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:40,700
He's a great catch.

258
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:43,294
Yeah, he has good manners
and he seems nice.

259
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:45,271
Nice?

260
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:48,107
Something's off about him.

261
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,009
What are you talking about?

262
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:52,619
When I went to the bathroom,

263
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:54,919
I saw him brushing his teeth
with Yuna's toothbrush.

264
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,835
What? With my toothbrush?

265
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,229
His mouth must've felt dirty.

266
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,102
Even so, you don't brush your teeth
with someone else's toothbrush.

267
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,221
Why not?

268
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,898
I sometimes use yours.

269
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:04,981
What?

270
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,415
-Why?
-Yours is soft.

271
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:11,030
Mine is too hard, so it hurts.
It makes my gums bleed.

272
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:12,498
That's disgusting.

273
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:14,771
Anyway, I have a bad feeling about him.

274
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,998
There's something strange.

275
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,832
You're the strange one.

276
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:18,725
Why?

277
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:21,708
Are you jealous
because he's close with Yuna?

278
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:23,016
Totally.

279
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:25,044
You got her a map this morning.

280
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,408
Do you like Yuna?

281
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:32,151
What?

282
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:33,785
-Me?
-Yeah.

283
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:35,104
And Yuna?

284
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,539
Forget it. I can't even talk to you.

285
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,092
Geez. So what?

286
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:42,808
Worrying about someone means liking them?

287
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,375
It just means I'm a kind person.

288
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:45,667
Stop that.

289
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:47,300
Since this morning, he's been...

290
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:48,887
What's wrong?

291
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:51,436
I'm starving
because I talked too much today.

292
00:12:51,524 --> 00:12:53,907
But you can't lose 10kg
just by starving yourself.

293
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:57,102
But I don't know how to lose weight.

294
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,547
Ask Seojin to help.

295
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:00,546
She diets 365 days a year.

296
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:01,622
Yeah?

297
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,664
Seojin, help me lose weight.

298
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:05,867
For nothing?

299
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:08,455
You're a slave to capitalism.

300
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,191
All right. I'll buy you the new razor.

301
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,306
It removes the roots of the hair.

302
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,613
Okay.

303
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:19,298
But you have to do exactly as I tell you.

304
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:25,221
I have to watch this.

305
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:28,975
They're going to make fun of me
if they catch me watching it.

306
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:41,287
Why are you so jumpy?

307
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:43,699
No, I didn't jump.

308
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:45,524
Knock before you come in.

309
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,772
This is my room. Why would I knock?

310
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:48,766
Why?

311
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:50,963
Were you watching porn?

312
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:53,145
Of course not.

313
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,250
That's ridiculous.

314
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:57,035
Yeah, you never watch that kind of stuff.

315
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:58,537
You're the purest guy I know.

316
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:00,330
Dusik.

317
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,742
Huh? What?

318
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,435
That Sanghyeon guy didn't seem
strange to you?

319
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:10,249
He has a perverted look
in his eyes, right?

320
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:13,686
I didn't get that vibe.

321
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:15,088
You didn't?

322
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:17,601
Strange...

323
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,420
Is this lock broken?

324
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,504
Yeah, it's been broken for a while.

325
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:22,895
-Why?
-Nothing.

326
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,982
I didn't know you were in here.

327
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,276
I told you to knock!

328
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:37,710
Sorry, I didn't know you were in here.

329
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,813
What are you doing in here
with your laptop?

330
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:43,724
I'm writing a scenario.

331
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:46,196
-I write well in the bathroom.
-Yeah?

332
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:48,740
Keep going. I'll just wash my hands.

333
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:49,689
Okay.

334
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,893
Dusik.

335
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:54,765
What?

336
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:58,029
He didn't even put toothpaste on it.

337
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,634
You can't brush without toothpaste.

338
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:03,035
-It's not a big deal.
-Really?

339
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:05,437
But who does that?

340
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:07,660
Is this lock broken too?

341
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:09,720
Yeah, it's been broken for a while too.

342
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,020
-Why?
-And the guest room on the second floor?

343
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:13,434
It's broken too. All the locks
are broken in this house.

344
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:14,980
Then fix them!

345
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:16,185
Why don't you fix them
if you know they're broken?

346
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:17,884
Why?
Darn it.

347
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:21,287
We're co-owners.

348
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:23,022
How annoying.

349
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,666
Without toothpaste... Did I see it wrong?

350
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:31,051
Wrapping my body will help me lose weight?

351
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:34,188
Wear these. All of them.

352
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:35,710
I'm going to shoot the bed scene.

353
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,414
Where are you going?

354
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,188
Jumping jacks. Go.

355
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:43,158
Shin Sujeong!

356
00:15:43,285 --> 00:15:44,156
Bed scene!

357
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:47,673
You'd jump into a fire for a bed scene
with Shin Sujeong, wouldn't you?

358
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:51,455
I'd gladly fall off a cliff too.

359
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:52,646
Get up!

360
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:53,788
Shin Sujeong.

361
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:55,038
Bed scene.

362
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:56,775
Shin Sujeong.

363
00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:58,190
Bed scene.

364
00:15:58,649 --> 00:15:59,666
Shin Sujeong.

365
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,026
Bed scene.

366
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:03,145
Bed scene!

367
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:04,764
Shin Sujeong!

368
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,476
Where's Dusik?

369
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,531
He has a meeting with the director.

370
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:16,776
He's busy with writing his scenario.

371
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:21,947
Jungi, are you okay?

372
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,073
Jungi.

373
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:27,885
A white tunnel...

374
00:16:28,423 --> 00:16:30,296
-Jeez...
-What's wrong?

375
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:31,553
Are you all right?

376
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:34,887
I must have blacked out for a moment.

377
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:37,683
I know that you have to lose weight,
but you have to eat.

378
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:39,306
You'll die if you keep going like this.

379
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:41,394
No, I'm fine...

380
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,354
I'll drink water.

381
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:48,367
You can't even drink water from now on.

382
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,221
Your shoot is in two days.

383
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:54,184
This is too much.

384
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:56,593
If you don't want to shoot a bed scene
with Shin Sujeong...

385
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:58,673
...you can drink it.

386
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:10,390
I'm going to shoot...

387
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:12,621
...that bed scene.

388
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,833
Yuna, it's me.

389
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:17,855
That sounds like Sanghyeon.

390
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,009
Why is he here?

391
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:27,716
Sanghyeon, why are you here?

392
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:30,238
There a really good pizza place
in my neighborhood.

393
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:32,050
So, I brought you one.

394
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:34,531
Oh, I'm sorry.

395
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,357
We just ate.

396
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:37,528
Nonsense.

397
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,520
I can eat pizza even when I'm full.

398
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,206
Thank you.

399
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:44,630
You're eating like a pig.

400
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:58,351
Don't even think about it.

401
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:01,038
You're so cold-hearted.

402
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:04,150
You won't even bleed if I stab you.

403
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:07,243
This pizza is so good.

404
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:08,687
Is it?

405
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:11,234
Sanghyeon, have one.

406
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:13,109
It's okay. I already ate.

407
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:14,302
You can have mine too.

408
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:15,861
Thanks.

409
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:24,588
Excuse me.

410
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,408
-Yes?
-What are you doing?

411
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,049
What?

412
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:32,975
What's wrong?

413
00:18:33,064 --> 00:18:35,780
He smelled Yuna's hair.

414
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:38,479
Me?

415
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:40,039
I didn't.

416
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,248
I was smelling the pizza.

417
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:44,968
I saw you. Stop lying.

418
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:47,388
You must be mistaken.

419
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:49,944
Why would he smell my hair?

420
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:51,484
Exactly!

421
00:18:51,624 --> 00:18:54,400
What's wrong with smelling hair?

422
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:56,884
I sometimes smell your hair.

423
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:59,490
M-My hair? Why?

424
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:03,909
Your hair smells delicious.

425
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:06,807
-What are you doing?
-I want to eat jjajangmyeon.

426
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,289
Stop it!

427
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:11,924
I really saw him smell her hair!

428
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:14,288
-You're being rude.
-I really saw it.

429
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:16,988
I did! This is driving me crazy!

430
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:18,147
Come on.

431
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:20,136
I'm sorry, Sanghyeon.

432
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,616
I apologize.

433
00:19:21,705 --> 00:19:22,710
It's fine.

434
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:25,478
-It's my fault for misleading him.
-What?

435
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:28,472
Can I look around the guest house
while you eat pizza?

436
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:29,394
Sure.

437
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:31,904
Yuna.

438
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:34,650
Excuse me. On your lips...

439
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:38,700
Thank you.

440
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:39,829
Oh, it's a mole.

441
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:41,917
Is it that way?

442
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:43,883
Yes, take your time.

443
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,864
Why did you put that in your pocket?

444
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,955
Why is he taking that with him?

445
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,892
-Donggu, what's with you?
-He put the napkin in his pocket!

446
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,461
Donggu, calm down.

447
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,220
This is driving me crazy!

448
00:19:57,816 --> 00:19:59,401
He put the napkin in his...!

449
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,605
You're not qualified to have this!

450
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:03,469
You have to shoot the bed scene!

451
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,069
Be quiet.

452
00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:12,044
Yuna's scent.

453
00:20:31,966 --> 00:20:34,943
I think he really likes you.

454
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:37,340
-What do you think about him?
-It's not like that.

455
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:39,049
You should go out with him.

456
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,010
He's good-looking and gentle.

457
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,199
Plus, he has a nice car, right?

458
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:43,341
That means he's competent...

459
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:45,371
Stop it!

460
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,454
What's wrong with you?!

461
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,065
I fed you pizza because you like pizza.

462
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:54,720
Where is that guy?
What's taking him so long?

463
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:56,808
Jesus.

464
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,304
Yuna...

465
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:08,081
Her warmth...

466
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:09,853
Yuna...

467
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:12,055
Yuna...

468
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:25,160
What are you doing here?

469
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:27,817
What?
I... Actually...

470
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:30,956
Why are you wearing Yuna's clothes?

471
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:32,802
What's going on?

472
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:36,131
Sanghyeon!

473
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:38,144
Why are you wearing my clothes?

474
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:41,185
This is a misunderstanding.

475
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:44,012
It's no misunderstanding.
I caught you in the act.

476
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:46,270
Sanghyeon, what's going on?

477
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,497
Well...
The thing is...

478
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:50,542
The thing is...
I...

479
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:55,548
I was trying to figure out your size.

480
00:21:56,246 --> 00:21:58,594
I wanted to buy you a coat.

481
00:21:58,728 --> 00:22:00,639
Yours is too worn out.

482
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:04,606
What?

483
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:07,960
Just ask her what her size is.

484
00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:11,715
And there's a size tag.
You didn't have to put it on.

485
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,385
I was worried if I ask her directly,

486
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:18,007
it might hurt her pride,
so I couldn't ask.

487
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:22,394
And the size tag must have fallen off.

488
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:24,880
That's why I put it on.
All right?

489
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:27,614
My gosh...

490
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,153
We misunderstood.

491
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:31,058
Seojin, you believe that?

492
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:33,635
A man trying on a woman's coat is weird.

493
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:35,064
It's not.

494
00:22:35,547 --> 00:22:38,713
-I sometimes wear Seojin's clothes.
-Why? Why?

495
00:22:38,802 --> 00:22:42,381
When I make fritters,
my clothes get covered in oil.

496
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,793
So I sometimes wear hers.

497
00:22:43,882 --> 00:22:46,031
What? Are you crazy?

498
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,120
Anyway, I'm sorry.

499
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:53,439
I must've made you feel uncomfortable.

500
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,575
I was just trying to do a good thing...

501
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,677
I'll get going.

502
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,052
He smelled it!

503
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,488
-Sanghyeon.
-He smelled it!

504
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:12,324
What's wrong with you?

505
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:16,087
He smelled her coat. I'm telling you.

506
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,726
Thank you for the ride.

507
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:28,507
Did you watch the movie I gave you?

508
00:23:29,497 --> 00:23:31,917
"The Free Wife"? Yes, a little bit.

509
00:23:32,492 --> 00:23:35,370
-The wife seemed very free.
-It's good, isn't it?

510
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:38,324
Watch this.

511
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,463
This is a masterpiece.

512
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:43,946
Oh, okay.

513
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:47,258
-Drive safely.
-Bye.

514
00:23:50,206 --> 00:23:52,556
Why does he keep giving me these movies?
I can't watch it in the house.

515
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,391
What is it this time?

516
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:56,040
"Sweet Whip".

517
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:57,559
"I can't forget that thrill".

518
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,738
This one is even lewder.

519
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:01,473
No one can see me with this.

520
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:05,094
Sanghyeon, don't leave like this.

521
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:07,646
-I apologize.
-No, Yuna.

522
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,257
I can't stand him accusing me of things.

523
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:12,039
Donggu, apologize to him.

524
00:24:12,128 --> 00:24:13,994
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why do I have to apologize?

525
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:15,518
He's leaving because of you.

526
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:16,888
Are you serious?

527
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:28,533
Hold it!

528
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:29,921
What is that?

529
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,808
Aren't these woman's panties?

530
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,304
They're not.

531
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:34,327
These are...

532
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:37,702
-...mine.
-What?

533
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,538
These are yours?

534
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:43,161
These lacy hot red panties?

535
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,671
Yes,

536
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,613
I love this design.

537
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:51,484
It comforts me.

538
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:54,108
You are shameless.

539
00:24:54,197 --> 00:24:57,919
No one carries around
woman's panties in their pockets.

540
00:24:58,007 --> 00:24:59,785
Some people do.

541
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,752
Sometimes when I feel down...

542
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,934
Shut up!

543
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:04,047
Go away!

544
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,640
Tell us the truth.

545
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:09,759
Are these really yours?

546
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:11,097
I already told you.

547
00:25:11,257 --> 00:25:13,211
I have more of these in different colors.

548
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:15,414
Would you like to go and check?

549
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,683
-You...
-Wait.

550
00:25:18,446 --> 00:25:19,860
I think they're mine.

551
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,234
-Yeah, these are mine!
-What?

552
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:26,155
Really?

553
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:29,858
What? Jesus. No way.

554
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:35,190
Those sexy hot red lacy panties
are not Yuna's?

555
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,358
Oh my god. Are you insane?

556
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:37,803
Darn it!

557
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:39,750
Why are you so disappointed?

558
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,685
You said it's yours!

559
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:42,808
That darn man...

560
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:46,012
Get out of the way! You pervert!

561
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:47,993
A pervert?

562
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:50,049
That's too harsh.

563
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,951
I'm offended. I can't stay here.

564
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,104
Can't believe they're not Yuna's...

565
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:56,250
You devil!

566
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:57,489
You can't leave!

567
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:06,365
What's that?

568
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:12,156
"I can't forget that thrill".

569
00:26:12,245 --> 00:26:14,306
"Sweet Whip"?

570
00:26:14,936 --> 00:26:17,525
He really is a pervert.

571
00:26:17,614 --> 00:26:18,722
I'm not a pervert.

572
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,567
That's not mine.

573
00:26:20,656 --> 00:26:21,718
If it's not yours,

574
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:22,748
then who's is it?

575
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,696
It's really not mine. Believe me.

576
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,419
Shut up!

577
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:30,123
Donggu, call the police.

578
00:26:30,212 --> 00:26:31,726
-Yeah, let's call them.
-Police...?

579
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:33,056
Wait, wait.

580
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,087
All right.

581
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,067
I'll tell you the truth.

582
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,163
I stole those panties.

583
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,032
I admit that.

584
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:45,076
But the CD is not mine. Believe me.

585
00:26:45,164 --> 00:26:48,240
Then who's is it?

586
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,693
Tell them.

587
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:58,483
I saw it falling out of your jacket.

588
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:03,605
What?

589
00:27:03,694 --> 00:27:05,179
You're saying it's Dusik's?

590
00:27:05,618 --> 00:27:08,236
He's the purest guy I know.

591
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:13,665
He's pure like a piece of white paper.
He's never even held a woman's hand.

592
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:15,721
Tell... Tell them!

593
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:19,030
-I saw it falling out of your jacket!
-Shut up!

594
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,738
Do I look like someone
who'd watch this garbage?

595
00:27:20,826 --> 00:27:22,219
How dare you!

596
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,750
-But it fell...
-Shut up! Shut up!

597
00:27:24,838 --> 00:27:26,603
You're dead! Pervert!

598
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:29,059
-Come outside!
-It's not mine! No!

599
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,949
-You're a dead meat.
-Hey!

600
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,819
That's it! Let's go!

601
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:37,518
This scene would be much better
if you do it.

602
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,358
I told you already.

603
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:44,643
I promised my parents
to never shoot bed scenes!

604
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,565
I mentioned it just in case.

605
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,143
Sir, I'm here.

606
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:00,712
You lost so much weight.

607
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:02,803
How much did you lose?

608
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:04,454
-Hen kilograms...
-What?

609
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:06,648
Ten kilograms.

610
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:08,568
10kg?

611
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,109
That must been tough. Well done.

612
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:13,745
No, it wasn't tough at all.

613
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:20,492
Oh, anemia...

614
00:28:21,746 --> 00:28:22,701
Be careful.

615
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,618
Jungi, you're fine. You're almost there.

616
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:27,539
Jungi, you can do this.

617
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,419
H-Hello.

618
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:43,774
I'll be shooting today's scene with you.

619
00:28:43,863 --> 00:28:45,491
My name is Lee Jungi.

620
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:48,994
It's an honor to meet you.

621
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:50,762
Hello.

622
00:28:51,744 --> 00:28:53,486
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet...

623
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:54,433
What the...

624
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:57,404
Who are you?

625
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,379
Sir...

626
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:03,808
Who is this woman?

627
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:06,279
She's Sujeong's body double.

628
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:07,975
A body double?

629
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:11,460
Shin Sujeong is not shooting this scene?

630
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,379
You thought you were doing a bed scene
with Shin Sujeong?

631
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:20,358
Shin Sujeong!

632
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:25,030
Bed scene!

633
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:28,850
Jungi, what's wrong?

634
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,382
Excuse me, sir.

635
00:29:33,983 --> 00:29:35,927
Shin Sujeong just called.

636
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:39,338
She thinks using a body double
is like lying to the audience.

637
00:29:39,427 --> 00:29:41,894
So, she wants to shoot
the bed scene herself.

638
00:29:42,871 --> 00:29:43,712
Really?

639
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:45,784
That'd be great.

640
00:29:46,622 --> 00:29:47,688
-Jungi.
-Yes.

641
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:49,370
You are going to shoot
the bed scene with Sujeong after all.

642
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:50,745
-Get ready.
-Yes.

643
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:53,726
-I'll get ready.
-Wait a second, sir!

644
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:55,297
What?

645
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:57,568
I'll do the bed scene.

646
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:07,095
Why did you change your mind?

647
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,950
No reason.
I just suddenly changed my mind.

648
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:11,412
Why now?

649
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,136
Get him out of here.

650
00:30:14,225 --> 00:30:15,123
Hurry up.

651
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:19,461
It's because Shin Sujeong is doing
the bed scene herself, isn't it?

652
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:21,407
I know what you're doing, you jerk!

653
00:30:21,495 --> 00:30:23,495
Do you know what I've been through?!

654
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:27,725
I told you that guy was weird.

655
00:30:27,814 --> 00:30:29,369
The panties thing was disturbing,

656
00:30:29,457 --> 00:30:31,647
but I was shocked
when he said the CD was yours.

657
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:32,677
Right?

658
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:35,540
Yeah, totally.

659
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:37,575
Sorry for not believing you.

660
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:39,864
I thought you were being jealous
because you like Yuna.

661
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:42,965
Me liking Yuna is ridiculous.

662
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:44,669
Me jealous?

663
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,961
Geez.

664
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,760
That's ridiculous.

665
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,041
Isn't that Jungi?

666
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,611
What happened to the shooting?

667
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,588
I don't know. Has he lost it?

668
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:57,354
Hey!

669
00:30:57,443 --> 00:30:58,336
Jungi!

670
00:30:58,538 --> 00:31:00,025
-Jungi!
-What's the matter with him?

671
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:01,516
Excuse me.

672
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:06,010
I'm in the same baking class with Yuna.

673
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:07,632
Is she home?

674
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:10,143
She is. Why are you asking?

675
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:11,870
I wanted to ask her out.

676
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:16,574
You want to ask her out?

677
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,329
Do you know this?

678
00:31:20,418 --> 00:31:21,596
What?

679
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:23,684
Yuna is actually...

680
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,020
Jerk.

681
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:33,124
He changed his mind when he heard
Sujeong will be doing the bed scene.

682
00:31:33,481 --> 00:31:35,460
I went through hell to lose that weight.

683
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:41,450
You're back from your baking class?

684
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:44,222
-Yeah.
-What's that look on your face?

685
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,839
There's a strange rumor going on
around the baking school.

686
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:50,606
They're saying I'm addicted
to plastic surgery.

687
00:31:50,695 --> 00:31:51,535
What?

688
00:31:51,624 --> 00:31:52,820
Addicted to plastic surgery?

689
00:31:52,898 --> 00:31:53,745
yes.

690
00:31:53,822 --> 00:31:57,515
On top of that, that I have a lot of debt
and I steal stuff...

691
00:31:57,604 --> 00:31:59,909
Not only that, they're saying
that I'm a man.

692
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:01,383
That I used to be in the Marines.

693
00:32:01,573 --> 00:32:04,107
That I can snap a barbed-wire fence
with my teeth.

694
00:32:04,954 --> 00:32:05,824
Really?

695
00:32:06,143 --> 00:32:08,374
What crazy person started that rumor?

696
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,428
I don't know.

697
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:12,731
They asked me seriously.

698
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:15,300
They believed it?

699
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:17,854
What?

700
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:20,294
Why are you looking at me like that?

701
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,211
Fine, I started that rumor.

702
00:32:27,998 --> 00:32:30,014
I did it for your mother.

703
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:34,419
I didn't want her to meet another pervert.

704
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:37,896
I'm telling you the truth.

705
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:39,855
Don't get the wrong idea, okay?

706
00:32:48,203 --> 00:32:50,201
We don't have any booking this week.

707
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:52,750
Why aren't there any guests these days?

708
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:54,539
Maybe because it's too cold.

709
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,599
We're going to go under at this rate.

710
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:57,906
Tell me about it.

711
00:32:57,995 --> 00:33:00,872
The landlady called me
about the overdue rent yesterday.

712
00:33:01,136 --> 00:33:02,940
She even sent us the lease
content proof the other day.

713
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:04,517
Guys, it's fine.

714
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:06,306
-Hi.
-Hi.

715
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:09,828
Ma'am.

716
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:12,108
-Why are you here?
-What do you mean?

717
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:13,262
I'm here to collect the overdue rent.

718
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,726
The rent?

719
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:19,998
-Our business isn't doing so well...
-So, you don't have it, right?

720
00:33:20,774 --> 00:33:21,896
You can begin.

721
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:23,287
Start what?

722
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,226
-Who are you?
-Can I help?

723
00:33:25,314 --> 00:33:26,714
What is that?

724
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:29,138
I saw this in a movie.

725
00:33:29,227 --> 00:33:30,283
What the hell?

726
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:32,613
-Seized!
-Seized?

727
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:34,739
-You can't take this.
-Don't do this.

728
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:36,093
Are we out of business, Seojin?

729
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:37,342
What is happening?

730
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:39,834
When is Donggu coming home?
Seojin...

731
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,543
Please, don't so that.

732
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:48,366
I'm home.

733
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,743
What are these red things?

734
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:54,282
-Ma'am.
-Hello, Mr. Kang.

735
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:56,751
Who is this baby?

736
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:01,546
Oh, she's...

737
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,408
She's Donggu's baby.

738
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,847
He got someone pregnant.

739
00:34:09,962 --> 00:34:11,513
He got someone pregnant?

740
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:13,139
Then...

741
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,634
-He's the baby's father?
-Yes.

742
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:19,741
We don't have much money
but we now have a baby.

743
00:34:19,837 --> 00:34:23,667
We have to buy so many things for the baby
like formula and diapers.

744
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:28,673
The truth is, we did save up money
to pay rent.

745
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:32,918
But we used it all up for the baby.

746
00:34:33,661 --> 00:34:35,601
Oh dear, I see.

747
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:40,466
What about the mother?

748
00:34:41,502 --> 00:34:42,577
The mother?

749
00:34:43,743 --> 00:34:45,249
She...

750
00:34:47,077 --> 00:34:48,265
She abandoned them.

751
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,289
She said she couldn't
live like this anymore.

752
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:58,211
How can a mother do that?

753
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:01,218
That's right.

754
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:03,276
We'll leave if you want us to.

755
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:05,987
But if we get thrown out
into the street in this cold weather...

756
00:35:06,617 --> 00:35:09,807
We'll be fine but what will we do
about the baby?

757
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:11,566
Poor baby...

758
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,580
That's none of our business.

759
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:18,967
We'll force them out by the law.

760
00:35:19,056 --> 00:35:20,224
Mr. Kim, stop it.

761
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:23,313
I'll give you one more month.

762
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,031
I'm giving you one last chance
because of the baby.

763
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:28,321
-Make sure you pay it in time.
-Really?

764
00:35:28,607 --> 00:35:29,894
Thank you.

765
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:31,491
Thank you!

766
00:35:31,747 --> 00:35:33,470
It's fine. Just raise her well.

767
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,433
-Yes.
-Let's go.

768
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:40,216
Gosh, poor baby.

769
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:46,267
-Bye.
-Thank you.

770
00:35:46,356 --> 00:35:48,346
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

771
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:51,451
We almost got evicted.

772
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,940
But you can't lie about
something like that.

773
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,189
What was I supposed to do?

774
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,544
Can't you see the red stickers?

775
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:59,684
If I hadn't lied, we'd have been evicted.

776
00:35:59,772 --> 00:36:01,582
What if she finds out that you lied?

777
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,735
She won't find out.

778
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:04,991
It's not like she's going to look up
his certificate of family relations.

779
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,704
What do we do...

780
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,357
But what are we going
to do about next month?

781
00:36:12,122 --> 00:36:13,471
We'll work something out.

782
00:36:13,677 --> 00:36:15,807
It's okay. It's okay.

783
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,145
"Real Estate"

784
00:36:18,234 --> 00:36:19,119
Sua.

785
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,488
-Dusik.
-Long time no see.

786
00:36:22,736 --> 00:36:24,816
-How are you?
-Yeah.

787
00:36:24,913 --> 00:36:25,842
I'm doing okay.

788
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:27,330
How's Donggu doing?

789
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:29,956
He's doing okay.

790
00:36:30,045 --> 00:36:31,606
Why were you in the real estate office?

791
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:32,914
I'm selling my house.

792
00:36:33,003 --> 00:36:36,864
Yunseok is opening a few restaurants in
the US and he asked me to come with him.

793
00:36:36,952 --> 00:36:38,295
How long will you be there?

794
00:36:38,383 --> 00:36:39,852
One or two years?

795
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:42,604
Or we could settle there.

796
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:46,146
I have to pack. Bye.

797
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:47,438
Take care.

798
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,806
Bye.

799
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,012
I think she's going to marry that guy.

800
00:36:54,101 --> 00:36:55,013
Yeah.

801
00:36:55,216 --> 00:36:57,787
Donggu is going to moan in pain again
if he finds out about this.

802
00:36:57,876 --> 00:36:59,687
We won't tell him.

803
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,815
He's over her already,
so there's no need to tell him.

804
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,264
Isn't that the landlady's car?

805
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:07,434
I think so.

806
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:10,528
Why is she heading toward our guesthouse?

807
00:37:11,472 --> 00:37:13,398
I'm getting a bad feeling.

808
00:37:14,952 --> 00:37:16,192
I'm home.

809
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:17,604
Hey, Yuna.

810
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,804
-Did you get the wisdom teeth out?
-Yeah.

811
00:37:21,664 --> 00:37:22,497
Hey...

812
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,603
What's all this?

813
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,408
Something happened.

814
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:30,415
I'll tell you later.

815
00:37:31,852 --> 00:37:32,790
Does it hurt a lot?

816
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:34,041
No.

817
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,725
-I wish it'd stop bleeding.
-That's what happens.

818
00:37:40,896 --> 00:37:43,744
-It'll keep bleeding for today.
-Yeah?

819
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:47,822
I'm going to put in a new cotton ball.

820
00:37:48,286 --> 00:37:50,183
Where are the cotton balls?

821
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,040
Where's the baby?

822
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:56,641
Hello, would you like a room?

823
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,942
I'm not a guest.

824
00:37:59,806 --> 00:38:02,245
-Who are you?
-Me?

825
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,314
I'm Han Yuna.

826
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:06,537
What is it, Seol?

827
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:08,976
Are you hungry?
Mommy will give you some milk.

828
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:10,354
Mommy?

829
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:12,457
You're her mother?

830
00:38:13,102 --> 00:38:15,156
When did you come back?

831
00:38:15,245 --> 00:38:16,095
Pardon?

832
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:19,689
-I just came back from the hospital.
-The hospital?

833
00:38:20,737 --> 00:38:21,814
Why were you at the hospital?

834
00:38:21,902 --> 00:38:24,610
-A few days ago, my...
-Wait!

835
00:38:24,698 --> 00:38:26,537
Wait! Wait!

836
00:38:27,454 --> 00:38:28,634
You scared me.

837
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:31,195
Why are you yelling?

838
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:32,412
I'm sorry.

839
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:35,223
Why are you back here?

840
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:38,253
I was worried about the baby.

841
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:39,753
I bought some diapers.

842
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:42,129
Why is it so noisy? Ma'am!

843
00:38:42,217 --> 00:38:43,219
Mr. Kang.

844
00:38:43,366 --> 00:38:45,309
When did you find the baby's mother?

845
00:38:45,398 --> 00:38:47,398
Oh, actually...

846
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:51,101
-Well...
-And why was she at the hospital?

847
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:53,948
The hospital? Well, actually...

848
00:38:54,037 --> 00:38:56,232
She collapsed and the hospital called us.

849
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,702
And we brought her home.

850
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,126
-That's what happened.
-She collapsed?

851
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,579
Are you ill?

852
00:39:01,668 --> 00:39:03,891
What? I was just...

853
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:06,244
Blood.

854
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:09,714
It's bleeding again.

855
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,045
Seojin. Hurry.

856
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:17,453
-Take Yuna to your room, so she can rest.
-Okay.

857
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,290
-Hurry up.
-Let's go to my room.

858
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:21,173
-Why? I'm fine.
-Just go.

859
00:39:21,252 --> 00:39:23,252
- Go on with her.
- You need to rest, Yuna.

860
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:24,495
Get some rest.

861
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:27,765
What...

862
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,090
What's making her cough up blood?

863
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:32,954
It's um...

864
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,924
We have to do something.

865
00:39:35,012 --> 00:39:36,754
-We have to take her to the hospital.
-No!

866
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:38,609
-Why not?!
-Because...

867
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:42,847
We brought her home because
there was nothing else they could do.

868
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:47,263
Then she's terminally ill?

869
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,186
Huh?

870
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:51,051
Yes.

871
00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:53,507
Is it...late stage?

872
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:55,824
Yes.

873
00:39:57,422 --> 00:40:00,398
But she's so young...

874
00:40:02,508 --> 00:40:04,835
It must be tough for you, Mr. Kang.

875
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:05,850
Me?

876
00:40:06,923 --> 00:40:09,290
-Yes.
-Treat her well.

877
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:12,043
Make her last memories good ones.

878
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:16,854
Did you guys have a wedding?

879
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:18,049
A wedding?

880
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:19,984
-Actually...
-Right.

881
00:40:20,605 --> 00:40:23,120
You weren't in a situation
to have a wedding.

882
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,391
I feel so bad for the baby's mom.

883
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:31,028
She never got the chance
to wear a wedding dress.

884
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:39,992
Cheer up, Mr. Kang.

885
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:41,739
Yes,

886
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:43,417
thank you.

887
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,881
I'll take my leave.

888
00:40:53,815 --> 00:40:56,204
Thanks for the diapers. Bye.

889
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,578
Bye.

890
00:41:01,552 --> 00:41:02,911
We almost got caught!

891
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,789
You shouldn't have lied!

892
00:41:04,877 --> 00:41:07,672
-That was close!
-She bought it.

893
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,364
It'll be fine.

894
00:41:09,452 --> 00:41:11,047
-Don't worry.
-What if she catches us?

895
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,556
Diapers.

896
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:14,468
You're taking the diapers?

897
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,240
Geez. He's unbelievable.

898
00:41:18,564 --> 00:41:20,360
This is insane.

899
00:41:21,476 --> 00:41:23,019
What do you think?

900
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:25,171
What's this?

901
00:41:25,893 --> 00:41:28,939
I want to give you a wedding.

902
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:30,153
-What?
-What?

903
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,434
-A wedding?
-A wedding?

904
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:34,292
Don't worry. I'll pay for it.

905
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:36,709
No, we're fine. Really.

906
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:39,330
You know nothing about women.

907
00:41:39,577 --> 00:41:43,335
If she never gets to wear a wedding dress,
she'll regret it forever.

908
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:47,135
I don't need to wear a wedding dress.

909
00:41:47,223 --> 00:41:49,510
I want to do it for you.

910
00:41:50,649 --> 00:41:53,724
Actually, when my husband
and I got married,

911
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:56,043
we were too poor to have a wedding.

912
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:58,583
I never got to wear a dress.

913
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,360
I see.

914
00:42:01,448 --> 00:42:04,388
That's why I know exactly how you feel.

915
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:08,125
So, don't worry and have a wedding.

916
00:42:08,722 --> 00:42:11,662
No, it's really not necessary.

917
00:42:12,187 --> 00:42:14,332
You're refusing my offer?

918
00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:16,400
Fine, don't have the wedding.

919
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:18,153
Then I want you to move out.

920
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:19,203
What?

921
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:21,880
-What do you mean...
-Decide.

922
00:42:21,968 --> 00:42:24,475
Do you want to move out
or have a wedding?

923
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:30,651
We'll do it.

924
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:33,117
We'll have the wedding.

925
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,386
That's more like it.

926
00:42:35,926 --> 00:42:38,923
The sooner the better, right?

927
00:42:39,492 --> 00:42:40,722
What about Sunday?

928
00:42:41,443 --> 00:42:43,038
This... This Sunday?

929
00:42:44,655 --> 00:42:47,849
She might die any day.

930
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:53,804
Oh, okay.

931
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:54,988
What?

932
00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:56,906
You're having a wedding?

933
00:42:56,995 --> 00:42:58,282
Yes.

934
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,122
This is happening
because of your stupid lie.

935
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,800
I didn't know this would happen.

936
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:06,317
This is wrong. This is fraud.

937
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:09,050
I'm going to tell her the truth right now.

938
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:10,301
Hey! Stop.

939
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,664
Are you crazy?

940
00:43:11,752 --> 00:43:13,241
Don't you know that she has a temper?

941
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,828
If she finds out that we lied,

942
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:17,424
Not only will we get evicted,
but we'll get sued too!

943
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,109
What are we supposed to do then?!

944
00:43:22,586 --> 00:43:23,712
Donggu,

945
00:43:24,145 --> 00:43:25,196
I'm sorry but...

946
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:28,851
Can't you just have the wedding?

947
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,675
-Jungi!
-Are you insane?!

948
00:43:31,597 --> 00:43:33,351
We have no choice.

949
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,580
We can't live on the street
in this cold weather.

950
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:43,517
Yuna.

951
00:43:45,101 --> 00:43:46,203
Just have a wedding.

952
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,414
Shut up! Shut up!

953
00:43:51,178 --> 00:43:53,538
We don't need rings. Seriously.

954
00:43:53,627 --> 00:43:56,058
I want to buy them for you.

955
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:57,331
Choose one.

956
00:44:01,064 --> 00:44:02,140
Donggu.

957
00:44:04,443 --> 00:44:05,329
Sangpil.

958
00:44:08,267 --> 00:44:10,117
Long time no see.

959
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:13,217
-How have you been?
-I'm doing okay.

960
00:44:14,536 --> 00:44:15,688
Who is she?

961
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:18,109
She's...

962
00:44:18,277 --> 00:44:19,278
Your girlfriend?

963
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,793
She's my...

964
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:24,009
Excuse me. What about these ones?

965
00:44:24,098 --> 00:44:26,176
This is a popular design
among bride and groom-to-be.

966
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:28,466
Bride and groom?

967
00:44:28,764 --> 00:44:31,081
Donggu, are you getting married?

968
00:44:31,464 --> 00:44:33,771
Oh, actually...

969
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,029
Yeah, I'm getting married.

970
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:42,411
Why didn't you tell me? When is it?

971
00:44:42,964 --> 00:44:44,482
It's um...

972
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:48,575
This Sunday.

973
00:44:48,663 --> 00:44:51,559
You should have called me.

974
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:53,556
Don't worry, man.

975
00:44:53,644 --> 00:44:56,313
I'll call up everyone
from college, professors.

976
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:59,225
I'll bring everyone to your wedding.

977
00:44:59,443 --> 00:45:01,604
Congratulations, Donggu.

978
00:45:01,893 --> 00:45:04,772
Yeah, thanks... Thanks...

979
00:45:05,898 --> 00:45:08,712
I'm so grateful that I want to cry.

980
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:11,797
This is insane.

981
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,945
Why did I have to run into Sangpil?

982
00:45:15,077 --> 00:45:16,886
-Sangpil...
-Sergeant Kang?

983
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:19,944
Corporal Kim.

984
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:21,474
Salute!

985
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:23,625
How have you been?

986
00:45:23,714 --> 00:45:25,124
I'm doing okay.

987
00:45:25,213 --> 00:45:28,006
-Long time no see.
-Mr. Kang, what do you think of this one?

988
00:45:28,094 --> 00:45:31,395
You have to wear a tuxedo at your wedding.

989
00:45:31,974 --> 00:45:33,330
Your wedding?

990
00:45:33,912 --> 00:45:35,399
Are you getting married?

991
00:45:36,964 --> 00:45:38,219
Well...

992
00:45:41,687 --> 00:45:43,873
-Yeah, I'm getting married.
-What? When?

993
00:45:43,961 --> 00:45:46,046
-This Sunday.
-This Sunday?

994
00:45:46,134 --> 00:45:49,162
You should've called me.
I feel a little hurt.

995
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,204
Don't be.

996
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:53,143
He had a reason.

997
00:45:53,231 --> 00:45:54,453
A reason?

998
00:45:55,357 --> 00:45:56,220
What reason?

999
00:45:59,395 --> 00:46:00,228
What?

1000
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,403
That's terrible...

1001
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:05,217
Cheer up.

1002
00:46:05,312 --> 00:46:07,145
Yeah, thanks.

1003
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:09,850
You're doing a good thing.

1004
00:46:09,948 --> 00:46:11,330
You're very kind.

1005
00:46:11,556 --> 00:46:13,737
Not at all.

1006
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:17,120
I just want them to be happy.

1007
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:22,070
I'll call everyone from our platoon.

1008
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,915
No, that's not necessary.

1009
00:46:25,705 --> 00:46:27,614
We have to work through
hard times together.

1010
00:46:27,703 --> 00:46:29,185
That's comradeship.

1011
00:46:29,274 --> 00:46:30,114
Right?

1012
00:46:30,203 --> 00:46:31,245
Yes.

1013
00:46:33,896 --> 00:46:34,825
Yeah,

1014
00:46:35,296 --> 00:46:36,165
thanks.

1015
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:39,096
I feel the comradeship, you jerk.

1016
00:46:42,998 --> 00:46:44,913
This is insane.

1017
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,614
We can't get married.

1018
00:46:53,904 --> 00:46:54,779
You're smiling?

1019
00:46:54,886 --> 00:46:56,113
How can you be smiling right now?

1020
00:46:56,637 --> 00:46:58,769
It's just hard to believe.

1021
00:46:58,968 --> 00:46:59,817
What is?

1022
00:47:00,326 --> 00:47:02,818
I imagined my wedding when I was young.

1023
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:06,746
Where I would have it
and what kind dress I'd wear.

1024
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,399
And the bouquet too.

1025
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:11,335
I gave up on it after I had Seol.

1026
00:47:11,424 --> 00:47:14,165
But somehow I got a chance
to have a wedding.

1027
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,838
We walked around all day. I'm tired.

1028
00:47:20,926 --> 00:47:22,512
I don't know.

1029
00:47:22,637 --> 00:47:25,768
It was so hectic today
that I couldn't even tell if I'm tired.

1030
00:47:26,546 --> 00:47:28,579
I wish this was a dream.

1031
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:33,523
Yuna, should we tell the truth...

1032
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,193
What?

1033
00:47:35,577 --> 00:47:36,765
She fell asleep?

1034
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:42,022
She has no worries.

1035
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:43,977
Oh my.

1036
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,064
Geez.

1037
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:18,729
Geez.

1038
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:23,921
She's such a nuisance.

1039
00:48:29,922 --> 00:48:31,308
We're home.

1040
00:48:31,685 --> 00:48:34,878
Gosh, the groom is here.

1041
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,783
It was a joke.

1042
00:48:38,968 --> 00:48:42,132
-I was just trying to make you laugh.
-Shut up.

1043
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,394
Do you know what I went through today?

1044
00:48:44,483 --> 00:48:47,710
Something huge is happening
because of your lie.

1045
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,772
Wait!

1046
00:48:48,902 --> 00:48:49,770
What's this?

1047
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:51,174
Isn't this the landlady?

1048
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:52,115
Why? What is it?

1049
00:48:52,203 --> 00:48:53,809
An article about the landlady is online.

1050
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,566
An article? What article?

1051
00:48:56,302 --> 00:48:58,739
"Ms. Kim's good deed is
melting this cold winter."

1052
00:48:58,828 --> 00:49:01,433
"Kang Donggu and Han Yuna
are running a failing guest house,"

1053
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,058
"and they've been struggling
to pay the rent."

1054
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:05,112
"Ms. Kim decided to give them a wedding."

1055
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,525
Who wrote this?

1056
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,326
Who wrote this article?

1057
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,672
Reporter Kim Taeyong?

1058
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,624
Kim Taeyong?

1059
00:49:11,712 --> 00:49:13,029
I'm a journalist.

1060
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:16,649
Corporal Kim? Why did he write this crap?

1061
00:49:16,776 --> 00:49:18,531
There are more important things
to write about.

1062
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,190
Hello, this is Waikiki.

1063
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:21,400
Hello.

1064
00:49:21,488 --> 00:49:24,558
-Hi, I'm Wheesung, the singer.
-What?

1065
00:49:24,973 --> 00:49:26,739
-Wheesung, the singer?
-Wheesung?

1066
00:49:26,827 --> 00:49:29,382
-You called the wrong number.
-I'm really Wheesung.

1067
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:30,367
I'm serious.

1068
00:49:30,628 --> 00:49:31,529
That's his voice.

1069
00:49:31,618 --> 00:49:32,993
Why did you call here?

1070
00:49:33,374 --> 00:49:35,205
You read the article?

1071
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:41,211
What? You want to sing at the wedding?

1072
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:45,703
Wheesung, one moment.
There's another call coming in.

1073
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:47,391
Hello, this is Waikiki.

1074
00:49:48,104 --> 00:49:50,514
-Hanbok designer Park Sulnyeo?
-What?

1075
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,348
You want to make them hanbok?

1076
00:49:53,437 --> 00:49:55,974
It's getting out of hand.

1077
00:49:56,062 --> 00:49:57,561
If we get caught,

1078
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,734
we have to leave Korea.

1079
00:50:00,052 --> 00:50:01,564
People will beat us to death.

1080
00:50:01,653 --> 00:50:03,862
Who? Chef Lee Yeonbok?

1081
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:14,278
"We do not accept monetary gifts
at this wedding"

1082
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:20,809
Donggu!

1083
00:50:20,897 --> 00:50:22,585
-Hey.
-Congratulations.

1084
00:50:22,674 --> 00:50:23,544
Thanks.

1085
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:26,123
-You brought everyone.
-Yeah, I brought everyone.

1086
00:50:26,663 --> 00:50:27,496
Thanks.

1087
00:50:29,007 --> 00:50:30,976
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

1088
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:36,858
Let's congratulate him.

1089
00:50:36,946 --> 00:50:39,059
Salute our comrade.

1090
00:50:39,147 --> 00:50:40,508
Salute!

1091
00:50:40,668 --> 00:50:41,769
-At ease.
-Salute.

1092
00:50:41,858 --> 00:50:43,201
Sergeant Kang.

1093
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,758
Corporal Kim.

1094
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,694
I read your article.

1095
00:50:46,782 --> 00:50:48,099
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

1096
00:50:48,187 --> 00:50:50,095
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

1097
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:52,360
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1098
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:53,871
- You look good.
- So handsome.

1099
00:50:55,828 --> 00:50:57,039
- Congratulations.
- We'll be inside.

1100
00:50:57,128 --> 00:50:58,159
Thank you.

1101
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,240
Are you okay?

1102
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:05,101
Do I seem okay to you?

1103
00:51:05,415 --> 00:51:08,410
My alumni, professors,
platoon commander are here.

1104
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,274
Even the president
of the tenants' association is here.

1105
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,851
I'm officially a married man.

1106
00:51:13,939 --> 00:51:16,851
But everyone's saying
that the bride is beautiful.

1107
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,128
You haven't seen Yuna in her dress, right?

1108
00:51:19,495 --> 00:51:20,912
She looks amazing.

1109
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,413
-Really amazing.
-So what?!

1110
00:51:23,536 --> 00:51:25,189
I should be happy
because I have a beautiful wife?

1111
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,424
I'm crazy happy that I have
a beautiful wife.

1112
00:51:29,512 --> 00:51:30,955
Donggu, calm down.

1113
00:51:31,043 --> 00:51:33,099
I can't calm down! It's all your fault!

1114
00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:36,080
You're ruining my life.

1115
00:51:36,168 --> 00:51:37,261
What are you guys doing?

1116
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,498
It's time to begin.

1117
00:51:40,687 --> 00:51:41,907
Come inside.

1118
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:44,383
-Yes, we'll be there.
-Yes, we should begin.

1119
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:46,382
I'll go inside now.

1120
00:51:46,892 --> 00:51:48,305
-We'll go inside.
-See you later, Donggu.

1121
00:51:56,174 --> 00:51:58,918
All right, everyone.

1122
00:51:59,302 --> 00:52:02,039
"Groom Kang Donggu, Bride Han Yuna"
We'll begin the wedding,

1123
00:52:02,127 --> 00:52:07,791
of Kang Donggu and Han Yuna.

1124
00:52:08,408 --> 00:52:09,319
Groom,

1125
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:10,582
enter!

1126
00:52:30,138 --> 00:52:32,669
The groom looks so manly, doesn't he?

1127
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:42,473
Now, next, the star of the day.

1128
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:48,389
Please applaud for the bride Han Yuna.

1129
00:52:48,896 --> 00:52:49,739
Bride,

1130
00:52:50,306 --> 00:52:51,279
enter!

1131
00:53:31,356 --> 00:53:33,081
Salute for the bride!

1132
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,513
Salute!

1133
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:35,815
At ease!

1134
00:53:54,617 --> 00:53:55,450
Donggu.

1135
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:56,882
Donggu.

1136
00:53:57,644 --> 00:53:58,535
Kang Donggu.

1137
00:54:18,617 --> 00:54:19,593
Thank you.

1138
00:54:20,505 --> 00:54:21,317
Wheesung.

1139
00:54:21,405 --> 00:54:23,638
Congratulations on your wedding.

1140
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:26,060
I wish you a life of happiness.

1141
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:28,748
It usually costs a lot
to have me sing at your wedding,

1142
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,865
but I sang for free today.

1143
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:33,899
So, in return,

1144
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,246
I'd like to see you kiss passionately.

1145
00:54:41,206 --> 00:54:42,457
A passionate kiss.

1146
00:54:43,597 --> 00:54:44,635
Don't be shy.

1147
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:46,655
Kiss!

1148
00:54:46,743 --> 00:54:48,427
Kiss!

1149
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,159
Kiss!

1150
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:51,500
Kiss!

1151
00:54:51,979 --> 00:54:55,068
-Kiss!
-This is unbelievable...

1152
00:54:55,309 --> 00:54:56,711
Kiss!

1153
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:58,752
Kiss!

1154
00:54:59,168 --> 00:55:00,548
Kiss!

1155
00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:02,554
Kiss!

1156
00:55:02,981 --> 00:55:04,349
Kiss!

1157
00:55:04,437 --> 00:55:06,514
-Kiss!
-Donggu.

1158
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,083
-Let's just do it.
-Why?

1159
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:10,006
Let's just kiss.

1160
00:55:10,343 --> 00:55:12,302
No, we can't kiss.

1161
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:47,344
Have fun on your honeymoon.

1162
00:55:48,186 --> 00:55:52,237
Buy everything she wants with this.

1163
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,140
Okay, thank you.

1164
00:55:55,228 --> 00:55:56,653
Go on in.

1165
00:55:58,002 --> 00:55:59,222
Have a safe trip.

1166
00:56:00,143 --> 00:56:02,226
Yes, see you.

1167
00:56:02,804 --> 00:56:04,378
Shall we go, Yuna...

1168
00:56:05,172 --> 00:56:06,272
I mean, Honey?

1169
00:56:09,043 --> 00:56:10,634
Okay.

1170
00:56:10,816 --> 00:56:12,213
Honey.

1171
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:35,953
Donggu.

1172
00:56:44,843 --> 00:56:45,676
Donggu?

1173
00:56:47,588 --> 00:56:48,599
-Donggu!
-What?

1174
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:49,914
What? What is it?

1175
00:56:50,002 --> 00:56:52,441
-What are you thinking about?
-What?

1176
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:55,342
Nothing.

1177
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:01,534
How long do we have to stay here?

1178
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,473
They'll call me when the landlady leaves.

1179
00:57:05,786 --> 00:57:07,323
Let's wait for a bit longer.

1180
00:57:09,715 --> 00:57:10,627
Mr. Kang.

1181
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:14,798
-Mr. Kim?
-Why are you here?

1182
00:57:15,709 --> 00:57:18,274
-Oh, you're going on your honeymoon?
-Huh?

1183
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:20,342
-Oh, yes.
-Right.

1184
00:57:20,431 --> 00:57:22,072
You're going to Jeju Island, right?

1185
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,353
I'm also going to Jeju Island on business.

1186
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:25,526
What time is your flight?

1187
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:27,195
It's...

1188
00:57:27,337 --> 00:57:29,661
...the 6:30 flight.

1189
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,718
I'm also taking that flight.

1190
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,897
We're on the same flight.

1191
00:57:33,986 --> 00:57:35,500
We're even sitting next to each other.

1192
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:36,946
That's incredible.

1193
00:57:37,035 --> 00:57:38,922
It's almost time. Let's go.

1194
00:57:41,094 --> 00:57:42,395
Donggu, what do we do?

1195
00:57:42,483 --> 00:57:45,053
I don't know. This is crazy.

1196
00:57:45,142 --> 00:57:45,975
Come on you two.

1197
00:57:54,209 --> 00:57:56,543
They must've landed by now.

1198
00:57:57,609 --> 00:58:01,077
I hope she didn't get sick in Jeju Island.

1199
00:58:02,243 --> 00:58:03,076
What is this?

1200
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:06,063
What is this slimy and disgusting thing?

1201
00:58:07,836 --> 00:58:08,785
Oh, shit.

1202
00:58:08,874 --> 00:58:11,697
What dog took a dump here?

1203
00:58:11,786 --> 00:58:12,945
Oh, shit.

1204
00:58:16,417 --> 00:58:18,135
It feels empty without them.

1205
00:58:18,743 --> 00:58:19,647
Totally.

1206
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:22,679
Donggu and Yuna must have landed.
Shouldn't we pick them up?

1207
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:23,926
Why should we?

1208
00:58:24,015 --> 00:58:26,136
It wasn't even a real honeymoon.

1209
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:29,209
It's funny how they ran into
Mr. Kim at the airport.

1210
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,394
Totally.

1211
00:58:30,743 --> 00:58:34,148
What if they really fall in love?

1212
00:58:34,237 --> 00:58:35,221
No way.

1213
00:58:35,702 --> 00:58:38,504
-Thank god the landlady didn't catch us.
-Yeah.

1214
00:58:38,592 --> 00:58:43,541
I can't believe that she believed
that they were a married couple.

1215
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:47,886
-What are you talking about?
-Oh my god!

1216
00:58:48,615 --> 00:58:52,113
-Ma'am!
-They're not married?

1217
00:58:54,268 --> 00:58:57,415
Did you lie to me?

1218
00:58:57,504 --> 00:58:58,725
No, let me explain...

1219
00:58:58,813 --> 00:59:00,870
Tell me the truth right now!

1220
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:02,521
-Ma'am?
-Ma'am?

1221
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:03,926
Ma'am.

1222
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:06,009
"Payment memorandum"

1223
00:59:06,594 --> 00:59:09,496
I'm sorry. We didn't do it on purpose...

1224
00:59:09,584 --> 00:59:12,126
Shut up and sign it.

1225
00:59:14,582 --> 00:59:15,945
What is this?

1226
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:18,410
It's a payment memorandum for the wedding,

1227
00:59:18,546 --> 00:59:20,323
and a warning that horrible
things will happen to you,

1228
00:59:20,412 --> 00:59:23,870
if you don't pay it back in a month.

1229
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:26,481
Horrible things?

1230
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:31,717
Multiply the worse thing
you can think of by 100.

1231
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:36,652
What I really want to do
is put you all in jail.

1232
00:59:39,818 --> 00:59:42,855
But I'm going easy on you
because of the baby.

1233
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:45,353
Sign it right now.

1234
00:59:45,562 --> 00:59:49,649
We can't make this much money in a month.

1235
00:59:49,737 --> 00:59:52,489
Then, you can go to prison.

1236
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:55,677
Right here?

1237
01:00:11,022 --> 01:00:12,504
What do we do now?

1238
01:00:13,514 --> 01:00:15,849
We have a debt when we don't
even have any customers.

1239
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:17,847
I don't know.

1240
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,532
It's all because of the idiot.

1241
01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:25,561
I'm going to beat him up when I get home.

1242
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:40,503
Oh my gosh!

1243
01:00:42,011 --> 01:00:44,191
He could have caused an accident!

1244
01:00:58,988 --> 01:00:59,995
Donggu?

1245
01:01:01,403 --> 01:01:02,420
Donggu!

1246
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,483
Can you hear me?

1247
01:01:07,603 --> 01:01:09,098
Can you hear me?

1248
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,462
What? What did you say?

1249
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:15,565
Did you say something?

1250
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:19,008
I said thank you.

1251
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,314
So, watch where you're going.

1252
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:28,030
You're such a nuisance.

1253
01:01:29,023 --> 01:01:30,000
Move.

1254
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,491
Why don't you just close your eyes
while you're walking?

1255
01:01:37,087 --> 01:01:38,568
Wait for me, Donggu.

1256
01:01:48,522 --> 01:01:49,450
Sua.

1257
01:01:53,245 --> 01:01:54,414
Donggu.

1258
01:02:00,446 --> 01:02:02,318
What are you doing here?

1259
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:03,815
Is something wrong?

1260
01:02:09,317 --> 01:02:12,034
What do I do...

1261
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:56,536
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1262
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:58,278
I can't stay here.

1263
01:02:58,366 --> 01:02:59,986
How long do I have to stay here?

1264
01:03:00,074 --> 01:03:01,575
Did you pay?

1265
01:03:01,663 --> 01:03:03,075
Stop!

1266
01:03:04,695 --> 01:03:07,065
I'm allowed to help out an ex-girlfriend
who's having a tough time, right?

1267
01:03:07,153 --> 01:03:07,979
Sua, here.

1268
01:03:08,067 --> 01:03:09,512
-Why are you giving me this?
-I thought it was pretty.

1269
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,790
Are you still hung up on Sua?

1270
01:03:10,878 --> 01:03:13,438
-I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
-Why would I?

1271
01:03:13,526 --> 01:03:14,549
Look after Sua.

1272
01:03:14,637 --> 01:03:16,925
Why did you draw those hearts?

1273
01:03:17,013 --> 01:03:18,403
-She was my first love.
-How did you met her?

1274
01:03:18,491 --> 01:03:20,422
As a writer and actress
of a porn movie.

1275
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:23,571
Lee Jungi, you brought this on yourself.

1276
01:03:23,704 --> 01:03:25,536
Don't blame me.

1277
01:03:25,624 --> 01:03:26,881
Yes, this is Lee Jungi
who saved your life.

1278
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,216
Speaking of which, can you lend me money?

1279
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,755
I'm going to do an eating show.
I need to pay my credit card bill.

1280
01:03:30,843 --> 01:03:32,267
Not anyone can do an eating show.

1281
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:34,158
You're going to give me 100 star-candies
if I eat the bones?

1282
01:03:34,246 --> 01:03:35,769
Prepare for a scan.

1283
01:03:35,858 --> 01:03:36,871
Is it serious?
