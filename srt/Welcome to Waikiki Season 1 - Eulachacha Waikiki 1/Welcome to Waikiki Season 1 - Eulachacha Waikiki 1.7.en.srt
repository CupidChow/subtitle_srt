1
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,376
Sua.

2
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,080
Donggu.

3
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:15,082
What...

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,369
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:19,653
Is something wrong?

6
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:25,959
Donggu, what do I do?

7
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:36,970
"Waikiki Guesthouse & Hostel"

8
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,034
What do we do now?

9
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:47,748
We'll get evicted
if we don't pay the landlady.

10
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,752
Exactly. We have nowhere to go if we
get evicted. It's driving me nuts.

11
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,221
This is all your fault.

12
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,034
What's your plan?

13
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:58,425
I didn't know things would go this way.

14
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,434
How do we make that
much money in a month?

15
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,530
This is nuts.

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,433
Shouldn't you be worried
about something else?

17
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,936
-What do you mean?
-Donggu will be here soon.

18
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:12,806
You made him have the fake wedding
and now we have a huge debt.

19
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,908
He's going to kill you.

20
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,511
May you rest in peace.

21
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,912
Rest in peace.

22
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:24,168
-Dusik, give me Seol.
-Why?

23
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,886
He can't hit me when I'm holding her.

24
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:27,566
-Give her to me. Hurry.
-No way.

25
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,989
I'm home.

26
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,894
Donggu...

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,295
Calm down.

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,800
Listen to me first.

29
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,498
Don't say a word.

30
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:39,800
Not one word.

31
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:46,006
What are you doing? Come on in.

32
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,374
Is someone here?

33
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,580
Sua.

34
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:16,837
Don't think about anything
and get some rest. Okay?

35
00:02:17,022 --> 00:02:20,707
Donggu, I don't feel comfortable
staying here.

36
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,249
I have a conscience.

37
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,399
I can't stay here.

38
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,981
-I'll just leave.
-Min Sua.

39
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:30,884
You said you have nowhere to go.
You can't leave at this hour.

40
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,386
You can leave in the morning.

41
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,187
Don't make me worry.

42
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,090
Get some rest.

43
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:51,605
What?

44
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,441
That guy Sua was dating was a swindler?

45
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,712
He took the deposit for her place
and the tuition fee her parents gave her?

46
00:02:58,812 --> 00:02:59,613
Yes.

47
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,016
Sua isn't the only one who got conned.

48
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,219
She got totally scammed.

49
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:08,021
Poor Sua.

50
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,334
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,825
She got punished for dumping Donggu.

52
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,627
That's harsh.

53
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:17,015
She got conned because she
left you for a rich guy.

54
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,001
How could she agree to stay here?

55
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,100
Doesn't she have a conscience?

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,803
-She has nowhere to go.
-She can go to her parents' house.

57
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:24,504
Sua's father is ill.

58
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:27,918
She was crying because he'll collapse
if he finds out she got scammed.

59
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:31,011
-So, make her feel at home. Okay?
-Goodness.

60
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:32,813
I bet you feel super sad for her.

61
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,402
Now that you see her again, does it
make you want to get back with her?

62
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:38,218
That's ridiculous.

63
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,500
It's not like that!

64
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,056
You don't need to yell.

65
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:45,325
I'm sorry to interrupt, but...

66
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:48,929
This Hallabong is staring at me.
Can I have it?

67
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,298
You have no right to eat this.

68
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,002
What are you going to do about the money?

69
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,201
What's your plan?

70
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,001
You take care of this no matter what.

71
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,305
Otherwise, I'll kick you out. Got it?

72
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,273
|I'll do my best.

73
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:01,400
What's wrong with your voice?

74
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,176
Do you know what we went through
to get this Hallabong?

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,278
It's fine. Can I have one?

76
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,001
Donggu, did you sleep well?

77
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,483
No.

78
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:14,988
I couldn't sleep because these stickers
kept appearing in my dream.

79
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,090
I see.

80
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,402
One moment.
I'll make some breakfast for you.

81
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,195
No, I'm fine.
I'll just have a glass of milk.

82
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:25,799
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

83
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:26,900
That hurts.

84
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,403
My lips are chapped from the cold wind.

85
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,001
What are you doing?

86
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:49,289
-The milk is overflowing.
-What? Jeez...!

87
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:52,175
What are you thinking about?
Why are you so out of it?

88
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:54,694
No, it's nothing.

89
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,068
This is crazy.

90
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,398
Why do I keep thinking about that?

91
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:01,568
I baked some pies.
Would you like to try some?

92
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,304
So, that delicious smell was the pies.

93
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,101
Wow, this looks delicious.

94
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,610
-They look so good.
-Looks delicious.

95
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:14,162
Jungi, have you found a way
to make some money?

96
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:18,067
Wow, these pies look perfect.

97
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,487
They look pretty and so do you.

98
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:32,999
Don't throw food!

99
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,594
Yuna, are there walnuts in it?

100
00:05:36,682 --> 00:05:38,972
-Yes. Why?
-Darn it!

101
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,174
Soap! Soap!

102
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,176
No, disinfectant!

103
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,779
Don't waste food.

104
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,367
What's wrong with him?

105
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,182
He has walnut allergy.

106
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,480
A rash breaks out over his
whole body when he eats walnuts.

107
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,250
Plus, he gets a chill, fever and diarrhea.

108
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,388
It takes him a week to recover.

109
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,190
I see.

110
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:58,600
No way.

111
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,494
He just needed an excuse to leave
to avoid talking about the debt.

112
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,865
Sua. Did you sleep well?

113
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,967
Why do you have your luggage?

114
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,169
I'm going to go now.

115
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:12,072
-Do you have somewhere to go?
-Don't worry.

116
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,242
I can probably get rent money
if I sell these.

117
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,245
I posted them on a secondhand website
and I already got some buyers.

118
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:19,346
Okay.

119
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,449
-Have some breakfast before you go.
-No, I'm fine.

120
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,351
I have a conscience.

121
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,753
I can't stay here anymore.

122
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,756
I'll get going. Take care, Donggu.

123
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:32,835
Take care, everyone.

124
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,129
Okay. Bye.

125
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:39,032
Those are all luxury brands.

126
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,634
Thank goodness you guys broke up.

127
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,136
If you guys had gotten married,
she would've used up our family's money.

128
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,537
That's enough.

129
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,742
I think I bought one of those.

130
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:51,511
This fool.

131
00:06:57,511 --> 00:07:00,320
It's almost time. Where is she?

132
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:07,827
Excuse me. Are you 'Bag Shuttle'?

133
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:11,131
Are you the buyer 'Usain Bolt'?

134
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:13,133
-Hello.
-Hello.

135
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,735
-Can I look at the bags?
-Sure.

136
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,640
I took care of these really well.

137
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,443
It really looks new.

138
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,513
-Can I try it on?
-Sure.

139
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:29,340
-Have a look at this too.
-It's so luxurious.

140
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,217
Look at this color.

141
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:35,021
I like them all.

142
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,024
I'll buy all of them.

143
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:39,926
-How much are they?
-Really?

144
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,328
One moment.

145
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,132
My shoe lace is undone.

146
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,236
-Excuse me, can you run fast?
-Sorry?

147
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,557
I can't run very fast. Why?

148
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,743
I was actually a sprinter
in the Seoul city team.

149
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,935
I see.

150
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:02,248
Fast start is the most important.

151
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,450
Watch carefully.

152
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,355
First, assume the starting position.

153
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,957
Now, say "Bang".

154
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,058
-"Bang".
-What?

155
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,761
Make a gun with three fingers
and say 'Bang.'

156
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,663
-Point it up to the sky.
-Point it up?

157
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,532
-Up! Bang!
-Bang!

158
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:24,738
She's really fast.

159
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,540
She really is a sprinter.

160
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:31,044
Usain Bolt! Where are you going?

161
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:33,046
Excuse me! Here! Over here!

162
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,348
Darn it!

163
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,866
Hey! Stop!

164
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,184
Thief!

165
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:50,663
Usain Bolt! This bad wench!

166
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,574
It's freezing.

167
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,370
It's so cold,
why does he want to see me so early?

168
00:08:57,794 --> 00:08:59,372
Is Director Tak here yet?

169
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,675
Sorry. Are you okay?

170
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:04,677
Yes, I'm fine.

171
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,179
Excuse me.

172
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:08,982
Aren't you Bong Dusik?

173
00:09:09,185 --> 00:09:09,982
What?

174
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,085
That's me, but who are you?

175
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:14,954
It's me, Malgeum. Don't you remember me?

176
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:16,756
Malgeum?

177
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:20,860
Yun Malgeum from Yujin Elementary School?

178
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:22,328
It's been ages.

179
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:23,830
Tell me about it.

180
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,934
You haven't changed a bit.
You're still pretty.

181
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:30,537
Yes? You look good too.

182
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:32,238
No, I'm not...

183
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,340
Let's have coffee. I'll bring them.

184
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,142
-Get us a table.
-Okay.

185
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,851
Mr. Bong.

186
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,153
-You're here early.
-Hi.

187
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,289
-Why did you want to see me?
-Yes.

188
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,157
I found the female lead for our movie.

189
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,259
-I'll introduce her to you.
-What?

190
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:55,562
-You found someone already?
-Yes.

191
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,563
Her name is Cherry.

192
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:00,366
She's a rising star. You'll like her.

193
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,684
-Cherry?
-Oh my.

194
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,070
She's already here.

195
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:05,171
Cherry!

196
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,372
-Hello, Mr. Tak.
-Hi.

197
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:09,275
Mr. Bong, say hello.

198
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,877
This is Cherry that I told you about.

199
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:25,091
Then, I'll get going first.

200
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,593
See you next time.

201
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,296
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

202
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,172
I like your scenario.

203
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,075
I remember that you liked to
write when you were young.

204
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:44,277
-You really became a writer.
-What?

205
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,578
Yes.

206
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,982
You were mature when you were young
and now you're a porn...

207
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,418
Never mind.

208
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,508
I'll get going.

209
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,890
Which way are you going?

210
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,893
-I'm going this way.
-I'm that way.

211
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,661
Bye, Cherry...

212
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:03,296
I mean, Malgeum.

213
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,566
Okay, bye.

214
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:07,667
Bye.

215
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:23,329
It's been a while.

216
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:25,318
I wanted to know how you were doing.

217
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,755
Remember when I saved your life
when you fell in the lake?

218
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,858
Yes, this is Lee Jungi
who saved your life.

219
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,060
Speaking of which, can you lend me money?

220
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,068
I actually...

221
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,362
Hello?

222
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,664
Hello?

223
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,166
You're the worst friend ever.
How can you do that to your savior?

224
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,868
Forget it!

225
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:43,970
Hey.

226
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:56,917
Is it your school album?

227
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:00,853
"Yun Malgeum"?

228
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,156
Why did you draw those hearts?

229
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,892
-She was my first love.
-Your first love?

230
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,394
She's pretty.

231
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,591
Why are you looking at her photo
all of a sudden?

232
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:12,532
I ran into her today.

233
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,533
You did?

234
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:15,584
Where?

235
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:18,871
As a writer and actress
of a porn movie.

236
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:20,399
Is she still pretty?

237
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,675
What is she up to these days?

238
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,479
She's the female lead
of my porn scenario.

239
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,880
Are you crying?

240
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,783
Was it that great to see
your first love again?

241
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:34,354
-Jungi.
-What?

242
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,058
You must've liked her a lot, huh?

243
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,060
What an innocent guy.

244
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,528
A piece of white paper.

245
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:52,027
It's freezing.

246
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:55,441
I have no money or anywhere to go.

247
00:12:56,936 --> 00:13:00,413
I feel guilty to go back to Donggu.

248
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:01,614
What do I do?

249
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,020
Usain Bolt, that mean wench!

250
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:12,925
Sua.

251
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:16,696
-What are you doing here?
-What?

252
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,799
I was just passing by.

253
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,771
So, this is your guesthouse.
I had no idea.

254
00:13:24,883 --> 00:13:28,708
What are you talking about? You came
here every day until a few months ago.

255
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:31,077
Well...

256
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,615
I have night blindness,
so I can't see anything at night.

257
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:36,792
Night blindness?

258
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:38,818
-I didn't know you had night blindness.
-What?

259
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,286
Well...

260
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:44,023
I got it after we broke up.
I must have caught it from someone.

261
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,993
Jeez... Min Sua.

262
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,495
You're here because you have
nowhere to go, right?

263
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:55,168
No, I'm just taking my time
to find the perfect place.

264
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:59,372
Okay. You can sleep here tonight
and look for a place tomorrow.

265
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,575
No, I have a conscience.

266
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,377
I can't trouble you anymore.

267
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,279
You said that you have night blindness.

268
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:08,481
That you can't see anything at night.

269
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:12,518
I'll stay just one more night
because I don't want to worry you.

270
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,969
Sua, go upstairs and rest.

271
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:34,140
Darn this night blindness...

272
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,112
Gosh, this night blindness!

273
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:41,614
What a load of crap.

274
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,416
Look how healthy her stomp sounds.

275
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:46,686
She was going on and on
about her conscience and she's back?

276
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,508
Looks like she hasn't found
a place to live.

277
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:51,195
-That's why I brought her.
-As if!

278
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:53,712
You brought her here because
you're still hung up on her.

279
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:55,495
No! No!

280
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,699
-You can't say that here!
-Where else should I say it then?

281
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:01,713
In the kitchen? The bathroom?

282
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,030
-At the bowling alley?
-Shut up!

283
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:05,638
Did you get the money?

284
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,009
-It's so sweet.
-I thought so.

285
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,726
You can't eat anything
until you get that money.

286
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,149
Yuna, from tomorrow onwards,
don't give him any food.

287
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:16,935
What?

288
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:18,831
Fine!

289
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:21,554
You are so cheap and nasty. I won't eat!

290
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,135
I'm going to get that money
and throw it in your face.

291
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:26,659
Just wait and see!

292
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:29,429
I'm scared... I'm sure you can get
that money...

293
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,365
I'm so scared! I might wet my pants!

294
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,168
Hello?

295
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,471
What time is the birthday
party this weekend?

296
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:41,274
2 o'clock?

297
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:42,575
Okay.

298
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,848
Could I possibly...get paid in advance?

299
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,216
Yes.

300
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:54,120
If I can get two years'
wages in advance...

301
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,216
Hello?

302
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:56,956
Hello?

303
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,563
Two years' wages was a bit too much.

304
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:06,933
Gee...

305
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,806
Why is she sleeping here?

306
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:11,437
She'll catch a cold without a blanket.

307
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,439
Wait.

308
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,843
Why am I worrying about her?

309
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,914
Why am I so concerned about her?

310
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,253
Just look at that.

311
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:29,121
Sure.

312
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,758
It's out of pity.

313
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:36,128
This is like helping out the unprivileged.

314
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,800
I must be going crazy.

315
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,029
It stinks.

316
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:44,270
What did she eat?

317
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,974
-Donggu.
-What? Why?

318
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:49,976
Why are you so startled?

319
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:52,044
It's nothing.

320
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,357
You're leaving now?

321
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,049
I should go. I have a conscience.

322
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:58,651
-You found a place to stay?
-Yes.

323
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,887
I called a friend and
she said I can come now.

324
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,991
Donggu, I won't trouble you ever again.

325
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,692
Take care.

326
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:09,095
Alright. Take care.

327
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:10,263
Sure.

328
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,839
What's wrong with her today?

329
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,441
Does she have a hole in her stomach?

330
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:23,543
It stinks!

331
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,844
What did she eat?

332
00:17:24,953 --> 00:17:26,913
Jeez, my goodness!

333
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,015
Oh, okay.

334
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,918
Thanks for introducing us.

335
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:38,858
Do I have to do this?

336
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:42,328
This is crazy.

337
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,235
This is crazy.

338
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:52,138
Why did Malgeum have to be
the female lead of my movie?

339
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:55,041
How can I face her after this?

340
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,647
I wonder if Sua got there safely.

341
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,350
-Can't she give me a call?
-Donggu.

342
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,852
You're worried about Sua,

343
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:09,355
but you're not worried about me
when I'm writhing in agony?

344
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,656
No, not at all.

345
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,558
Did you get the money?

346
00:18:12,663 --> 00:18:15,061
I will... I will!

347
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,462
You expect me to believe that?

348
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,365
I'd rather believe a street dog.

349
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,234
W-What? A street dog?!

350
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,638
Do you know what I've
decided to get the money?

351
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,341
-What have you decided?
-It's none of your business!

352
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,342
All right.

353
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,626
If I get the money,
what are you going to do?

354
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,914
If you get that money, I'll...

355
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:39,185
I'll call you Father.

356
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:43,089
The Father thing
and you'll crawl between my legs.

357
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,390
Deal?

358
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:46,492
Back off if you're scared.

359
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,994
I'm not scared.

360
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:51,464
I'll do anything if you get that money.

361
00:18:51,658 --> 00:18:55,368
Kang Donggu, you better not
back down on this promise.

362
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:58,871
I'm going to get that money.

363
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:00,973
No matter what.

364
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,952
Malgeum, are you sitting in
for this audition?

365
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:17,556
Yes, Mr. Tak insisted that I come.

366
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:22,061
The female lead needs to choose
the male lead she'll be working with.

367
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:24,263
Let's begin.

368
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,370
Hello.

369
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:33,059
I'm the Erotic Terminator.

370
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:37,443
My name is Deokchul. Wang Deokchul.

371
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,348
Great body. Mr. Bong, what do you think?

372
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,450
Don't you think he and Cherry
will look great together?

373
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,251
What?

374
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,552
Wait.

375
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:50,951
This means Malgeum has to shoot
bed scenes with the guy we pick today.

376
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,159
With my precious first love?

377
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,361
-I asked what you think about him.
-What?

378
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,363
Oh, right. Well...

379
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,170
He's great but he's slightly bow-legged.

380
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,973
Bowed legs can't convey
my intended message.

381
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,210
What's your intended message?

382
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,813
Standing up tall and straight
for yourself.

383
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:17,316
-Our movie has that kind of message?
-Yes.

384
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,491
It's all great, but his eyes are too
intense, it doesn't suit my message.

385
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:26,992
Next.

386
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,494
Care for a glass of milk?

387
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:33,699
It's all great, but his collar bones
are too prominent for the role.

388
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,106
Mr. Bong, you're more
particular than I thought.

389
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:44,210
There's no one that feels right.

390
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:48,914
Hello.

391
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,317
I'm a newbie in the porn business.

392
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,820
I'm Lee Jungi.

393
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:56,922
Jungi!

394
00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:58,924
Dusik...

395
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:16,308
So, you've been writing a
scenario for a porn movie?

396
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,212
You wrote those lewd lines?

397
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,583
You said it was about the love
between family members.

398
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,386
-It is about that.
-No, it's not...

399
00:21:29,064 --> 00:21:30,189
Oh, 'Goodbye, Sister-in-law'...

400
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,590
It is about family.

401
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:35,094
-Why are you here?
-I...

402
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:37,496
I'm here to earn money.

403
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,399
Donggu's been breathing down my neck.

404
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,468
I decided to do anything
to get that money,

405
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:45,771
so that I can throw it in his face.

406
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,774
Let's keep this a secret.

407
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:50,176
That's what I want too.

408
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:53,679
Let's take it to our graves.

409
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:58,350
Alright. Good job, guys.

410
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,252
Let's decide.

411
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,453
In my opinion,

412
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,657
this Lee Jungi guy was the best one.

413
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:06,058
-What do you think?
-What?

414
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,259
Jungi?

415
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:09,361
I liked him too.

416
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:10,663
His acting was the best.

417
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:14,166
And he has that decadent look in his eyes.

418
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,669
He was born to be a porn star.

419
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,219
-What do you think?
-Sorry?

420
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,939
-Actually...
-If everyone agrees,

421
00:22:20,054 --> 00:22:21,941
let's go with Lee Jungi.

422
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,442
We have to start shooting soon.

423
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,410
Okay?

424
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,644
Okay.

425
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,047
-No, excuse...
-My dear.

426
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:32,651
Jungi is the male lead?

427
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,233
Jungi is going to shoot
bed scenes with Malgeum?

428
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,932
No! This can never happen.

429
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:39,024
It can't happen! No!

430
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,260
Jungi!

431
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:46,866
-Jungi, what are you doing?
-Can't you see?

432
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,771
I'm working out.

433
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,870
The director told me to get into shape.

434
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:53,739
So, he called you already?

435
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,243
-Are you really doing that movie?
-Of course!

436
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,912
I'm going to shoot that
movie and get paid!

437
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,415
Then I'll watch Donggu
crawl between my legs.

438
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:08,387
What if your parents see the movie?

439
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,723
My parents? It's fine.

440
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:12,324
They like porn.

441
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:13,726
They're very open-minded.

442
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,797
What if your future wife watches it?

443
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,532
My wife? It's fine.

444
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,234
I'm going to meet a woman who likes porn.

445
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:25,838
What if your children watch it?

446
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,868
My children? It's fine.

447
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:31,343
We'll watch it together.
Early sex education is important.

448
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,947
Besides, making porn movies isn't a crime.

449
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:37,850
It's a form of art!

450
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,929
It is, but...

451
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:41,153
Just wait and see.

452
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:44,859
Now that I've started this...

453
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:48,460
...I will do a bed scene that
will go down in porn history.

454
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,967
This can't be happening...

455
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,536
Stop it!

456
00:23:57,655 --> 00:23:59,060
Stop working out!

457
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,172
Stop!

458
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:13,218
I've been eating eggs for days
and now my mouth tastes like rotten eggs.

459
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,724
How long do I have to stay here?

460
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:24,063
"Donggu"

461
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,601
Miss.

462
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,904
How many days have you been here?

463
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:34,206
-Did you pay the extra charges?
-Sorry?

464
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:36,108
No, not yet.

465
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,304
I was going to pay when I leave.

466
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,913
Can you pay now?

467
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:45,232
You think I can't pay for it?

468
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,819
I'll pay right now.

469
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,560
My purse!

470
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:58,931
-I swear my purse was in here!
-Gosh.

471
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,633
It's fine. Things like this happen.

472
00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:03,635
I'm just going to make a call.

473
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:05,938
Hello?

474
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,472
Police?

475
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,741
Wait!

476
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:16,749
She hasn't answered her phone in days.

477
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,951
What if something happened to her?

478
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,253
Stop worrying about her.

479
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:23,155
Tell me the truth.

480
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,757
You're still hung up on her, aren't you?

481
00:25:25,077 --> 00:25:27,092
You still like her, don't you?

482
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,596
No! I don't!

483
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,866
-You can't say that here!
-Where should I say it then?

484
00:25:33,994 --> 00:25:35,772
Or should I shout it to
the moon on the rooftop?

485
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:37,770
Forget it! Jeez...

486
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:40,272
Anyway, it's not like that!

487
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,276
It's time for dinner already.

488
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:45,978
I should get started on it.

489
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:52,084
I told you it's not like that!

490
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:53,905
That's ridiculous.

491
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,387
Don't shout at me.

492
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,290
You keep on speaking nonsense.

493
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,698
Do you need any help?

494
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,901
No, I can do it.

495
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,702
Yuna...

496
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,605
You don't think that, do you?

497
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,595
Think what?

498
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,542
I mean, me and Sua.

499
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:20,913
People help out the underprivileged
and strangers in Africa.

500
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:24,116
I'm allowed to help out an ex-girlfriend
who's having a tough time, right?

501
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,217
Sure.

502
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:28,120
So, what I'm saying is...

503
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:32,314
I don't have any feelings left for Sua
or want to get back with her.

504
00:26:32,502 --> 00:26:34,993
Not at all.

505
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:37,129
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

506
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,331
Why would I?

507
00:26:39,402 --> 00:26:41,100
Look after her.

508
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,971
Okay. I will.

509
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,373
I'm going to the supermarket.
Do you want something?

510
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:49,888
I don't want anything.

511
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:52,177
Why are you getting angry at me?

512
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,579
See you later.

513
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:02,970
I guess it's not bothering her at all.

514
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:06,291
I'm not thinking about you at all.

515
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:08,760
I just didn't want her
to get the wrong idea.

516
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:11,363
I'm not worried about her at all.

517
00:27:13,993 --> 00:27:14,867
Hello?

518
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,902
What?

519
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:18,904
The police station?

520
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,983
Donggu.

521
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:33,785
I'm sorry.

522
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:37,623
The office said he'll call my parents.

523
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,625
So I had no choice.

524
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:50,797
Get up.

525
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,171
Let's go.

526
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,676
Let go of me. I'm not going.

527
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,746
You have nowhere to go.

528
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,347
Come on.

529
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,383
I can't do this.

530
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:05,984
This is not right!

531
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,053
Why not?

532
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:11,590
I can't let you help me again
after what I've done to you.

533
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,059
You can let me help. It's fine!

534
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:17,062
You should've lived a happy life
after dumping me.

535
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:26,138
Stop making me worry. Let's go inside.

536
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,541
Look.

537
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,276
Your hands are frozen.

538
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:33,845
Come on.

539
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:57,436
What's wrong with it?

540
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,093
Lee Jungi.

541
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,597
You brought this on yourself.

542
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:02,267
You shouldn't have come to the audition.

543
00:30:02,972 --> 00:30:04,002
Please...

544
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:06,171
...don't blame me.

545
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:15,480
Good...

546
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:22,354
It's so nutty.

547
00:30:31,472 --> 00:30:33,465
What the... What is this?

548
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,666
What happened to my face?

549
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,901
What's this!

550
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,304
What is it? What's wrong?

551
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,906
Gosh, my stomach.

552
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,207
My stomach...

553
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,376
Dusik.

554
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:49,171
Oh my gosh, you got a rash on your face.

555
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:51,783
-Oh no!
-I don't know.

556
00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:53,185
We're doing a table-read today.

557
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,587
And we start shooting
in a few days.

558
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,890
-What I am going to do?
-You can't shoot the movie.

559
00:30:58,986 --> 00:31:00,892
Once you get a rash, it lasts for days.

560
00:31:00,983 --> 00:31:02,361
You get bad diarrhea too.

561
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,564
I think you should quit the movie. Right?

562
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:06,565
Dusik.

563
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,235
Can't you ask the director to postpone
the shooting date?

564
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:11,264
Are you crazy?

565
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,767
Do you know what the director hates
the most?

566
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,674
It's postponing shooting dates.

567
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:17,976
What do I do then?

568
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:20,545
Just give up.

569
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:24,349
I'll persuade him not to sue you.

570
00:31:24,435 --> 00:31:25,732
Just don't do it, okay?

571
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:28,353
Okay. Thanks, Dusik.

572
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,955
No need to thank me.

573
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:31,760
Where's the hair dryer?

574
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:35,260
Jungi. What happened to your face?

575
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,364
I woke up with a rash
on my face and whole body.

576
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,066
Did you eat something bad?

577
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,567
Did you eat walnuts?

578
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:44,277
I didn't.

579
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,051
I didn't even go near any walnuts.

580
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:47,272
Then why is this happening?

581
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:49,775
Hold on.

582
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:50,976
Jungi.

583
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,979
Did you eat a walnut on purpose
because you can't get the money?

584
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:54,780
What?

585
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,101
How could you say that to a sick person?

586
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,914
You said you'll make that money.
I knew you couldn't do it.

587
00:32:02,002 --> 00:32:04,623
Gosh, you're  useless.

588
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,125
You're a jerk.

589
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:11,029
Dusik, change of plans.

590
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:16,535
-I have to do this movie.
-What?

591
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,136
What are you talking about?

592
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:22,340
I can't stand him undermining me anymore.

593
00:32:23,047 --> 00:32:24,943
Kang Donggu...

594
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,253
I'll destroy you!

595
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:28,346
Jungi...

596
00:32:29,151 --> 00:32:29,948
Jungi...

597
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,230
Jungi, let's just go back home.

598
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,531
No!

599
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,856
I'm going to the set.

600
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:51,336
Didn't you hear
what Kang Donggu said to me?

601
00:32:51,945 --> 00:32:54,139
You can't shoot a scene
in your condition.

602
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,040
I can!

603
00:32:55,268 --> 00:32:59,244
I'm going to do it
even if it kills me.

604
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,445
Even if it kills me!

605
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,559
Jeez! Just don't do it!

606
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,850
Why are you yelling at me?

607
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:09,421
Is there a reason
I shouldn't do this movie?

608
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:10,922
Because...

609
00:33:12,143 --> 00:33:14,826
...it's my first love!

610
00:33:29,459 --> 00:33:30,642
Do you love me?

611
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:33,545
When was I your first love?

612
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,347
What are you talking about?

613
00:33:35,469 --> 00:33:39,217
I'm talking about Malgeum!
She's my first love!

614
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,211
That's right.

615
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:42,420
My parents' nickname for me was Malgeum.
How did you know that?

616
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,623
I mean Cheery!

617
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,922
Cherry is Malgeum! My first love!

618
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:46,725
What?

619
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:47,926
Malgeum...

620
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,829
That Malgeum from your school album...?

621
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:53,632
-Malgeum is Cherry?
-Yes!

622
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:58,036
So, please don't do it. Please!

623
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,138
I see.

624
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:03,174
You should've told me sooner.

625
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,044
-I'm sorry but I'm doing this movie.
-Why?

626
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:11,870
I want to see Kang Donggu crawling
between my legs or I'll die of anger!

627
00:34:11,937 --> 00:34:12,851
Jungi!

628
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,352
Fine.

629
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,756
You want to get back at Donggu, right?

630
00:34:17,863 --> 00:34:18,657
That's right.

631
00:34:18,763 --> 00:34:20,058
Then, how about this?

632
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,662
What?

633
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:26,364
Jungi enrolled in the army?

634
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:28,166
-At his age?
-Yes.

635
00:34:28,372 --> 00:34:31,047
Soldiers came and dragged him away
this morning.

636
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,339
Apparently, he used every dirty trick
to get out going to the army.

637
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,741
-What do we do?
-We have no choice.

638
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,777
Without the male lead,
we have to postpone.

639
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:41,680
This is unbelievable...

640
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,772
I wired the money for your manuscript.

641
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,953
-Check your account.
-Thank you.

642
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:55,226
She's not bothered when we even
kissed in front of everyone?

643
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:58,530
Fine! I won't think about her either.

644
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,704
Kang Donggu!

645
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:08,707
Why are you standing there so arrogantly?

646
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,617
What the hell are you doing?

647
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,695
Pay back the landlady with that money.

648
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,690
You can buy yourself some chip
with the change.

649
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,093
It's real money.

650
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,595
How did you get this much money?

651
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:31,997
That's none of your business!

652
00:35:32,886 --> 00:35:34,199
Aren't you forgetting something?

653
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,701
You have to call me Father.

654
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,204
Seriously?

655
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,007
Are you backing down on your promise?

656
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:44,109
You're The Great Kang Donggu.

657
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,710
Are you a coward?

658
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:50,815
-Give it back then.
-Father.

659
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,617
Yes, my son.

660
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,822
And I believe there's another thing.

661
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,907
You really expect me to do it?

662
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,301
Are you backing down on your promise?

663
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:09,100
You're The Great Kang Donggu.
What a coward.

664
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:13,605
I'll do it!

665
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:16,107
Fine! I'll do it!

666
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,509
Yes, my son!

667
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,211
I've been waiting for this moment.

668
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,881
Come to Daddy.

669
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,185
Thank you for the money, father.

670
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,188
Yes, son. Come to me.

671
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,892
-Good boy.
-Thanks, Father.

672
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:37,796
It's so hard to...

673
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:40,372
...raise a son!

674
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:42,267
You're an ungrateful son.

675
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,973
I am your father as of today.

676
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,681
This cheonggukjang is delicious.

677
00:36:56,778 --> 00:36:58,983
-Yuna, it's really good.
-Really?

678
00:36:59,196 --> 00:37:00,785
-Help yourself.
-Thanks.

679
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,389
Donggu, I got my appetite back
now that the red stickers are gone.

680
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:05,690
Totally.

681
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,393
I even slept well after
we paid the landlady back.

682
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:10,495
Son.

683
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,593
You know who to thank.

684
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,799
Stop bragging about it, Jungi.

685
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,203
What did you call me?

686
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:23,508
-Stop bragging about it, Father.
-Okay, okay, my son.

687
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,143
I'll tone it down.

688
00:37:26,136 --> 00:37:27,612
Why is he your son?

689
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,013
It's none of your business.

690
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,416
-Good morning.
-Did you sleep okay?

691
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:33,447
Sua, what's that?

692
00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:34,414
Do you have a cold?

693
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,122
This? It prevents sagging.

694
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,523
It's essentials for models.

695
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:40,024
Models, my ass.

696
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,926
You've never walked on a runway.

697
00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:44,229
I thought it was a bib.

698
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:48,533
My dear, Seojin,
you say the cutest things.

699
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,825
Oh my! Do you still grow a mustache?

700
00:37:53,501 --> 00:37:56,608
Remember to moisturize after you shave,
otherwise your skin will get damaged.

701
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,109
Be careful of folliculitis.

702
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,312
Gosh, cheonggukjang smell.

703
00:38:02,734 --> 00:38:04,616
Why? You don't like it?

704
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:08,520
Something lighter like eggs Benedict
is better for breakfast, isn't it?

705
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:11,723
What?

706
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,128
I'll just skip breakfast.
I'm on a diet anyway.

707
00:38:17,234 --> 00:38:18,830
Enjoy your breakfast.

708
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:22,734
Gosh, just look at her. So cheerful.

709
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:27,451
She seems so cheerful that I can't even
tell that she's a victim of a scam.

710
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:29,641
I really don't like her.

711
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:31,843
Donggu, when is she leaving?

712
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:32,944
Don't hold your breath.

713
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,648
She's staying here for a while.

714
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,878
Plus, she'll pay when she leaves
and she can stay as long as she wants.

715
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:42,353
Your brilliant brother signed a contract.

716
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:43,254
What?

717
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,857
-Are you insane?
-Why do you have to tell everyone?

718
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,769
-Sua will pay me back.
-You're such pushover.

719
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,471
How much longer are you going
to let her push you around?

720
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:51,663
Pushover?

721
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:52,886
That's enough.

722
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:56,234
Sua is a bit spoiled
but she's a nice person.

723
00:38:56,341 --> 00:38:57,936
Nice?

724
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:01,339
Son, why do you keep taking Sua's side?

725
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:04,843
I won't have her as my daughter-in-law!

726
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,145
What the hell are you talking about?

727
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,147
I don't have any feelings for her.

728
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,031
Yuna, like I said before,
there's nothing going on.

729
00:39:12,134 --> 00:39:14,118
I don't have any feelings for Sua.

730
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,423
-What?
-So, what are you doing?

731
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,992
Why are you explaining yourself to Yuna?

732
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,895
Do you like her?

733
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,798
Are you dating both of them?
I won't allow it!

734
00:39:26,919 --> 00:39:28,499
No, I don't.

735
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,003
You are being ridiculous!

736
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,521
-What the hell!
-I was enjoying my breakfast.

737
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,506
-You deserve a beating!
-What?

738
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,509
Son! Son!

739
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:42,213
How dare he leave the table
when his father is still eating!

740
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,215
Goodness!

741
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:47,218
Why do I keep worrying
about what Yuna thinks?

742
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:48,753
I must be going crazy.

743
00:39:49,229 --> 00:39:50,631
I'm going crazy.

744
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:02,300
Son, didn't I tell you that you'll turn
into a pig when you read lying down.

745
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,601
Stop it.

746
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:09,040
Father, stop nagging or
I'll run away from home.

747
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:11,409
-How long are you going to keep this up?
-I don't know.

748
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:13,511
Until my anger toward you goes away.

749
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:15,914
Which is a far future.

750
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:20,585
Sit up when I'm talking to you.

751
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,392
Dusik, you didn't forget
about our date today, right?

752
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:28,693
See you later.

753
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,796
Who is it from? Why are you smiling?

754
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:35,300
-It's from Malgeum.
-Malgeum?

755
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,703
Ah, Cherry?

756
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:41,472
What?

757
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:44,275
Who's Malgeum and who's Cherry?

758
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,868
She's a friend of mine
from elementary school.

759
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:49,301
She was born in the US.

760
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,692
Her English name is Cherry
and her Korean name is Malgeum.

761
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:52,601
Malgeum.

762
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,385
It's a girl?

763
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,193
Looks like it's going well
between you two?

764
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,588
Exchanging texts and stuff?

765
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,757
There's nothing going on.
We're just friends.

766
00:40:59,872 --> 00:41:03,465
Friends become babe, babes become honey.

767
00:41:03,576 --> 00:41:05,763
Then they become mortal enemies
and go to court to get divorced.

768
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,165
Go for it.

769
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:11,235
The truth is, I keep thinking about her.

770
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:15,440
I'm not sure if it's because I like her
or because she's a friend.

771
00:41:15,564 --> 00:41:16,641
It's easy.

772
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:20,473
When you like someone,
your heart starts beating like crazy.

773
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,280
Your hands and feet become numb.

774
00:41:22,386 --> 00:41:24,382
And you feel dazed as if someone's
hit your head with a hammer.

775
00:41:24,477 --> 00:41:25,583
Those are the signs.

776
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,384
I love spending time with her.

777
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:29,887
But, how do I put this...

778
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,290
I'm not certain about my feelings.

779
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:35,059
You're not certain?

780
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:41,165
There is a way to find out for sure.

781
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:42,667
Do you want to know?

782
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,335
What is it?

783
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:45,837
You know NASA, right?

784
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:47,739
National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

785
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:50,441
Richard Fredman from
NASA came up with this.

786
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:54,012
He worked on this formula for
five years on the super computer.

787
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,513
Really? What is it?

788
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,814
-You want to know?
-Yes.

789
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,095
Almost done.

790
00:42:13,486 --> 00:42:14,319
There it is.

791
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:17,402
The probability of you liking
for Malgeum is 80%.

792
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:18,703
It's become certain.

793
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,405
You like Malgeum for sure.

794
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:21,894
Are you kidding me?

795
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,108
This formula is bogus.

796
00:42:24,203 --> 00:42:27,211
It's sometimes spot on.

797
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:31,916
Shall I calculate if your love
will come to fruition?

798
00:42:32,012 --> 00:42:33,918
-Yes.
-Observe.

799
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:35,319
A mechanical pencil.

800
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:36,621
Grab a mechanical pencil.

801
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:40,591
Draw a heart.

802
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:42,193
Then, push out the lead.

803
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:45,496
Push it out. Push it as much as you can.

804
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:49,578
Then color in this heart.
Keep coloring.

805
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,870
If the lead doesn't break
until I fill up this heart,

806
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,473
-your love will come to fruition.
-Shut up!

807
00:42:56,993 --> 00:42:59,077
What was I expecting from you?

808
00:42:59,374 --> 00:43:00,878
Gosh! My goodness!

809
00:43:00,982 --> 00:43:04,482
This is really accurate.

810
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,317
It's the truth.

811
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,820
What was I expecting from him?

812
00:43:09,123 --> 00:43:11,422
He's so immature.

813
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:20,398
"Kang Donggu X Han Yuna"

814
00:43:26,026 --> 00:43:26,904
What the...

815
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,607
76%?

816
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,311
The probability of me liking Yuna is 76%?

817
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:34,512
How is this possible?

818
00:43:35,504 --> 00:43:37,515
No, this is not possible.

819
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,018
"Park Myeongja"

820
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,320
Park Myeonja...

821
00:43:55,744 --> 00:43:56,934
91%!

822
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:01,239
I've never met this woman but
the probability of me liking her is 91%?

823
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:02,140
This is ridiculous.

824
00:44:02,249 --> 00:44:05,143
Yes, Park Myeongja's pork gukbap
is delicious.

825
00:44:05,237 --> 00:44:08,412
But that doesn't mean I like her, right?

826
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:14,719
Of course Jungi's formula doesn't work.

827
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,220
I got worried for no reason.

828
00:44:27,128 --> 00:44:28,533
I said we have to clean...

829
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:32,236
What are you doing?

830
00:44:33,843 --> 00:44:35,344
Well, I'm...

831
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:36,335
Wait.

832
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:42,202
Are you washing your face with milk?

833
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,148
No, that's not what I was doing.

834
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,651
Then why did you pour milk into the sink?

835
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:48,052
Well...

836
00:44:48,968 --> 00:44:51,535
I was going to drink it. I love milk.

837
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:52,924
Really?

838
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:54,425
Then, drink it.

839
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,027
What?

840
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,230
-Right now?
-You said you were going to drink it.

841
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:01,432
Go ahead. Drink it.

842
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,136
I was going to.

843
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:14,345
If you leave as much as one drop of milk,
I'm going to kick you out.

844
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,952
Fine! I'm sorry!
I was going to wash my face with it.

845
00:45:21,064 --> 00:45:23,454
Why are you yelling at me?!

846
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,355
I didn't do anything wrong!

847
00:45:24,467 --> 00:45:26,068
Why are you yelling?

848
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:27,367
What's going on?

849
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,559
Look at what she's doing.

850
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:32,867
She was going to wash her face with milk
that we bought for the guests.

851
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:34,865
What? Why?

852
00:45:34,968 --> 00:45:38,469
It's skin care. This is how
models take care of her skin.

853
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,373
Donggu, add milk price on my room charge.

854
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:43,574
Satisfied?

855
00:45:45,272 --> 00:45:47,178
She's unbelievable!

856
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,773
How can she wash her face with
milk when she has nothing?

857
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,183
She should say sorry to cows.

858
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:55,052
That's how models wash their faces.

859
00:45:55,565 --> 00:45:56,754
Let's go back downstairs.

860
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,057
He's a huge pushover.

861
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:01,359
Unbelievable.

862
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:04,328
I'm sure he's still hung over Sua.

863
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,731
Maybe they'll get back together.

864
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:10,234
He was heart-broken when they broke up.

865
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,069
It'd be good if they get back together.

866
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,474
She has no conscience.

867
00:46:16,574 --> 00:46:19,081
How can she wash her face with milk
when we don't even have guests?

868
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,379
-That's enough.
-I can't stop!

869
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:24,482
-I'm eating cereal without milk!
-Then, don't eat it!

870
00:46:25,997 --> 00:46:29,487
Look, even Dusik is sighing out of anger.

871
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:30,888
It's not that.

872
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,687
He met his first love again
but he's not sure if he likes her.

873
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,630
What? How can you not know?

874
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:39,035
I don't know.

875
00:46:39,122 --> 00:46:41,299
-It's confusing.
-Really?

876
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:45,603
When I like someone, I can tell it's him
just from the sound of his footsteps.

877
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:47,405
You can tell it's him
with just the sound of his footsteps?

878
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,141
-That's ridiculous.
-I mean...

879
00:46:50,226 --> 00:46:53,632
When you like someone,
you notice everything about him.

880
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:57,615
Then, you can tell what
his footsteps sound like.

881
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:02,320
You must've known what that booger guy's
footsteps sounded like?

882
00:47:02,432 --> 00:47:04,355
What sound did he make
when he picked his nose?

883
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:07,224
I told you not to mention him.

884
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:10,127
-Stop hitting me! It hurts!
-I hit you for you to feel that pain!

885
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:14,532
Don't hit me so hard. You're so strong.
I am suffering because of you!

886
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,368
I'm telling you this formula works.

887
00:47:17,447 --> 00:47:21,339
-It's scientifically proved.
-How is that possible?

888
00:47:21,484 --> 00:47:23,480
I'm telling you I'm right.

889
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:28,379
How can you tell you like
someone or not by footsteps?

890
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:31,215
Your formula doesn't make sense.

891
00:47:31,324 --> 00:47:32,316
Of course it does.

892
00:47:32,493 --> 00:47:38,522
NASA's Richard Fredman made this formula.
He calculated it on the super computer.

893
00:47:44,634 --> 00:47:45,529
What's wrong?

894
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,029
-Are you feeling sick?
-My heart...

895
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:51,535
-My heart...
-What? What's wrong with your heart?

896
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,038
-It's beating too fast.
-What?

897
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,340
-Why?
-I don't know.

898
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,743
As soon as I saw that
woman who passed by me,

899
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,912
my heart started beating fast.

900
00:48:02,033 --> 00:48:04,534
My hands feel tingly as if electricity
is running through them.

901
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,914
There are the early signs
of falling in love.

902
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,888
Love?

903
00:48:11,103 --> 00:48:13,624
-That's ridiculous.
-Why is it so?

904
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:14,692
Fine.

905
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:16,894
I'll prove it to you.

906
00:48:17,073 --> 00:48:17,995
How?

907
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,232
I'll ask her for her name
and put it in the formula.

908
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:25,236
This is the chance to prove
Richard Fredman's formula.

909
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:26,237
She's...

910
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:29,373
Over there.

911
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,245
What is he doing? He's crazy.

912
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:36,647
Jungi, where are you going?

913
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,055
Excuse me! Wait!

914
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:46,991
Wait! Wait!

915
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:49,768
She went up.

916
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:52,369
-Darn it.
-What are you doing?

917
00:48:52,501 --> 00:48:53,964
Get yourself together.

918
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,066
Seojin.

919
00:48:56,177 --> 00:48:59,270
She might be the woman of my destiny.

920
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,272
Destiny? She's a stranger you saw
on the street.

921
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:03,374
That's why I'm going to check.

922
00:49:03,898 --> 00:49:06,405
I just need her name. Just that.

923
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,814
What the hell is wrong with him?

924
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,391
Who left the TV on?

925
00:49:23,353 --> 00:49:24,295
Oh my god!

926
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,663
Be quiet.

927
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,568
She'll yell at me again
if she sees me like this.

928
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:30,468
-She went out with Jungi.
-She did?

929
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:33,070
I didn't have to hide then.

930
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,675
Goodness, that startled me.

931
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,589
I wanted to watch TV and do a face pack.

932
00:49:42,711 --> 00:49:45,501
-So, I was hiding from her.
-Really?

933
00:49:45,968 --> 00:49:47,785
Well done.

934
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,308
It must be Seojin. It's Seojin.

935
00:49:51,393 --> 00:49:52,790
It's not Seojin.

936
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,192
-It's Yuna.
-What?

937
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,994
I'm home.

938
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,829
-Hey.
-It really is her.

939
00:49:58,934 --> 00:50:01,632
How did you know it was her
from just her footsteps?

940
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:03,334
I don't know.

941
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:07,838
When I like someone, I can tell it's him
just from the sound of his footsteps.

942
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,846
How could I tell it was Yuna
from the sound of her footsteps?

943
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:18,449
Does that mean I like her?

944
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,954
Why are you staring at me?

945
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,222
You're making me uncomfortable.

946
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:26,957
No, it's nothing.

947
00:50:28,934 --> 00:50:30,728
No way. I have feelings for her?

948
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:32,530
How is this possible? It can't be.

949
00:50:32,634 --> 00:50:36,468
No, I just have an excellent hearing.

950
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:38,768
Yes, that's it.

951
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:40,768
Someone else is coming.

952
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,608
This is...

953
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:46,610
-The parcel delivery man?
-Parcel delivery!

954
00:50:46,734 --> 00:50:48,812
Okay! I was right! Parcel delivery man!

955
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,514
Parcel delivery man!

956
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:54,351
-Thank you so much!
-What are you doing?

957
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:58,022
I just have an excellent hearing!

958
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:00,224
Thank you!

959
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:03,894
Thank you, parcel delivery man!

960
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,967
Cheers.

961
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,742
Malgeum, you can hold your liquor.

962
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:23,347
I can't drink well,
but I feel like drinking today.

963
00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:27,985
Actually, today's my birthday.

964
00:51:28,081 --> 00:51:29,787
What? Your birthday?

965
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:31,956
Why didn't you tell me?

966
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,857
If I had known, I'd have bought a gift.

967
00:51:33,974 --> 00:51:37,957
Don't worry about it. You drinking
with me like this is already a gift.

968
00:51:38,058 --> 00:51:41,265
Shouldn't you have a birthday party
with your friends?

969
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:43,367
Or have dinner with your parents?

970
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:49,940
Actually, my parents and I fell apart
after I started doing this job.

971
00:51:50,328 --> 00:51:51,942
I haven't seen them in a while.

972
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,944
My friends too.

973
00:51:58,822 --> 00:52:01,823
Let's stop talking about depressing stuff
and let's just drink.

974
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,120
Okay.

975
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:07,791
Give it to me.

976
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:12,096
Malgeum.

977
00:52:12,302 --> 00:52:14,498
I need to use the bathroom.

978
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:16,266
Sure.

979
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:24,675
-Why are you eating ramyeon?
-What?

980
00:52:25,053 --> 00:52:26,377
We were hungry.

981
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:30,581
You take so much care about your
skin yet you're eating ramyeon?

982
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:33,984
So delicious.

983
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,254
I'm going to the supermarket.

984
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,580
Yuna, you have to buy lots
of things today, right?

985
00:52:39,653 --> 00:52:41,558
-I'll come with you.
-Oh, okay.

986
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:43,354
Sua.

987
00:52:43,534 --> 00:52:45,139
-You want to come with us?
-No.

988
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,766
Cold wind damages my skin.
I'm a model.

989
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,935
See you later then.

990
00:52:51,135 --> 00:52:53,256
I'll clean up. See you.

991
00:52:59,278 --> 00:53:00,077
What the?

992
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,578
Hey.

993
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:02,780
Sua, are you okay?

994
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,481
Yes, I'm fine.

995
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:08,485
It doesn't look fine. It's bleeding.

996
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,403
Yuna, where's the first aid kit?

997
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,400
I think it's in the living room.
I'll go get it.

998
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:15,392
No, I'll get it.

999
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,394
You can go to the supermarket.

1000
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:19,697
Sorry I can't come with you.

1001
00:53:19,792 --> 00:53:22,800
It's fine. Clean up her wound.

1002
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,601
Yes. See you later.

1003
00:53:25,567 --> 00:53:26,437
Sua.

1004
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:29,139
Hold still for a while.
I will go and get the first aid kit.

1005
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,945
I just need her name!

1006
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:38,148
Gosh, seriously.

1007
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,151
Not here.

1008
00:53:43,768 --> 00:53:44,688
Jungi...

1009
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:46,557
Jungi, stop.

1010
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:48,959
We are not going to find her
in this huge building.

1011
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,161
Why? Are you terrified?

1012
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,359
Because Richard Fredman's formula
might be accurate?

1013
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:55,966
Who the hell is Richard Fredman?

1014
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,201
Just wait.

1015
00:53:57,377 --> 00:53:59,770
I'll prove to you...

1016
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,573
...how scientific this formula is.

1017
00:54:11,035 --> 00:54:12,549
Dr. Kim Hyojeong?

1018
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,936
Seojin, this is her, right?

1019
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:16,253
How would I know?

1020
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:17,554
I'm sure this is her!

1021
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:21,959
As soon as I saw this photo,
my heart started beating again.

1022
00:54:33,491 --> 00:54:35,405
99! 99%!

1023
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:38,008
Look at this.
You still don't believe me?

1024
00:54:38,093 --> 00:54:41,103
Hyojeong and I are meant to be together.

1025
00:54:41,205 --> 00:54:43,814
How do you know that?

1026
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:45,115
Kang Seojin.

1027
00:54:45,605 --> 00:54:49,720
Just admit it.
You're really pathetic right now.

1028
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,120
This proves that Richard
Fredman's formula works.

1029
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,827
I'm going to meet Hyojeong.

1030
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:58,128
Whatever.

1031
00:54:59,006 --> 00:55:00,230
Hyojeong.

1032
00:55:01,121 --> 00:55:02,849
Hyojeong.

1033
00:55:02,934 --> 00:55:05,636
Do whatever you like. I don't care.

1034
00:55:06,243 --> 00:55:08,839
But why am I so curious?

1035
00:55:09,146 --> 00:55:10,440
Darn it.

1036
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:11,942
Come in.

1037
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,443
Hyojeong.

1038
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:17,848
-Take a seat.
-Oh, okay.

1039
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,924
-What seems to be the problem?
-I actually...

1040
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,828
My heart is beating too fast.

1041
00:55:30,934 --> 00:55:31,829
Since when?

1042
00:55:31,934 --> 00:55:36,233
It started when I saw
a certain beautiful woman.

1043
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,536
And I used the formula to check
that we're 99% compatible.

1044
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:42,039
After knowing that fact, my heart feels
like it's going to burst.

1045
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,540
Any other symptoms?

1046
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:45,943
I feel dizzy.

1047
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,245
My hands and feet are tingling.

1048
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,348
Like electricity is flowing
through me and I'm out of breath.

1049
00:55:51,434 --> 00:55:52,249
I see.

1050
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:54,151
I'll listen to your heart first.

1051
00:55:54,251 --> 00:55:56,053
No, there's no need...

1052
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,555
Hyojeong, wait...

1053
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,728
-Why is it beating like that?
-Why is this happening?

1054
00:56:04,834 --> 00:56:07,331
-Your heart beat...
-Can you hear it?

1055
00:56:07,634 --> 00:56:09,132
It's odd.

1056
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,536
The symptoms described are worrisome.

1057
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:13,937
Let's do a scan.

1058
00:56:14,033 --> 00:56:17,040
Prepare for a scan, quickly.

1059
00:56:17,534 --> 00:56:19,810
-What is happening...?
-This way.

1060
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:23,180
What is going...?

1061
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,984
What is happening...?

1062
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:30,354
Hello?

1063
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,657
-What is happening...?
-Sir.

1064
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:37,060
-We're starting the scan, so don't move.
-Okay.

1065
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:39,363
What the hell is happening?

1066
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:42,266
This is so out of the blue.

1067
00:56:44,596 --> 00:56:45,569
I'm going in!

1068
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:55,779
Dusik, what took you so long?

1069
00:56:55,854 --> 00:56:57,347
Is the bathroom far away?

1070
00:56:58,249 --> 00:56:59,349
Ta-da.

1071
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:00,350
Cake?

1072
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,053
It's your birthday.
We need to have a cake.

1073
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,956
-Thanks, Dusik.
-Don't mention it.

1074
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:08,158
It's what you do for a friend.

1075
00:57:11,165 --> 00:57:12,362
Excuse me.

1076
00:57:12,968 --> 00:57:15,032
You're an actress, aren't you?

1077
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:17,834
Pardon?

1078
00:57:18,823 --> 00:57:19,603
Yes.

1079
00:57:19,723 --> 00:57:22,506
I told you. It is her.

1080
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:27,811
What movie or TV drama were you in?

1081
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,112
Well...

1082
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:31,615
We were in the middle of a conversation.

1083
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:34,251
I remember! I remember!

1084
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:37,321
'Bikini Patrol'! The porn movie!

1085
00:57:37,449 --> 00:57:39,323
You were in it, weren't you?

1086
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:44,928
I knew I saw you from somewhere.
It was that movie!

1087
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:51,034
You're dressed moderately right now,
but in the movie, your body was...

1088
00:57:51,908 --> 00:57:53,904
...incredible.

1089
00:57:54,034 --> 00:57:56,106
It's an honor to meet you.
Can I shake your hand?

1090
00:58:01,707 --> 00:58:02,913
You don't want to?

1091
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:04,915
Are you playing hard to get?

1092
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:07,017
-Excuse me, we were in the middle of...
-Forget it.

1093
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:08,734
Forget it!

1094
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:12,122
She thinks she's a celebrity.
She's only a porn star.

1095
00:58:12,538 --> 00:58:14,324
Fine, I am a porn star. So what?

1096
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:18,895
Does that mean I have to shake hands
with a rude man like you?

1097
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:22,699
She's got a temper.

1098
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:26,674
-That's why she didn't hesitate to show...
-What did you say?

1099
00:58:26,784 --> 00:58:27,785
What did you say?

1100
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,779
Malgeum, ignore him.
Let's just go. Let's go.

1101
00:58:31,986 --> 00:58:34,726
She didn't hesitate to show herself.

1102
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:36,546
Don't be such an ass.

1103
00:58:44,331 --> 00:58:45,322
How is it now?

1104
00:58:45,709 --> 00:58:46,923
Does it still hurt a lot?

1105
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,325
No, it's fine.

1106
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:53,497
There's a fire.

1107
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:57,067
Isn't that the supermarket
from our neighborhood?

1108
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,069
Yes, it is.

1109
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:01,471
Looks like a big fire.

1110
00:59:03,567 --> 00:59:05,598
Didn't Yuna say she was
going to the supermarket?

1111
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,286
Jungi.

1112
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:18,488
Sit down.

1113
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:23,293
What did she say?
What's the result?

1114
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:26,196
The thing is...

1115
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:30,400
-She said there's a problem with my heart.
-What?

1116
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:35,105
My heart beating fast,
my hands and feet tingling.

1117
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,374
She says it's all because
there's a problem with my heart.

1118
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:39,376
-Is it serious?
-No.

1119
00:59:39,897 --> 00:59:43,380
We found it early,
so I just need to take medication.

1120
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:45,882
Thank goodness.

1121
00:59:46,185 --> 00:59:49,086
I got so shocked.
I thought it was a big problem.

1122
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,289
Imagine how I felt.

1123
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:56,093
I was so scared in there, I almost peed.

1124
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:59,496
Jeez... Falling in love at first sight?

1125
00:59:59,608 --> 01:00:00,697
You guys are destined to be together?

1126
01:00:00,796 --> 01:00:02,304
Stop it. It's embarrassing.

1127
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,702
But we were actually destined to meet.

1128
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:10,408
If I hadn't met her today,
I could have just dropped dead.

1129
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:12,409
If that's not destiny,
I don't know what is.

1130
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,912
Yes, you were destined to meet.

1131
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,315
This can't be though.

1132
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,219
The formula said we were 99% compatible.

1133
01:00:22,325 --> 01:00:24,321
Stop talking about that formula.

1134
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,623
-It doesn't work.
-What about you?

1135
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:29,126
You said you can tell the person you like
by his footsteps.

1136
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:32,729
It's a figure of speech.

1137
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:37,334
Everyone goes through the same thing
when we like someone, right?

1138
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:41,771
Oh my goodness, someone got hurt.

1139
01:00:47,851 --> 01:00:50,130
You think about that person all day.

1140
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:52,516
Donggu!

1141
01:00:52,812 --> 01:00:54,017
Where are you going?

1142
01:01:04,138 --> 01:01:07,097
You constantly worry when
that person is not around.

1143
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:24,781
It hurts you more when you
see that person hurting.

1144
01:01:41,404 --> 01:01:42,866
-Let go.
-You jerk!

1145
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:45,302
What give you the right
to insult her like that?

1146
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,178
Let me go! Let me go!

1147
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:52,067
You can do anything for that person
even if you get hurt.

1148
01:01:55,567 --> 01:01:57,480
Yuna! Yuna!

1149
01:01:57,601 --> 01:01:58,982
You can't come any further.
It's dangerous.

1150
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:00,850
My friend is in there.

1151
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:03,553
-It's dangerous.
-I don't care! Move!

1152
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:05,655
Yuna! Yuna!

1153
01:02:05,834 --> 01:02:06,756
Yuna!

1154
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:08,758
Donggu!

1155
01:02:27,718 --> 01:02:30,714
What are you doing here?
Is something wrong?

1156
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:41,591
Just the fact that person exists
in this world...

1157
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:45,268
...makes you feel relieved and grateful.

1158
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:48,765
Isn't that love?

1159
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:26,036
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1160
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:27,533
I like her?

1161
01:03:27,634 --> 01:03:28,738
You're crazy!

1162
01:03:28,834 --> 01:03:30,240
Are you mad at me about something?

1163
01:03:30,334 --> 01:03:33,877
Please don't be mad at me. I'm sorry.

1164
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,826
I thought my heart was going to melt away.

1165
01:03:37,937 --> 01:03:39,349
I can see through you.

1166
01:03:39,467 --> 01:03:41,551
-I prepared something for you. Blind date.
-What?

1167
01:03:41,634 --> 01:03:44,254
This Moore Moosh 2017 F/W
vintage collection.

1168
01:03:44,334 --> 01:03:46,156
-You look like a beggar.
-What? A beggar?!

1169
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:47,980
Everyone can't take their eyes off me.

1170
01:03:48,067 --> 01:03:49,659
You have money, right?

1171
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,061
What are you doing?

1172
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,562
What? A blind date?

1173
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,064
Isn't that Seojin?

1174
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:56,700
We'll begin Cherry's fan meeting.

1175
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,102
Cherry! Cherry!

1176
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:00,203
It was embarrassing today, wasn't it?

1177
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:01,805
I can't work like this.

1178
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:03,206
Don't call Malgeum ever again.

1179
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:04,701
Then pay the penalty fees.

1180
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:05,809
I made a huge mistake.

1181
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:09,112
This is the only way to make
that much quickly.

1182
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:13,616
-We won?
-We hit the jackpot!
