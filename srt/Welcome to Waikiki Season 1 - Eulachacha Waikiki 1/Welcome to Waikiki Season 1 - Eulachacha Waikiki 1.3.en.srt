1
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:11,301
Thank you for staying
in our guesthouse Waikiki.

2
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,982
I sincerely hope that you have
a pleasant time in Waikiki.

3
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:17,237
Next.

4
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:19,308
-Ladies and gentlemen.
-Gentlemen.

5
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:20,587
Thank you.

6
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:24,109
Is that it?

7
00:00:24,348 --> 00:00:25,450
I said a bunch of stuff.

8
00:00:25,538 --> 00:00:27,973
I condensed it.
I just need to get the point across.

9
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,253
Forget it.

10
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:30,608
What can I expect from you?

11
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:34,012
Anyway, let's have a good time.

12
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,146
Cheers!

13
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,271
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

14
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:44,301
What's up with him?

15
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:46,936
He got dumped recently.

16
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:53,515
Don't mind him. All of us together now...

17
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:54,732
Cheers!

18
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,089
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,564
Why is she crying?

20
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:02,996
She was also dumped recently.

21
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:05,800
Miserably and brutally.
It was almost unspeakably horrifying.

22
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:09,167
Don't mind them. Once again...

23
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:10,881
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

24
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,862
Forget it.

25
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,462
I'm going upstairs and take a rest.

26
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:15,079
Why? We were having a good time.

27
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,057
-Wait. Where are you going? Wait.
-Wait!

28
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:18,780
-Excuse me.
-Dear guests. Stop it.

29
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,649
-Wait. Please!
-Hey!

30
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:24,734
-Mayday! Emergency!
-Can somebody hear me?

31
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:25,979
Darn it.

32
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:27,183
Darn it.

33
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:29,885
You two!

34
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:33,093
Stop blowing your noses.
Your bone marrow will come out soon.

35
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:36,168
How long are you going to keep doing this?

36
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:38,020
Can't you see that you're making
the guests uncomfortable?

37
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,734
I'm sorry, Jungi.

38
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:44,668
I can't stop crying
because I keep thinking of Taehyeon.

39
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:46,120
-What are you saying?
-We can't understand you.

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,500
Don't cry, Seojin.

41
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:50,475
Seojin!

42
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,433
-What the hell?
-Is he Jean Valjean or something?

43
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:09,010
Why...

44
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,345
...are you here?

45
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:11,634
I had to see you.

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,659
I really missed you.

47
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:15,886
I thought you were disappointed in me.

48
00:02:15,975 --> 00:02:17,378
Of course not. Why would I?

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,346
Because of the mustache?

50
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,389
That's not the problem, you fool!

51
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:24,441
Don't you get it?

52
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:27,411
Even if bananas grow on your head...

53
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
No.

54
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:30,161
Even if seaweed grows...

55
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:32,676
...from your armpits!

56
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:33,730
He must be nuts.

57
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,445
I don't care.

58
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:36,590
Taehyeon...

59
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:40,047
Would you like to officially
go out with me?

60
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:42,773
Taehyeon!

61
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:45,307
Whether it's bananas or seaweed...

62
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:47,546
...I don't care.

63
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:52,492
They're practically shooting a movie.

64
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:56,641
On top of that, it's a disgusting
third-rate cult movie.

65
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:57,734
Don't you agree, Donggu?

66
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm so jealous.

67
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:13,389
-Here we go.
-All right.

68
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:16,556
That's it! Nice!

69
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:34,682
Taehyeon, here's your coffee.

70
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:35,793
Thanks.

71
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,414
Taehyeon, your nose is bleeding.

72
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:43,120
It's okay. This happens often.

73
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:58,004
This drawing is...nice.

74
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,366
We're already here.

75
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:03,837
It's late. Go in.

76
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:04,926
Okay.

77
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:17,364
Oh, right.

78
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,099
Here.

79
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,253
What is it?

80
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:23,797
Open it in your room.

81
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:25,728
I'll get going.

82
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,169
Get home safely.

83
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:49,707
I'm home.

84
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:50,952
Hi, you're back?

85
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,183
How was your date?

86
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,767
Yo, Chewbacca.

87
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:55,674
Why is your face so red?

88
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:58,838
-Like you've just kissed?
-No, I didn't kiss...

89
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:00,569
Yeah, you did!

90
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:01,657
What's that?

91
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:03,825
This?
It's a gift from Taehyeon.

92
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:05,330
A gift? Let's see.

93
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:06,798
-Let's open it.
-Go away.

94
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:08,120
This is my present. Why do you care?

95
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,411
Because we're friends.

96
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:11,328
Open it!
Open it!

97
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,605
Nice box.

98
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:18,799
What's this?

99
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:20,553
What's this?
What's this?

100
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,052
He gave you a razor?

101
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:27,464
Why did he...

102
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:30,393
This is incredible.

103
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:34,400
You're the only one who gets
a razor as a gift from her boyfriend.

104
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:35,903
Shut up.

105
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:36,992
Right, Donggu?

106
00:05:38,465 --> 00:05:40,243
Why are you crying again?!

107
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:41,901
Now that I think about it...

108
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,868
I never gave any proper presents to Sua.

109
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,801
"Waikiki Guest House
Facebook Fan Page Grand Opening!"

110
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:56,698
What's that noise?

111
00:05:57,734 --> 00:05:58,834
It's gimbap!

112
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,264
Don't touch it. These are for Taehyeon.

113
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:02,690
You're so cheap.

114
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:04,664
-I don't want it!
-You can't have it.

115
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:08,067
You've never even made ramyeon for me.

116
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:10,853
Yet you're doing everything for him.

117
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:13,206
So annoying.

118
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:14,841
Right, Donggu?

119
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,855
Why are you crying again?!

120
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,854
I never made gimbap for Sua.

121
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:25,851
Korean men never make gimbap
for their girlfriends!

122
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,502
Right, Dusik?

123
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,630
Isn't it manners to ask
if I've ever had a girlfriend first?

124
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:35,061
Sorry.

125
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,756
That was mean!

126
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:49,349
Three...

127
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:10,530
Seojin, why are you standing there?

128
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,201
No reason.

129
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:14,093
Taehyeon, you're bleeding.

130
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:16,874
I guess I'm stressed out because of work.

131
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:19,506
-It's bleeding more often recently.
-I see.

132
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,010
I'm almost done with this article.
Just give me a second.

133
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,664
Okay, take your time.

134
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:28,648
I have to study anyway.

135
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:48,754
All done.

136
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,261
What's this?

137
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,118
This?

138
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:53,328
It's gimbap.

139
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:55,029
You made it for me?

140
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:56,118
Yes.

141
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:57,810
Try some.

142
00:07:57,973 --> 00:07:58,978
I'm sure it'll be delicious.

143
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:02,406
Wow.

144
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:03,734
-Here.
-Seojin.

145
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:06,319
Gimbap tastes the best
when eaten with your hands.

146
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:08,814
It looks good.

147
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,071
It's really good.

148
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:16,737
Try one. Here.

149
00:08:19,308 --> 00:08:20,308
No, thank you.

150
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:22,990
-I'll eat it myself.
-Seojin.

151
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,435
I want to feed you.

152
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,105
Go on, try it.

153
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:27,982
That's it. Open wide.

154
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:29,398
There you go.

155
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:30,740
You eat well.

156
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,410
You're so cute.

157
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:34,476
What is that?

158
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:37,462
What was it?

159
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,053
There's nothing there.
Did you see something?

160
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:41,247
I thought I saw something.

161
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:43,107
Gee, you're so cute.

162
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:46,415
So cute. You playful thing.

163
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:48,211
Seojin.

164
00:08:48,624 --> 00:08:50,528
Can I feed you one more?

165
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:54,137
-Say aah...
-No. No.

166
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:55,368
-Say aah...
-No, thanks.

167
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,350
Can't we watch something else?

168
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:06,079
Just leave it.

169
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:08,781
It's new every time.

170
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:13,725
I ran out of tissues.

171
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,193
Don't touch the remote control.

172
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:23,839
I'm home.

173
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:25,932
Hey, Chewbacca.

174
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:27,349
How was your date?

175
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:28,614
Yeah, you know...

176
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,059
But you look like you had a fight.

177
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:32,858
No, we didn't fight.

178
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:35,626
He has a weird habit.

179
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:36,729
What habit?

180
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:38,203
He picks his nose all the time.

181
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,544
Everyone picks their nose.
It's no big deal.

182
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:43,080
It is a big deal.

183
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:44,281
He never washes his hands
after he picks his nose.

184
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:47,260
Then he ate gimbap
with that finger and fed me too!

185
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:48,988
-Then he pinched my cheeks!
-Chewbacca.

186
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:51,197
You're so selfish.

187
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:52,331
Why?

188
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,631
He accepted your mustache,

189
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,263
but you can't deal
with him picking his nose?

190
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:57,627
It's not the same.

191
00:09:57,715 --> 00:09:59,703
But his thing is a habit.

192
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,215
Whatever. If it bothers you
that much, tell him.

193
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:03,425
Should I tell him?

194
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:04,566
What if he gets mad at me?

195
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:06,867
He understands your mustache thing,
so won't be mad.

196
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:08,441
That's my spot.

197
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:13,491
What is it this time? What is it!?
What? What? What? What?

198
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,982
There's no toilet paper.

199
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,536
Ouch, my head.

200
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:19,624
Donggu.

201
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:21,968
I made you some congee. Have some.

202
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,899
I'm not hungry.

203
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:25,537
You have to stop doing this.

204
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,000
You haven't eaten or slept in days!
You'll die soon.

205
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:29,840
Let me die.

206
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,015
I don't want to live.

207
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:33,041
You're crazy.

208
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,713
You're crazy.

209
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:38,384
You have nothing better to do than
getting hung over with a girl like Sua?

210
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:40,248
What?

211
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:42,541
A girl like Sua?

212
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:45,127
Watch what you're saying.

213
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:46,367
What did I say?

214
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:51,077
I don't know what you think about Sua,
but she was my true love.

215
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:55,159
To me, she's the happiest memory
that I won't forget until I die.

216
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:57,492
She's a wound that will never heal!

217
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:03,116
How dare you yell at me.

218
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,205
Hey, you brat!

219
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:34,560
What are you doing here by yourself?

220
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:37,130
Nothing.

221
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,238
I know it's tough.

222
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:49,869
I know how painful
an abrupt breakup can be.

223
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:52,578
I've been through it, so I know it well.

224
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,881
But, listen.

225
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:57,350
Even if it hurts like
you're going to die,

226
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:59,802
you'll get over it as time passes.

227
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:01,135
-So...
-No.

228
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:02,689
I'll never get over it.

229
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:04,186
Even after 10 years...

230
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:07,099
No. Even after 100 years,
I won't be able to get over Sua.

231
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:08,668
Why is that?

232
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:10,871
There's so many things
I never got to do for her.

233
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:13,728
I regret it so much.

234
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:18,016
Do you know what I regret the most?

235
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:21,885
Failing to give her...

236
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:24,254
...a beautiful breakup.

237
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:27,980
I wish I could see her one last time.

238
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:29,483
So that...

239
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:32,364
...I could give her a beautiful breakup...

240
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,722
...so I wouldn't regret it.

241
00:12:57,882 --> 00:12:59,261
What are you doing here?

242
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,042
I have a favor to ask.

243
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,291
What favor?

244
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,541
Can you see Donggu one last time?

245
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:06,693
Why should I?

246
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:09,117
He's having a really tough time.

247
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,643
He's not eating or sleeping.

248
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:11,647
He just cries all the time.

249
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:13,506
What does that have to do with me?

250
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:16,057
You guys were together for four years.

251
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:19,231
You can't just break up like this.

252
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,923
-Please see him...
-No.

253
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:23,972
I'm not going to do that.
Please leave now.

254
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,417
I have to work.

255
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:31,279
Please. You'll be saving his life.

256
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:32,923
Please, Sua.

257
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:38,334
Sua!

258
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:39,260
Sua!

259
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:42,019
Sua, don't do this.
Please just see him one more time.

260
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:44,590
I said no. So please leave.

261
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:46,475
Sua!

262
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:49,487
Sua, please see him one last time.

263
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:50,924
Sua!

264
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:52,431
Sua!

265
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:06,553
Why are you staring at me?
Do I have something on my face?

266
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,886
No, it's nothing.

267
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,978
I'm almost done.
So wait just a bit more.

268
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:12,751
Okay.

269
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,592
"Nose, nose, nose, nose..."

270
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,398
"Nose, nose, nose, nose..."

271
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,802
"Nose, nose..."

272
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,636
"Nose, nose, nose, nose..."

273
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:36,118
Taehyeon.

274
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,525
You startled me.
What's wrong?

275
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:39,278
I'm so sorry, but...

276
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:42,081
Can you please stop picking your nose?

277
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,762
Sorry, I didn't realize I was doing it.

278
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:54,788
And please stop rolling it into a ball
and flicking it.

279
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:58,130
Okay, sorry.

280
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:02,950
I thought long and hard
whether I should tell you this.

281
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,263
But I have to say it today.

282
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:06,205
Okay.

283
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:08,395
You pick your nose all the time.

284
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:09,601
Really? I do?

285
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,346
Yes, you do.

286
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,206
And you said your nose
bleeds often, right?

287
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:14,856
I'll tell you why.

288
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:17,294
It's because you pick your nose often.

289
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,219
I guess it's a subconscious thing.
I'm sorry.

290
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,278
It's okay.

291
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:25,481
We can fix a habit.

292
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,704
You're not offended, are you?

293
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:33,502
No, you told me that
because you're looking out for me.

294
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:34,944
What a relief.

295
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,403
Then let's get some beer.

296
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:38,492
Let's go.

297
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:39,774
Oh, okay.

298
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,938
Donggu!
Over here.

299
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:51,493
Why did you ask me to come out here?

300
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:54,717
I used to work with this girl
at the convenience store.

301
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:56,984
She's been asking me
to set her up with someone.

302
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:59,553
-So what?
-So I'm setting you up.

303
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:01,931
You forget a woman with a woman.

304
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,256
-So...
-Are you insane?!

305
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,739
-What's wrong?
-Do I seem that shallow to you?

306
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,550
My heart still hurts
whenever I think about Sua.

307
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:12,738
I'm not ready and don't want
to let her go yet.

308
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:15,161
-Seriously.
-You can't just leave.

309
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:16,844
-Wait.
-You're insane.

310
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,300
There she is. Mina!

311
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:19,366
Over here!

312
00:16:27,534 --> 00:16:30,335
Mina, this is my friend Kang Donggu
that I told you about.

313
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:33,300
Hello. My name is Lee Mina.

314
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:34,389
Hello.

315
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:37,404
I'm doing this for you.

316
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:39,174
Never do anything like this again. Got it?

317
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:40,644
Yeah, okay.

318
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:44,060
Dusik told me so much about you.

319
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:45,271
Really?

320
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:50,240
Shall we go and have some coffee?

321
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:52,618
Why don't we get a drink instead?

322
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:54,246
-Shall we?
-Mina.

323
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:57,116
It seems like Donggu has to leave now.

324
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:00,326
Actually, he just broke up
with his girlfriend recently.

325
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,954
So, he doesn't want to go on a blind date.

326
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:04,343
Oh, I see.

327
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:07,101
It's fine. It can't be helped.

328
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:08,841
Donggu.

329
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,197
I was inconsiderate. I'm sorry.

330
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,457
Go home.

331
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:13,628
Go home and rest.

332
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:15,459
Get a good rest.

333
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:16,759
Okay, thanks.

334
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,950
It was nice meeting you anyway.
See you again.

335
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:24,090
-Dusik, buy me grilled clams. Okay?
-Okay.

336
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,542
How have you been?
Why didn't you call me?

337
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,817
Kang Donggu.

338
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,321
Why did you look back?

339
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:34,728
Do you want to go out with her?

340
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,785
You just broke up with Sua.

341
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:38,546
Get it together, Kang Donggu!

342
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:46,122
What should we order?

343
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,967
Perilla...

344
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,424
Perilla pasta?

345
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:51,870
Taehyeon, you're doing it again.

346
00:17:54,311 --> 00:17:56,742
-Sorry.
-You can't help it, can you?

347
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,074
We need to take a special measure.

348
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,716
A special measure?

349
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:07,292
Seojin.

350
00:18:07,406 --> 00:18:09,503
Is this necessary?

351
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:11,892
Yes, if you want to fix your habit.

352
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:13,238
You don't want to fix it?

353
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,326
I do.

354
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,277
Okay.

355
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:16,409
Cheers.

356
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:18,262
One moment.

357
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:21,374
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

358
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:27,608
Cheers.

359
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:32,777
Go ahead, try some.

360
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:37,139
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:38,818
Donggu.

362
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:40,417
Oh, you guys came here?

363
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:42,808
Yeah, Mina wanted grilled clams.

364
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:44,255
Why are you here?

365
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:46,751
I was heading home,
but I has a lot on my mind.

366
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:47,895
So I came to have a drink.

367
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:48,984
-By yourself?
-Yeah.

368
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:50,779
-Alone in a grilled clams restaurant?
-Yes.

369
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:53,999
I come here alone three times a week.
Is that weird?

370
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,329
Would you like to join us?

371
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,490
-Shall I?
-No, Mina.

372
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:01,212
He said he has a lot on his mind.

373
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:03,442
He's having a really tough time.

374
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:05,143
Donggu.

375
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,453
Don't mind us
and eat lots of grilled clam, okay?

376
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,262
Eat until you're full.

377
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:10,414
Okay.

378
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:20,509
What can I get you?

379
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:22,734
A bottle of soju and grilled clams please.

380
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:24,485
By yourself? It's a big portion.

381
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:26,892
I eat that dish three times a week.

382
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,980
Bring it to me.

383
00:19:31,624 --> 00:19:33,872
Gee, this is a lot.

384
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,008
I'm so full but there's still
so much left.

385
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:40,987
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

386
00:19:43,664 --> 00:19:45,939
Mina, he's so slow-witted, right?

387
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:49,182
Yeah, he's really slow.

388
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:52,367
-Who is that guy?
-His name is Lee Jungi. We live together.

389
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:57,755
He must be naturally that way.
How could he not get it?

390
00:19:57,844 --> 00:19:59,501
-Dusik, let's finish our drinks and go.
-Okay.

391
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,478
I'm full.

392
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,754
-Should we get going now?
-Okay.

393
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:10,054
Are you leaving too?

394
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,048
Yeah, I was about to get up too.

395
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,767
You still have a lot of clams left.

396
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:16,402
These? I'll take it home for Seol.

397
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,088
Grilled clams for Seol?

398
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,518
But she's only 100 days old.

399
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:23,122
I can just blend them.

400
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:25,291
Can I have this to go?

401
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:41,110
Taehyeon, you're doing it again.

402
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:43,075
I can't leave you alone.

403
00:20:46,053 --> 00:20:48,003
Seojin, this is too much.

404
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:49,763
No, it's not.

405
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:52,316
I'm going to hit you
when you pick your nose. Got it?

406
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:54,183
I got it, so please stop.

407
00:20:54,271 --> 00:20:56,162
We can't stop.

408
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:59,331
Are you ignoring me? How can you pick
your nose right away?

409
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:00,960
Why don't you listen to me?

410
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:02,909
Please stop.

411
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:04,448
Why are you getting mad at me?

412
00:21:04,537 --> 00:21:06,054
Is picking my nose a crime?

413
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:08,132
I'm doing this for you.

414
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,185
Your nose bleeds too often
and it's unhygienic.

415
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:12,438
And frankly...

416
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:15,474
It doesn't look good.

417
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,567
It doesn't look good?

418
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,001
Than you growing a mustache.

419
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:25,402
Why are you bringing that up?

420
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:27,235
I accepted your mustache thing, didn't I?

421
00:21:27,322 --> 00:21:28,452
Why can't you accept my thing?

422
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,897
It's not the same.

423
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:32,534
That's just what my body does
but your thing is a habit.

424
00:21:32,622 --> 00:21:35,171
My body makes a lot of boogers.

425
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,268
What?

426
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:40,232
What's more weird? You growing
a mustache or me picking my nose?

427
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:42,969
Are you curious? Shall I ask people?

428
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:44,616
Excuse me.

429
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,249
This woman can grow a mustache.

430
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:50,534
What's more weird?
That or picking my nose?

431
00:21:50,622 --> 00:21:52,989
Stop it! You're embarrassing me.

432
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:54,077
Embarrassing?

433
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:55,805
Are you embarrassed by me?

434
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:57,708
You embarrass me too.

435
00:21:57,796 --> 00:21:58,796
Do you know why?

436
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:01,686
When we have a date
from morning till evening,

437
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:05,759
I can see your mustache growing.

438
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,900
And when I kiss you,

439
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:11,703
I get chafed.

440
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:15,328
I have to apply ointment on my lips
after we kiss.

441
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,112
I look so pathetic when I do that.

442
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,810
I endured all those things.

443
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:22,819
So why do you shame me
for picking my nose?

444
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:24,835
If it bothers you so much,
you should've told me earlier.

445
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:26,627
How did you keep it to yourself
for so long?

446
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:28,253
You're so narrow-minded.

447
00:22:28,392 --> 00:22:29,521
Narrow-minded?

448
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,996
Take that back.

449
00:22:32,423 --> 00:22:34,051
No, you're narrow-minded.

450
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,174
You're so narrow-minded.

451
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:39,010
Fine, I'm narrow-minded.
So what, 'Hairy'?

452
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,172
'Hairy'?

453
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:42,955
-You're a booger!
-Booger?!

454
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:45,425
-Yes, you're a booger!
-Don't call me a booger!

455
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:46,701
You're the 'Huam-dong Hairy Girl.'

456
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,354
"Huam-dong Hairy Girl"?

457
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,168
-You're the 'Wangsim-ri Booger'!
-What?!

458
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:52,711
Don't disrespect Wangsim-ri.

459
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,844
It's unacceptable. Let's break up!

460
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:56,293
All right, let's break up.

461
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:57,786
Don't ever call me again, Booger.

462
00:22:57,874 --> 00:22:59,869
Don't you ever call me again,
Huam-dong Hairy Girl.

463
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:01,818
-I can't hear you, Booger!
-Huam-dong Hairy Girl!

464
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:02,929
-I can't hear you!
-Hairy! Hairy!

465
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:04,709
-I can't hear you!
-Hairy! Hairy!

466
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:06,457
Please calm down!

467
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:09,953
Oh my gosh!

468
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:12,326
You're still here?

469
00:23:12,484 --> 00:23:15,755
So, please see Donggu one last time.

470
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:17,447
Why are you doing this?

471
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:18,869
Did he ask you to do this?

472
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,796
-No.
-Then why are you doing this?

473
00:23:21,905 --> 00:23:23,162
I know better than anyone,

474
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:25,251
the pain of not being able
to properly say goodbye,

475
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:28,338
to the person you love.

476
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,939
So, please see him one last time.

477
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,028
I beg you.

478
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:36,821
No.

479
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,819
I never want to see his face again.

480
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:41,688
You're wasting your time.
Just leave.

481
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,297
You're so mean.

482
00:23:46,831 --> 00:23:47,831
Sua.

483
00:23:48,353 --> 00:23:49,602
If you keep saying no,

484
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:51,836
I'm going to do something about it.

485
00:23:55,494 --> 00:23:56,505
What...

486
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:58,262
What are you going to do?

487
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:04,022
My bag!

488
00:24:05,222 --> 00:24:06,707
She's crazy!

489
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:08,174
Hey!

490
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:12,827
-I really enjoyed that. Thanks, Dusik.
-My pleasure.

491
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:15,418
Don't forget about
the blind date on Friday.

492
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:17,306
-What? A blind date?
-I won't.

493
00:24:17,526 --> 00:24:19,105
He already set her up with another guy?

494
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:21,722
I didn't even get her number.

495
00:24:21,811 --> 00:24:23,062
Wait.

496
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:25,196
Why do you need her number?

497
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:27,111
Are you really interested in her?

498
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:30,832
Keep it together, Kang Donggu!

499
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:38,683
What? You haven't left?

500
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:40,769
What's wrong?

501
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:42,947
Something's stuck in my teeth.

502
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:44,322
Mina, do you have a business card?

503
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:45,341
Why do you need her business card?

504
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,323
Business cards work best
to get something out of my teeth.

505
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:51,741
When I get something stuck in my teeth,
it annoys me so much. Didn't you know?

506
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,030
-I didn't know that.
-Yeah.

507
00:24:53,164 --> 00:24:54,670
Mina, do you have a business card?

508
00:24:54,822 --> 00:24:56,526
I have a business card.

509
00:24:56,807 --> 00:24:58,069
Here it is.

510
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:01,985
This is a valuable business card
that 'Piggy Mom' gave you.

511
00:25:02,074 --> 00:25:04,342
-I can't use this.
-Is that so?

512
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:05,493
I think I have another one.

513
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:06,663
Mina, don't you have one?

514
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:08,374
A business card? One moment.

515
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:09,848
My business card...

516
00:25:11,515 --> 00:25:12,327
Here it is.

517
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:15,532
This is from my old job. Is this okay...

518
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:17,890
This is perfect.

519
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:20,435
This is my favourite type of paper.

520
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:22,982
It's the perfect paper to pick my teeth.

521
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:25,023
This is a rare find.

522
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:28,466
-That's great.
-Thanks. Bye.

523
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:31,116
I got it.

524
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:33,051
What's wrong with him?

525
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,320
That was natural.

526
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:39,043
That was clever.

527
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:40,551
Excellent.

528
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:45,535
Yuna.

529
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:47,285
Yuna, please stop.

530
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:50,742
Only if you agree to see Donggu.

531
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,950
Darn it.

532
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,293
Give me my bag when I ask nicely.

533
00:25:58,382 --> 00:26:01,259
Not until you agree to see Donggu.

534
00:26:01,348 --> 00:26:03,360
Why are you doing this to me?

535
00:26:03,448 --> 00:26:06,671
You can't do this to a man
you once loved.

536
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:09,306
Please see him one last time.

537
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:10,341
Okay.

538
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:11,472
Fine.

539
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:12,910
Really?

540
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:15,490
-Where is he?
-He should be at the guesthouse.

541
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:17,662
Let's go.

542
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:23,821
It's me, Kang Donggu.
Your blind date.

543
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,742
I just wanted to make sure
you got home safely.

544
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:30,278
It was nice to meet you today.

545
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,070
Sua.

546
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,285
Donggu, you had a blind date?

547
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:39,801
But...why are you with Sua?

548
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,177
You said you'd do anything
to see her one last time.

549
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:44,265
That was...

550
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,721
-Sua, what happened was...
-Donggu.

551
00:26:47,077 --> 00:26:48,312
Let's talk.

552
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:49,522
What?

553
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:51,292
Okay.

554
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:52,656
Sure.

555
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:04,214
Sua, it's a misunderstanding. I swear.

556
00:27:05,986 --> 00:27:10,163
I didn't want to go on a blind date
but Dusik called me.

557
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:11,801
I must've lost my mind for a moment.

558
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,273
I'm sorry, Sua.

559
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:17,354
Donggu.

560
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:21,035
You don't have to be sorry.

561
00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:24,285
I'm not qualified to hear that.

562
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:27,442
Thank you for loving me...

563
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:29,905
...for the last four years.

564
00:27:30,426 --> 00:27:31,500
You made me feel happy.

565
00:27:32,397 --> 00:27:33,725
-But...
-Stop.

566
00:27:34,492 --> 00:27:35,231
What...

567
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,198
What are you trying to say?

568
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:38,646
Just yell at me.

569
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:40,279
When you talk like that,

570
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,373
I can't hang onto you anymore.

571
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:44,474
It feels like it's really over.

572
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,023
Sua.

573
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,770
I'll do better.

574
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:52,945
I'll do 100 times, 1000 times
better than that guy.

575
00:27:53,034 --> 00:27:54,682
-So, please...
-Donggu.

576
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,129
You did more than enough all this time.

577
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:00,151
It's not your fault that we broke up.

578
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,119
It's all my fault.

579
00:28:03,664 --> 00:28:04,824
I changed.

580
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:07,758
I'll tell you something.

581
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:10,734
I'm so happy with Yunseok.

582
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,765
So, forget about me.

583
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:17,179
I want you to be happy too.

584
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:22,705
I'm sorry.

585
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:25,710
I'm sorry, Donggu.

586
00:28:27,177 --> 00:28:28,613
I'm so sorry, Donggu.

587
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,471
Thank you for liking me...

588
00:28:38,658 --> 00:28:39,991
...for all those years.

589
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:48,233
Bye.

590
00:29:33,761 --> 00:29:35,456
You people live for tomorrow.

591
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:39,650
Those who live for tomorrow will die
in the hands of those who live for today.

592
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,772
I live for today.

593
00:29:43,693 --> 00:29:45,658
I'll show you...

594
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:49,278
...how shitty that life is.

595
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,941
Leave your profile on the table.

596
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,868
Okay.

597
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:59,037
"Male Profile"

598
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:04,102
That was a performance
by the rookie actor, Lee Jungi.

599
00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:05,638
Please remember that name.

600
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:13,784
Hope you sell 10 million tickets
for your movie.

601
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,348
-See you again.
-Bye.

602
00:30:26,437 --> 00:30:27,437
See you again.

603
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:28,566
Bye.

604
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,401
I'm home.

605
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:32,235
Where have you been, all dressed up?

606
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:35,394
I distributed my profile
to movie production companies.

607
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:37,573
What's the point?

608
00:30:37,664 --> 00:30:39,745
You only get roles that stand quietly
in the background.

609
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:42,697
-It's a waste of paper.
-What did you say?

610
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,500
How could you say that to me?

611
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,280
Geez.

612
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:50,805
That's why you get called
Huam-dong Hairy Girl by your first love.

613
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:52,795
I told you never to mention it again.

614
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:55,662
-I told you not to! Don't say it!
-Let me go.

615
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,066
Stop fighting. We have guests.

616
00:30:58,155 --> 00:30:59,870
-Kang Seojin!
-Let go!

617
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:02,840
What's that? A camera?
Why do you have it with you?

618
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,073
-I'm shooting something tomorrow.
-What?

619
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:06,029
What are you shooting?

620
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:08,266
I'm helping out Taesik.

621
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:09,602
Why did you get a part-time job?

622
00:31:09,721 --> 00:31:10,881
To earn money.

623
00:31:11,165 --> 00:31:11,913
Money?

624
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:13,550
-Is something wrong?
-Huh?

625
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,309
No, nothing's wrong.

626
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,523
I broke up with Sua.

627
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:25,350
It looks like she met a decent guy.

628
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:27,024
So, I'm letting her go.

629
00:31:29,314 --> 00:31:31,936
But what does that have to do
with earning money?

630
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:35,633
Now that I broke up with Sua,
I realized I only have movies left.

631
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:38,371
I decided to get my act together
and focus on making a movie.

632
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:43,386
I'm going to earn
the production cost within a year.

633
00:31:43,474 --> 00:31:45,607
So, Jungi, practice acting.

634
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,244
And you write up a scenario, okay?

635
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:52,083
That's the old Kang Donggu!

636
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:55,394
Are you going to go with that idea?

637
00:31:55,483 --> 00:31:57,604
US President reincarnating into Bruce Lee?

638
00:32:07,758 --> 00:32:10,242
I wonder how long it'll take them
to give up this time.

639
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,348
Why did you sigh?

640
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,275
Is something wrong?

641
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,166
Seojin.

642
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:21,985
Do you have a dream?

643
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:23,681
Dream? I do.

644
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:25,203
Becoming a journalist.

645
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:28,337
Since I was young, my dream
has been to become a journalist.

646
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:31,789
But I don't even remember
how many interviews I failed.

647
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:33,824
Why do you ask?

648
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,620
I'm envious.

649
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:37,443
Everyone has a dream.

650
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:39,787
Donggu has one and Jungi has one.

651
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,982
Dusik has one and you too.

652
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,600
That's nothing to be envious about.

653
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,024
You don't have a dream?

654
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:45,203
I did have one.

655
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:47,004
I'm in no position to dream.

656
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:48,938
What does your situation
have to do with having a dream?

657
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:50,767
You know my situation.

658
00:32:50,856 --> 00:32:52,205
I have Seol.

659
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:54,705
Yuna.

660
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:56,800
Do you know J.K Rowling?

661
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:58,989
She was a divorced mom with a kid.

662
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:01,920
Her only income was
the weekly national allowance.

663
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:04,495
She didn't have enough formula
for her baby so she added water in it.

664
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:07,591
Do you know what she wrote
through all that?

665
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:11,206
It's Harry Potter.

666
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:13,125
People say they can't do things,

667
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:15,996
because they don't have money or time
or because they don't have rich parents.

668
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:18,135
Those are all excuses.

669
00:33:18,484 --> 00:33:20,995
So, tell me what your dream is.

670
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,942
I'll help you in every way I can,
so tell me.

671
00:33:26,997 --> 00:33:27,997
A rapper.

672
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:29,826
Rap... Rapper?

673
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:33,468
A rapper like Dok2 and Behwy?

674
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:34,385
Why?

675
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:35,780
-Is it weird?
-No.

676
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:38,326
It's not weird. It's just unexpected.

677
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:41,171
-Can you rap?
-A little bit.

678
00:33:41,614 --> 00:33:42,540
Do you want to hear it?

679
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:44,021
Yeah, go ahead.

680
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:52,067

00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,099

00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,351

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,300

What do you think?

691
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:13,290
It's very unique.

692
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,853
I think you only need
a little more practice.

693
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:16,942
Really?

694
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:19,212
Then, do you think I can go for it?

695
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,782
Sure, why not?

696
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:23,213
It is your dream.

697
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:24,537
Thank you, Seojin.

698
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:27,855
If it weren't for you,
I'd never have thought about pursuing it.

699
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:30,378
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

700
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:32,075
Good luck.

701
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,464
Private Kim, wake up.

702
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:37,582
Don't die! Private Kim!

703
00:34:37,996 --> 00:34:39,996
There's a radio over there.

704
00:34:41,243 --> 00:34:42,245
Mayday. Mayday.

705
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:43,289
Emergency.

706
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:45,168
Gosh. Ogenki...

707
00:34:45,278 --> 00:34:46,704
Private Kim, hold on a little bit more.

708
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,959
Private Kim, we're almost there.

709
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,228
Private Kim. Private Kim!

710
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,267
Jerks.

711
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:02,273
See you in hell.

712
00:35:07,545 --> 00:35:08,895
"'Marine' Audition 2018, February 12th"

713
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:10,669
-That is all.
-Look.

714
00:35:10,757 --> 00:35:15,078
You do know
what this movie is about, right?

715
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:16,166
Yes, sir.

716
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:17,762
"Marine".

717
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:20,164
-Isn't it about Marines?
-No, it's not.

718
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:21,576
It's about a swimmer.

719
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:22,700
Park Taehwan the Marine boy.

720
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:24,487
Swimming, Olympics, youth!

721
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:27,512
Sorry, sir. I've been doing
so many auditions these days.

722
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,271
I'll do it again.

723
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,646
No, we don't need to see it.

724
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:32,036
-You can go.
-What?

725
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:35,487
Sir, please give me another chance.

726
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,897
I'm a good swimmer.

727
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:39,315
You can give a small part.
I don't need to get paid.

728
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:41,583
I'll do anything, sir.

729
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:42,851
Please!

730
00:35:43,065 --> 00:35:45,349
Then, take off your clothes.

731
00:35:46,486 --> 00:35:47,486
Pardon?

732
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:49,050
Why do you want me to take off...

733
00:35:49,138 --> 00:35:50,766
This is a movie about swimmers.

734
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:53,917
We need to see if you have
a good body to give you a part.

735
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,559
Okay, I'll take them off.

736
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,781
Wait. Wait!

737
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,215
Is that chest hair?

738
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:02,909
Yes, it is.

739
00:36:02,998 --> 00:36:03,889
Are your legs hairy too?

740
00:36:03,977 --> 00:36:07,130
Yes, I have a high level of testosterone.

741
00:36:07,218 --> 00:36:08,015
-You can go home.
-What?

742
00:36:08,104 --> 00:36:09,568
Pull up your zipper and get out.

743
00:36:09,657 --> 00:36:10,554
But, why?

744
00:36:10,643 --> 00:36:12,748
Have you seen a hairy swimmer like you?

745
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:17,250
They cut their hair short and shave off
their arm pits to reduce air resistance.

746
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:19,212
They even shave down there.

747
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:24,819
I'll shave everything.

748
00:36:24,908 --> 00:36:28,135
Except for the hair on my head,
and shave off all the other hair.

749
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,570
Don't you worry, sir.

750
00:36:31,138 --> 00:36:32,138
"Marine"!

751
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:53,466
So this is what a waxing room looks like.

752
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:03,416
Should I do this?
This is driving me crazy.

753
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,599
What's this?

754
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:07,347
It's all ragged.

755
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:08,844
Oh my god.

756
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,885
-Hello.
-Hi. Who are you?

757
00:37:11,974 --> 00:37:14,031
I'll be waxing you today.

758
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,569
You're going to wax me?

759
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:17,893
Don't be embarrassed.

760
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:20,689
We get a lot of male customers.

761
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:21,549
I see.

762
00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:24,152
I don't have much time,
so I'll just get to it.

763
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,139
Let's begin. Please lie down.

764
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:27,928
Should I put this somewhere else?

765
00:37:28,017 --> 00:37:30,168
Keep it. You'll need it.

766
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:32,636
Please take off your gown.

767
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,567
I'll start.

768
00:37:45,738 --> 00:37:47,738
Bear with me even if it hurts.

769
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:54,688
I'll remove the sheet.

770
00:37:56,287 --> 00:37:57,548
What is this?

771
00:38:06,362 --> 00:38:09,858
This is why... this doll is here...

772
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,334
"President is Bruce Lee"

773
00:38:20,678 --> 00:38:22,610
Are you manipulating the view count again?

774
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:23,910
Is that necessary?

775
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:25,976
Everyone else does it too.

776
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:28,754
Why is my view count so low?
It's driving me crazy.

777
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:30,924
-Seojin.
-Yeah?

778
00:38:31,013 --> 00:38:32,675
-Can I use your account?
-Why?

779
00:38:32,764 --> 00:38:33,908
To write a comment.

780
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:35,207
Nope.

781
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:36,538
Brat.

782
00:38:37,163 --> 00:38:38,035
Seojin.

783
00:38:38,124 --> 00:38:40,095
I made a song.

784
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,658
-Would you like to hear it?
-What?

785
00:38:42,157 --> 00:38:44,728
You made a song?

786
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,471
A song? What are you talking about?

787
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,122
-What song?
-Well...

788
00:38:48,267 --> 00:38:51,300
-Yuna's dream is to become a rapper.
-Rap... Rapper?

789
00:38:51,424 --> 00:38:53,375
Yuna, you can rap?

790
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:54,464
Yes.

791
00:38:54,905 --> 00:38:57,320
I wrote a song about Seojin.

792
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:59,959
-Would you like to listen?
-Yes, sure.

793
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,646
I didn't know you had a talent like that.

794
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,051
Drop the beat.

795
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:12,101

803
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:29,545

00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:30,675
♪ Yeah!

805
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:37,934
What do you think?

806
00:39:39,182 --> 00:39:41,236
Oh, it was good.

807
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,034
It was unique and...

808
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:44,911
...has a grotesque charm to it.

809
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,580
Really?

810
00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:49,072
-Would you like to listen to another song?
-No.

811
00:39:49,196 --> 00:39:50,842
No, what I mean is...

812
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:53,711
I have to take a shower.
I'll listen to it later.

813
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:54,799
Later.

814
00:40:04,976 --> 00:40:05,874
Seojin.

815
00:40:05,962 --> 00:40:07,053
I'll get started.

816
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:09,204

00:40:22,939 --> 00:40:23,939
Geez.

822
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,161
That was shocking.

823
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,563
Isn't it too much to become
a rapper with those skills?

824
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:35,923
Get the hell out of here!

825
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:37,951
Sorry. You should've told me
you were in here.

826
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,610
I was busy taking a shower.

827
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:42,833
Wait.

828
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:45,062
Jungi!

829
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:46,281
What is this?

830
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,218
What happened?

831
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:48,440
It's nothing.

832
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:50,153
It's not nothing!

833
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,113
-It's nothing.
-Let me see!

834
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:53,669
Where did it all go?

835
00:40:53,757 --> 00:40:55,500
-You're imagining it.
-What?

836
00:40:55,588 --> 00:40:56,799
-Where is it?
-Stop turning me around.

837
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:58,154
-Your arm pits...
-Hey!

838
00:41:01,014 --> 00:41:03,067
What? Brazilian waxing?

839
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:04,601
Why did you do it?

840
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:06,852
The director told me to do it.

841
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,550
He said he wouldn't
give me a part if I didn't.

842
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:10,407
That's ridiculous.

843
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:12,791
-So, which part did you get?
-Swimmer number eight.

844
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:16,595
You don't even have a name?
It's another background role, huh?

845
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:18,539
Swimmer number eight is a great part.

846
00:41:18,628 --> 00:41:20,978
There's even swimmer number 28.

847
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:21,921
Is that so?

848
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:22,915
That's impressive.

849
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:25,222
-There are 28 swimmers in that movie?
-Shut up.

850
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:28,201
It's Jisu.

851
00:41:28,761 --> 00:41:29,761
Hello?

852
00:41:29,985 --> 00:41:32,091
Hi, Jisu. It's Jungi.

853
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,077
Tomorrow?

854
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,556
I'm free tomorrow. Why?

855
00:41:34,645 --> 00:41:35,938
With your mother?

856
00:41:36,233 --> 00:41:38,623
Yes, of course. Yes.

857
00:41:38,886 --> 00:41:40,537
See you tomorrow. Bye.

858
00:41:41,014 --> 00:41:42,572
You've already found a new girlfriend?

859
00:41:43,322 --> 00:41:44,632
I wonder how long this one will last.

860
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,954
It's serious this time.

861
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:49,312
We made plans to have a meal
with her mother.

862
00:41:50,215 --> 00:41:52,246
Yeah? It sounds like you're serious
about this girl.

863
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:53,744
Totally.

864
00:41:53,922 --> 00:41:57,370
I have a feeling about her
that I haven't felt about anyone else.

865
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,343
Donggu.

866
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,437
Did you feel like this
when you were with Sua?

867
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:05,701
Yeah.

868
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:07,187
Yeah, you know...

869
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:10,586
-Jungi...
-What?

870
00:42:13,145 --> 00:42:15,724
I was just asking a question.

871
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:18,786
-Sorry.
-No, there's no need to be sorry.

872
00:42:20,907 --> 00:42:22,928
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

873
00:42:23,017 --> 00:42:24,185
Why you jerk...

874
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,275
What?

875
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:27,192
You always say the wrong thing.

876
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:29,120
Why did you bring up Sua?

877
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:30,451
I didn't do it on purpose.

878
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:32,856
Why are you getting mad
when Donggu says it's okay?

879
00:42:33,813 --> 00:42:35,085
He didn't look okay.

880
00:42:35,174 --> 00:42:38,361
-It's fine. Mind your own business.
-Did you seriously say 'Thanks'?

881
00:43:02,005 --> 00:43:03,520
What are you doing here?

882
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:07,124
Nothing.

883
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,760
You were thinking about Sua, weren't you?

884
00:43:13,649 --> 00:43:14,898
I know it's tough.

885
00:43:15,213 --> 00:43:17,834
Even if you don't tell me,
I know how hard it is.

886
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,843
I know that no words can comfort you.

887
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,320
I prepared something for you.

888
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:31,748

Oh, that's right.

You're working today, right?

Yeah, I have a study group.

What got into Yuna?

917
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:38,372
-Yeah!
-Her dream is to become a rapper.

918
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:40,308
A rapper? With those skills?

919
00:44:40,397 --> 00:44:42,218
I encouraged her to try it out.

920
00:44:42,311 --> 00:44:43,421
It's also driving me crazy.

921
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,323
So it's you who got her started.

922
00:44:45,827 --> 00:44:46,600
Hey.

923
00:44:46,689 --> 00:44:49,010
She's allowed to dream,
but that's just wrong.

924
00:44:49,211 --> 00:44:50,571
Stop her before it's too late.

925
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:52,448
We don't know what kind
of trouble she'll get into.

926
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:54,442
But she's taking this rapper thing
so seriously.

927
00:44:54,531 --> 00:44:57,058
It's your problem. I have to go to work.

928
00:44:57,811 --> 00:44:59,449
-Take one for the road.
-No, thanks.

929
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:11,587
Jisu told me so much about you.

930
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:13,390
I really wanted to meet you in person.

931
00:45:13,479 --> 00:45:17,157
You're handsome and polite
just like she said.

932
00:45:17,246 --> 00:45:18,497
You're too kind.

933
00:45:18,586 --> 00:45:20,879
Gosh, you're humble too?

934
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:22,425
Thank you, Ma'am.

935
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:24,262
Oh, excuse me.

936
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,351
Go ahead.

937
00:45:25,595 --> 00:45:26,477
Hello?

938
00:45:26,634 --> 00:45:27,532
Really?

939
00:45:27,621 --> 00:45:29,099
Okay. I'll be right there.

940
00:45:30,317 --> 00:45:31,568
I'm so sorry.

941
00:45:31,718 --> 00:45:34,776
Something urgent came up
and I have to go.

942
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:36,740
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

943
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:38,786
Drive safely.

944
00:45:39,006 --> 00:45:41,529
-Bye, Ma'am. My name is Lee Jungi.
-Bye.

945
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:51,454
I was so nervous.
I lost all senses in my legs.

946
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:54,785
How did I do?

947
00:45:54,874 --> 00:45:57,362
It looked like she really liked you.

948
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:58,451
Really?

949
00:45:59,776 --> 00:46:00,776
What a relief.

950
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,065
Well done, Lee Jungi.

951
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:04,741
She's running late.

952
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:05,714
Is someone else coming?

953
00:46:05,803 --> 00:46:08,983
My sister is getting off work early,
so she's coming to see you.

954
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:11,293
I'm getting nervous again.

955
00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:14,711
-Sorry, I'm late.
-It's okay.

956
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:16,342
Jungi, say hello.

957
00:46:16,434 --> 00:46:18,201
This is my little sister Jimin.

958
00:46:18,304 --> 00:46:20,175
I'm Lee Jungi.

959
00:46:26,974 --> 00:46:28,843
I'll be waxing you today.

960
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,560
Why?

961
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:34,642
What's wrong? Do you know each other?

962
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:36,588
Actually...

963
00:46:38,022 --> 00:46:40,270
What is it? Tell me.

964
00:46:41,153 --> 00:46:43,681
You guys didn't date each other, right?

965
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:44,456
No, no.

966
00:46:44,545 --> 00:46:45,990
No, no, no.

967
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,414
No, no.

968
00:46:47,503 --> 00:46:49,068
-No.
-Then, what is it?

969
00:46:49,175 --> 00:46:51,120
What is it? Jimin, tell me.

970
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:53,450
Actually...

971
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:57,354
Your boyfriend came to my shop yesterday.

972
00:46:58,228 --> 00:46:59,326
He went to your shop?

973
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:01,649
Jungi, did you get waxed?

974
00:47:03,443 --> 00:47:06,445
B-Because of...
the part that I'm playing...

975
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:09,201
-F-For work!
-I see.

976
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:11,935
It's fine as long as
you didn't wax him yourself.

977
00:47:16,693 --> 00:47:17,693
What?

978
00:47:18,621 --> 00:47:19,621
Did you...

979
00:47:20,468 --> 00:47:22,806
You waxed him?

980
00:47:24,734 --> 00:47:26,767
We don't have any male waxers.

981
00:47:26,953 --> 00:47:29,268
Jisu, it's not weird at all.

982
00:47:29,357 --> 00:47:30,325
It's my job.

983
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:31,580
-Work.
-Work.

984
00:47:31,669 --> 00:47:32,912
-Work.
-Work.

985
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,308
Work.

986
00:47:35,365 --> 00:47:36,365
Jisu!

987
00:47:37,374 --> 00:47:38,563
Jisu!

988
00:47:38,652 --> 00:47:40,897
Jisu, wait. Wait.

989
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,299
Jisu, I'm sorry.

990
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:47,281
How could I have known
that she was your sister?

991
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,871
I had to do it for my movie.

992
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,045
We haven't even held hands yet.

993
00:47:52,311 --> 00:47:53,777
But my sister saw your...

994
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:56,255
-She saw everything.
-Everything...?

995
00:48:00,136 --> 00:48:01,193
That's...

996
00:48:01,904 --> 00:48:04,045
It's her job.

997
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:05,355
Why?

998
00:48:05,965 --> 00:48:06,965
Fine.

999
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:08,892
But I feel uncomfortable.

1000
00:48:09,808 --> 00:48:11,197
I'll just go home.

1001
00:48:11,286 --> 00:48:13,223
Jisu... Jisu...

1002
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,540
Jisu!

1003
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:16,850
This is unbelievable.

1004
00:48:16,934 --> 00:48:19,802
Why did she have to be Jisu's sister?!
Why? Why? Why?!

1005
00:48:20,049 --> 00:48:21,049
Darn it.

1006
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,011
Are you ready?

1007
00:48:28,231 --> 00:48:29,065
Yeah.

1008
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:31,531
You haven't done this in a while.
You sure you can do this?

1009
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,321
It's me, Kang Donggu.

1010
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:34,384
You know how good I am.

1011
00:48:34,467 --> 00:48:36,435
Then you should be working
in the film industry.

1012
00:48:36,524 --> 00:48:38,267
Why are you here?

1013
00:48:39,676 --> 00:48:41,230
Have you given up on making films too?

1014
00:48:41,343 --> 00:48:43,159
No, I'll go back soon.

1015
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:45,399
But I need money to do that.

1016
00:48:45,488 --> 00:48:47,660
Yeah, don't give up like me.

1017
00:48:47,749 --> 00:48:49,632
Pursue your dream.

1018
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,279
I will. Thanks.

1019
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,834
Minseo, stop crying.

1020
00:48:54,925 --> 00:48:56,673
It's almost time to start the party.

1021
00:48:57,057 --> 00:48:57,869
Excuse me.

1022
00:48:57,953 --> 00:48:59,157
Aren't you going to do something?

1023
00:48:59,246 --> 00:49:01,051
-He's even crying like this.
-What?

1024
00:49:01,293 --> 00:49:02,388
What do you want me to do?

1025
00:49:02,477 --> 00:49:05,203
Other photographers tried
to make him laugh.

1026
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:06,568
Do something.

1027
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,590
Make him laugh?

1028
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,528
-I'm not a comedian.
-Oh my god.

1029
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:12,503
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1030
00:49:12,592 --> 00:49:15,402
It's his first day. My apologies.

1031
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:16,630
One moment please.

1032
00:49:18,448 --> 00:49:20,478
Donggu, what the hell are you doing?

1033
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:22,592
What can I do about the baby crying?

1034
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,971
You have to be better at making
babies laugh than taking videos.

1035
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:27,059
Watch.

1036
00:49:29,515 --> 00:49:30,904
Hi, Minseo.

1037
00:49:31,463 --> 00:49:33,009
Look at me.

1038
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,344
Your son is really adorable.

1039
00:49:51,496 --> 00:49:52,805
Did you see that?

1040
00:49:52,894 --> 00:49:54,397
This is how you do it.

1041
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:55,532
Try it.

1042
00:49:55,669 --> 00:49:57,555
-You want me to do it?
-Come on, man.

1043
00:49:57,644 --> 00:49:59,341
It's not easy to make money.

1044
00:49:59,985 --> 00:50:00,861
If you don't want to do it, just quit.

1045
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,845
-Go home.
-No.

1046
00:50:03,324 --> 00:50:04,416
No, I'll do it.

1047
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:05,708
Do it properly.

1048
00:50:28,754 --> 00:50:31,167
Seojin, can I use your laptop?

1049
00:50:31,407 --> 00:50:32,278
Why?

1050
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:34,747
I have to submit an application online.

1051
00:50:34,913 --> 00:50:36,182
Apply to what?

1052
00:50:37,085 --> 00:50:38,575
I'm auditioning for Show Me the Money.

1053
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:40,830
What? Show Me the Money?

1054
00:50:40,919 --> 00:50:43,383
I want to hear what professional rappers
think of my rap.

1055
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:48,111
Yuna, I think it's a rash decision.

1056
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,203
I know.

1057
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:51,900
I know that my rapping skills
aren't as good as the professionals.

1058
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:54,878
But I think I can reach that level.

1059
00:50:56,576 --> 00:50:58,039
Listen, Yuna.

1060
00:50:58,758 --> 00:51:01,097
I didn't say it because I didn't
want to hurt your feelings, but...

1061
00:51:01,473 --> 00:51:02,566
You're a terrible rapper.

1062
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:03,976
What do you mean?

1063
00:51:04,065 --> 00:51:06,069
It's a complete mess.

1064
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:08,974
My rap is that bad?

1065
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:11,952
Honestly, anyone can rap like you.

1066
00:51:12,312 --> 00:51:13,312
Even I can do it.

1067
00:51:13,634 --> 00:51:14,634
I see.

1068
00:51:16,137 --> 00:51:17,403
I see...

1069
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:20,019
Why didn't you tell me?

1070
00:51:20,128 --> 00:51:21,537
I'm sorry.

1071
00:51:22,757 --> 00:51:26,322
-I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
-No, it's okay.

1072
00:51:27,271 --> 00:51:28,271
Forget about it.

1073
00:51:35,354 --> 00:51:36,811
Was I too harsh?

1074
00:51:37,266 --> 00:51:39,778
Why did I encourage her
in the first place?

1075
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:41,397
I don't know.

1076
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:46,155
The noodles are soggy now.

1077
00:51:46,244 --> 00:51:48,378
-I'm hungry.
-Hey.

1078
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:50,512
What happened with you?

1079
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,889
Don't ask.

1080
00:51:52,793 --> 00:51:54,507
-Did you just make that ramyeon?
-Yeah.

1081
00:51:55,018 --> 00:51:56,219
Can I get one bite?

1082
00:52:00,154 --> 00:52:03,105
No. Make your own ramyeon.

1083
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:05,794
Didn't you have lunch
with your girlfriend's mother?

1084
00:52:05,883 --> 00:52:07,537
Something happened
so I couldn't eat anything.

1085
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,304
Just one bite. Give it to me.

1086
00:52:10,935 --> 00:52:12,690
I said no! Make your own ramyeon.

1087
00:52:12,779 --> 00:52:14,182
You're so cheap.

1088
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,972
Let me have some.

1089
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:17,273
Let go.

1090
00:52:20,177 --> 00:52:21,644
You're so strong. Do you lift weights?

1091
00:52:22,888 --> 00:52:25,081
-Come on.
-It's mine.

1092
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:30,133
You spilled ramyeon on me.

1093
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:31,232
Ouch. What the hell?

1094
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:33,251
It's soaking in.

1095
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:45,664
"Emergency Medical Center"

1096
00:52:45,753 --> 00:52:47,294
-Kang Seojin!
-I'm sorry!

1097
00:52:47,382 --> 00:52:48,942
-Kang Seojin!
-I'm sorry!

1098
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:50,732
Is this the end of my manhood?

1099
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,141
Doctor! I'm doomed!

1100
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,899
Lee Jungi is finished!

1101
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,846
Kang Seojin!

1102
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:00,406
Kang Seojin, you...

1103
00:53:01,855 --> 00:53:04,700
What are you waiting for?
Doctor, please do something.

1104
00:53:04,803 --> 00:53:05,712
I'm sorry.

1105
00:53:05,801 --> 00:53:08,076
Please call the professor one more time.

1106
00:53:08,164 --> 00:53:09,926
She's on her way down.

1107
00:53:11,075 --> 00:53:14,066
I just got out of a surgery.
What is this about?

1108
00:53:14,154 --> 00:53:15,181
The thing is...

1109
00:53:15,269 --> 00:53:18,458
The intern doctor is too embarrassed
to see the patient.

1110
00:53:19,024 --> 00:53:20,503
You call yourself a doctor?

1111
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:22,988
Come and speak to me later.

1112
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:26,142
What is the problem?

1113
00:53:28,076 --> 00:53:30,097
-Jungi?
-Who are you?

1114
00:53:32,516 --> 00:53:34,150
It's me. Jisu's mom.

1115
00:53:34,246 --> 00:53:35,288
Mom, do something...

1116
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:36,474
Oh my god!

1117
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:40,798
Oh, ma'am...

1118
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:42,966
How come you're here?

1119
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:44,600
I'm a doctor at this hospital.

1120
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:47,121
What happened to you?

1121
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:49,198
He spilled hot ramyeon on himself.

1122
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:51,891
Poor thing.

1123
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,742
Let's have a look.

1124
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:55,238
No. Ma'am.

1125
00:53:56,136 --> 00:53:58,007
No, no. I'm fine.

1126
00:53:58,192 --> 00:54:00,320
I'm really fine. I have to go now.

1127
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:01,979
I'll go home now, Ma'am.

1128
00:54:03,235 --> 00:54:06,272
You're not fine.
You can't go anywhere in this state.

1129
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:07,472
No. Ma'am. Don't.

1130
00:54:07,681 --> 00:54:09,285
I'm really okay.

1131
00:54:09,991 --> 00:54:13,857
Jungi, I'm a doctor
before I'm Jisu's mother.

1132
00:54:13,991 --> 00:54:15,602
-Nurse Kim, grab the patient.
-Yes.

1133
00:54:15,691 --> 00:54:17,434
Grab me? Why?

1134
00:54:17,914 --> 00:54:18,914
Why?

1135
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:20,663
Hold still.

1136
00:54:22,464 --> 00:54:24,100
Ma'am! Ma'am!

1137
00:54:24,188 --> 00:54:25,072
No, no!

1138
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,770
-No, ma'am!
-Hold still.

1139
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:28,176
Don't do it. No.

1140
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,423
No! Don't look!

1141
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:31,774
Don't look!

1142
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:52,428
What... What is this?

1143
00:54:55,268 --> 00:54:56,271
Goodness...

1144
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,970
No wonder.

1145
00:55:07,059 --> 00:55:10,331
You don't usually get that burned
from spilling ramyeon on yourself.

1146
00:55:10,486 --> 00:55:12,248
So that was the reason.

1147
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:13,435
Yes.

1148
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:16,439
The treatment went well.
You can go home.

1149
00:55:16,528 --> 00:55:17,605
Thank you...

1150
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:19,239
...Ma'am...

1151
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:25,002
Jungi.

1152
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:28,527
Jisu.

1153
00:55:29,142 --> 00:55:30,545
H-H-Hi.

1154
00:55:30,634 --> 00:55:33,401
I have to do rounds. Excuse me.

1155
00:55:34,058 --> 00:55:36,239
I'll be outside, Jungi.

1156
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:41,303
Jisu...

1157
00:55:41,392 --> 00:55:42,445
Jungi.

1158
00:55:42,949 --> 00:55:44,547
Why are you doing this to me?

1159
00:55:44,811 --> 00:55:46,782
You get waxed by my sister,

1160
00:55:46,871 --> 00:55:48,300
and now my mother...!

1161
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:50,953
Are you planning to show it
to everyone in my family except me?

1162
00:55:51,325 --> 00:55:54,159
How can I face my sister and my mom now?

1163
00:55:54,248 --> 00:55:56,420
-Jisu...
-Forget it.

1164
00:55:56,509 --> 00:55:57,840
I don't want to hear it anymore.

1165
00:55:57,929 --> 00:55:59,428
Let's break up, Jungi.

1166
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:03,534
-What are you talking about?
-Sorry.

1167
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:05,434
I can't handle this.

1168
00:56:06,265 --> 00:56:07,652
Goodbye, Jungi.

1169
00:56:08,286 --> 00:56:10,712
No, wait. Jisu!

1170
00:56:10,885 --> 00:56:11,885
Jisu!

1171
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:15,311
Jisu!

1172
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,400
Jisu!

1173
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:20,880
Breathe. Jisu!

1174
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:24,056
Jisu! Let me explain...

1175
00:56:24,154 --> 00:56:25,503
Jisu!

1176
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:27,423
Jisu!

1177
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:39,630
♪ There are three bears in a house

1178
00:56:39,718 --> 00:56:41,718
♪ Daddy bear, Mommy bear

1179
00:56:42,287 --> 00:56:43,506
♪ And baby bear

1180
00:56:46,511 --> 00:56:47,910
What are you doing?

1181
00:56:47,999 --> 00:56:49,292
He's crying even more.

1182
00:56:49,381 --> 00:56:51,946
-Don't you have anything else?
-Let me try again.

1183
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:21,756
Minseo.

1184
00:57:21,845 --> 00:57:24,288
Thank you for being our son.

1185
00:57:24,394 --> 00:57:27,415
Happy first birthday
and we love you forever.

1186
00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:51,047
So, you did that until your forehead
started bleeding?

1187
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:57,319
That was the only way to make him laugh.

1188
00:57:58,028 --> 00:58:00,516
It's so hard to earn money.

1189
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,706
It's so hard.

1190
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:03,938
Jisu.

1191
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,896
Jisu, please listen to me.

1192
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:07,754
Jisu, please don't hang up.

1193
00:58:07,842 --> 00:58:09,965
I didn't do it on purpose.

1194
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:12,528
Please let me explain. Jisu!

1195
00:58:15,209 --> 00:58:16,866
Why? She really wants to break up?

1196
00:58:18,747 --> 00:58:20,797
You shouldn't have waxed.

1197
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:24,574
I have to do whatever the director says.

1198
00:58:24,962 --> 00:58:26,926
You'll meet someone else.

1199
00:58:27,229 --> 00:58:28,229
Cheer up.

1200
00:58:29,603 --> 00:58:31,490
I'm sad about breakup with Jisu,

1201
00:58:31,628 --> 00:58:36,595
and on top of that, I'm worried
that I'll never get my break as an actor.

1202
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:38,741
Don't say that.

1203
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,268
It took Hwang Jeongmin 10 years
to become a known actor,

1204
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,634
and it took Kwak Dowon 20 years.

1205
00:58:45,707 --> 00:58:46,707
So what?

1206
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:48,680
Are you saying it'll take me 20 years too?

1207
00:58:48,768 --> 00:58:52,759
I'm saying that if you keep working hard,
you can become famous like them.

1208
00:58:53,049 --> 00:58:55,835
You're a troublemaker
but you're a good actor.

1209
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:59,330
I am a pretty good actor.

1210
00:58:59,898 --> 00:59:01,165
Everyone knows that.

1211
00:59:02,112 --> 00:59:03,173
Yeah.

1212
00:59:03,615 --> 00:59:05,014
Let's cheer up.

1213
00:59:05,601 --> 00:59:08,607
The sun will shine on us one day.

1214
00:59:08,696 --> 00:59:10,286
Of course it will.

1215
00:59:10,646 --> 00:59:13,652
Let's eat to cheer ourselves up.

1216
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,178
I'm starving.

1217
00:59:15,267 --> 00:59:16,631
-I'm hungry.
-You're always hungry.

1218
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,219
When are you not hungry?

1219
00:59:18,307 --> 00:59:19,695
Tell me.

1220
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:21,329
Muffins!

1221
00:59:23,535 --> 00:59:25,740
This is all you get for dinner.

1222
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:29,337
I didn't feel like going grocery shopping,
so I just made these.

1223
00:59:29,426 --> 00:59:30,426
Yuna.

1224
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,393
Are you still angry?

1225
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:34,341
No, I'm not angry.

1226
00:59:34,429 --> 00:59:37,069
I feel great. I'm on cloud nine.

1227
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:38,774
I see.

1228
00:59:38,936 --> 00:59:40,038
You're clearly not angry...

1229
00:59:40,127 --> 00:59:41,317
You're not angry.

1230
00:59:47,664 --> 00:59:49,692
-Did you bake these?
-Why?

1231
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,044
Can you bake too?

1232
00:59:52,815 --> 00:59:54,790
Can everyone bake as well as me?

1233
00:59:54,878 --> 00:59:57,166
No, I'm saying these are really good.

1234
00:59:57,386 --> 00:59:58,556
Guys, try one.

1235
00:59:58,645 --> 00:59:59,657
Go ahead.

1236
00:59:59,879 --> 01:00:01,604
-Should I?
-Let me take one.

1237
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,262
It's good.

1238
01:00:09,351 --> 01:00:11,380
You made these?

1239
01:00:11,582 --> 01:00:14,569
-This is better than bakery stuff.
-Yes. Yes.

1240
01:00:14,658 --> 01:00:15,976
Really?

1241
01:00:16,065 --> 01:00:17,192
I told you so.

1242
01:00:17,502 --> 01:00:21,654
Why don't you become a pastry chef.
Instead of a rapper?

1243
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:22,870
A pastry chef?

1244
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:26,395
Actually, my second dream
is to become a pastry chef.

1245
01:00:26,484 --> 01:00:28,823
Really? Then you should become
a pastry chef.

1246
01:00:28,922 --> 01:00:29,922
Should I?

1247
01:00:30,067 --> 01:00:33,035
-I still want to pursue rapping.
-Yuna.

1248
01:00:33,116 --> 01:00:35,298
I was only joking.

1249
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,002
-Is it really that good?
-Yes.

1250
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,036
You should be a pastry chef.

1251
01:00:39,124 --> 01:00:40,303
It's pretty good.

1252
01:00:40,414 --> 01:00:42,428
-Really?
-Yuna, you have a talent.

1253
01:00:42,516 --> 01:00:43,516
Is it good?

1254
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:50,957
So smooth.

1255
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:52,728
Very good.

1256
01:00:53,152 --> 01:00:54,422
You look like a real swimmer.

1257
01:00:57,568 --> 01:00:59,981
Nice. Very nice.

1258
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:04,664
Now you look like a real swimmer
now that you've waxed everything off.

1259
01:01:04,752 --> 01:01:05,656
Thank you.

1260
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:07,284
I will do my best!

1261
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:11,281
What? You waxed your arm pit hair too?

1262
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:13,635
Well done.

1263
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:14,833
Next!

1264
01:01:15,556 --> 01:01:16,556
Yes!

1265
01:01:17,045 --> 01:01:18,131
Wow.

1266
01:01:20,393 --> 01:01:23,932
-You shaved off your head too?
-Yes, sir.

1267
01:01:25,743 --> 01:01:28,491
I don't need hair
if I can look like a real swimmer.

1268
01:01:29,088 --> 01:01:29,921
Excellent.

1269
01:01:30,056 --> 01:01:31,162
Very good.

1270
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,351
This is an actor.

1271
01:01:33,434 --> 01:01:35,035
Suhyeon is here.

1272
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,560
-He's here?
-Yes.

1273
01:01:37,816 --> 01:01:38,850
It's cold.

1274
01:01:38,972 --> 01:01:40,808
It's really cold. Let's start quickly.

1275
01:01:41,345 --> 01:01:43,326
Suhyeon, you didn't wax?

1276
01:01:43,484 --> 01:01:45,700
No, because I get cold easily.

1277
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:47,474
I'll get cold without hair.

1278
01:01:47,563 --> 01:01:51,818
But you need to look like a swimmer
in a movie about swimmers.

1279
01:01:51,907 --> 01:01:52,907
Look.

1280
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:56,552
I'm an actor that plays a swimmer.
I'm not an actually swimmer.

1281
01:01:56,641 --> 01:01:58,105
If you need me to shave,

1282
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,821
you can cast someone else.

1283
01:02:00,226 --> 01:02:01,553
No, no.

1284
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:04,044
Hair isn't important.

1285
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:05,487
Let's start rolling.

1286
01:02:05,576 --> 01:02:07,988
Why are they so smooth?

1287
01:02:08,132 --> 01:02:09,764
They make me look weird.

1288
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:11,616
People are going to criticize me for it.

1289
01:02:11,705 --> 01:02:13,159
I can't shoot a movie like this.

1290
01:02:13,936 --> 01:02:15,170
You're right.

1291
01:02:15,259 --> 01:02:16,625
What should we do?

1292
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:19,862
We'll shoot the cheering scene.

1293
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:22,382
Full of emotions!

1294
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,514
Got it?

1295
01:02:23,682 --> 01:02:24,829
-Yes.
-Yes.

1296
01:02:24,918 --> 01:02:25,918
Ready...

1297
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:28,177
Action!

1298
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:30,912
You can do it!

1299
01:02:34,138 --> 01:02:35,701
You can do it!

1300
01:02:36,328 --> 01:02:38,637
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

1301
01:02:42,858 --> 01:02:44,858
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

1302
01:02:49,202 --> 01:02:50,435
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

1303
01:03:18,868 --> 01:03:21,982
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1304
01:03:22,071 --> 01:03:23,491
Something amazing happened.

1305
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:25,811
I got a part in a movie!

1306
01:03:25,899 --> 01:03:26,750
Guess who plays the main role.

1307
01:03:26,834 --> 01:03:28,934
It's Kim Heeja! Kim Heeja!

1308
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:32,371
I hate people who use
their connections to get jobs.

1309
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,288
It's only a rehearsal.

1310
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:35,376
What? A rehearsal?

1311
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:37,678
I told her to tone it down.

1312
01:03:37,766 --> 01:03:39,094
Hospitalized for four weeks.

1313
01:03:39,183 --> 01:03:41,381
Why did you do that
at someone else's party?

1314
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:43,404
What if the guests see you?

1315
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:44,735
Janggun!

1316
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,601
What am I going to do?

1317
01:03:46,769 --> 01:03:48,949
I passed the interview.

1318
01:03:49,038 --> 01:03:50,411
My interview style is quite unique.

1319
01:03:50,546 --> 01:03:51,546
Do you have a boyfriend?

1320
01:03:51,634 --> 01:03:53,603
I like the glamorous style.

1321
01:03:54,753 --> 01:03:58,411
If you want to drink that badly,
have a drink with your sister.

1322
01:03:58,536 --> 01:03:59,735
Are you crazy?

1323
01:03:59,824 --> 01:04:01,910
Take your hand off of me.
I won't ask again nicely.

1324
01:04:03,247 --> 01:04:06,526
It's you, Yuna.

1325
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:09,001
What happened
between you and Seol's father?

1326
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:11,319
Her life is unbelievably dramatic.

1327
01:04:11,407 --> 01:04:12,679
Let's look for Seol's father.

1328
01:04:12,767 --> 01:04:14,631
I came to see Han Yuna.

1329
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,658
Junseong? How did you find me?
