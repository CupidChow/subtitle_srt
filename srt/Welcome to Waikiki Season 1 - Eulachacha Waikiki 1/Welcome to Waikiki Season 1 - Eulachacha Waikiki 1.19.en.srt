1
00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:05,601
I'm sorry, Seojin.
But it's really the only chance for me.

2
00:00:05,998 --> 00:00:08,497
So, please just once more.
Can you understand me?

3
00:00:09,606 --> 00:00:10,704
Alright.

4
00:00:10,806 --> 00:00:12,894
Really? Really?

5
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:14,890
But, are you angry?

6
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,897
No, I'm not.

7
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:17,890
Really?

8
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:19,287
You're really fine?

9
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:21,021
Yes, I'm fine.

10
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:24,314
God, thank you, Seojin. Thank you.

11
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,211
See you at home.

12
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:33,735
It's fine.

13
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:37,129
Really...

14
00:00:38,924 --> 00:00:40,520
Really fine.

15
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:45,941
What? You will sign with YS?

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,227
Yes!

17
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:48,632
Wow, that's really good for you.

18
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:51,330
Many famous celebrities are
there and it's big company.

19
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:55,140
They are now realizing
the value of Lee Jungi.

20
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:57,243
Wow, really.

21
00:00:58,614 --> 00:00:59,887
Oh, right. Seojin.

22
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:03,093
I'm really sorry for today.

23
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:06,284
It's fine. It's was because of your work.

24
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,010
You suffered as you didn't have an agency.
Congratulations.

25
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:11,216
Thank you.

26
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:14,915
Then, Jungi. Are you going to be famous?

27
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:17,969
Well, should I get your autograph already?

28
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:21,668
Actually I made a new signature today.
Do you want?

29
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:22,865
Sure.

30
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:24,369
Okay.

31
00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:27,150
Well, then. Lee Jungi's first autograph.

32
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:29,150
I'll show you my skill.

33
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:38,172
Lee...

34
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:45,024
Lee...

35
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:51,406
Lee...

36
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,249
Lee...

37
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:05,606
Lee...

38
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:07,098
I dozed off.

39
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:11,597
Jungi, are you done?

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,304
You need to wait a bit more.

41
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:14,988
Then, I will go in first.

42
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:18,488
I need to study for my baking license.

43
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:19,877
Really?

44
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:23,267
Then I will give it to you when I'm done.

45
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:24,069
Alright.

46
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:27,593
Now, I'm done with Lee. So...

47
00:02:28,494 --> 00:02:34,847
Jun...

48
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:41,546
Jun...

49
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:48,446
Jun...

50
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:51,439
Yes, father.

51
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:54,731
I'm on my way to sign the contract.

52
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:56,635
Don't worry.

53
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,341
I've already looked thoroughly.

54
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:02,238
Yes, I will call you when I'm done.

55
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,222
Yes.

56
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:06,626
-What did he say? Does he like it?
-Yes.

57
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,332
He doesn't express it
but I can feel he likes it.

58
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:12,598
God, I never knew this day would come.

59
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,702
You life will completely change
now, right?

60
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:16,193
That's what I think too.

61
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,884
I went through so much
during my 10 years of acting career.

62
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:21,941
Well, you did suffer a lot.

63
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,727
Will you read you line like that!

64
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,036
You jerk!

65
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,630
God, even thinking
about it makes me suffer.

66
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:35,519
-I'll go now.
-Alright.

67
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:42,732
Boy, Sua gave me all the work
and where is she now? What's she doing?

68
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:45,748
Dusik! Dusik!

69
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:49,352
-Look at this.
-What's all the fuss about?

70
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,848
-What's that?
-I designed this!

71
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,551
Buying clothes from Dong Dae Moon...

72
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,043
...and selling them won't be enough
for Soorgio Armani.

73
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:59,308
So you want to sell your own designs?

74
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,999
Yes. Do you want to see?

75
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:03,102
Tada.

76
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:09,483
Soorgio Armani, 2018 S/S,
vintage collection, ultra v-neck sweater.

77
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:10,765
-What do you think?
-Well...

78
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:13,971
But why is the chest line so deep?

79
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:18,092
General v-neck is too
ordinary, and not sexy.

80
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:24,113
This one comes down all the way down
to belly button emphasizing sexiness.

81
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:26,035
What do you think? Isn't it cool?

82
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:30,432
It looks fine, but isn't this too much?

83
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:35,033
It's alright.
Nowadays this extreme fashion is popular.

84
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,438
What are you doing? Wear it.

85
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:41,583
What? I need to wear this?

86
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,075
-Why?
-You are the model.

87
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,678
We need photos to upload on our shop.

88
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:47,686
What? Me? Why? Where? What? How? Why?

89
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:50,769
Your boss is telling you to do so.
Just follow me!

90
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:53,682
Why are you making me do this?
I'm busy. You mean boss!

91
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,961
-Just follow me.
-Why! My belly button will be exposed.

92
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,047
What do you think? Do you like it?

93
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:07,833
Yes, it's great.

94
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:10,099
Well, then let's sign.

95
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:12,214
Shall we?

96
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:23,231
Lee...

97
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:34,919
-Not done?
-Jun...

98
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:41,012
It's Gi!

99
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:44,317
Yes, I'm done.

100
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:45,408
Is it?

101
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:48,222
Well, then let's do our best together.

102
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:50,466
Sure. I'll do my best.

103
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,180
"As a result..."

104
00:05:55,367 --> 00:06:02,350
"Baby tiger and daddy tiger
lived happily ever after."

105
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:03,936
The end!

106
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,670
Seol, what is the point of this story?

107
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:13,075
The point of this story is dad. Dad.

108
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:15,782
So, say dad once. Please?

109
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:19,458
You really don't give me what I want.

110
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:22,069
Seol, dad.

111
00:06:22,156 --> 00:06:23,363
Say it. Quick.

112
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,156
Hey, just once please.

113
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:27,468
Please? Dad. Say it.

114
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,464
What are you doing?

115
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,861
Just reading story book to Seol.

116
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:39,002
What is that? Looks so cool and homeless.

117
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,510
What? Cool homeless?

118
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:45,572
Your cloth is way too cool.
Where did you buy that?

119
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:49,175
I didn't buy! Sua designed it.

120
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,588
What? Sua designs clothes?

121
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:55,769
Yes, she does. What's more is that
she wants me to wear it to advertise.

122
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:59,483
God, Min Sua isn't normal.

123
00:07:00,372 --> 00:07:01,570
-I'm back.
-Oh, you're here.

124
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,521
You're here. Did it go well?

125
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:05,116
Yes, it went well...

126
00:07:07,214 --> 00:07:09,227
Hey what's this cool and homeless look?

127
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,017
Sua designed it. It's so funny, right?

128
00:07:13,203 --> 00:07:16,207
It is. I can see your belly button.

129
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:18,302
What's that, an open mind?

130
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:26,033
What was that? Why did you stop talking?

131
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:27,827
Were you guys trash talking about me?

132
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:32,649
No, we were complementing
about this top.

133
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:34,236
Right.

134
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:37,839
It's really pretty,
it's making Dusik look handsome.

135
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,847
Really? Is it that good?

136
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,339
-What?
-What?

137
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:45,839
You were making fun of me,
you deserve this.

138
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:48,340
Shut up!

139
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:50,149
What is this? What?

140
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:54,075
Why? You guys are like cool homeless trio.

141
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:56,083
-Right, Yuna?
-Yes.

142
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:59,577
You look really cool and sexy, Donggu.

143
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:04,108
Yuna, don't do that.
It's embarrassing. What is this!

144
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:06,918
But why is Sua designing all of a sudden?

145
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,230
I don't know. She's so passionate.
I can't tell her it's weird.

146
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:12,722
God, what should I do.

147
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:16,554
But that's too much.
What is this? Right, Yuna?

148
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,942
Well, it's a bit shocking.

149
00:08:21,262 --> 00:08:22,768
Well, all of you were he...

150
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,070
What is it?

151
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:26,872
What's going on?

152
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:29,563
Were you talking bad about me? Is it?

153
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,558
No, your design is really good.

154
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:34,377
So we were complementing it.
Complementing.

155
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:38,439
Yes, how can this top be so luxurious?
It's so pretty.

156
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,801
Really? Is my design that good?

157
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:46,389
What is this?

158
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:47,691
Why are these sleeves...

159
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,589
...so long?

160
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:56,096
That's Soorgio Armani,
2018 S.S cutey collection.

161
00:08:56,211 --> 00:09:01,104
Bong San number 5. I was inspired
by Bong San dance and made this hoody.

162
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:03,694
I see.

163
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:07,685
But isn't this too long?

164
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:10,668
That's the point.

165
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:13,774
Normal hoody is too
simple and not fun at all.

166
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:19,146
So I made the sleeves extremely
long to point out cuteness.

167
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,852
What do you think?
It's so cute, right? Right?

168
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,549
Yes, it is. Thanks, Sua.

169
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:29,854
You're welcome. But you need to wear it
everyday and promote it. Alright?

170
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,052
-Sure.
-Alright.

171
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,092
-Yes.
-Of course.

172
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:35,893
Hello?

173
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:37,481
Yes, sir.

174
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:38,790
Pardon?

175
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:40,585
Me?

176
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:44,391
Yes. Alright.

177
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:46,693
Why? What was that?

178
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,653
It's my CEO.

179
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:53,161
Mr. Choi Minsik got flu so he can't throw
the first pitch for pro-baseball game.

180
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:56,541
So he wants me to do it.

181
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,515
What? You? First pitch?

182
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,836
-For pro-baseball game?
-Yes.

183
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:05,655
Wow, congratulations.
Only famous people do that.

184
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,641
You're right.

185
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:09,641
I have an agency now and this things happen.

186
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,847
-First pitch.
-That's huge.

187
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,462
Congratulations.

188
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:17,446
Sungso's 360 degrees pitch and...

189
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:20,232
...Shin Suji's rotation pitch went viral.

190
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:24,817
After their extraordinary pitch,
their likeability increased by 13 times.

191
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:27,928
Their popularity increased 20 times more.

192
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:29,634
Really?

193
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:33,528
It's just throwing first pitch.
Why is everyone here for this meeting?

194
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:36,668
Guess having a big agency
is really different.

195
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,720
Pitch that is extraordinary
and something new.

196
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:40,934
Do you have some ideas?

197
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:44,336
Lee Jungi is an anchor in his drama.

198
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:50,123
Dress like anchor Son Seok Hee and throw
a ball that looks like a microphone.

199
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:53,226
Well, that's a bit dull. Any other ideas?

200
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,940
No?

201
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,038
There're so many people here. No idea?

202
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:04,898
Yes, honey.

203
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:06,588
Pardon?

204
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,294
You want to learn pole dance?

205
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:15,145
Yes. If you want you should. Sure.

206
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:17,827
Hold on.

207
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,224
Pole dance?

208
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:28,327
So you mean...

209
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:32,224
You want me to learn pole dance here?

210
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:35,636
CEO doesn't want anyone to know.

211
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:37,033
Secret is the key.

212
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:39,537
But don't you think
pole dance pitch is weird?

213
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:43,053
Who does that? Does this even make sense?

214
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:45,656
What should we do, it's CEO's idea.

215
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,063
God, this is crazy.

216
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:50,160
Now, shall we start?

217
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,366
I will show you first, you can follow me.

218
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,385
Sure.

219
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:05,426
What do you think? It's easy, right?

220
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:08,918
No, I think I can't do it. Bye.

221
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:12,420
No, you can do it if you practice.

222
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:14,608
First, let's start with hanging.

223
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:16,005
Hanging?

224
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:22,546
Don't play with me.

225
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:24,451
Put more power to your arm. Again!

226
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:28,997
It's so hot, hot.

227
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:29,982
Again.

228
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:32,585
Again.

229
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,874
Teacher! Help me!

230
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,562
Help me, teacher!

231
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:42,165
Gosh, it's killing me.

232
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:43,561
Gee...

233
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,367
I fought with that bar the whole day.
My whole body is in pain.

234
00:12:47,457 --> 00:12:49,276
Do you really need to do this?

235
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:52,153
What can I do. It's my boss's idea.

236
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:54,161
I'm just worried you might get hurt.

237
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:55,557
It's ok.

238
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:57,665
It's a good chance for me.

239
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:03,251
I'll do my best to succeed.

240
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:07,456
And do everything I can do for you, Bacca.
I will do that!

241
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,640
My, my. You're going to make me cry.

242
00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:13,344
But, Bacca.

243
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:16,043
I don't think this patch is enough.

244
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:18,149
I need something different.

245
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:19,057
What?

246
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,255
My god, you!

247
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:25,248
Why did you hit me!

248
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:28,145
If you want to hit me,
hit me with your lips. Huh?

249
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:31,429
-Forget it.
-What forget it.

250
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,430
There's only a few orders nowadays.

251
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:41,203
Look at this, look.
I knew that nobody would order it.

252
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:43,807
I'm just scared someone I know might see.

253
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:46,599
I need to ask Sua
to take the photo down.

254
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,792
Sua. You know...

255
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:55,398
Hey.

256
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:58,091
Guess you are really serious about this.

257
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,296
Why is she sleeping like this?

258
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,076
Gosh, smelly!

259
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:08,878
What did she eat?

260
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:11,172
-Gee!
-What?

261
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,474
Hey.

262
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,378
-What? What are you doing, Dusik?
-Nothing. Why?!

263
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,172
What is it? Why are you laughing?

264
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:23,886
Well, actually...

265
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:26,909
I dreamt of farting.

266
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,556
It was so real.

267
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:36,463
It must have been. It must have.

268
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:40,886
Director Bong, is there any orders
for my designed clothes?

269
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:43,187
Well, no. Not yet.

270
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,687
I see.

271
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:49,882
Why is no one buying it? Is my design bad?

272
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,985
Well, it's not advertised well.

273
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:55,190
Cheer up.

274
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:56,397
Right?

275
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,286
Then should I advertise it?

276
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:01,785
I have an idea.

277
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,750
Hello, it's Soorgio Armani's new product.
Ultra v-neck sweater.

278
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:17,345
Please have a look.

279
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,355
"2018 S/S. Vintage collection."

280
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,448
Please have a look. It's so pretty.

281
00:15:20,543 --> 00:15:25,537
So great. Sexy.
Ladies, come and have a look.

282
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:27,236
Yes, thank you.

283
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,838
Have a look at this.

284
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,513
Hey.

285
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:36,113
Thank you so much.
It's Soorgia Armani mall.

286
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:42,903
Min Sua. You're really too much.
This is really too much. So embarrassing.

287
00:15:47,397 --> 00:15:48,493
Wow.

288
00:15:50,998 --> 00:15:52,799
Wow, you are good now.

289
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:56,298
Right? Right? I practiced it
whole night and now I can do it.

290
00:15:56,813 --> 00:16:00,803
But, I'm not sure
whether I can throw the ball too.

291
00:16:00,904 --> 00:16:04,002
Really? Do you want some help?
It's my day off.

292
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:07,240
Really? That would be great.

293
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,722
You're an angel.

294
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:13,717
Let's go to the playground
and play with mommy, alright?

295
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:31,033
Taerin, let's go to another playground.

296
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,579
-Now, Jungi.
-Yes?

297
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:44,284
Shall we start?

298
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:47,078
Are you sure about this?

299
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:48,879
You never played baseball before.

300
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:51,061
Don't worry. I will get the hang of it.

301
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:52,371
Throw it.

302
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,069
Sure? Then I will throw now.

303
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:01,844
Seojin!

304
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:05,518
Seojin, are you ok?

305
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:09,424
I'm fine. Fine. Do it again. Do it!

306
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,698
I will do it again then. Sorry.

307
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:13,619
-Sure.
-I'm sorry.

308
00:17:20,654 --> 00:17:21,758
Hold on!

309
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:28,352
-I'm sorry.
-You're doing great.

310
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:58,855
Designing isn't so easy.

311
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,670
Hey, how long do we need to wear this?
It's embarrassing.

312
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,870
But don't be like that in front of Sua.
She's trying hard.

313
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:16,763
This is too much.
Who will buy this trash? Isn't it?

314
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:20,871
It may be better to tell her fast
and make her give up.

315
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:24,490
You care too much. God, what's this?

316
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:26,982
Sua.

317
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:28,592
Is that so?

318
00:18:29,052 --> 00:18:30,471
That was it.

319
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:33,765
-Soo...Sua, it's not that.
-I'm sorry...

320
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:35,709
...for making you wear that trash.

321
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:39,326
Soo...Sua! That's not it.

322
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,010
-Sua.
-Sua, I didn't mean that.

323
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:42,820
-Sua!
-Sua!

324
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:47,637
Sua, I'm sorry.

325
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:50,820
I didn't mean that you
were bad at designing.

326
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:56,014
Your clothes are really extreme.
I just can't pull the look.

327
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:57,824
He's right. Your design is really nice.

328
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,727
Our body shape can't pull it off.

329
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:00,910
It's fine.

330
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,116
You guys are right. What am I?
I can't design.

331
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:07,321
What was that sound?

332
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:08,805
It's an order.

333
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,329
That's great.

334
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,436
-What?
-Why?

335
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:14,936
Look at this.

336
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,224
My v-neck sweater is sold. Five of it.

337
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:19,438
-What?
-Five?

338
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:22,026
My hoodies too.

339
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:26,023
There are people who buy those.

340
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,629
I told you.
Extreme fashion is trend nowadays.

341
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,028
You don't even know about fashion.

342
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:37,214
Sorry. I don't know about fashion.

343
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:41,511
Really. It should be an honor to wear
something like this.

344
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,215
Is that so?
There's something I designed recently.

345
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:48,523
Do you want?

346
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:49,825
-What?
-What?

347
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,919
-Sua.
-Yes?

348
00:19:58,111 --> 00:19:59,719
What kind of pants is this?

349
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:04,624
It's Soorgio Armani 2018 S/S,
sexy collection.

350
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:10,828
Ultra fire shorts. I made it
extremely short to point out sexiness.

351
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:13,130
-What do you think?
-It's good.

352
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:16,821
Sexy, cool, embarrassing.

353
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:21,834
But Sua...isn't this too short?

354
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:25,061
No, that's the point of it.

355
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:30,645
Anyway, it's my gift to you two
so wear it everyday and advertise them.

356
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:31,645
Alright?

357
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:34,022
-Sure.
-Of course.

358
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:36,935
It's really pretty.

359
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:43,818
Jungi, can you do your pitch well today?

360
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:49,115
Of course. My Bacca helped me so hard.
I have to do well.

361
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:54,026
But I hope you can be there
to cheer me up.

362
00:20:54,111 --> 00:20:56,724
I'm sorry. I have an interview today.

363
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:59,113
It's alright. You need to do your work.

364
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,512
Instead...

365
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,416
Tada!

366
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:04,501
What is this?

367
00:21:04,907 --> 00:21:07,043
-A mustache?
-It's a lucky charm.

368
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:08,146
Give me.

369
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:13,456
Even though I'm not there,
think as if I'm there when you see this.

370
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:15,967
-Alright?
-Sure, thank you.

371
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:17,967
You know that I'm your number one fan?

372
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,779
Don't forget that I am there
to support you every time.

373
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,075
Alright.

374
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,377
And also...I have another gift.

375
00:21:25,462 --> 00:21:26,273
What is it?

376
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:32,377
Jungi, cheer up! I'll be going now!

377
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:33,385
Cheer up!

378
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:35,285
Have a good day.

379
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:36,500
Let's cheer up!

380
00:21:45,411 --> 00:21:49,729
I need to go to film company
but I can't go like this.

381
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:54,133
Alright. I need to change
and go out throw the window.

382
00:21:55,637 --> 00:21:57,236
Director Bong, lend me your lap...

383
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:00,842
What are you doing?

384
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:02,434
Are you...

385
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:04,437
...taking off the clothes?

386
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:08,247
No, I'm wearing it. Wearing it.

387
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:10,548
I love this sweater.

388
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:13,243
You do? Where's Dusik?

389
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:15,622
He's out to meet his friend.

390
00:22:19,814 --> 00:22:20,921
Yes, direc...

391
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,224
Yes, yes. I'm going now.

392
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:27,026
Sure, I'll go fast! Yes, I'm sorry. Sorry.

393
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:29,732
Are you going to the office? Bye.

394
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:31,022
Yes, sure.

395
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,827
Go ahead. Advertise my clothes too!

396
00:22:35,912 --> 00:22:36,828
Sure.

397
00:22:39,713 --> 00:22:41,317
I need to take out something.

398
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:43,503
Bye!

399
00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:47,106
Well, where's the laptop?

400
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:04,501
What's this?

401
00:23:09,812 --> 00:23:11,498
Here, clothes you asked me.

402
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,188
Thanks.

403
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:18,690
Hey, what is Soorgio Armani mall?
Why do you want me to buy it for you?

404
00:23:19,193 --> 00:23:20,206
Well, I have some reasons.

405
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,116
Anyway, sorry for the inconvenience.

406
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:26,110
But what's with that outfit?
Is that a boxer? It's so embarrassing.

407
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,609
Everyone is looking at you.

408
00:23:29,315 --> 00:23:30,910
Why? Isn't it pretty?

409
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:33,795
Extreme fashion is in trend.

410
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:35,095
Hey.

411
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:36,882
Do you want it?

412
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:40,294
Try it.
If you like it recommend to others.

413
00:23:40,397 --> 00:23:41,585
Try it, it's nice.

414
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:46,187
-Is it embarrassing? Try it.
-Please, don't.

415
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,761
You can restart from now.

416
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:04,668
From now, you can search for
something that can make you happy.

417
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:07,361
-Do you think I can do it?
-I'll help you with your study.

418
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,359
-Min Sua, you can do it!
-I can do it!

419
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:13,248
I want to open an internet shopping mall.

420
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:14,954
It's Armani.

421
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:18,845
Boss is out there like this,
how can a director go in?

422
00:24:45,812 --> 00:24:48,006
-Sua, what are you doing here?
-What?

423
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,199
-Doing nothing. Why!
-Why are you yelling?

424
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:53,105
Hey, I got a game from my friend.

425
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,190
Let's bet on instant noodle.
It's been long.

426
00:24:55,888 --> 00:24:58,906
No! I'm tired. I want to rest. You pig!

427
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:00,104
What?

428
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:04,210
A pig? What are you talking about?

429
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,711
She's really crazy.

430
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:09,603
Did you practice a lot?

431
00:25:09,699 --> 00:25:11,588
Yes, I did my best.

432
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:13,796
Great. I'm sure about this.

433
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,605
When you do this, Lee Jungi will be
successful. So do well.

434
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:17,796
Yes, sir!

435
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:19,404
-Outfit?
-Here, sir.

436
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Here you go.

437
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:24,111
What? What is...

438
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:25,397
Why is this here...

439
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:29,206
Wow, great outfit.
It goes perfect with pole dance.

440
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:31,100
Wait, where did you buy this?

441
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:36,397
There's really hot shopping mall
around stylists. Soorgio Armani.

442
00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:38,810
What? Soorgio Armani is hot?

443
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:43,913
Yes! Also the CEO came up
with her own brand. Designs are great.

444
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:45,890
It's so extreme and sexy.

445
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:47,708
Well, yes.

446
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:52,398
Good job with the interview.

447
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:54,295
Our work is finished.

448
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:56,893
Should we go and grab something?

449
00:25:57,082 --> 00:25:59,385
Yes? Well, ma'am.

450
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:03,751
If you don't have anything for me to do,
can I leave for a while?

451
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,148
-I have something to do.
-Well, alright.

452
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:08,759
Thank you.

453
00:26:08,853 --> 00:26:10,243
See you tomorrow.

454
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:12,731
Bye.

455
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:19,935
Lee Jungi, you showed
extraordinary pole dance pitch.

456
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,312
It seems you're already
gaining lots of attraction.

457
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:24,630
Where did you get this idea?

458
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:25,714
Oh, well.

459
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:28,311
My agency representative
gave me this idea.

460
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:32,999
Lots of people around me
helped me to do this well.

461
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:37,894
Kang Seojin.

462
00:26:38,902 --> 00:26:40,989
-Hello, sir.
-What are you doing here?

463
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:44,212
Well , I was just passing by.

464
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:45,210
I see.

465
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:48,511
Pole dancing must have been hard for you.
Wasn't it?

466
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:52,414
Well, it was. I got a lot of help
from people around me.

467
00:26:52,502 --> 00:26:56,303
There's someone who helped me
everyday by catching my ball.

468
00:26:56,803 --> 00:26:58,819
To that person,
I'd like to take this chance...

469
00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:01,819
...to thank you
for all the work you did for me.

470
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:05,113
Is that person your girlfriend?

471
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:06,414
It is, isn't it?

472
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:09,208
What? A girlfriend?

473
00:27:17,977 --> 00:27:19,562
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

474
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,876
Really? What's your ideal type?

475
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:25,075
I'm not sure.

476
00:27:28,394 --> 00:27:29,998
Love pole dance, please.

477
00:27:36,098 --> 00:27:38,293
Jungi's name is number one search result.

478
00:27:38,485 --> 00:27:40,182
Pole dance pitch is number two.

479
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:41,786
Third is Poo Joonseok.

480
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:44,593
You are really popular now.

481
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:46,687
Can't believe pole dance pitch worked.

482
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,108
I never knew this could happen.

483
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:54,115
Wow, what a strange world.

484
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,330
But I have something that's bothering me.

485
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,828
-Yes?
-No girlfriend?

486
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:04,832
Do you want to be buried inside
a mountain without even knowing?

487
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,237
Well, that's...

488
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,110
My CEO told me not to reveal
the fact that I have a girlfriend.

489
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:13,807
He's really firm about that.
I had no choice.

490
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,403
Seojin.

491
00:28:15,602 --> 00:28:16,808
I'm really sorry.

492
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:19,297
I should've told you before.

493
00:28:19,912 --> 00:28:21,497
It's fine.

494
00:28:21,607 --> 00:28:23,108
There's nothing we can do.

495
00:28:23,196 --> 00:28:24,721
Thank you for understanding.

496
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:28,610
Bro, but why did you wear this?

497
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:29,817
Isn't this Sua's clothes?

498
00:28:29,902 --> 00:28:32,501
My stylist bought this outfit.

499
00:28:32,793 --> 00:28:35,912
She said Sua's mall is
really hot among stylists.

500
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:37,198
What? Really?

501
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,499
Yes, it is.

502
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:42,416
She said Sua will become
Korea's Coco Chanel.

503
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:48,005
Wow, Jungi.

504
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:51,716
I saw your pitch the other day.
It went viral.

505
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:54,209
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me. I must thank you.

506
00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:56,500
You advertised our drama.

507
00:28:56,615 --> 00:28:58,897
Right. Did you see the script?

508
00:28:58,997 --> 00:28:59,997
Yes, I did.

509
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,092
What do you think?
You'll be partnered with Cindy...

510
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,902
...who has huge amount of uncle fans.

511
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,489
I'm honored.

512
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:09,110
But, who are they?

513
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,907
They're Cindy's fans.

514
00:29:10,992 --> 00:29:13,395
They're the famous uncle fans.

515
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:15,501
I guess she's really popular.

516
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,905
-That's Cindy!
-Cindy!

517
00:29:18,004 --> 00:29:19,896
Cindy!

518
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:32,472
"My star, Cindy.
Goddess Cindy, I love you."

519
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:42,574
-Cindy!
-Cindy forever!

520
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,962
Cindy! Cindy!

521
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:50,148
For today's scene, new anchor Hyena
meets her first love Song Joonseok.

522
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:54,947
Hyena finds her first love,
runs to Song Joonseok and hugs him.

523
00:29:55,032 --> 00:29:56,344
-Okay?
-Alright.

524
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:58,631
Then, let's start shooting.

525
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:01,744
Let's start the shooting.

526
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:07,134
High cue!

527
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,246
Senior Joonseok?

528
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:11,937
Joonseok!

529
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,833
What? What are you doing?

530
00:30:19,438 --> 00:30:20,342
Hyena?

531
00:30:20,729 --> 00:30:21,729
Are you Hyena?

532
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:23,945
Joonseok, long time no see.

533
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:27,546
Cut. Okay. Good.

534
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,253
-Let's go to bust shot.
-Alright.

535
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:33,587
Jungi, your jacket is stained
with my lipstick. I'm sorry.

536
00:30:33,655 --> 00:30:36,750
Well, it's alright. It's fine.

537
00:30:55,452 --> 00:30:58,046
What? Why are they
looking at me like that?

538
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:00,243
What the... It's creepy.

539
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,752
"Baking and Confectionery License Test."

540
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:07,456
Jesus. Buddha.

541
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:13,565
Please help Yuna pass her test right away.

542
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:17,462
Amen. Buddha mantra. Yap!

543
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:18,569
Oh, my.

544
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:20,470
Yuna!

545
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:22,392
Yuna! Yuna.

546
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,271
Is is finished?

547
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:25,367
Did you do well?

548
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:28,674
Why?

549
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,573
-You didn't do well?
-Yes.

550
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:34,383
I think I made a lot of mistakes.

551
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,787
I think I'm going to fail.

552
00:31:37,885 --> 00:31:40,389
The results are not out yet.

553
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:42,992
-I'm sure you did great.
-God.

554
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:45,984
I prepared really hard.

555
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:48,492
Just even for Seol,

556
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:50,683
I really wanted to pass.

557
00:31:56,403 --> 00:31:58,106
Why are you crying?

558
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:00,301
Don't worry. You will pass.

559
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,301
Stop crying. Stop.

560
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:04,895
Donggu.

561
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,480
Hey, it's alright. Really.

562
00:32:16,682 --> 00:32:18,187
It's alright.

563
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:29,845
Senior!

564
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:36,821
Wow, Jungi hugged top star Cindy.
What in the world?

565
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:39,226
Man, it's just acting.

566
00:32:39,328 --> 00:32:41,424
Guess Seojin, you must be jealous.

567
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:42,718
Jealous?

568
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,727
There's so much to be jealous about.
It's just acting.

569
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:49,028
Yes. Hey! My Bacca is not narrow minded.

570
00:32:49,223 --> 00:32:53,416
Right. Bacca, on Sunday, let's go to
that restaurant we couldn't go.

571
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:55,813
It's alright. You are busy these days.

572
00:32:55,928 --> 00:32:59,720
No, it's not just normal day.
It's your birthday. I can't ignore it.

573
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,324
This time, I'll really keep the promise.
So empty your schedule. Alright?

574
00:33:04,413 --> 00:33:05,816
Yes, alright.

575
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:07,220
It's your birthday?

576
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:11,522
My goodness, you don't even know
your only sister's birthday?

577
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:13,825
Well, I don't even expect it from you.

578
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,715
I'm going for grocery shopping.

579
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:26,115
Hey, what's wrong with Yuna?

580
00:33:26,698 --> 00:33:29,206
She didn't do well
on her baking license exam.

581
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:31,508
She's been like that for few days already.

582
00:33:31,597 --> 00:33:33,997
Go out on a date with her. Make her happy.

583
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:36,699
I did that. But it's not working.

584
00:33:37,003 --> 00:33:38,871
Is there any other way to make her happy?

585
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:41,276
Well, first of all...

586
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:45,768
You find it out yourself.
I'm going for shooting.

587
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:46,976
-I'll go now.
-Alright.

588
00:33:47,178 --> 00:33:47,881
That...

589
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:56,870
Jungi, I'm sorry. My car broke down
on the way to pick you up.

590
00:33:56,955 --> 00:34:01,873
It's fine. I can get a taxi. Don't mind.
See you at the studio.

591
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:05,754
Taxi!

592
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,264
Gosh! What!

593
00:34:08,368 --> 00:34:09,795
What is this!

594
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:10,978
I'm sorry.

595
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:12,168
Are you alright?

596
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:14,677
I was watering the plants
and accidentally...

597
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:17,280
God, you need to be more careful.

598
00:34:17,796 --> 00:34:19,682
I could have gotten hurt.

599
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:21,777
I'm really sorry. Sorry.

600
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,578
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

601
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:27,317
God, I could really have died.

602
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:30,206
Taxi!

603
00:34:32,912 --> 00:34:34,714
Hello, welcome.

604
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,015
Where to?

605
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,619
To JBC studio, please.

606
00:34:37,715 --> 00:34:38,394
Hey.

607
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,006
You look very familiar.

608
00:34:41,284 --> 00:34:44,808
You recognize me. Did you see me
doing pole dance pitch a while ago?

609
00:34:44,895 --> 00:34:47,400
Pole dance pitch? What's that?

610
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:49,297
You don't know?

611
00:34:49,996 --> 00:34:52,899
-Maybe you watch drama "News Room"?
-"News Room"?

612
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:56,080
Song Joonseok.

613
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,580
You filmed a hug scene with Cindy...

614
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:02,192
Wow, you even remember that scene.

615
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:04,675
Yes, I am! That's me!

616
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:08,071
Well, do you want an autograph?

617
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:09,365
No, I don't want.

618
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:11,174
Let's just go.

619
00:35:19,948 --> 00:35:22,537
How could you feel sick
after riding a taxi?

620
00:35:22,631 --> 00:35:24,934
God, don't even talk about it.

621
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,946
The driver accelerated real hard.

622
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:28,940
I was really suffering back there.

623
00:35:29,148 --> 00:35:30,352
It's strange.

624
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:35,231
I almost died on my way here when a pot
fell from a building to my head.

625
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:37,041
Is it your unlucky day?

626
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:38,524
I think so.

627
00:35:39,928 --> 00:35:40,928
Hold it.

628
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:45,721
I think the taxi driver...looks familiar.

629
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:48,412
You filmed a hug scene with Cindy...

630
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,618
Cindy! Skin fair like milk, Cindy!

631
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:55,825
-It's him! Him! Cindy's uncle fan!
-What?

632
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:58,626
-The taxi driver was Cindy's uncle fan?
-Yes.

633
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,317
He came to the studio to cheer Cindy.

634
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,317
Hold it.

635
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,720
-What!
-Are you ok?

636
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:08,613
Cindy!

637
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:13,933
What? The one who dropped
his pot is also Cindy's fan.

638
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,130
You don't say... You must be wrong.

639
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:18,429
I'm not! Are they...

640
00:36:18,532 --> 00:36:21,837
...taking revenge on me
because I hugged Cindy?

641
00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:23,543
God, that's nonsense.

642
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:25,646
I really don't think fans
will try to harm you.

643
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:28,241
They won't, right?

644
00:36:37,753 --> 00:36:38,873
Why do I?

645
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:40,278
Why Bong Dusik?

646
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:44,062
Is he handsome? Or has a great body shape?

647
00:36:47,052 --> 00:36:47,946
But...

648
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:50,551
...he is a bit cute.

649
00:36:51,954 --> 00:36:52,861
What am I saying?

650
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:56,163
My god, I'm crazy. Crazy!
Crazy Min Sua.

651
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:58,351
Get your mind right.
You were not like this before.

652
00:36:58,454 --> 00:37:01,330
What are you doing?
Why are you looking at my photo?

653
00:37:03,144 --> 00:37:04,235
See what!

654
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,235
You were so ugly I was erasing
from my hard drive.

655
00:37:06,338 --> 00:37:08,329
What? You little!

656
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,152
Shut up! Get out! Out!

657
00:37:10,254 --> 00:37:12,055
You are too ugly to look at.
Get out, you pig!

658
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,644
What? Pig?

659
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,647
Hey, why do you keep calling me pig?
Are you crazy?

660
00:37:18,347 --> 00:37:20,750
I don't want to talk to you.
Get out! You pig!

661
00:37:21,354 --> 00:37:24,855
Fine. I'm going. Going! You stupid idiot!
Fart all day!

662
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:32,832
Look, he's ugly and even
gets angry too often!

663
00:37:34,436 --> 00:37:36,537
But that was very manly.

664
00:37:36,943 --> 00:37:38,027
He's sexy.

665
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:43,518
Oh my! What am I saying!
I'm going crazy! No, no. No!

666
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:46,813
So handsome.

667
00:37:49,028 --> 00:37:51,216
Wow, you did great.

668
00:37:56,009 --> 00:37:58,709
"Actor Lee Jungi has no girlfriend!"

669
00:38:02,498 --> 00:38:06,006
Hey, hey, hey. Aren't you working?
What are you doing?

670
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:10,799
Lee Jungi?
He's really popular these days.

671
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,616
Are you Lee Jungi's fan?

672
00:38:14,103 --> 00:38:14,797
Yes.

673
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:17,503
-Jungi is my boy...
-Yes?

674
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:22,011
No, he's my brother's friend.

675
00:38:22,114 --> 00:38:24,511
Really? That's great.

676
00:38:24,622 --> 00:38:27,821
If I need an interview with him,
I will ask you.

677
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:29,932
-Sure.
-Wow.

678
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,644
Well, I have a date this weekend.
What should I wear?

679
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:43,038
Is this a studio of that rapper who is
in charge of our movie's sound track?

680
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:47,438
Yes. MC Dot Copy. He's hot these days.

681
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,232
His rap is really good.

682
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,157
Dot Copy...

683
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,442
He's here. Hello.

684
00:38:57,534 --> 00:38:58,745
-What's up?
-Hey.

685
00:38:59,335 --> 00:39:00,546
Long time no see.

686
00:39:01,934 --> 00:39:03,338
Who's this?

687
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:07,037
He's Kang Donggu.
Our movie's production assistant.

688
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:09,233
-Hello.
-Hello.

689
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:13,027
-Hit it.
-Right.

690
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:16,567
-Nice to meet you.
-Ok. Let's get it.

691
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,754
Is our music work going well?

692
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:20,620
Yes, well. Just fine...

693
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,220
You said it's a spy
movie happening in Dubai.

694
00:39:24,305 --> 00:39:28,719
So I prepared some samples according to
that concept. Do you want to hear it?

695
00:39:28,804 --> 00:39:30,804
-Shall we?
-Ok. Let's get it.

696
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:43,068
Now, Hyena visits Joonseok's house
suddenly.

697
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:49,772
Hyena stares at Joonseok with teary eyes
and kisses him all of a sudden. Alright?

698
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:50,565
-Yes.
-Yes.

699
00:39:50,669 --> 00:39:53,161
Now, let's start. Make it realistic.

700
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:53,955
Sure.

701
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,954
Let's start shooting.

702
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:59,452
High cue!

703
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:00,762
Who is it?

704
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,452
Hyena!

705
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:04,960
What's up?

706
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:06,253
Joonseok...

707
00:40:07,662 --> 00:40:09,055
Come in. Come in and talk.

708
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:20,539
Cut!

709
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:21,843
Are you alright?

710
00:40:21,928 --> 00:40:24,642
-Hey, what are you doing?
-I'm sorry, director.

711
00:40:24,753 --> 00:40:25,953
Are you alright, Jungi?

712
00:40:26,038 --> 00:40:27,539
Yes. I'm fine.

713
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:33,634
"Cindy."

714
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:35,634
Cindy? What?

715
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,925
Cindy?

716
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,044
Is he...?

717
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:40,330
Let's restart from that kissing scene.

718
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,329
Yes, yes. Alright.

719
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,721
Now, high cue!

720
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,527
Are you alright?

721
00:40:51,912 --> 00:40:53,228
Cut! What's happening?

722
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:55,220
Jungi! Jungi, are you alright?

723
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,243
Yes, yes.

724
00:40:57,328 --> 00:40:58,833
Will you people just do it properly?

725
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:00,833
What is wrong with all of you? Huh?

726
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,825
God, what's wrong with this?

727
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:04,443
I'm sorry, Jungi.

728
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,732
Yes, yes. It's fine.

729
00:41:08,437 --> 00:41:09,534
"My love, Cindy"

730
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:12,368
Huh? Cindy?

731
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,341
What? Is he...too?

732
00:41:16,445 --> 00:41:17,817
Are you alright?

733
00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:21,897
Yes, yes...I'm fine.

734
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:24,794
Until the lights are back,
let's take a rest.

735
00:41:24,895 --> 00:41:26,809
-Jungi, take a rest.
-Alright.

736
00:41:30,603 --> 00:41:33,920
This is not good. This is really not good.
Really, really.

737
00:41:34,021 --> 00:41:35,817
Bro! Are you alright?

738
00:41:35,915 --> 00:41:36,928
It's really strange.

739
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:40,447
I think microphone staff
and light staff are Cindy's fans.

740
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,744
-Hey, are you talking about that again?
-I'm sure!

741
00:41:42,832 --> 00:41:44,434
There is something going on here!

742
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:46,968
Calm down. Drink this.

743
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,038
Thank you.

744
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:57,220
What's wrong with its taste!

745
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:04,025
Hey! It's already a year
passed from its expiry date!

746
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:05,237
Really?

747
00:42:05,537 --> 00:42:08,348
I just brought it from the shop.

748
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:10,531
It's fine.

749
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:11,730
By the way...

750
00:42:11,815 --> 00:42:13,612
I don't have any schedule this Sunday,
right?

751
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,739
I have a really important appointment.

752
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:18,223
Sunday? Hold on.

753
00:42:18,714 --> 00:42:19,712
Sunday...

754
00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:23,521
"My love, Cindy"

755
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:27,504
Cindy! Then, you manager. You too...?

756
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:31,406
-Why?
-No, no. Nothing.

757
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,911
Are you alright? Would you like
some coffee to wake you up?

758
00:42:34,022 --> 00:42:36,316
I don't want! I won't eat! Never!

759
00:42:36,523 --> 00:42:37,602
Why are you yelling?

760
00:42:54,135 --> 00:42:58,435
This is it! Park Seojoon is my style.

761
00:42:58,738 --> 00:43:02,125
Not Dusik. How dare he?

762
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:05,821
He's handsome.

763
00:43:19,554 --> 00:43:23,044
What's wrong with me? Am I crazy?
I'm crazy. Crazy!

764
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:25,638
Min Sua! You're really crazy!

765
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:28,333
What are you doing? Alone?

766
00:43:29,427 --> 00:43:32,537
Why do you care so much
about what I do! You pig!

767
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,432
She's calling me pig again.
Hey! Why am I a pig, huh?

768
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:37,821
You stupid idiot!

769
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,313
That psycho! She's really crazy!

770
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,315
-What the hell happened to you?
-Dusik...

771
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,600
I'm really scared.

772
00:43:46,703 --> 00:43:48,515
Scared? Why?

773
00:43:49,523 --> 00:43:52,728
What? You think Cindy's
fans are terrorizing you?

774
00:43:52,928 --> 00:43:56,928
Yes! When something strange happens,
it's all because of Cindy's fans.

775
00:43:57,029 --> 00:44:01,445
I think they're taking a revenge on me
for having love line in my drama.

776
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,246
Hey, I don't think so.
You're over thinking it.

777
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:07,735
No, it's not.
There's something fishy.

778
00:44:07,836 --> 00:44:11,036
Don't be like that. Just go to your room
and sleep. You're just tired.

779
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:12,332
Am I?

780
00:44:12,936 --> 00:44:14,338
Is that so?

781
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:16,933
-I'll get better if I take a rest, right?
-Yes, go.

782
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:19,227
Alright.

783
00:44:21,223 --> 00:44:25,121
It's dangerous.
Outside my bed is dangerous. Dangerous.

784
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:35,889
Jungi! Jungi! What's wrong!

785
00:44:36,881 --> 00:44:39,678
Loo, look!
Cindy's fan sent me a threat message.

786
00:44:39,786 --> 00:44:42,694
I bet Cindy's fan came into my room too.

787
00:44:43,387 --> 00:44:46,065
Inside my bed is also dangerous!
Inside my bed is also dangerous!

788
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,247
Jungi! Where are you going! Where!
What's wrong with him?

789
00:44:56,936 --> 00:44:59,437
"Get away from Cindy. Die! Die!"

790
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:12,497
"My love, Cindy."

791
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,060
Yuna, what are you doing?
I bought your favorite, soondae.

792
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,790
Thanks.

793
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,773
Are you still feeling bad about your exam?

794
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:34,972
No, I'm not.

795
00:45:35,384 --> 00:45:37,179
It's busy these days for you, right?

796
00:45:37,264 --> 00:45:38,066
Yes.

797
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:41,971
I'm going to Dubai in a week
and there's so much to take care of.

798
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:44,788
-Are you staying there for a month?
-Yes.

799
00:45:46,088 --> 00:45:49,580
But I'm going to miss you and Seol a lot.

800
00:45:49,678 --> 00:45:50,667
Should I not go?

801
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,080
Hey, you should go.

802
00:45:53,271 --> 00:45:55,174
Take care while you're there.

803
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,484
I mean...

804
00:45:56,578 --> 00:45:59,793
I might fell in love with other woman.

805
00:46:04,405 --> 00:46:07,004
I'm just joking to make you laugh.

806
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:07,985
Sorry.

807
00:46:09,993 --> 00:46:12,604
I met a really fun guy today.
Do you want to know?

808
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:14,501
Who?

809
00:46:14,587 --> 00:46:17,304
I met our rapper
in charge of our soundtrack.

810
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:21,209
But it seemed like
I've heard his song already.

811
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:23,119
Psy, Bigbang, Ikon.

812
00:46:23,204 --> 00:46:27,019
Their songs but different lyrics.
Everything was same.

813
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:28,494
Really?

814
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:30,607
What was his name?

815
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,710
MC Dot Copy?

816
00:46:33,078 --> 00:46:34,890
Maybe that is why he's all copy.

817
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:36,887
Because he copies all the songs?

818
00:46:37,191 --> 00:46:38,792
MC Dot Copy?

819
00:46:38,901 --> 00:46:40,505
Why? Do you know him?

820
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,688
Of course! I respect him the most!

821
00:46:43,793 --> 00:46:48,294
It's because of Dot Copy
I dreamed of becoming a rapper.

822
00:46:48,401 --> 00:46:52,304
-Really?
-It's my dream to meet Dot Copy.

823
00:46:52,506 --> 00:46:54,383
Do you want me to do that for you?

824
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:55,687
Really?

825
00:46:55,788 --> 00:46:58,178
That will be so great for me.

826
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:01,485
God, now only you are smiling.
You like it that much?

827
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:03,786
Yes! I really really do.

828
00:47:04,495 --> 00:47:06,897
Donggu, thank you so much.
Thank you. Oh my god.

829
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,397
God, look at you.

830
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:12,181
Oh my god!

831
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:17,666
Good morning. Hello.

832
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,768
Jungi, you're here.

833
00:47:20,162 --> 00:47:21,269
Aren't you tired?

834
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,960
Would you like some coffee?

835
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:24,856
Well, thanks.

836
00:47:41,618 --> 00:47:44,228
No thanks! I won't eat!

837
00:47:55,256 --> 00:47:57,060
Why are you eating alone?

838
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:58,264
Eat with me.

839
00:47:58,371 --> 00:47:59,066
What?

840
00:47:59,856 --> 00:48:01,463
I'm fine.

841
00:48:01,562 --> 00:48:03,652
-There's rice on your cheek.
-What?

842
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:27,605
Give it! I put it there to eat it later!

843
00:48:28,102 --> 00:48:29,295
Don't touch!

844
00:48:44,618 --> 00:48:45,923
Oh, my!

845
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,526
Cindy...

846
00:48:48,518 --> 00:48:50,123
You shocked me!

847
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:53,414
Senior, are you angry at me?

848
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,111
What?

849
00:48:55,412 --> 00:48:56,316
No, I'm not.

850
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,618
Why are you avoiding me?

851
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,411
You don't talk me, don't greet me.

852
00:49:02,713 --> 00:49:04,611
Did I do something wrong?

853
00:49:04,701 --> 00:49:05,701
Well...

854
00:49:06,107 --> 00:49:09,016
-That's not it.
-If I did, please tell me.

855
00:49:09,505 --> 00:49:11,123
I'll fix my problem.

856
00:49:11,304 --> 00:49:12,012
Please?

857
00:49:17,213 --> 00:49:18,541
Are you crying?

858
00:49:21,132 --> 00:49:22,932
Well, actually...

859
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:27,721
-Why, what's wrong. Why?
-I think my eyelash went inside my eye.

860
00:49:28,228 --> 00:49:30,927
Is it? Let me see. Here.

861
00:49:43,736 --> 00:49:47,048
Done! I finished uploading new products.

862
00:49:47,144 --> 00:49:48,159
God, I'm so tired.

863
00:49:48,244 --> 00:49:50,349
Why do you always work alone?
What about Sua?

864
00:49:50,437 --> 00:49:53,045
I don't know. She is really a mean boss.

865
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,651
She never works.
Calls me pig without any reasons.

866
00:49:55,736 --> 00:49:57,243
I think she's a psycho.

867
00:49:57,548 --> 00:49:59,235
She wasn't normal at first.

868
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:00,641
You're right.

869
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,934
Well, I'm done with my work.

870
00:50:03,026 --> 00:50:07,513
Shall I fabricate number of hits
for "President is Bruce Lee"?

871
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:13,006
What's this?
Top search word is Lee Jungi.

872
00:50:14,008 --> 00:50:16,120
I bet it's not the Lee Jungi I know.

873
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:22,416
What? Cindy and Lee Jungi dating?

874
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:24,009
Secret dating sighted?

875
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:27,224
What? What are you talking about?

876
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:28,509
Well...

877
00:50:31,515 --> 00:50:32,714
What is this?

878
00:50:33,412 --> 00:50:34,325
I don't know.

879
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,498
Hey, what's happening?

880
00:50:38,689 --> 00:50:39,808
I'm here.

881
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:41,601
What are you doing?

882
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:44,408
Are you looking at something interesting?
Let me see too.

883
00:50:44,507 --> 00:50:46,900
Me too, me too.

884
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:51,086
Hey, what is this?

885
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:53,093
Jungi, what's this?

886
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:55,270
-Did you kiss Cindy?
-What?

887
00:50:55,984 --> 00:50:58,081
What kiss?

888
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,085
No! Never. Never.

889
00:51:00,173 --> 00:51:03,096
-This is a huge misunderstanding.
-Then explain this photo.

890
00:51:03,181 --> 00:51:07,994
Well, Cindy's eyelash went inside her eye
so I blew it for her.

891
00:51:08,197 --> 00:51:09,677
It's true.

892
00:51:09,782 --> 00:51:11,857
Seojin, you trust me, right?

893
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:14,357
Is that so?

894
00:51:15,165 --> 00:51:17,072
I knew it.

895
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:19,059
God, this is crazy.

896
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:20,973
Who the hell wrote this?

897
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:22,861
Hey, Seojin. Don't you worry.

898
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:25,660
I'll release correction
article about this.

899
00:51:25,745 --> 00:51:26,349
Alright.

900
00:51:36,274 --> 00:51:38,074
"Agency CEO"

901
00:51:43,832 --> 00:51:44,937
Yes, sir.

902
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:46,747
Did you see the article?

903
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,935
Yes, that's a misunderstanding.
Misunderstanding.

904
00:51:49,032 --> 00:51:51,134
I'm not dating Cindy.

905
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,046
We need to release correction article.

906
00:51:53,149 --> 00:51:54,577
Correction article?

907
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:55,947
Why?

908
00:51:56,032 --> 00:51:57,447
-Just leave it.
-What?

909
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,034
What do you mean?

910
00:51:59,132 --> 00:52:00,132
Jungi.

911
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:01,521
Who's Cindy?

912
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:04,040
She's Korea's little sister.
Korea's little sister.

913
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,731
If there's rumors about you and Cindy
your awareness will go up...

914
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:08,033
...and become an issue.

915
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,033
There's nothing bad about it.

916
00:52:10,142 --> 00:52:11,739
Well, but still...

917
00:52:11,831 --> 00:52:12,638
Hey!

918
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:15,233
Just do as I say.

919
00:52:15,356 --> 00:52:17,431
I'll release it at the right time.

920
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:18,733
-Alright?
-Sir...

921
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:21,027
Sir!

922
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:24,829
God, what should I do...

923
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:32,717
Jungi is still on top.

924
00:52:32,827 --> 00:52:34,709
Articles about him are
released every second.

925
00:52:36,826 --> 00:52:39,104
What happened? Will he release?

926
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:40,589
Well..

927
00:52:41,105 --> 00:52:43,796
He wants me to keep quiet.

928
00:52:43,898 --> 00:52:45,502
-What?
-Well...

929
00:52:45,608 --> 00:52:49,483
He said if I have rumors with Cindy,
it will help my awareness to go up.

930
00:52:50,173 --> 00:52:52,264
He wants me to keep quiet.

931
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:55,169
God, what should I do...

932
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:57,356
Really?

933
00:52:58,065 --> 00:53:00,166
Then it's fine.

934
00:53:00,663 --> 00:53:03,364
Jungi, I'm alright. Don't mind me.

935
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,977
Jungi, but this is too much.

936
00:53:06,165 --> 00:53:08,366
Is Seojin "Hong Gildong" or what?

937
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:11,672
She can't call her boyfriend boyfriend.
She needs to bear the fact that you're...

938
00:53:11,757 --> 00:53:13,749
...involved in a romance rumor.
Isn't it?

939
00:53:13,844 --> 00:53:14,868
Seojin...

940
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,455
I'm sorry.

941
00:53:17,145 --> 00:53:18,244
I'm really sorry.

942
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:21,442
It's fine. You didn't do that on purpose.

943
00:53:22,127 --> 00:53:23,061
But, Jungi...

944
00:53:23,138 --> 00:53:26,432
Fans were furious when you hugged Cindy.
Now there's rumor about you...

945
00:53:26,543 --> 00:53:30,131
...and Cindy dating.
You might get killed if you step out.

946
00:53:30,439 --> 00:53:32,833
You're right. This is a problem.

947
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:34,920
I must celebrate birthday
with Seojin tomorrow.

948
00:53:35,006 --> 00:53:37,012
Hey, we can have party in the house.

949
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:39,711
No, I already reserved it.

950
00:53:40,013 --> 00:53:43,417
Even, it's your birthday.
I can't just ignore it.

951
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:48,081
I will do something about it.
Let's go on a date tomorrow. Alright?

952
00:53:48,581 --> 00:53:50,073
Sure, alright.

953
00:53:53,879 --> 00:53:55,863
Oh my god, my god.

954
00:53:57,967 --> 00:53:59,071
Here, let's get it.

955
00:53:59,873 --> 00:54:02,691
Thank you! Really, thank you.

956
00:54:03,183 --> 00:54:04,494
Thank you for making your time.

957
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:06,484
You're welcome. You're welcome.

958
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:07,999
But...

959
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:11,800
I didn't know
Director Jo's girlfriend is my fan.

960
00:54:11,997 --> 00:54:13,895
Me too, I really didn't.

961
00:54:14,399 --> 00:54:19,602
Actually, I dreamed of becoming a rapper
after I listened to your songs.

962
00:54:19,902 --> 00:54:21,201
I gave up on it now.

963
00:54:21,305 --> 00:54:22,612
Oh, really?

964
00:54:22,712 --> 00:54:24,398
You wanted to become a rapper?

965
00:54:25,919 --> 00:54:26,919
Let's get it.

966
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,899
Oh, okay then do you want to record
a song as you're at my studio?

967
00:54:37,898 --> 00:54:39,097
Really?

968
00:54:39,205 --> 00:54:41,613
Of course. Try it.

969
00:54:41,793 --> 00:54:43,716
It'll be a good experience.
Great, isn't it?

970
00:54:43,806 --> 00:54:45,486
What song do you want to sing?

971
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:50,291
Well, I love your representative song,
"Mapo Bridge".

972
00:54:50,376 --> 00:54:51,478
Can I sing that?

973
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:52,883
Oh, sure. Why not?

974
00:54:52,976 --> 00:54:55,181
-Please go inside the booth. Let's get it.
-Alright.

975
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:03,387
-Alright, Yuna. Let's do this.
-Alright.

976
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:06,294
Don't be nervous. Okay. Let's get it.

977
00:55:12,741 --> 00:55:16,023
What? This is exactly same
with Zion.T's "Yang Hwa Bridge".

978
00:55:16,132 --> 00:55:19,538
My, he's really something. Really.

979
00:55:49,867 --> 00:55:51,073
Yuna, hold it.

980
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:52,470
Yes? What's wrong?

981
00:55:52,573 --> 00:55:56,867
You sing too much like Zion.T.

982
00:55:57,166 --> 00:55:59,469
I think you are mixing up
with "Yang Hwa Bridge" by Zion.T.

983
00:55:59,561 --> 00:56:02,779
You're...singing my song "Mapo Bridge".
"Mapo Bridge".

984
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:04,894
It's not "Yang Hwa Bridge".
You know what I'm saying?

985
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:07,092
Yes, I'm sorry.

986
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,788
Don't ever sing like Zion.T. Alright?

987
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:13,883
-Yes.
-Let's go again. Let's get it.

988
00:56:38,391 --> 00:56:39,500
Stop it, stop it!

989
00:56:40,894 --> 00:56:43,297
Yuna, it sounds like Zion.T again.

990
00:56:43,497 --> 00:56:48,004
That and this song is totally different.
Why do you keep mixing it up?

991
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:52,096
First of all, Yang Hwa bridge
and Mapo Bridge is one kilometer away.

992
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:57,076
In between, there's Seo Gang Bridge.
Is that confusing? My...

993
00:56:59,273 --> 00:57:00,368
♪ Happy...

994
00:57:00,472 --> 00:57:01,262
No.

995
00:57:02,366 --> 00:57:04,658
♪ Let's be happy.

996
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:07,145
♪ Let's be happy.

997
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:09,360
Is this that hard?

998
00:57:09,656 --> 00:57:11,042
I'm sorry.

999
00:57:13,245 --> 00:57:15,555
Then, let's go one last time.

1000
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,344
Sure.

1001
00:57:24,697 --> 00:57:26,401
Wow, Bacca!

1002
00:57:27,098 --> 00:57:30,392
-My Bacca, you're so pretty today.
-Really?

1003
00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:33,704
I paid a little attention as it's our date
after a long time. Is it ok?

1004
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:35,609
Yes, you're really pretty.

1005
00:57:36,817 --> 00:57:37,900
Then, shall we go?

1006
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:39,805
-Sure.
-Oh, right.

1007
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:40,908
Hold on.

1008
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:44,823
What are you doing?

1009
00:57:44,908 --> 00:57:46,720
I shouldn't be seen by any reporters.

1010
00:57:46,814 --> 00:57:49,812
So my CEO asked me to do like
this, when I go out.

1011
00:57:51,018 --> 00:57:51,712
He did?

1012
00:57:51,815 --> 00:57:54,112
I'm done. Let's go.

1013
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:55,621
Let's go!

1014
00:58:00,412 --> 00:58:01,725
Hello.

1015
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,422
Did you make a reservation?

1016
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:08,723
-Chewbacca.
-This way please.

1017
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:17,499
Seojin.

1018
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:22,693
Chair's moving in.

1019
00:58:30,388 --> 00:58:31,388
Thank you.

1020
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:34,284
By the way,
are you going to keep wearing that?

1021
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:35,490
What? Wear?

1022
00:58:36,584 --> 00:58:39,083
Oh, this. I need to take it off.

1023
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:42,829
Seojin, here. Order anything.

1024
00:58:42,914 --> 00:58:45,502
I'll buy you everything you want to eat.

1025
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,906
Really? I'm so excited.

1026
00:58:48,308 --> 00:58:49,890
What should I eat?

1027
00:58:50,313 --> 00:58:51,508
Yes, editor.

1028
00:58:51,605 --> 00:58:52,896
I just arrived.

1029
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,199
Yes, my interview ended just now.

1030
00:58:55,299 --> 00:58:55,998
Yes.

1031
00:58:56,293 --> 00:58:57,803
Which room?

1032
00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:59,589
Right side? Yes.

1033
00:59:01,298 --> 00:59:04,096
I'm sorry. I got confused.

1034
00:59:04,494 --> 00:59:05,192
Sure.

1035
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,177
Sirloin? Tenderloin?

1036
00:59:22,273 --> 00:59:24,169
Seojin, choose your menu.

1037
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:26,444
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Alright. Go ahead.

1038
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:28,356
Sirloin?

1039
00:59:41,906 --> 00:59:42,906
Excuse me.

1040
00:59:44,118 --> 00:59:45,820
Are you Lee Jungi?

1041
00:59:45,914 --> 00:59:47,109
No, no I'm not.

1042
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,900
-You got the wrong guy.
-Hey, you are Lee Jungi.

1043
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,198
I saw you sitting in the room.

1044
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:55,893
Mr. Jungi, please tell me
about your relationship with Cindy.

1045
00:59:55,978 --> 00:59:57,491
-Do you admit it?
-I'm not Lee Jungi.

1046
00:59:57,576 --> 01:00:01,974
Hey! Hey! Or remove your
mask just a little bit.

1047
01:00:02,082 --> 01:00:04,389
If you're not him I'll let you go.
A little bit.

1048
01:00:04,488 --> 01:00:05,788
-God!
-A little bit! Little bit!

1049
01:00:05,889 --> 01:00:08,691
Hold on, Mr. Lee Jungi! Lee Jungi!

1050
01:00:08,786 --> 01:00:10,884
Just a word! Mr. Lee Jungi!

1051
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:18,447
Why isn't he coming?

1052
01:00:19,145 --> 01:00:21,043
"Jungi"

1053
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:22,249
It's Jungi.

1054
01:00:25,757 --> 01:00:26,928
Yes, Jungi.

1055
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:29,165
-Why aren't you coming?
-Seojin.

1056
01:00:29,256 --> 01:00:31,054
I'm chased by a reporter.

1057
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:33,572
I think I can't go back
to the restaurant again.

1058
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:34,564
What should I do?

1059
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:37,270
-What?
-I'm really sorry.

1060
01:00:40,055 --> 01:00:41,743
God, she's still following me.

1061
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,346
Meet me at home later! I'm really sorry.

1062
01:01:20,489 --> 01:01:21,897
Seojin, you're here?

1063
01:01:22,499 --> 01:01:24,737
I'm really sorry.

1064
01:01:25,027 --> 01:01:27,324
The reporter was waiting
for me in the corridor.

1065
01:01:27,645 --> 01:01:29,935
She kept asking me
whether I admit the rumor or not.

1066
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:31,943
I had no choice but to run away.

1067
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,225
I'm really sorry.

1068
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,725
Hey, Seojin...

1069
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:40,527
I'm really sorry.

1070
01:01:40,623 --> 01:01:41,226
Please?

1071
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:46,861
Jungi, I have something to tell you.

1072
01:01:46,946 --> 01:01:47,746
Tell me?

1073
01:01:48,546 --> 01:01:49,350
What is it?

1074
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,953
Let's take some time to think about us.

1075
01:01:54,345 --> 01:01:55,056
What?

1076
01:01:56,938 --> 01:01:59,144
Time to think about us?

1077
01:02:00,745 --> 01:02:02,127
What do you mean?

1078
01:02:02,717 --> 01:02:03,921
Just...

1079
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,120
Let's just rethink
about our relationship.

1080
01:02:09,912 --> 01:02:10,508
What?

1081
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:15,799
God, what kind of person is he?

1082
01:02:15,884 --> 01:02:18,792
I think "Yang Hwa Bridge"
and "Ma Po Bridge" are exactly same.

1083
01:02:18,884 --> 01:02:22,485
He copied the song,
but he's yelling at you.

1084
01:02:24,295 --> 01:02:26,096
Yuna, cheer up.

1085
01:02:26,191 --> 01:02:27,990
He's weird, not you.

1086
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:30,387
It's fine.

1087
01:02:31,086 --> 01:02:33,658
I already gave up on becoming a rapper.

1088
01:02:36,597 --> 01:02:38,091
But Donggu...

1089
01:02:40,272 --> 01:02:42,676
Why am I bad at everything?

1090
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:44,770
Baking,

1091
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:46,575
and rap too...

1092
01:02:48,862 --> 01:02:51,273
Why do you think so negatively?

1093
01:02:51,372 --> 01:02:52,557
I'm sorry.

1094
01:02:53,367 --> 01:02:56,557
I know you're trying hard to cheer me up.

1095
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:58,747
But I just can't.

1096
01:03:01,647 --> 01:03:04,047
Really! This woman!

1097
01:03:04,259 --> 01:03:05,157
Yuna.

1098
01:03:05,547 --> 01:03:07,870
I prepared something just for you.

1099
01:03:08,645 --> 01:03:09,645
What is it?

1100
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,533
♪ Yeah.

1101
01:03:13,912 --> 01:03:14,726
♪ Get it!

1102
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,520
♪ Hurt by exam!

1103
01:03:16,628 --> 01:03:18,821
♪ Stuck in your heart! You cry!

1104
01:03:18,914 --> 01:03:21,612
♪ Even if you're sad or lonely,
Donggu never cries.

1105
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:23,419
♪ No, Yuna!

1106
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:26,221
Donggu, what are you doing?

1107
01:03:26,321 --> 01:03:28,413
♪ Look at my eyes. Red Sun!

1108
01:03:28,516 --> 01:03:31,310
♪ Forget about Dot Copy! Erase him!

1109
01:03:31,424 --> 01:03:35,211
♪ And run! Run for your dream!
You're just going! Where?

1110
01:03:37,316 --> 01:03:39,211
Okay! Again, again!

1111
01:03:39,304 --> 01:03:40,591
♪ You just go!

1112
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:45,495
You laughed, right? Right?

1113
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,186
So, now you're ok?

1114
01:03:48,882 --> 01:03:52,385
God, it's really hard to cheer you up.

1115
01:03:52,668 --> 01:03:53,972
God, I'm so embarrassed.

1116
01:03:54,074 --> 01:03:56,573
Why? You are good at it.

1117
01:03:57,676 --> 01:03:59,177
Not so well like you.

1118
01:04:00,074 --> 01:04:02,271
Seol, am I good at rapping?

1119
01:04:06,045 --> 01:04:08,846
"Ms. Han Yuna, you passed baking
license exam. Visit website for details."

1120
01:04:09,748 --> 01:04:10,941
Why? What is it?

1121
01:04:11,145 --> 01:04:12,643
I passed!

1122
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,950
Donggu! I passed the license exam!

1123
01:04:16,047 --> 01:04:17,149
Really?

1124
01:04:19,066 --> 01:04:22,300
See? I told you! You will pass the exam.

1125
01:04:22,364 --> 01:04:23,771
Congratulations!

1126
01:04:23,867 --> 01:04:24,973
Thank you!

1127
01:04:25,063 --> 01:04:26,576
Wait, wait.

1128
01:04:26,678 --> 01:04:28,267
We can't just spend today like this.

1129
01:04:28,373 --> 01:04:29,568
Let's party! Party!

1130
01:04:29,971 --> 01:04:32,376
Just hold on. I'll buy a cake and come.
Alright?

1131
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:40,900
Yuna.

1132
01:05:04,278 --> 01:05:07,485
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1133
01:05:07,588 --> 01:05:09,501
What? Seol's father came?

1134
01:05:09,596 --> 01:05:10,993
How did you?

1135
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:13,777
-Dad.
-Talk about blood.

1136
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:16,482
I want to be responsible
about Yuna and Seol.

1137
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:17,990
Only now you came to be responsible?

1138
01:05:18,093 --> 01:05:19,582
I still love Yuna.

1139
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:21,772
Nothing will change even if you do this.

1140
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:23,772
It doesn't change the fact
that I'm Seol's father.

1141
01:05:23,883 --> 01:05:25,873
I want to be forgiven. Is that impossible?

1142
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:28,268
Why am I keep thinking
about Dusik, that jerk? Why!

1143
01:05:28,371 --> 01:05:31,812
Min Sua, I'm crazy.
Really, truly crazy.

1144
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:33,208
My stomach.

1145
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,407
What's wrong? Are you sick?

1146
01:05:34,503 --> 01:05:36,005
Is Mr. Bong Dusik here?

1147
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,812
I have something to tell you.

1148
01:05:38,914 --> 01:05:41,217
I think I...

1149
01:05:41,314 --> 01:05:44,398
I thought I was really strong. Guess not.

1150
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:47,084
The opportunity that will come
to you just once in your life.

1151
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,189
You will throw that away?

1152
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:49,998
-Change your room first.
-In return...

1153
01:05:50,094 --> 01:05:52,103
You will break up with Seojin?

1154
01:05:52,188 --> 01:05:57,402
I will tell you all about
my rumor with Cindy.
