1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:04,004
Oh dear, let's start cleaning.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,107
Donggu... You...

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,392
That's why you ran out to the
supermarket and the coat...

4
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:15,883
The person you like is not me, but Yuna?

5
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:17,117
What?

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,612
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,690
-Yerin told me everything.
-What?

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:27,227
She promised to keep it a secret.
She told you already?

9
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:34,234
Donggu, did you see Yerin off?

10
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:35,435
What?

11
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,940
This is unbelievable.

12
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:42,242
This is incredible.

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,446
Sua, what's wrong?
Did something happen?

14
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:50,551
Donggu doesn't like me but...

15
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,854
No! Sua, no! No, don't!

16
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,156
What was that?

17
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,158
What's up with them?

18
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,167
I can't breathe.

19
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:05,766
Sorry.

20
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:08,769
Do you really like Yuna?

21
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:11,071
Why did you act like you liked me?

22
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:15,242
-I didn't want her to find out.
-What?

23
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:19,145
You're using me to keep
your feelings secret from Yuna?

24
00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:22,649
It kind of happened. Sorry.

25
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:26,553
Sua, can't you keep this a secret?

26
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,655
-Why?
-Well...

27
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,658
I'm a bit confused.

28
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,560
So, please keep this a secret.

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,863
I beg you, please.

30
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,567
-Fine. Just stop.
-Really?

31
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,067
Yeah. Get out of here.

32
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,371
-Go on.
-Okay, I'll leave.

33
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,645
Can you give this coat to Yuna?

34
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,035
-I bought it for her.
-What?

35
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,351
She easily catches the cold.

36
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,753
-But her coat is not warm enough...
-Fine.

37
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,142
I'll give it to her. All right?

38
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,659
Thank you.
You are the best.

39
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,863
He's unbelievable...

40
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:12,165
That hurts my pride.

41
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,867
Unbelievable...

42
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,179
I can't believe I'm back in this place.

43
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:43,830
-Hello, sir.
-Mr. Bong.

44
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:46,416
When are you going to pay
Malgeum's penalty fees?

45
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,517
Sorry. Please give me more time.

46
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:53,528
I'll get the money,
so please don't say anything to her.

47
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,142
Please...

48
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,479
Hello? Sir?

49
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,483
This is crazy.

50
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,788
You're spending all the money you earned
on pain relief patches.

51
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:22,981
You can't make Malgeum's penalty fees
like this.

52
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:26,273
I have to do something.

53
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,075
Does Malgeum know you're doing this?

54
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,176
She doesn't know, does she?

55
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:31,478
Just tell her how you feel.

56
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,747
After I pay the penalty fees.

57
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,048
Goodness.

58
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,058
Dusik.

59
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,152
-Someone's here for you.
-For me? Who?

60
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:45,759
Malgeum.

61
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:51,774
She's your first love, isn't she?

62
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:52,365
What?

63
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,551
Yes.

64
00:03:56,984 --> 00:03:58,071
Where's the milk?

65
00:03:58,156 --> 00:03:59,172
Milk.

66
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,541
That's my milk.

67
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,243
Malgeum likes lattes.

68
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:08,849
Goodness, look at that. He was dying
just before. He looks lively now.

69
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:12,219
The power of love is incredible.

70
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,096
Yes, it is incredible.
Right, Donggu?

71
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,426
What?
I don't know.

72
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,897
-Yuna, you can have this.
-What?

73
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,699
Why are you giving this to me?

74
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:29,620
You can take it. It's too small for me.

75
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:33,227
I can't take it. Donggu gave it to you.

76
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:36,207
It's fine. He won't mind at all.

77
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:37,911
-Right, Donggu?
-What?

78
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:40,714
Yes, of course.

79
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,017
Don't worry. Just take it.

80
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:47,821
Sua and I are just friends.

81
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,124
That's right. We're friends.

82
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,593
Maybe Donggu loves someone else.

83
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:55,595
What?

84
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,903
Anyway, you can have this.

85
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:05,623
Be nice. Don't throw it to her.

86
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:07,507
I didn't want to throw it.

87
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,018
But Seol cries when I go near her.

88
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,613
-That's ridiculous.
-Watch.

89
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,018
You made her cry.

90
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:22,789
What's going on?

91
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,291
Awesome.

92
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,661
This kid can tell good and evil apart.

93
00:05:27,972 --> 00:05:29,146
She's a genius.

94
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,363
You're evil.

95
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,865
A genius and the devil.

96
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,170
Jungi, what did you just call me?

97
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,872
-I'll kill you.
-I lost it for a moment.

98
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,677
These photos are bringing back memories.

99
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:46,980
You and I were inseparable. Right?

100
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,585
-Since when did you like me?
-What?

101
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,621
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,023
What are these?

103
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,525
What are these?

104
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:01,628
That's...

105
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:02,960
You liked me, didn't you?

106
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,150
Since when?

107
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,634
Am I your first love?

108
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,157
No, this is...

109
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,535
I brought some pain relief patches.

110
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,070
I didn't know you had a guest.

111
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:11,052
Who is she?

112
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:14,367
-A friend of mine.
-A friend?

113
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:18,178
-Oh, you're his first love?
-Hey!

114
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:20,266
What are you talking about?
That's not true.

115
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,216
-Get out.
-Fine, I'll go.

116
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,219
I brought you pain relief patches
and now you're scolding me.

117
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:28,121
Get out.

118
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:31,358
-Have a good time.
-Hey!

119
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,231
Why do you need pain relies patches?
Are you hurt?

120
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:41,668
It's nothing. I got hurt working
at the construction site...

121
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,270
Construction site?

122
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:44,037
What?

123
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:48,108
A friend of mine needed help.

124
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:52,695
Are you doing this for the penalty fees?

125
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,515
No, I took care of that already.

126
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,918
-Really?
-Yes.

127
00:06:58,022 --> 00:07:02,122
So, don't worry about that
and just do well at drama auditions.

128
00:07:10,726 --> 00:07:12,716
I can't believe I even have a cold.

129
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:15,635
I won't be able to make
that much money like this.

130
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,539
Darn it.

131
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,636
"Well-paying part-time job"

132
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:28,715
Two million won in one week?

133
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:30,216
Two million won?

134
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:32,218
-Two million won?
-Yes.

135
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:35,522
I want to do this too.

136
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,525
But it's a test for a cold medicine,
so only ones with a cold can participate.

137
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,526
A cold?

138
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,929
-I can catch a cold.
-How?

139
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,132
Let's go!

140
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,002
Jungi, do you have to do this?

141
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:51,705
Of course.
It pays two million won in a week.

142
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,406
Two million won! Two million won!

143
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,010
-Pour it!
-Don't blame me later.

144
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,511
Here we go.

145
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:04,417
-It's cold.
-Are you okay?

146
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,569
It's cold.

147
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:08,455
Let's go, cold!

148
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:17,731
Let's do this! Let's go, cold!

149
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,698
Seol, don't cry.

150
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:24,004
Look at this, my dear.

151
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,806
Stop crying.

152
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,813
Alright.

153
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,416
What's wrong?

154
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,118
Let's see.

155
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:40,020
-Stop.
-I got you.

156
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,221
What's wrong?

157
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,523
Give me a break.

158
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,525
Hoon, one moment.

159
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:49,929
Excuse me, can I help?

160
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,431
Sorry?

161
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,033
Hoon, wait just a moment.

162
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,912
What a fun noise, right?

163
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:09,115
Stop crying and play with this
with your mommy.

164
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,521
That was awesome.

165
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,822
Babies have sensitive ears,
so they like noises like this.

166
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:18,224
Thank you.

167
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,526
You saved me.

168
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,829
-It was nothing.
-Thank you.

169
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:28,535
Let's go.

170
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,741
Dad, why are you staring?

171
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,445
She reminds me of me in the past.

172
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,650
I was just like her when you were a baby.

173
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,352
I didn't know what I was doing.

174
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,055
I think it's something else.

175
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:53,059
Dad, did you fall in love at first sight?

176
00:09:58,128 --> 00:09:59,833
Where's Jungi and Dusik?

177
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,235
Dusik is sick.

178
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,338
Jungi's probably doing something crazy.

179
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:07,340
Are you in a hurry?

180
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:09,242
Why are you eating so
fast while standing up?

181
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,045
-I have to eat when I can.
-Why?

182
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,930
That's why.

183
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:23,556
Seol doesn't want to
be separated from Yuna.

184
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,960
That's why she can't sleep or do anything.

185
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,461
Really?

186
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:35,368
Why are you dressed like that?

187
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,769
Where have you been?

188
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,969
-I went for a walk.
-A walk? In this cold?

189
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,242
-Dressed like that?
-I have to catch a cold.

190
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:43,443
You have to catch a cold?

191
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,136
Can you explain it so we can understand?

192
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:50,150
I need to catch a cold
to participate in a clinical test.

193
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:52,051
Isn't there a better way to catch a cold?

194
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:54,053
-You're crazy.
-I'm dying.

195
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,755
Oh, that's it.

196
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:58,858
What the hell?

197
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,860
Why are you eating my candy?

198
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,762
I'm trying to catch your cold.

199
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,565
That's disgusting.
You can't catch a cold like that.

200
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,766
Yes, this is not enough.

201
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:08,067
You can have this.

202
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:09,602
Darn it!

203
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:12,405
I need to find a way to catch a cold now.

204
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,010
I have an idea.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,187
What's with that tongue?
Don't give me that dirty look.

206
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,014
Why?

207
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,716
I thought of a way to catch a cold
for sure.

208
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:24,918
Dusik.

209
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,353
Let's kiss.

210
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:30,757
What? Kiss? Are you insane?

211
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:31,949
Don't come closer. Go away.

212
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:34,027
I haven't even kissed a woman. Go away.

213
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,828
It's okay. It'll be quick.

214
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:37,931
Don't closer, you lunatic.
I haven't even kissed a woman.

215
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,134
Dusik, come here.

216
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,169
That's disgusting.

217
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,838
"Waikiki Guesthouse & Hostel"

218
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,587
Seol, where's your mommy?

219
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,490
What's going on here?

220
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,396
What's happening here?

221
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,097
Donggu!

222
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,300
Yuna! Wake up.

223
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,410
Why are you sleeping here?

224
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,382
I put Seol to sleep and started studying.
I must've dozed off.

225
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:40,053
Then Donggu, why were you sleeping here?

226
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,755
Next to Yuna at that.

227
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,559
Actually, I...

228
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,629
Gosh, my head...

229
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:53,933
I drank so much yesterday.
I didn't even know I fell asleep here.

230
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,335
I'm telling the truth.

231
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,404
-I'm so hung over...
-Stop drinking.

232
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:00,707
Don't you feel sorry for your liver?

233
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,510
Are you hungry?
I'll make some breakfast.

234
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,066
-I'll help.
-Thanks.

235
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,880
You can take Seol.

236
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,584
Good morning, Seol.

237
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,486
Did you sleep well?

238
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,490
Excuse me.

239
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:18,891
Hot water, please.

240
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,793
One moment.

241
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,613
-Yuna, what are you doing?
-What?

242
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,705
What's wrong?

243
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:35,108
Oh no!

244
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,110
That's hot!

245
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,812
Are you okay?

246
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:41,214
Yuna, are you okay?

247
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,316
I'm okay.

248
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,420
I'm sorry. I'm all over the place
these days.

249
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:51,424
This won't do. You're on a holiday
from now on.

250
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,920
So, get out of the house
and do everything that you wanted to do.

251
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:57,430
No, I'm fine.

252
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,198
Do as you're told.

253
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:00,433
Are you disobeying your boss?

254
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:01,934
No, but...

255
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:04,843
Go on. Get out of here.

256
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,039
Yes, take a break.

257
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,413
-But...
-Go on.

258
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:12,211
Come on. Bye, Mommy.

259
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:20,219
All done. Press on it
until it stops bleeding.

260
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,324
-And take this pill at 9 o'clock.
-Okay.

261
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,429
Dusik, this is a great gig.

262
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,731
I could do this for the rest of my life.

263
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,002
We just draw blood, take the pills
on our backs and get paid two million won.

264
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,204
-This is easy money. Right?
-Yes.

265
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:46,078
"Malgeum"

266
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,082
Isn't that Malgeum?

267
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,784
Why aren't you answering it?

268
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,588
I don't want to make her worry.

269
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,891
Why would she be worried?

270
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:09,202
Seol, Mommy is taking a break today. So,
we're going to have a fun time together.

271
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,705
You're doing everything for her.

272
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,707
You're even taking care of her baby.

273
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,510
When we were together,
you were so selfish.

274
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,512
You've changed a lot.

275
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,781
I haven't.

276
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:25,785
What is it, Seol?

277
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:27,787
Do you want some too?

278
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,490
You can't have this yet.

279
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,793
You can't have this.

280
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,300
All right, Seol.
I gave you abalone porridge,

281
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:44,303
so let's sit still for a while. Okay?

282
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:46,706
You're happy. I'm happy.

283
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:51,010
Where are the birthday party videos?

284
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,614
It's time to take your pill.

285
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,916
Do we have to take it again?
We sure take it...

286
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:00,820
-What happened to my voice?
-Yes, it's weird...

287
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:02,922
What happened to my voice?

288
00:17:03,026 --> 00:17:05,591
Is it because we have a bad cold?

289
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,900
Don't I sound sexy?

290
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,503
Dusik.

291
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,485
It's been a long time
since we lied down together.

292
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,208
Gosh, I'm too shy!

293
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,410
You're so sexy.

294
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:26,112
Gosh, I'm too shy!

295
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:28,614
Excuse me.

296
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,416
Just take your pills.

297
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:31,717
Okay.

298
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:33,486
I don't want to take the pill.

299
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,888
Shall I feed it to you? Come here.

300
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,592
-Baby, kiss me.
-Oh my god.

301
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,897
Oh my god.

302
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,374
I'm so tired.

303
00:17:56,876 --> 00:18:00,546
How long do I have to keep
filming birthday parties?

304
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:03,649
I miss making movies.

305
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,750
What are you doing?

306
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,754
Can't you tell? I'm having a coffee
and editing birthday party videos.

307
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:10,456
Really? Where's Seol?

308
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,258
Seol? She's right here...

309
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,361
Where's Seol?

310
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:16,562
Where's she?

311
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,967
-Seol!
-She's obviously not under there.

312
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,869
-Where is she?
-Can't you see that I'm looking for her?

313
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,172
"-Where is she?
-Seol!

314
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,573
-Seol!
-Seol!

315
00:18:27,701 --> 00:18:29,569
Seol is not in here.

316
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:30,476
-Seol!
-Seol!

317
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,378
-Seol!
-Seol, where are you?

318
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:33,379
Seol.

319
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,448
Seol, where are you?

320
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,934
Seol, are you here?

321
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:40,653
Here she is. No, she's not.

322
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:41,854
Seol.

323
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,459
Seol!

324
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,768
Where is she?

325
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,563
What are you going to do?

326
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,734
-What if something happened to her?
-I'm going crazy too!

327
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,737
How will we find her?

328
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:00,439
That's right.

329
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:10,148
This is the amazing plan to find Seol?

330
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:12,764
She cries when Sua comes within 1m of her.

331
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,455
-We'll find her faster this way.
-Hey!

332
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:19,358
Am I a metal detector? Am I a radar?

333
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,394
You're mistreating me.

334
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,497
We have to find her.
Stretch out your arms a bit more.

335
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,999
Good. Here we go.

336
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,404
This way.

337
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:40,680
Isn't that Seol crying?

338
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,753
Look.
There's nothing in here.

339
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,756
I definitely heard something.

340
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:52,558
Maybe she's in her bed.

341
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,759
It's not possible.

342
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,361
She can't climb into...

343
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:56,962
Here she is!

344
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:59,799
-My dear!
-What?

345
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,784
How did she get in there by herself?

346
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,836
How is this possible?

347
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,937
-It's impossible.
-What does it matter?

348
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:07,139
We found her and that's all the matters.

349
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:10,042
Seol, how did you climb into the crib?

350
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,645
I was so worried about you.

351
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:14,547
Thank goodness nothing happened.

352
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:17,850
Wait.

353
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:19,552
Why are her cheeks so red?

354
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,454
Excuse me, Seol.

355
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,723
She has a fever.

356
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:24,824
What?

357
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,527
She does. What's wrong?

358
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:30,251
Seol.

359
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:36,168
Mr. Lee Jungi, Mr. Bong Dusik, wake up.
I need to draw your blood.

360
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,337
Again?

361
00:20:44,347 --> 00:20:46,512
What the hell? What happened to my voice?

362
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,647
What happened to you voice...

363
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:50,649
What the hell? What happened to my voice?

364
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:52,218
What the hell?

365
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:55,121
What's wrong with their voices?

366
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,256
What the hell? My voice is weird too!

367
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:01,127
Mine too.

368
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:03,829
Why is this happening? Oh no!

369
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:06,899
-Doctor!
-What the hell is happening?

370
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:10,002
What happened to my voice?

371
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,303
Darn it.

372
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,310
Electronic.

373
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:20,112
Argentina.

374
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,286
Sundae for one, please.

375
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,088
-One moment.
-Sure.

376
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:34,760
Hello.

377
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:39,664
You helped me with my baby, right?

378
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:41,066
Can't believe we ran
into each other again.

379
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:44,470
Why are you alone? Where's that cute baby?

380
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,373
Dad is looking after her today, huh?

381
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,409
Seol doesn't have a father.
I'm a single parent.

382
00:21:50,499 --> 00:21:52,501
Oh, I see.

383
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:57,082
I asked my helper to take care of Hoon
today.

384
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,286
Then are you on a date with your wife?

385
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:04,063
No, she passed away six years ago.

386
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,494
We don't even know each other's name yet.

387
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,196
I'm Song Hyeonjun.

388
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,664
I'm Han Yuna.

389
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,481
It's great to see you again.

390
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,067
It's great to see you again.

391
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,204
Wait, there's something...

392
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:21,273
-On your coat.
-What?

393
00:22:21,578 --> 00:22:23,375
When did Seol do this?

394
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,713
So, the baby did it.

395
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:31,083
My Hoon threw up a lot too.

396
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:33,285
He ruined all my clothes.

397
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:36,021
Excuse me.

398
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:40,125
Hi, Seojin. What is it?

399
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:41,894
What?

400
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:44,797
Seol?

401
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,834
Okay. I'll be right there.

402
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,402
Did something happen?

403
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,939
-Seol is sick. I have to go.
-Bye.

404
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,013
Seol!

405
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,548
Seol!

406
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,950
What's wrong with her?

407
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,320
She has enteritis.

408
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,522
Enteritis?
Why all of a sudden?

409
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,535
She was fine this morning.

410
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,244
It looks like she ate something bad.

411
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:16,228
I didn't give her anything.

412
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,631
You know that I can't go near her.

413
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:19,932
Well, she ate something.

414
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:23,535
Actually, I fed her something...

415
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:25,604
What did you give her?

416
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:28,207
A little bit of hot dog.

417
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,535
Hot dog?

418
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:34,613
I wasn't going to feed it to her at first
but she was pleading with her eyes.

419
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:40,686
-But it was an organic hot dog.
-Did you feed her anything else?

420
00:23:41,393 --> 00:23:43,589
A tiny bit of ham.

421
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,391
-And abalone...
-Pardon?

422
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:49,295
-Ham and abalone?
-It was abalone porridge.

423
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,562
Are you crazy?

424
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,866
You can't give ham and abalone to her
when she's still breast feeding.

425
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,767
Use your brain.

426
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:58,938
I'm sorry. I thought
it was okay for her to have it.

427
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,541
I'm sorry, Yuna.

428
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,847
No. It's my fault for not telling you
what she can eat.

429
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,518
Seol, Mommy is so sorry.

430
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,745
I shouldn't have left you.

431
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:16,855
I'm sorry.

432
00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:23,062
This is ridiculous.

433
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,664
This is the weirdest side effect.

434
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:28,467
What if our voices don't return to normal?

435
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,436
Tell me about it.

436
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,739
How could they give us
this crappy medicine?

437
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,908
Let's just go home.

438
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,444
Taxi!

439
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,716
Taxi! Taxi!

440
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:48,120
Do you go to Huam-dong?

441
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,612
Huam-dong. Waikiki guest house.

442
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,695
Why are you looking at us like that?

443
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,416
Is it because of our voices?

444
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:02,705
We're not messing with you.

445
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:06,305
We were in a clinical test
and this is a side effect.

446
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:09,041
We're really not messing with you.

447
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,113
What are you doing?

448
00:25:17,334 --> 00:25:19,018
What are you doing?

449
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,820
This is a side effect. We're not kidding.

450
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,322
Don't play with me!

451
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,823
You're mocking me, aren't you?

452
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,226
You're making fun of me!

453
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,796
I'll kill you.
You're dead!

454
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:51,617
What are you doing?

455
00:25:52,604 --> 00:25:54,307
Hey, you're here?

456
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,988
Why don't you go inside?

457
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:57,723
I want to.

458
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:02,294
I can't see their faces
because I feel so guilty.

459
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,499
I'm such an idiot.

460
00:26:09,476 --> 00:26:12,404
Donggu, can I ask you something?

461
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:13,872
What is it?

462
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,974
You having feelings for Yuna...

463
00:26:16,176 --> 00:26:19,411
Have you considered
her situation and Seol?

464
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:21,194
What do you mean?

465
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,215
She's in a tough situation.

466
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:24,583
She has Seol.

467
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:28,887
Are you confident you can bear all that?

468
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,993
You've never thought about that?

469
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:38,888
I may be out of line,

470
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,701
but if you can't handle her situation,
don't start anything with her.

471
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:46,905
She has enough wounds already.

472
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,890
Didn't you say you'll be gone for days?
Why are you already back?

473
00:26:57,487 --> 00:26:59,384
Have you finished the part-time job?

474
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:04,823
So, did you make some money?

475
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,694
How much?

476
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:14,099
-Use your words!
-That hurts.

477
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,474
Don't hit me!

478
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,490
What happened to your voice?

479
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,973
It's a side effect of the drug.

480
00:27:22,294 --> 00:27:23,709
This is all your fault!

481
00:27:23,817 --> 00:27:26,411
-You found that stupid gig.
-I didn't ask you to come with me.

482
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,980
You came voluntarily!

483
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:31,173
-Don't yell at me!
-I didn't do anything wrong!

484
00:27:31,257 --> 00:27:33,252
This happened because you found
that stupid part-time job!

485
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,354
Are they Minions?

486
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,256
Idiots.

487
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,276
"Malgeum"

488
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,365
It's Malgeum.

489
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,285
I can't answer the phone with this voice.
What do I do?

490
00:27:50,482 --> 00:27:52,504
Seojin, can you take it for me?

491
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,107
Give it here.

492
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,477
Hello.

493
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,848
Yes, this is Dusik's phone.
But he's in the bathroom.

494
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:05,684
I can leave a message for you.

495
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,086
Okay.

496
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,388
Bye.

497
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:11,965
-What did she say?
-She has something to say,

498
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:13,679
and she's waiting outside.

499
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:16,580
What?
Something to say? Out of the blue?

500
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:19,364
Maybe she's going to ask you out.

501
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,569
Ask me out? No way.

502
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:25,244
You like that idea, don't you?

503
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,539
You're kind of anticipating it,
aren't you?

504
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,443
Stop it.

505
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:33,931
Why is this happening to me?

506
00:28:40,896 --> 00:28:42,788
Sorry for calling you outside so suddenly.

507
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:47,092
I have something to say to you.

508
00:28:49,403 --> 00:28:50,295
Well...

509
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,298
Actually...

510
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:57,296
I decided to work with
Director Tak again.

511
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,103
What?

512
00:28:58,983 --> 00:29:00,405
What are you talking about?

513
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,208
Dusik, what happened to your voice?

514
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,013
I have a cold.

515
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,218
You're working with Director Tak again?

516
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,721
Does that mean you'll be doing porn again?

517
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:22,928
No. Director Tak is producing a TV drama
in China and he wants to cast me in it.

518
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,530
So, I'm going to China.

519
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:27,633
-When?
-Tomorrow.

520
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:31,136
Because I have to start
shooting the movie soon.

521
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,537
That soon?

522
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:37,834
Malgeum, did he tell you something?

523
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,044
Tell me what?

524
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:43,348
Oh, that you're paying
the penalty fees for me?

525
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,251
I knew that.

526
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,154
And that you were doing
part-time jobs because of that.

527
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,857
But I just pretended not to know.

528
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,060
Because I really wanted a new start.

529
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:58,096
Then, are you working with
him again because of money?

530
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,265
I'll get the money somehow.

531
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:01,967
-So, please...
-No.

532
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,869
It's not just because of money.

533
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,671
I want to do this.

534
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:11,877
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't do anything else.

535
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:15,981
So, I want to start fresh in a country
where no one knows me.

536
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,285
Do you have to go?

537
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:23,889
Can't you stay?

538
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,857
This is a great opportunity for me.

539
00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:28,960
I don't want to miss this chance.

540
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:34,191
You will support me, right?

541
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:40,672
Thank you. I really wanted
to hear that you support me.

542
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,008
I almost forgot.

543
00:30:43,915 --> 00:30:48,280
I found some photos of us
when I was packing.

544
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:56,888
Dusik...

545
00:30:57,297 --> 00:31:00,559
Thank you so much for everything.

546
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,863
I should go now.

547
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,283
Take care.

548
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:31,323
What are those hearts?

549
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,924
She's my first love.

550
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:06,925
Seol, do you feel better?

551
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:10,330
Did you stomach hurt
because of that stupid guy?

552
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:11,329
My dear.

553
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,232
You're so stupid.

554
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:18,437
How could you feed ham and abalone
to a baby who's still breast feeding?

555
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,939
That's enough. He didn't know.

556
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,942
It's okay, Donggu. Seol is all better now.

557
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:26,645
Seol, come here.

558
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,449
My baby. You're all better, aren't you?

559
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,368
I may be out of line,

560
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:37,055
but if you can't handle her situation,
don't start anything with her.

561
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:41,460
She has enough wounds already.

562
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,595
Can I handle it?

563
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,663
I couldn't even take care of Seol.

564
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:47,966
Are you okay?

565
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,569
I can't even look after myself.

566
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:58,276
Why is he sulking like he's the victim?

567
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:03,293
You're so laid back.

568
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:06,685
You don't have a job
but you're taking a nap.

569
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:09,404
I slept for a few hours after preparing
for the interview all night.

570
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:13,592
You're an actor who does
weird part-time jobs.

571
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,794
What? Weird part-time jobs?

572
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:19,798
I contributed to the development
of Korean medicine.

573
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:24,512
You should give up on job hunting
and just participate in clinical tests.

574
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,304
Like for depilatory for women.

575
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,606
Not a lot of women can grow a beard.

576
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,908
-Shave, shave.
-I'll kill you!

577
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,911
-Do you want to die?!
-Chewbacca's killing a human being.

578
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,413
Help me, Jedi.

579
00:33:35,525 --> 00:33:38,964
Stop it.
Why do you guys fight all the time?

580
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,569
Let them. They'll fall in love soon.

581
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:43,455
What? Fall in love?

582
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,757
What a horrible thing to say!

583
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:49,828
-He's the worst man I know.
-What?

584
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:53,632
Even if we get stranded on an island,
nothing will happen between us.

585
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:54,933
Same here.

586
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:59,212
I'd rather live with a sea turtle
than with you.

587
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:02,608
Sea turtles can't grow facial hair.
Smooth, smooth.

588
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,223
That sea turtle just called to say
she hates a pathetic loser like you.

589
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:07,312
A pathetic loser?!

590
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,814
-What? Darn it.
-This darn woman!

591
00:34:09,906 --> 00:34:11,716
-This brat!
-What?

592
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:15,921
-This is mine.
-No, it's not.

593
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:22,627
Why did you buy the same phone as mine?

594
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:23,796
I bought it first.

595
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,997
There's nothing I like about you.

596
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,101
What's that?

597
00:34:30,312 --> 00:34:31,503
What is that noise?

598
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:35,106
♪ I'm waiting for you

599
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:38,678

00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:47,185
Why is he singing that song
with that voice?

602
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,486
Try to understand.

603
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:50,555
Malgeum is going to China today.

604
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,258
The side effect is lasting a long time.

605
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:55,360
He took the pills exactly on time.

606
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:03,735
Donggu, make Dusik stop.

607
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:04,736

621
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,994
I am a coward.

622
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,799
I am a coward!

623
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,602
Malgeum...

624
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,304
I'm Prosecutor Kang Jihwan
from Seoul Prosecution.

625
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:16,107
Do you want to do this the easy way
or the hard way?

626
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,609
It's up to you.

627
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,278
But if you choose to do the hard way,

628
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,098
you better prepare to die.

629
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:24,683
What are you doing?

630
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:26,484
Can't you see?

631
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,586
What role are you playing this time?

632
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:30,989
I'm a prosecutor.

633
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,993
A heroic prosecutor who fights gangsters.

634
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,294
A prosecutor?

635
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,097
With that face? Not a gangster or a bully?

636
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,585
The director is not
a good judge of character.

637
00:36:40,684 --> 00:36:42,701
Don't say that, Chewbacca.

638
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,585
I'm going to have some ramyeon.

639
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:48,073
She never supports me.

640
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,177
Why isn't the stove working?

641
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,479
Jungi, can you take a look?

642
00:36:55,485 --> 00:36:57,248
You're only nice to me
when you want something.

643
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:58,750
Come.

644
00:36:58,868 --> 00:37:00,852
Why isn't this working?

645
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,855
It was working fine.
Move.

646
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,025
Why isn't this working?

647
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:11,429
Let's see.

648
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:13,331
So weird. The gas valve is already open.

649
00:37:16,158 --> 00:37:17,460
Jungi!

650
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:22,273
Darn it.

651
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:28,680
Why did you turn it on
when I had my face in the stove?

652
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:30,064
Sorry.

653
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:32,884
I didn't know it'd turn on so suddenly.

654
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:34,886
Fire tends to turn on suddenly!

655
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:38,690
Oh no...

656
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:42,494
I can't go to the shooting
looking like this.

657
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,196
You've been in a bad mood all day.

658
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,698
Is something on your mind?

659
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,101
Let him be. He's always sulky.

660
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,003
Stop sulking.

661
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:55,406
That's enough. I'm in a bad mood...

662
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,612
What's going on? Where is your eyebrow?

663
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:02,514
Did you wax it off?

664
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,616
You're missing an eyebrow.

665
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,502
Don't laugh!

666
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:07,786
Your sister did this.

667
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,020
Don't laugh!

668
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,424
What's that?

669
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,727
-Plamodel.
-Plamodel?

670
00:38:17,286 --> 00:38:18,563
Your voice is back.

671
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,365
I got it back this morning.

672
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:24,169
-Why do you have a plamodel?
-Because I'm feeling blue.

673
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,543
What happened to your eyebrow?

674
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:34,045
Don't laugh! Don't laugh!

675
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,648
You were feeling depressed, remember?

676
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:40,151
Why did you buy a plamodel
when you're feeling blue?

677
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:44,055
I thought it'd help me
organize my thoughts.

678
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,190
Yes.

679
00:38:45,304 --> 00:38:47,992
Dusik, let's do it together.

680
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:52,573
-I have a lot on my mind.
-Yes, let's.

681
00:38:52,684 --> 00:38:55,200
Isn't that face super funny?

682
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:56,801
Totally.

683
00:38:58,614 --> 00:38:59,904
Just shave the other one off too.

684
00:38:59,997 --> 00:39:01,706
You look like Harvey Dent.

685
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:03,308
Don't laugh!

686
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,412
Donggu.

687
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:10,514
Have you ever made a plamodel?

688
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,820
This is harder than it looks.
It's not for everyone.

689
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:16,621
What?

690
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,525
I can finish it in half a day.

691
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:21,811
Oh, you can?

692
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:27,432
I don't eat or sleep once I open the box.

693
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,800
Can you do that?

694
00:39:29,249 --> 00:39:32,937
Quit now if you're going to give up later.

695
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,440
I won't give up.

696
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,344
If you're not up to it, quit now.

697
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,147
Then, let's begin.

698
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,349
Let's go.

699
00:39:49,328 --> 00:39:51,222
Sua, what do you think?

700
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,225
You look like a fool with a drawn eyebrow.

701
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:55,994
What? Stupid?

702
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:57,896
Darn it.

703
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:00,899
Sua.

704
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:01,900
What about this?

705
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,799
You look like a fool with a tape on.

706
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,303
Fool with a tape?

707
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,005
Darn it!

708
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,506
This is driving me nuts.

709
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:12,010
Kang Seojin ruined my life.

710
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,409
"Mona Lisa Wigs"

711
00:40:18,118 --> 00:40:19,017
Jungi.

712
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,111
Ask them if they make eyebrow wigs.

713
00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:23,521
Are you kidding?

714
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,616
You're just pouring oil to the fire.

715
00:40:26,746 --> 00:40:27,825
Forget it then.

716
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:29,727
There it is.

717
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,134
Kang Seojin.

718
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:32,830
How are you going to fix this?

719
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,634
-I can't go to the shoot like this.
-I said I'm sorry.

720
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,037
-I'm going to the interview.
-Seojin!

721
00:40:39,234 --> 00:40:41,940
How can you go to the interview
after ruining my shooting today?

722
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,642
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

723
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,044
Good luck!

724
00:40:48,534 --> 00:40:51,015
- Seojin, wait up!
- What?

725
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,554
"Mona Lisa Wigs"

726
00:40:58,701 --> 00:41:00,124
Good luck with your interview.

727
00:41:00,312 --> 00:41:02,026
I'm always rooting for you.

728
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:05,196
-Good luck.
-Okay...

729
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:06,798
Thanks.

730
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:08,499
-I'll do my best.
-High-five.

731
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,202
Here I go.

732
00:41:22,594 --> 00:41:24,515
You're next. Just wait.

733
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:26,402
"Job interviews"

734
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:30,207
Last question. Why do you want
to become a journalist?

735
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:34,125
I believe journalists
can change the world.

736
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:40,089
I want to correct injustice with
my articles and speak for the weak.

737
00:41:40,196 --> 00:41:44,002
I want to make this world a better place.

738
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:47,705
That's why I want to become a journalist.

739
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:48,701
Great.

740
00:41:48,878 --> 00:41:50,289
Well done.

741
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:53,378
-We'll let you know the result.
-Thank you.

742
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:59,083
Wait, Ms. Kang.

743
00:41:59,868 --> 00:42:02,387
Yes? What's wrong?

744
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:06,057
There's something on your back.

745
00:42:08,149 --> 00:42:08,750
Wait.

746
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,461
Why is that...

747
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:11,362
What is this?

748
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:13,931
"Baldness, it could happen to you too."

749
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:15,733
"Prepare for it in advance."

750
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,736
Did you bring this for me?

751
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:23,007
-No! No, sir.
-Okay.

752
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,509
You can go now.

753
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,815
Why was this stuck on my back?

754
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:33,518
Wait.

755
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,421
I'm always rooting for you. Good luck!

756
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:38,923
Is that what he was doing?

757
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:42,827
Lee Jungi, you crazy jerk.

758
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:50,435
Are you kidding me?

759
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,537
What happened to your face?

760
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:55,239
Where's your eyebrow?

761
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,010
-I'm sorry.
-That doesn't fix the problem.

762
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,400
You don't look like an elite prosecutor.

763
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,815
Can't we do some special make-up?

764
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:05,716
Do you know how much that costs?

765
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,706
Darn it. We have to shoot
and this is frustrating.

766
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:13,858
Wait.

767
00:43:19,868 --> 00:43:22,033
-That will work.
-Pardon?

768
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:27,131
I'm Prosecutor Kang Jihwan
from Seoul Prosecution.

769
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:29,307
Do you want to do this the easy way
or the hard way?

770
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,634
It's up to you.

771
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,244
But if you choose to do the hard way,
you better prepare to die.

772
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:36,047
Shut your mouth.

773
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:40,351
I don't care who you are.
If you move a muscle, I'll...

774
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:43,254
Cut! Cut!

775
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:45,857
What the hell was that?

776
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,758
Is that the best you can do?

777
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:51,362
You have the scariest looking
face but you're acting like that?

778
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:53,364
-You're pissing me off.
-I'm sorry.

779
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,867
It's because my role suddenly changed.

780
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:58,736
I'll try it again.

781
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:00,134
Let's go again.

782
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:03,741
This is all Kang Seojin's fault.

783
00:44:06,733 --> 00:44:07,945
Darn it!

784
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:10,148
Darn it!

785
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:16,654
When he comes home, I'll...

786
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,926
-Seojin!
-Lee Jungi!

787
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,961
You did this, didn't you?

788
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,467
Do you know what happened
because of this?

789
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:30,068
I got scolded by the director
and got my role taken away!

790
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,769
I already apologized for that.

791
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,338
Do you even know how important
that interview was to me?

792
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:37,134
Are you going to take responsibility
if I fail the interview?

793
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:37,942
What?

794
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:41,316
Fix my eyebrow then.

795
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,014
Are you kidding me?!

796
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:46,317
-Darn it!
-Darn it!

797
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:55,092
Seojin, what is it?

798
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:57,995
Who is that text from?

799
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,200
"We regret to inform you
that you failed the interview"

800
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:08,906
Seojin!

801
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,508
What does it say?

802
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:15,213
She failed her interview.

803
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,048
-What?
-Oh no.

804
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:19,850
That was a stupid prank.

805
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:23,254
This is not my fault.

806
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:26,457
I'm also a victim.

807
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,960
Darn it.

808
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,261
Goodness.

809
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,564
Poor Seojin.

810
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,900
There's nothing she can do.

811
00:45:38,267 --> 00:45:41,372
Are those guys still doing that?

812
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,975
They haven't eaten all day.

813
00:45:44,968 --> 00:45:46,377
Aren't they hungry?

814
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,453
I'm hungry.

815
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,622
My back hurts.

816
00:45:57,822 --> 00:45:59,924
My eyes hurt too. I'm dying.

817
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:05,596
I'm so tired that I can't even think
let alone organize my thoughts.

818
00:46:06,334 --> 00:46:08,299
Isn't he tired?

819
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,801
Persistent jerk.

820
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,334
I'm tired.

821
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:18,609
I'm so tired that my body's becoming numb.

822
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,779
Why does he seem okay?

823
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,681
Persistent jerk.

824
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,183
Dusik.

825
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,452
How much did we make?

826
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:29,884
Are we almost done?

827
00:46:29,968 --> 00:46:32,456
I don't know. Let's see.

828
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:33,491
Let's see.

829
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,679
What the hell?

830
00:46:38,763 --> 00:46:40,665
There's still so much left.

831
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:42,067
Darn it.

832
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,586
When are we going to finish this?

833
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,571
I'm so tired.

834
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,033
Dusik.

835
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:59,250
I can do this all day, but look.

836
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,752
"Men on a Mission" is on.

837
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:05,556
I'm a big fan of the show,
so I never miss it.

838
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,557
Do you want to watch it?

839
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,250
Please say yes.

840
00:47:09,334 --> 00:47:12,663
Let's take a break for an hour. Please.

841
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:16,067
I can also do this all night,

842
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,870
but I am also a huge fan
of the show like you.

843
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,974
Let's watch the show
and come back to this.

844
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:25,976
Thank goodness.

845
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:30,247
I don't care which show we watch.
Let's take a break.

846
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:32,583
Where are you guys going?

847
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:34,785
-Are you done?
-Not yet.

848
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:38,168
'Men on a Mission' is on TV right now.

849
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:40,391
-I'm a big fan of that show.
-Me too.

850
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,690
I never miss that show.

851
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,595
I even joined Seo Janghoon's fan club.

852
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:46,597
-True story.
-Really?

853
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:48,866
But it was canceled today.

854
00:47:55,067 --> 00:47:56,974
Oh, I see...

855
00:47:57,968 --> 00:48:02,869
We should keep making this
since the show is not on today.

856
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:03,981
Of course.

857
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:07,184
We should since the
show is not on TV today.

858
00:48:07,868 --> 00:48:09,487
Let's get back to the plamodel.

859
00:48:16,683 --> 00:48:18,262
Where's Donggu and Dusik?

860
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:19,597
I don't know.

861
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:22,268
They stayed up all night making
that plamodel.

862
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:24,268
They're still doing that?

863
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:26,837
They're more tenacious than I thought.

864
00:48:26,953 --> 00:48:29,106
They must have a lot on their minds.

865
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,008
I feel sorry for them.

866
00:48:35,403 --> 00:48:36,614
Where's Seojin?

867
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,015
She doesn't want to eat.

868
00:48:38,133 --> 00:48:41,719
She's been crying all day in bed.
I'm worried.

869
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,801
-Go and apologize to her first.
-Why?

870
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,393
I'm the victim here. Look at my eyebrow.

871
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,595
But what you did was way worse.

872
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,397
Let her win for once.

873
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:56,667
She's right. Seojin is crying
her eyes out.

874
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,971
All right. She's so petty.

875
00:49:17,694 --> 00:49:19,290
Chewbacca, have some breakfast.

876
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,492
I don't want to talk. Just leave.

877
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,098
I'm sorry.

878
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,702
I thought you'd notice it
before you got to the interview.

879
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,004
Forgive me.

880
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,706
Just leave.

881
00:49:35,801 --> 00:49:38,008
I'm apologizing first.
Can't you just forgive me?

882
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:41,912
It's not all my fault that
you failed the interview.

883
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:43,714
I know that.

884
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,417
I know that it's not
your fault that I failed.

885
00:49:46,501 --> 00:49:48,219
Then why are you so mad at me?

886
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:50,821
It's not like this is your first time
failing an interview.

887
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:54,425
This was... my last interview.

888
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:56,339
What are you talking about?

889
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:57,528
Your last interview?

890
00:49:57,628 --> 00:50:01,098
I decided if fail this interview,
I'd give up on becoming a journalist

891
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,701
and look for another job.

892
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:08,706
But now that I've actually failed
the interview, I feel so sad.

893
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,211
So just get out of my room!

894
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,814
Just leave me alone!

895
00:50:39,127 --> 00:50:40,037
Guys.

896
00:50:40,234 --> 00:50:41,038
Guys.

897
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,634
What are you doing?

898
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,142
Sleep in your beds.

899
00:50:45,234 --> 00:50:47,177
Sleep? Who's sleeping?

900
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:48,379
Me?

901
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:49,680
I'm not sleeping.

902
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,285
I was just blinking very slowly.

903
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:59,890
-Dusik, were you sleeping?
-No, I wasn't.

904
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,092
I was just thinking about something.

905
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:04,995
About how we can make this model cooler.

906
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:09,900
I actually slept like a baby.

907
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,924
I woke up when I was just about
to enter the rem sleep stage.

908
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,608
I want to sleep in my bed.

909
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:21,312
But Donggu will make fun of me.

910
00:51:21,634 --> 00:51:23,314
Darn it.

911
00:51:23,634 --> 00:51:24,915
I want to sleep.

912
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:27,518
My eyes are shutting down.

913
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,120
Should I go to bed?

914
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:35,634
But Dusik will make fun of me.

915
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,227
What do I do?

916
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,904
Oh no, look what happened.

917
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,512
What happened?

918
00:51:48,597 --> 00:51:50,320
Look at this.

919
00:51:50,501 --> 00:51:54,311
My fingers are glued together.

920
00:51:57,901 --> 00:52:00,216
Oh no, mine too.

921
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,316
So what?

922
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:08,114
We need to use the thumb
and the index fingers to make plamodels.

923
00:52:08,202 --> 00:52:11,028
But they are glued together.

924
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:14,025
We can't make the model anymore.

925
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,134
So, as sad as it is,

926
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:20,404
we can't do it anymore because
our fingers are glued together.

927
00:52:20,993 --> 00:52:22,993
I really wanted to complete this model.

928
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:25,609
But I'm afraid this is where we stop.

929
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,613
-Do you really want to finish it?
-Of course.

930
00:52:29,801 --> 00:52:31,915
-Of course.
-Don't worry.

931
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,816
I have acetone.

932
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:36,016
It will dissolve the glue right away.

933
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:36,998
I'll help.

934
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,123
Acetone?

935
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:40,924
No way.

936
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:45,726
This is a strong glue.
Acetone won't do it.

937
00:52:45,822 --> 00:52:48,335
It'll take a long time.

938
00:52:48,828 --> 00:52:51,621
It won't work.

939
00:52:54,801 --> 00:52:55,806
Dusik.

940
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:56,907
Me too?

941
00:53:04,273 --> 00:53:07,798
See? It dissolved right away.
Go ahead and finish the model.

942
00:53:07,908 --> 00:53:09,109
Acetone...

943
00:53:14,144 --> 00:53:16,960
You. Don't move.

944
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:21,465
I don't care if you're a prosecutor.
If you move a muscle...

945
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,235
I'll kill you.

946
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:28,772
Darn you, Seojin.

947
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:31,375
I can't act because she's on my mind.

948
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:38,882
-Hello?
-Hello?

949
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:41,585
-Is this Ms. Kang Seojin's phone?
-Sorry?

950
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,087
Kang Seojin?

951
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,692
Gosh, I took her phone.

952
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:51,595
What's this regarding?

953
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:55,499
I'm calling about the second interview
she's scheduled to have today.

954
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,302
She got a text saying
that she failed the first interview.

955
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,204
No, she passed the first interview.

956
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:03,006
-Maybe we sent out the wrong text.
-What?

957
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:05,109
How could you do that?

958
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:08,512
Forget it. What time is the interview?

959
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:09,813
What?

960
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,519
At 2 o'clock?

961
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,793
What's this? Is there another
hairy girl in Huam-dong?

962
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:25,562
Hello.

963
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,264
Seojin, it's me.

964
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,366
It's you?

965
00:54:30,565 --> 00:54:31,668
What is it?

966
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,370
The thing is...

967
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:37,369
I took your phone again by mistake.

968
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,275
Again?

969
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:41,779
You saved my name
as 'Huam-dong Hairy Girl'?

970
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:43,180
That's not important.

971
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,983
-You passed the first interview.
-What?

972
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,584
What are you talking about?

973
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:51,488
They just called to let you know
you have a second interview today.

974
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,390
Are you serious?

975
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:57,294
So, go to the 10th floor by 2 o'clock.

976
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:58,595
2 o'clock?

977
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:03,066
-Darn it.
-Why?

978
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,369
If you get ready quickly,
you can make it in time.

979
00:55:05,455 --> 00:55:08,272
I'm going to see the ocean by bus
to get some fresh air.

980
00:55:08,574 --> 00:55:09,873
I'm almost there.

981
00:55:09,982 --> 00:55:12,676
The interview would've been over
by the time I get there.

982
00:55:12,779 --> 00:55:14,378
Are you just giving up?

983
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,571
You said this was your last interview.

984
00:55:16,655 --> 00:55:18,582
But the time...

985
00:55:18,674 --> 00:55:21,885
I'll do something. Just get here.

986
00:55:22,382 --> 00:55:23,187
See you.

987
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:30,360
Sir!

988
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,062
Stop the bus!

989
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,264
We'll start shooting now.

990
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:37,334
-Stand by!
-Okay.

991
00:55:46,322 --> 00:55:47,411
Excuse me.

992
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,513
Hey, where are you going?

993
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:54,017
A new teacher is here today.
Let me introduce him.

994
00:55:54,123 --> 00:55:55,519
Come in.

995
00:56:01,309 --> 00:56:02,626
Hyeonjun?

996
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:06,830
Yuna? How come you're here?

997
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,033
Please introduce yourself.

998
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,336
Oh, I'm sorry.

999
00:56:12,442 --> 00:56:15,239
-Let's talk later.
-Okay.

1000
00:56:18,649 --> 00:56:23,447
Hello, I'm Song Hyeonjun.
I'll be teaching this class.

1001
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:24,748
Nice to meet you all.

1002
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:30,721
Oh my goodness.

1003
00:56:30,939 --> 00:56:33,624
-This is awesome.
-Why? Is he that famous?

1004
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:36,326
He's one of the top patissiers in Korea.

1005
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,427
He is?

1006
00:56:43,437 --> 00:56:45,535
-Thank you.
-Bye.

1007
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:49,940
-Excuse me.
-Oh my gosh.

1008
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:52,442
How many interviews are left?

1009
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,645
-All the interviews are finished.
-Finished?

1010
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:57,447
Can't you wait for one more person?

1011
00:56:57,948 --> 00:57:00,851
The interviewers have their schedules,
so it's not possible.

1012
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,423
What happens when she misses
today's interview?

1013
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:09,126
That person would fail the interview.

1014
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,134
That's unfair!

1015
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:13,997
You people made a mistake.

1016
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,300
I didn't hear anything about that.

1017
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:17,701
What should I do now?

1018
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:20,304
"Job interviews"

1019
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,875
Darn it.

1020
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:27,377
Excuse me! Where are you going?!

1021
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,680
That's it for today.

1022
00:57:29,767 --> 00:57:31,281
You can't go in there!

1023
00:57:32,334 --> 00:57:33,350
Who are you?

1024
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:35,652
Don't move.

1025
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,354
What are you doing?

1026
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,227
Don't move.

1027
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:46,630
I don't care if you're a prosecutor...

1028
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,536
I don't care if you're a interviewer.
I'll kill you if you move!

1029
00:57:52,634 --> 00:57:53,637
Who are you?

1030
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:55,639
-What do you think you're doing?
-Shut up!

1031
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,941
Sit there quietly
if you don't want to get hurt.

1032
00:57:58,133 --> 00:58:00,811
-Got it?
-This is enough.

1033
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:01,812
What?

1034
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,515
What are you going to do?

1035
00:58:05,634 --> 00:58:07,017
What are you going to do?

1036
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,522
Why are you getting up?

1037
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,425
You're so tall.

1038
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:16,701
Wow...

1039
00:58:29,415 --> 00:58:30,607
-You.
-Yes?

1040
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,109
Let's talk.

1041
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:33,210
Come here.

1042
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,812
Why? Don't hurt me.

1043
00:58:35,934 --> 00:58:37,614
I just want to talk.

1044
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:40,017
No, don't do this.

1045
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,199
Help me. Help me.

1046
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:25,062
I'm Kang Seojin.
I have an interview today.

1047
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:28,665
One moment, please.
A weird guy is causing trouble.

1048
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,368
Please put me down.

1049
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:33,770
Please, sir.

1050
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:53,523
I'm sorry.

1051
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:04,842
What a weirdo.

1052
01:00:05,934 --> 01:00:08,939
-Do you know him?
-Sorry?

1053
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:13,402
-No.
-You're Ms. Kang Seojin, right?

1054
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,911
-Yes.
-You're late.

1055
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:16,012
I'm sorry.

1056
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:18,568
Sir, there's one more interviewee.

1057
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,217
-What should we do?
-We'll do the interview.

1058
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:23,320
-Come in.
-Thank you.

1059
01:00:33,524 --> 01:00:34,831
I've reached my limit.

1060
01:00:35,634 --> 01:00:38,034
I can't stay awake anymore.

1061
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:42,939
But I can't quit before he does.

1062
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:46,710
What do I do?

1063
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:00,524
Oh no!

1064
01:01:00,627 --> 01:01:02,325
Where is it?!

1065
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:04,327
What? What is it?

1066
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:08,431
The radar that I made has disappeared.

1067
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,736
-I can't do this anymore.
-Why not?

1068
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,638
You can't finish it
without the radar thing?

1069
01:01:14,738 --> 01:01:15,539
Of course!

1070
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:19,643
An aircraft carrier without a radar
is like a guest house without any guests.

1071
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:22,646
I really wanted to finish this model.

1072
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:25,949
There's no point in continuing
to make this model.

1073
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:29,553
Maybe you're sitting on it.

1074
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,056
No, I'm not.

1075
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,860
You should check though. Stand up.

1076
01:01:39,668 --> 01:01:40,764
Okay.

1077
01:01:41,382 --> 01:01:43,266
I'll stand up.

1078
01:01:51,675 --> 01:01:53,577
It's not here.

1079
01:01:53,687 --> 01:01:55,879
I told you.

1080
01:01:57,581 --> 01:01:59,583
I really wanted to finish it.

1081
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:01,184
I'm going to my room.

1082
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,786
Gosh...

1083
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,789
Dusik, can you believe
that the radar disappeared?

1084
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:08,302
This is shocking.

1085
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,695
I'm so sad.

1086
01:02:11,801 --> 01:02:13,396
Where did it go?

1087
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,501
Gosh...

1088
01:02:15,601 --> 01:02:17,567
I don't think I can sleep like this.

1089
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,542
-I can't do this either.
-Why not?

1090
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:28,845
I'm worried about Donggu.

1091
01:02:29,234 --> 01:02:32,249
I've trained for this, so I'm fine.

1092
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:38,455
But the shock of losing a radar
while making a plamodel is immense.

1093
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:40,657
-Really?
-Absolutely.

1094
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,727
You have no idea.

1095
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:48,331
How horrible it feels.

1096
01:02:48,734 --> 01:02:49,733
Donggu.

1097
01:02:49,934 --> 01:02:51,934
Are you okay? Are you in a lot of shock?

1098
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:54,734
Donggu, are you okay?

1099
01:02:54,834 --> 01:02:56,740
The radar is gone, right?

1100
01:03:19,013 --> 01:03:20,230
What are you doing?

1101
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,931
Does it taste good drinking alone?

1102
01:03:22,347 --> 01:03:24,734
You should go home and rest.

1103
01:03:24,836 --> 01:03:27,544
-Why are you here?
-I just felt like it.

1104
01:03:29,255 --> 01:03:31,341
Pour me a drink.

1105
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,545
How did the interview go?

1106
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,448
-You didn't make any mistakes?
-No, it went well.

1107
01:03:39,256 --> 01:03:42,452
-What happened to your shooting?
-What?

1108
01:03:45,569 --> 01:03:47,857
I just quit.

1109
01:03:50,476 --> 01:03:53,663
-Was it because of me?
-No.

1110
01:03:54,245 --> 01:03:58,968
I mean, I look too intellectual
and smart for that role.

1111
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:01,871
I was perfect
for the elite prosecutor part.

1112
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:04,741
But the gangster role didn't suit me.

1113
01:04:08,156 --> 01:04:09,346
Anyway...

1114
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,449
Thank you so much for today.

1115
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,451
You're making me cringe.

1116
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:16,252
It's fine.

1117
01:04:16,558 --> 01:04:17,854
Let's just drink.

1118
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:38,475
You drink alcohol like water.

1119
01:04:41,871 --> 01:04:45,348
Today, I was...

1120
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:49,152
...moved by you a little bit.

1121
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:53,256
Shut up.

1122
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:57,862
It was a very important interview
for you, wasn't it?

1123
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,662
Yes, it was.

1124
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:02,699
It could've been your last interview.

1125
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:09,072
So, you better pass this one.

1126
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:10,173
Got it?

1127
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:11,788
Okay.

1128
01:05:12,581 --> 01:05:19,182
If I get the job, I'll pay
for your eyebrow tattoo.

1129
01:05:19,491 --> 01:05:21,184
I'll make you pretty again.

1130
01:05:24,102 --> 01:05:25,588
Thanks.

1131
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:30,794
But I don't want an eyebrow tattoo.

1132
01:05:31,194 --> 01:05:34,097
Why don't we implant your mustache
on my eyebrow?

1133
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:36,800
Do you want to die?

1134
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,303
I'm kidding.

1135
01:05:42,234 --> 01:05:43,823
You know something?

1136
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:50,013
My heart started beating fast
when I saw you before.

1137
01:05:51,501 --> 01:05:53,616
I wonder why.

1138
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,419
Maybe I've gone crazy.

1139
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:02,525
Come on, what are you doing?

1140
01:06:02,826 --> 01:06:05,261
Let me see you.

1141
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:16,139
I don't understand.

1142
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,542
Why do I think you're great?

1143
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,961
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1144
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:13,563
Where did we go last night?

1145
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,802
Darn the alcohol.

1146
01:07:15,901 --> 01:07:17,767
You and my sister? How dare you..

1147
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,469
Come here! Come here!

1148
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:22,472
I'm Kang Seojin. This is my first day.

1149
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,958
The identity of the King hasn't been
revealed for seven weeks.

1150
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,159
I'm a reporter.

1151
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,245
You're obstructing
the people's right to know.

1152
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:32,067
Have you found out who it was?
You can't work as a journalist like this.

1153
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:33,350
Just quit your job.

1154
01:07:33,434 --> 01:07:35,018
You're Red-faced Squid, right?

1155
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:37,250
I'm sure he's Sua's ex-boyfriend.

1156
01:07:37,334 --> 01:07:38,421
Did you catch that swindler?

1157
01:07:38,534 --> 01:07:40,924
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to catch him.

1158
01:07:41,024 --> 01:07:43,126
-One Coke.
-Yes, sir.

1159
01:07:43,234 --> 01:07:44,234
Aren't you angry?

1160
01:07:44,334 --> 01:07:45,128
You're late.

1161
01:07:45,234 --> 01:07:47,430
Let's have some pork. My treat.

1162
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:48,935
This is my workroom.

1163
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:50,834
You can practice in here. I'll help you.

1164
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:53,303
Donggu, are you mad at me with something?

1165
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,604
Donggu, are you crying?

1166
01:07:54,701 --> 01:07:56,406
I didn't know you were a big coward.

1167
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:58,508
So what if you fail?

1168
01:07:58,634 --> 01:07:59,701
I'm going to tell her how I feel.

1169
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:01,711
Yuna, I have something to say.
