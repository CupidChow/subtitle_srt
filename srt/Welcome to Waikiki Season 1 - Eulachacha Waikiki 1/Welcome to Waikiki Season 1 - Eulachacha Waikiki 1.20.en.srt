1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,498
"Ms. Han Yuna, you passed baking
license exam. Visit website for details."

2
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:09,394
Yuna.

3
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,048
Long time no see.

4
00:00:30,677 --> 00:00:31,578
Sungmin.

5
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,284
How have you been?

6
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:36,483
Why are you here?

7
00:00:37,278 --> 00:00:39,385
I want to apologize to you.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,083
I know I can't be forgiven,
even if I try hard.

9
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,162
I don't need your apology. Just go.

10
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:51,827
-Yuna.
-I said, I don't need it so just go!

11
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:56,763
Yuna, what's wrong?

12
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,466
Who is this?

13
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:02,165
Who is he?

14
00:01:27,156 --> 00:01:28,664
I didn't know.

15
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:30,656
I really didn't know.

16
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:32,951
I'm sorry, Yuna.

17
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:35,161
I'm really sorry.

18
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,846
You don't need to be sorry.

19
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:38,849
My Seol...

20
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:41,626
She's my daughter regardless of you.

21
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,737
I... I will take the responsibility.

22
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:47,634
I will be responsible for all of it.

23
00:01:49,044 --> 00:01:49,939
Responsible?

24
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:53,240
How are you going to do that?

25
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:57,843
How dare you say that now?
I suffered everyday without you.

26
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:01,733
Every single day was like hell to me.

27
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:04,154
You never called me.

28
00:02:07,722 --> 00:02:09,930
I already have someone who held my hands.

29
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:12,931
And now, I...

30
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:15,812
...love him.

31
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,716
-Yuna.
-Stop it.

32
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:22,615
I decided to have Seol.

33
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:24,711
She's my daughter
and it's none of your business.

34
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,608
We already broke up at that time.

35
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:30,229
So let's erase each other from our lives.

36
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:33,316
Bye.

37
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,116
Yuna!

38
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:38,617
Yuna!

39
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:43,901
Let's go Donggu.

40
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:02,345
Hey, Kang Seojin.

41
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:04,645
What do you mean by that?

42
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,956
Think about our relationship?

43
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,361
Our relationship...

44
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:10,559
Let's rethink about it.

45
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:12,441
What's there to rethink about?

46
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:14,853
Why all of a sudden? Huh?

47
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:16,848
Is it because I broke our promise today?

48
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:17,845
Or...

49
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,733
Is it because of the scandal?

50
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,281
What is it? You need to tell me
so that I can figure it out.

51
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:26,128
I'm just tired of everything.

52
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:28,535
I'm tired as I can't see you often
because you're busy.

53
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:30,834
I'm tired as we can't go out
on a date anytime we want.

54
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,113
I'm so tired of hiding
about the fact that you're my boyfriend.

55
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:42,616
Alright.

56
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,312
Then I'll...

57
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:46,923
...tell reporters about the truth
and correct the fact.

58
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:48,708
-Will that...
-No, don't.

59
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:52,010
You suffered for so long
and now only you found your way.

60
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,708
-I don't want to stand in your way.
-You don't like this and that!

61
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,217
-What do you want me to do!
-I don't know!

62
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,501
But I'm tired of it.

63
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:03,993
I get so disappointed...

64
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:06,303
I feel miserable. What should I do?

65
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:13,306
I thought I was strong enough.

66
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:14,982
I guess not.

67
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:18,001
Jungi.

68
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,930
I really don't want to see you now.

69
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:22,508
Can you please leave?

70
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:25,613
-Seojin.
-Please go.

71
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:27,699
Get out now!

72
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:30,018
Seojin!

73
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:32,206
Seojin!

74
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:34,096
Seojin!

75
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:03,815
President became a zombie.

76
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,434
He brought his energy
all the way from his abdomen,

77
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:09,236
and focused on his fingers.

78
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:10,939
And finally,

79
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:16,438
President's super ultra
energy finger zap exploded.

80
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:21,127
The alien struggled
while holding his wide separated eyes.

81
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,926
See this.
I like that kind of man?

82
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,331
Now, why?

83
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,259
I, Min Sua is a legendary
hot girl from Hoo Am Dong...

84
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:34,259
...but likes Bong Dusik, who always writes
weird web novel and wears sweat suit?

85
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:35,465
No, no, no...

86
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:36,762
That can't be.

87
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:37,968
Of course not.

88
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:42,949
Why are you staring at me?

89
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:44,276
Why?

90
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,355
Do I look more handsome
than before whenever you look?

91
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:51,657
I'm just joking.

92
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,665
Why so serious?

93
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:59,592
There're jokes that you can and can't do!
How can you say that?

94
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:02,578
Is this joke something that
makes you become so serious?

95
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,868
Forget it! Don't talk to me, you pig!

96
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:07,288
What? Pig again?

97
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:10,181
Hey, did you see such a thin pig like me?

98
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,690
Did I gain some weight?

99
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:15,794
You here? How was your date? Good?

100
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,104
What? What's going on?

101
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:23,192
-Did you two fight?
-I'm going inside to take some rest.

102
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:24,700
Sure.

103
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:29,394
Hey, what's up with Yuna?

104
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:30,704
Did something happen?

105
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,213
What?

106
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,911
Seol's father came?

107
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,007
Wait...

108
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:43,009
-Why all of a sudden? What's the reason?
-I don't know.

109
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,405
I can't ask her now.

110
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:46,795
My, what in the world is going on...

111
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:49,511
Moreover, you're leaving in a week.

112
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:51,209
It must be bothering you.

113
00:07:57,262 --> 00:08:00,753
Sua, people feel happy
in many different ways.

114
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:05,971
So it's ok to find your own way
to become happy from now on.

115
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:07,368
I just tried something on.

116
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:08,967
Why? It's pretty!

117
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,069
Extreme fashion is hot these days.
Do you want to try?

118
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:18,761
What? Why am I continuously
thinking about Dusik? Why!

119
00:08:18,854 --> 00:08:20,864
God, what should I do!

120
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,647
Doctor said I shouldn't drink a lot.

121
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:32,029
God, I don't know.

122
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:51,402
It can't be,
but am I really in love with Dusik?

123
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,103
"Bong Min Doo Su Sik A"

124
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,500
What? 20 percent?

125
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:06,080
Well, I don't really like him.

126
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:08,596
God, it's a relief.

127
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,999
Wait. Does 20% also mean I like him?

128
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:16,103
This is more complicated than ever!

129
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:17,797
Hold it.

130
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,191
"Bong Min Dusik Sua"

131
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:26,973
64 percent?

132
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,068
Then, Dusik likes me more?

133
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,382
You like it? Like it?

134
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:37,865
You like it,
because this thing could be true?

135
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:42,860
You're crazy, Min Sua.
You're totally crazy.

136
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:57,075
She needs to come down herself
when it's meal time.

137
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:58,885
She always makes me to wake her up.

138
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,995
Is this a pigsty or what?

139
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,081
What? She drank?

140
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,785
Hey, Min Sua.

141
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:09,871
Hey!

142
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:12,285
Hey, wake up. Hey.

143
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:14,786
-Why are you sleeping here?
-What is it?

144
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,683
What?

145
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:18,898
What? Why!

146
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,207
Why are you so surprised?

147
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:23,000
Hey, why did you drink so much?

148
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:26,104
Why do you care so much
about me drinking? You pig!

149
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:29,511
Hey! Why are you calling me a pig?
You're so childish!

150
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:32,220
Fine, I'm childish!
So I didn't even go to kindergarten.

151
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:34,820
My, my. Just forget it. Forget about it.

152
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,812
And...please clean this place.
What is this?

153
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,423
It's so dirty.

154
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:43,499
Forget it, forget it.
I have stomachache. Don't nag me.

155
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:45,109
My stomach...

156
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:49,812
Hold on.

157
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,201
"Min Bong Su Doo A Sik"
"Bong Min Doo Su Sik A"

158
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:57,717
-Hey, Bong Dusik!
-God, you surprised me.

159
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,320
Why did yell?

160
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:03,307
Give me that. It's mine! Mine! You thief!

161
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:05,816
Now I'm a thief?

162
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,001
That was close...

163
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,224
What? Where is it?

164
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:27,729
Where is it?

165
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,822
Where is it!

166
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:37,017
Donggu, did you sleep well?

167
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:38,421
Yes.

168
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:40,827
I made your favorite, mackerel.

169
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:43,818
-It looks delicious, right?
-Yes? Yes.

170
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:45,326
Thank you.

171
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:47,334
Dusik, why aren't you eating?

172
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:49,940
I was insulted so much just now,
I'm not hungry anymore.

173
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:54,147
-Why? What happened?
-Well, you see Sua...

174
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,393
Hey, Min Sua. What are you doing now?

175
00:11:59,504 --> 00:12:01,401
None of your business.
Eat your meal, you pig!

176
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:03,393
Do you see? I'm insulted again.

177
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:04,691
Excuse me?

178
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,697
Sungmin? How did you?

179
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:16,015
Well, I had something to tell you.

180
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:22,714
Sungmin, what's wrong with you?
I told you I have nothing to say.

181
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,218
What is it? What's wrong Yuna?

182
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:26,508
Who is he?

183
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,611
Let's talk.

184
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,507
Who's he? Is he?

185
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,193
What's wrong with you?

186
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:44,897
I told you let's erase
each other from our lives.

187
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:46,792
You acting like this won't change
anything!

188
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:49,094
I'm not asking you to accept me in again.

189
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:50,986
I don't even deserve it.

190
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,185
But, Yuna...

191
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,789
I know I don't deserve it,

192
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,786
but it doesn't change the
fact that I'm Seol's father.

193
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:02,377
I'm really sorry to you.

194
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:05,385
But I really want to do
everything I can do for Seol,

195
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:07,067
and apologize to you and Seol.

196
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:09,368
-Is that possible?
-No.

197
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:11,582
You can't do that.

198
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:14,774
I'm telling you again.

199
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:16,877
Seol is my daughter,

200
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:19,067
and she's none of your business.

201
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:22,562
So don't even come looking for me.

202
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:27,871
Why is Seol's father here?

203
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,276
That's what I mean...

204
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:31,276
Will Yuna be alright?

205
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:37,290
Well, sorry for the inconvenience.

206
00:13:58,501 --> 00:13:59,679
Daddy.

207
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:09,021
Sorry for the inconvenience.

208
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:10,609
I'll be going then.

209
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,616
Goodbye.

210
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:28,329
Did Seol say daddy just now?

211
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:30,218
-Right?
-Yes...

212
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:31,904
Wow.

213
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:35,525
Donggu really tried to make her say
that, but it didn't work.

214
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:37,517
It's amazing.

215
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:39,621
Guess blood is blood.

216
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,034
It's not wrong. Right?

217
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:43,027
Hey.

218
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:46,543
-I'm going to get some rest.
-Alright.

219
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:52,733
Hey.

220
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:55,723
-You're really insensitive.
-What did I do?

221
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,139
What are you doing?

222
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,140
I'm just playing with Seol.

223
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,951
I'm sorry.

224
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:27,141
Why?

225
00:15:28,044 --> 00:15:30,237
He will never come back.

226
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,427
So don't worry.

227
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:34,135
Alright?

228
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:39,235
I really don't care so much. Why would I?

229
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:41,631
Don't worry, Yuna.

230
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,441
Well, that's a relief.

231
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,348
You waited from early morning, is it?

232
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:55,142
Why? Did something happen?

233
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:57,032
Well...

234
00:15:58,936 --> 00:15:59,844
Sir...

235
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:03,733
I'll reveal the truth
about Cindy and my rumor.

236
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:04,630
What?

237
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,926
What are you talking about?

238
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:08,934
There's someone I love.

239
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:13,636
I think acting like this is
disrespectful to someone I love.

240
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,816
Wow, Lee Jungi?

241
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:17,627
Very romantic.

242
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,437
-Really romantic.
-Pardon?

243
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,933
Do you think you have
enough time to love someone?

244
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:27,346
-Sir, that's not...
-Don't be ridiculous.

245
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:32,047
More than a truck of actors vanish
right away after one drama every year.

246
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,547
You think you won't be one of them?

247
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:36,964
I'll do my best. I really work really...

248
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,042
If everyone can work hard
and become a star who wouldn't be?

249
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:44,633
Do you what those people who fail
every time don't have?

250
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,435
Luck and opportunity.

251
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:48,722
Opportunity! But,

252
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:53,819
you want to throw away that opportunity
that only comes once in a life time?

253
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:57,605
Fine.

254
00:16:57,912 --> 00:17:00,803
Gather the reporters, and tell them
the truth. Do whatever you want.

255
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:03,217
But from that moment,

256
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,209
our contract is over.

257
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,001
First,

258
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:12,767
-you need to move out from your house.
-Pardon?

259
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:15,008
Move out?

260
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:17,896
The reporters will be
all around your house.

261
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:22,315
This issue needs to grab
attention for at least a week.

262
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:23,195
Alright?

263
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:29,691
Jungi.

264
00:17:30,295 --> 00:17:31,890
You can stay here for a while.

265
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,287
We requested for few days off
so don't worry about the shooting.

266
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:55,634
"Jungi"

267
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:05,867
Well, I was checking the scenario.

268
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,449
I don't like the ending.

269
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:10,560
Can there be some twist to it?

270
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,770
-Twist?
-Rather than your opinion...

271
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:14,972
Let's hear it from Donggu.

272
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:18,271
Look at him. He's getting some ideas.
Everyone, be quiet.

273
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,357
Donggu, what's wrong?
Do you have any new idea?

274
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,572
"Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad"

275
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:26,469
Dad! Dad!

276
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,755
Dad, dad? Dad?

277
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:30,558
Do you mean,

278
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,644
he succeeded his assassination
but the victim is his dad?

279
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,244
-That's good.
-Wait...

280
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:39,241
The main character is Korean
but how can Arab be his dad?

281
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:40,641
Why not?

282
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:42,542
He was adopted from young age by Arab.

283
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:45,138
One day he went out to
play and got lost. Get it?

284
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:47,935
Then, by accident he got on a ship
and that ship was going to Korea.

285
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,436
-It's possible, isn't it?
-What? Well, that's...

286
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:51,523
Shut up.

287
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:54,523
Hey, Kang Donggu.
You did it again.

288
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,519
I'm retiring after this movie. You direct.

289
00:18:57,615 --> 00:18:58,821
-I lose.
-Pardon?

290
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:02,011
Now, if you have anything to
decide, ask Donggu.

291
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,994
Donggu is now on the same level as me.
Same.

292
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:07,788
Director Kang, I trust you. Alright?

293
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:10,073
What? Oh, yes.

294
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,452
Director, director.

295
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:21,775
Yes, I need to add more passengers
for the Dubai trip. Is that possible?

296
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:23,179
Pardon?

297
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,980
Yes, could you please check
and get back to me?

298
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,171
Yes.

299
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:30,154
God, there's so much to do.

300
00:19:34,354 --> 00:19:36,359
This is Seol's favorite doll.

301
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,160
I have no time!

302
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:47,451
Again, again.

303
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:54,559
Come out! Out!

304
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:57,969
Can you see this!

305
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:00,263
I will not go until I get you!

306
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,363
-Seol! I'm here!
-You here?

307
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,470
Yes...

308
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,157
I need to take something.

309
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:10,260
But what's all this?

310
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,949
What?

311
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:13,347
Well...

312
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,343
Seol's dad's secretary left all these.

313
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,231
-Donggu, are you here?
-Yes.

314
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:27,118
-Donggu, these are...
-Yuna!

315
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,133
I need to take something.
It's urgent so...

316
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,111
What?? What is that?

317
00:20:44,513 --> 00:20:46,214
Is she a Gollum or what?

318
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:51,117
Hey, what are you doing?

319
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:53,620
Are you mine worker? You going for mining?

320
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:55,731
What are you trying to find?

321
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:58,131
I told you it's none of your business,
you baboon!

322
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,122
Ba...baboon?

323
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,528
Are you crazy? Really. You little.

324
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,129
God, I can't swear in front of Seol.

325
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,534
Seol, what is this?

326
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:12,225
Why are you holding a paper?

327
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,741
There are some writings on it.

328
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:19,150
No!

329
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:22,333
-Give it to me!
-What's wrong with you? What's this?

330
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:24,515
-Give me! You don't need to know.
-Oh?

331
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,229
You make me more curious.
Give me. What's this?

332
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:28,324
No! Don't see!

333
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:30,031
-Hey, hey!
-It hurts!

334
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:31,816
Show me! Hey.

335
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,721
My god!

336
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:36,233
Hey, hey, hey!

337
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:39,138
Hey, Min Sua, what are you doing!

338
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:40,811
Hey!

339
00:21:42,738 --> 00:21:43,950
Did you just...

340
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,450
...eat a paper? Really?

341
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:50,769
Look, look!

342
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,673
I ate already!

343
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:00,690
She's really crazy.

344
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:02,329
Crazy.

345
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:09,829
My, it was really close.

346
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:14,835
Hold on, why was Seol holding the paper?

347
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,137
How?

348
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:20,425
I don't care. I wasn't busted. It's fine.

349
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:29,505
My stomach...

350
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:31,816
It's painful again.

351
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:47,598
Doctor, what's wrong with her?

352
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:50,200
I think it's stomach cramps.

353
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:51,812
What did she eat?

354
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,502
Pardon?

355
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:56,820
Well... I drank a bit yesterday.

356
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:57,701
And?

357
00:22:58,598 --> 00:22:59,902
Nothing.

358
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,513
What are you talking about?
You ate paper too.

359
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:04,402
Paper? What paper?

360
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,094
-A sketch book.
-What?

361
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:07,705
Why did you eat sketch book?

362
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,403
-Did you tear it and eat as a snack...?
-No, I didn't!

363
00:23:12,112 --> 00:23:15,416
Just stop talking to me and do something.
Please!

364
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,015
Right, sure. Let's have a blood test
and endoscopy.

365
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,904
Right.

366
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,796
What's wrong with you these days?

367
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,197
I can't really understand you.

368
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:36,855
Doctor, what's inside me?

369
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:40,752
Very small cyst and stomach ulcer.

370
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:42,252
Is that so?

371
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:48,761
Sir, it's not really a big thing.

372
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:50,642
Please give me that.

373
00:23:52,427 --> 00:23:55,032
Now he gives me. Before he takes it
away, take him to recovery room.

374
00:23:55,122 --> 00:23:56,333
-Sure.
-Sure, doctor.

375
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,519
Bring in the next patient.

376
00:24:12,144 --> 00:24:14,641
Miss, I'm going to put you
under anesthesia.

377
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:21,142
By the way, it doesn't hurt, right?
I've never had an endoscopy.

378
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:26,250
Don't worry. You won't know anything
as you'll fall asleep after anesthesia.

379
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,669
But, I don't get anesthetized very well.

380
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:38,042
You get anesthetized really well.

381
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:38,946
Well.

382
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,240
Let's start.

383
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:44,132
Here we go.

384
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,142
Miss! Let this go! Let it go!

385
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:51,945
No!

386
00:24:52,837 --> 00:24:54,134
Why aren't you doing!

387
00:24:56,223 --> 00:24:59,947
I never saw someone who starts this
from the beginning. What's wrong today?

388
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,526
Miss, please let this go. Please?

389
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:05,430
-I need to start checking.
-I don't want to.

390
00:25:05,515 --> 00:25:07,112
I won't give you.

391
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:10,620
I'll let you go if you bring Dusik.

392
00:25:10,705 --> 00:25:11,818
What? Two?

393
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,533
One, two, three? Two?

394
00:25:14,618 --> 00:25:15,637
No!

395
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:18,820
Dusik. Dusik.

396
00:25:19,212 --> 00:25:24,222
My friend who is really cute and handsome.

397
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:32,017
If you don't bring Dusik,
I won't open my mouth!

398
00:25:36,808 --> 00:25:39,109
Excuse me, is Bong Dusik here?

399
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:41,600
Yes? I'm Bong Dusik.

400
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:48,883
Mr. Bong Dusik?

401
00:25:49,777 --> 00:25:52,586
Yes, I'm Bong Dusik. Why did you...?

402
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,268
This patient said
she really needs to talk to you.

403
00:25:56,963 --> 00:26:00,657
She said she won't get the test
if we don't call you here.

404
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:01,658
What?

405
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,964
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

406
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:06,758
This always happens.

407
00:26:07,754 --> 00:26:09,052
Miss Min Sua.

408
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:12,647
Mr. Bong Dusik is here.
Please tell him now.

409
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:17,738
You're right!

410
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,264
My friend Dusik, you here?

411
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:25,455
Hey, what are you doing?

412
00:26:25,562 --> 00:26:27,096
What are you doing now?

413
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:28,708
I...

414
00:26:28,812 --> 00:26:31,605
...have something to tell you...

415
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,105
What is it? Tell me fast.

416
00:26:36,802 --> 00:26:38,094
Dusik!

417
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:40,982
Actually I...

418
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:44,998
I think I...

419
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:48,282
...like you.

420
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:50,299
Wh..what?

421
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,179
I, Min Sua...

422
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,791
...likes Bong Dusik.

423
00:26:56,989 --> 00:26:59,896
Really!

424
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:04,000
Wh..what?

425
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,493
What the hell are you talking about?

426
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:07,802
Wow...

427
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:10,112
I never saw anyone confess here.

428
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,526
Endoscopy romance?

429
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:13,514
Wow! That's really something new.

430
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:24,394
God, I slept well.

431
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:27,583
Are you up now?

432
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,988
Yes.

433
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,685
Well, am I done?

434
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:34,478
Am I ok?

435
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:38,176
No, there's a little
inflammation but that's all.

436
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,477
That's good.

437
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,328
But why are you laughing?

438
00:27:46,921 --> 00:27:49,328
Did I fart during the test?

439
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:51,518
No, you didn't.

440
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:55,118
You confessed to your friend.

441
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,204
What? Confess?

442
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:01,509
-To who?
-His name was Bong...

443
00:28:01,603 --> 00:28:02,293
Bong!

444
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,603
-Was it Bong Dusik?
-Yes, that's right. Mr. Bong Dusik.

445
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:11,590
No way. You're saying that
I confessed to Bong Dusik?

446
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:13,185
How did that happen?

447
00:28:13,288 --> 00:28:16,974
You said you won't get the test
if we don't bring Mr. Bong Dusik.

448
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:18,783
What? Really?

449
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,103
My goodness.

450
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:23,800
What should I do, what should I do!

451
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,803
I'm so embarrassed.

452
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:39,224
How can I see Bong Dusik now!

453
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:10,733
Hello?

454
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:13,432
Yes, it is.

455
00:29:15,735 --> 00:29:16,517
What?

456
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,116
I'm sorry for contacting
you all of a sudden.

457
00:29:25,212 --> 00:29:26,307
It's fine.

458
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:28,410
What is it that you want to talk about?

459
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,501
Thank you so much
for taking care of Yuna and Seol.

460
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:38,479
I don't think that's something
you should thank me.

461
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,590
But still...

462
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,987
I wanted to thank you.

463
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:43,985
This...

464
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:50,677
This is something I sincerely prepared.

465
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:53,684
What?

466
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:55,264
Sincerity?

467
00:29:56,676 --> 00:30:00,582
You want me to take this and back off?

468
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:02,971
You watched too many dramas.

469
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:06,877
This is too cliche.
Dramas now never choose this scenario.

470
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:08,973
-No...
-Do you have lots of money?

471
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:12,774
Let me see how much you put here. Alright?
God...

472
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:23,862
What's this?

473
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:25,560
It's a letter.

474
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:29,957
I couldn't express how much
I feel grateful with just words...

475
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:34,256
Is that so?

476
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:36,557
I thought...

477
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,159
I will read the letter at home.

478
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:45,245
And...

479
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:47,641
I have one favor.

480
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:52,236
Yuna and Seol...

481
00:30:53,622 --> 00:30:55,433
I want to be responsible.

482
00:30:57,228 --> 00:30:58,322
What?

483
00:30:58,538 --> 00:30:59,433
I still...

484
00:30:59,844 --> 00:31:01,246
I love Yuna.

485
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:02,929
Love?

486
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,850
Then you shouldn't have left her.

487
00:31:07,144 --> 00:31:08,055
Hey you.

488
00:31:08,764 --> 00:31:10,857
Do you know how hard
Yuna had to suffer?

489
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,857
Now what? You want to be responsible?

490
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:15,856
I know I was a coward.

491
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:19,563
I know I won't be forgiven.

492
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:22,056
I know it's late but now...

493
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:25,858
I want to payback all the debts
I owe to Seol and Yuna.

494
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:31,164
So please, can you help me, Mr. Donggu?

495
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:38,061
You really watched a lot of dramas.

496
00:31:39,466 --> 00:31:43,171
When you say that, am I supposed to
say yes and Seol must be more happy...

497
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:47,563
...to live with her father who is
richer than me. It's hurting but,

498
00:31:47,648 --> 00:31:50,157
I should let her go.
You thought I would say this?

499
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:52,554
Listen to me.

500
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,872
Yuna and Seol.

501
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:58,563
I will protect them whatever happens.
So...

502
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:01,680
Don't you ever contact me.

503
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,266
I won't give up either.

504
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,482
Never.

505
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,763
I, Min Sua!

506
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:24,263
I like Bong Dusik.

507
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,193
Really!

508
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:29,072
It's impossible.

509
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:32,490
Sua likes me?

510
00:32:34,187 --> 00:32:34,981
Hey.

511
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:36,783
You here?

512
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:38,796
Dusik.

513
00:32:39,395 --> 00:32:40,796
Do you want to drink?

514
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:42,082
Drink?

515
00:32:42,782 --> 00:32:44,816
-Why all of a sudden?
-Just.

516
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,524
I just want to drink.

517
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,016
Is that so?

518
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,722
Sure.

519
00:32:52,112 --> 00:32:53,703
I thought of drinking as well.

520
00:32:58,219 --> 00:32:59,117
Yes, Jungi.

521
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:01,297
What?

522
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:03,106
What do you mean?

523
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:06,893
You here?

524
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:08,099
Come in.

525
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:19,885
What's this place for? Why are you here?

526
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:21,568
Something came up.

527
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:24,471
Why did you buy so much?

528
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,662
Oh, this?

529
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,661
Alcohol.

530
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:29,774
Donggu wanted to drink.

531
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,870
Really?

532
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:34,208
That's great.
I really wanted to drink too.

533
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:35,609
You too?

534
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:39,406
Wow, shall three of us drink to death?
It's been so long.

535
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,216
Shall we?

536
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:43,787
Let's drink! It's been a while!

537
00:33:43,872 --> 00:33:46,593
Let's drink until we lose our minds!

538
00:33:46,678 --> 00:33:47,593
Let's do this!

539
00:33:47,678 --> 00:33:50,378
Until we are wasted!

540
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:52,389
What are you doing? Do it.

541
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:56,190
So childish. Let's do this!

542
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:58,673
Let's drink!

543
00:33:58,984 --> 00:34:01,192
Let's drink!

544
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,711
What's up with you two?

545
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:11,115
Did something happen?

546
00:34:11,707 --> 00:34:12,917
Sisters.

547
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:15,004
It's been a while
since only us in the house.

548
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:17,096
Shall we drink?

549
00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:18,498
Shall we?

550
00:34:18,698 --> 00:34:20,490
I want to...

551
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:22,187
But I don't feel good.

552
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:25,386
I'll take care of Seol. Don't worry.
You two go ahead and drink.

553
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,670
Is it?

554
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:31,876
Yuna, let's drink! Let's do this!

555
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:34,187
Sure. Let's drink!

556
00:34:34,277 --> 00:34:35,679
Seol, you too. Let's do this!

557
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:37,084
Let's do this!

558
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:40,977
What?

559
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:44,085
Seojin wants to break up with you?

560
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,775
She said it's really hard
for her to meet me.

561
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:50,787
I know why Seojin is feeling that way.

562
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:53,779
So I'm trying to correct it but,

563
00:34:55,786 --> 00:34:57,384
I was scared to do it...

564
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,783
At first, I was so grateful
for reaching this level.

565
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,481
But I get greedy more and more.

566
00:35:04,681 --> 00:35:07,599
-So you will break up with Seojin?
-What?

567
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:10,274
Then from that point onwards,

568
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:16,073
you'll be buried in the
mountain before you know it.

569
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:20,577
I know!
I'm not going to break up with Seojin!

570
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:23,776
-Don't you worry.
-You should.

571
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,263
Or you and Seojin will be...

572
00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:34,513
...buried in the mountain
before you know it.

573
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:39,204
Cheers.

574
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,107
-Shall we?
-Cheers.

575
00:35:41,614 --> 00:35:43,316
Cheers!

576
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,935
It's been so long
since only we three are left in the house.

577
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:53,443
You're right.

578
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:56,546
No guests. Seol's sleeping.

579
00:35:56,848 --> 00:35:57,848
Great.

580
00:35:57,938 --> 00:36:00,247
Best condition for closing down business.

581
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:05,350
But I like it as only girls are here,
it's been a while.

582
00:36:06,944 --> 00:36:08,649
-Hey, Seojin.
-Yes?

583
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:11,051
Is there something going on
between you and Jungi?

584
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:13,817
Did you two fight?

585
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,817
Well...

586
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,737
It's just hard for me these days.

587
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:19,237
What is?

588
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,935
Just everything.

589
00:36:21,027 --> 00:36:26,441
I don't think Jungi likes me
as much as I like him.

590
00:36:26,745 --> 00:36:29,743
I feel like I'm the only one struggling.

591
00:36:30,534 --> 00:36:34,424
Why? I think Jungi likes you
more than you do.

592
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:35,527
Yes.

593
00:36:36,336 --> 00:36:37,623
I don't know.

594
00:36:38,222 --> 00:36:40,520
Why don't I know that?

595
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:43,124
God, I really don't know.

596
00:36:43,221 --> 00:36:45,211
I really don't.

597
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:50,323
Let's drink!

598
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,439
Hey.

599
00:37:03,944 --> 00:37:05,336
Why are you sighing?

600
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:06,741
Just.

601
00:37:07,944 --> 00:37:09,542
I feel insecure.

602
00:37:10,047 --> 00:37:10,940
Why?

603
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,742
Why? You feel nervous
because Seol's father came back?

604
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:16,550
Because Yuna might go back to him?

605
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:17,844
You little.

606
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,988
It's not that.

607
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,592
He's Seol's biological father.

608
00:37:28,677 --> 00:37:30,583
He's rich.

609
00:37:31,186 --> 00:37:32,720
And also,

610
00:37:32,806 --> 00:37:35,601
I'm leaving in few days.

611
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:37,601
I feel a bit insecure.

612
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:39,597
You don't have to feel insecure for that.

613
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:41,581
Few days ago,

614
00:37:41,777 --> 00:37:45,175
Seol called him daddy.

615
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:47,981
Here.

616
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:51,295
I felt my heart dropping.

617
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:55,589
That's why I feel insecure a lot.

618
00:37:56,687 --> 00:38:01,006
It bothers me as I need to be away
from her for a month because of my movie.

619
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:03,799
Then you should just propose to her.

620
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:05,083
Propose?

621
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,987
With my ability? No way...

622
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:19,772
Yuna.

623
00:38:20,352 --> 00:38:24,153
Can I ask you one question?

624
00:38:25,356 --> 00:38:26,356
What is it?

625
00:38:27,355 --> 00:38:32,347
You never regret about meeting my brother?

626
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:35,735
Yes.

627
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:38,943
I've never.

628
00:38:39,244 --> 00:38:40,344
Really?

629
00:38:41,647 --> 00:38:42,431
Yes.

630
00:38:43,047 --> 00:38:44,749
Donggu is...

631
00:38:45,175 --> 00:38:50,646
...not that successful, he's narrow minded
and gets angry really well.

632
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:52,916
He's like a child. But...

633
00:38:54,044 --> 00:38:58,233
He loves me more than anything else
in the world.

634
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,834
I know that by looking at his eyes,

635
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,226
how much Donggu loves me
and cares about me.

636
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:11,710
That's enough for me.

637
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:14,629
So cheesy.

638
00:39:14,714 --> 00:39:16,816
My stomach cramps are coming back again.

639
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:21,928
You know that by the eyes?

640
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:26,014
-Yes.
-Why can't I see that?

641
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,628
Love is really difficult.

642
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:34,817
Man, love is always hard.

643
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,934
I really want to die these days.

644
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,039
Why?

645
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:43,434
-You like someone?
-What?

646
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,751
-Who is it?
-Really?

647
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,857
No, don't bother.

648
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,341
Hey guys.

649
00:39:59,546 --> 00:40:01,943
Do you like hide and seek?

650
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:06,939
-Hide and seek?
-Yes.

651
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:12,135
I really love hide and seek.
Do you want to play?

652
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:17,733
Sua, you didn't drink.
You should find us.

653
00:40:20,823 --> 00:40:23,331
Hey! What was that?

654
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:25,144
What's wrong with her?

655
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:27,922
Wait, are we really doing this?

656
00:40:28,724 --> 00:40:30,430
Hey, hey!

657
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,859
Hey, where are you going?

658
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:35,844
Yuna told me to hide.
I'm going to hide.

659
00:40:35,944 --> 00:40:38,438
Wait, what? Hey!

660
00:40:39,531 --> 00:40:43,135
Find us after counting to ten. Alright?

661
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:46,052
My, what the...

662
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,995
Sua! I'm done!

663
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:56,683
I didn't hide in the laundry room.
So don't ever come here!

664
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,406
What is wrong with these people?

665
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,073
Do I need to really find them?

666
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:04,953
God, what is this?

667
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:19,186
We have such a shitty life.

668
00:41:20,087 --> 00:41:21,300
Right?

669
00:41:22,706 --> 00:41:24,283
You're right.

670
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:29,884
Hey, why are you laughing?

671
00:41:29,977 --> 00:41:32,075
It's funny, isn't it?

672
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:35,774
You two are really materialistic people.

673
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,278
Since when did you two become like that?

674
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:41,564
You guys are pathetic cowards.

675
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,989
-What?
-Isn't it?

676
00:41:44,096 --> 00:41:44,892
Hey!

677
00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:48,103
Since when did we love by one's ability?

678
00:41:48,188 --> 00:41:52,108
You are worried as he's rich
and has great ability. Right?

679
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:56,417
Hey! Love has nothing to do with ability!

680
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:59,012
Jungi, you too.

681
00:41:59,407 --> 00:42:02,817
What are you, Kim Soo Hyun or Gong Yoo?

682
00:42:02,905 --> 00:42:05,798
You have nothing to lose but you are
such a coward.

683
00:42:05,894 --> 00:42:08,489
You said you won't get help from your dad
as you want to succeed on your own.

684
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:10,686
Was that all lie?

685
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,202
Man, or is it not?

686
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,113
Is this normal?

687
00:42:19,813 --> 00:42:22,105
It's bitter truth.

688
00:42:22,597 --> 00:42:24,790
I thought we will never change.

689
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:27,895
I know we are a little...

690
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,989
...pathetic but,

691
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:33,469
I thought we were living a awesome life.

692
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:34,986
I know.

693
00:42:36,183 --> 00:42:39,460
When did I become a coward?

694
00:42:39,545 --> 00:42:42,053
It's better to be a coward.

695
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:47,267
I think I became the world's
most pathetic person.

696
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,760
Oh, right!

697
00:42:51,063 --> 00:42:53,768
Hey, hey.

698
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,871
Do you want to hear a big news?

699
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:56,981
You know...

700
00:42:57,069 --> 00:42:58,266
Suarez...

701
00:42:58,378 --> 00:42:59,679
Sua...

702
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:02,473
...likes me!

703
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:05,680
What?

704
00:43:06,379 --> 00:43:08,077
Sua likes you?

705
00:43:08,198 --> 00:43:09,680
Isn't it shocking? Right?

706
00:43:09,781 --> 00:43:11,770
It was shocking for me too.

707
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,874
Man, that shouldn't happen.

708
00:43:14,977 --> 00:43:18,177
He's right. That shouldn't happen.

709
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,174
Hold it.

710
00:43:20,171 --> 00:43:22,570
Why? What's there to say no?

711
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:26,072
Sua is great.

712
00:43:26,378 --> 00:43:28,675
She's cool, pretty.

713
00:43:29,878 --> 00:43:31,795
Her brain is so pure.

714
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:37,809
You go out with Donggu's sister!

715
00:43:38,103 --> 00:43:39,619
Hey you!

716
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:41,420
That must not happen!

717
00:43:41,505 --> 00:43:44,714
He's right. That should not happen!

718
00:43:44,812 --> 00:43:47,618
-That shouldn't happen, you jerk.
-You jerk.

719
00:43:47,706 --> 00:43:50,007
I'm not saying, I will go out with her!

720
00:44:05,231 --> 00:44:06,231
A mustache?

721
00:44:06,317 --> 00:44:07,523
Lucky charm.

722
00:44:08,922 --> 00:44:13,132
Even if I'm not there with you,
look at this and think I'm there with you.

723
00:44:13,232 --> 00:44:14,132
Alright?

724
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:19,067
I'm your number one fan,
you know that right?

725
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:22,156
Don't forget that I'm right
beside you cheering you up.

726
00:44:23,738 --> 00:44:24,751
Jungi, you can do it!

727
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:39,120
Don't you see me as a woman?

728
00:44:39,413 --> 00:44:41,405
I see you as a man.

729
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:43,621
I think I like you.

730
00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:45,819
Let's do this.

731
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,113
As a man and woman.

732
00:44:47,405 --> 00:44:49,097
Jungi!

733
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:56,415
Let's go!

734
00:44:56,711 --> 00:44:59,605
You suffered a lot to reach where you are.

735
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:02,207
I don't want to be in your way.

736
00:45:13,702 --> 00:45:14,798
Jungi, where are you going?

737
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,104
Going to see my fan.

738
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:19,500
What are you talking about?

739
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:22,096
-You have an appointment with our CEO.
-I don't care.

740
00:45:22,494 --> 00:45:23,822
Tell him to break the contract.

741
00:45:24,611 --> 00:45:26,314
Why are you acting like this?

742
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:31,118
I'm going to live the way I used to live.

743
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:32,999
Immature life with no plan.

744
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:34,309
And,

745
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,404
no more cowardly life.

746
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,986
Jungi! Jungi!

747
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:48,948
Oh, my!

748
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:51,359
What's that noise!

749
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:54,448
What a smell!

750
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:56,582
Who farted? Who!

751
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:00,170
What?

752
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:01,556
There's nobody.

753
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,361
Was that me?

754
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:08,361
God, the smell.

755
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:17,689
My whole body is aching
after playing hide and seek all night.

756
00:46:19,158 --> 00:46:20,835
Oh, my head.

757
00:46:22,248 --> 00:46:23,653
Oh, my head.

758
00:46:24,246 --> 00:46:25,844
I'm hungover.

759
00:46:25,929 --> 00:46:26,924
I feel sick too.

760
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:29,828
What?

761
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:32,328
Why is she sleeping here?

762
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:37,144
So awkward.

763
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:39,303
I'd better go in and sleep.

764
00:46:48,003 --> 00:46:49,814
That must hurt a lot.

765
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:52,012
Is she in deep sleep?

766
00:46:57,711 --> 00:46:59,307
Where is it?

767
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:05,351
Good, good.

768
00:47:08,657 --> 00:47:12,056
Sua, move a little more.

769
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,598
Gosh, it hurts!

770
00:47:18,788 --> 00:47:20,788
Sua, are you alright?

771
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:23,918
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

772
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,098
When did you get back?

773
00:47:26,188 --> 00:47:28,986
I just came.

774
00:47:29,785 --> 00:47:31,200
I see.

775
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:37,775
Man... I was really sleeping well.
I really didn't know you were here.

776
00:47:38,886 --> 00:47:40,566
I thought so...

777
00:47:42,177 --> 00:47:44,057
Are you going to get that?

778
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:47,276
I will. I will.

779
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:51,982
Hello?

780
00:47:52,585 --> 00:47:53,474
Yes, bro.

781
00:47:54,194 --> 00:47:54,890
What?

782
00:47:55,191 --> 00:47:57,293
Now? Alright.

783
00:47:57,786 --> 00:47:59,398
Alright, yes.

784
00:48:03,788 --> 00:48:04,693
Sua...

785
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,188
Can you help me?

786
00:48:20,569 --> 00:48:21,569
Sua!

787
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:23,771
-Why are you here?
-What?

788
00:48:24,365 --> 00:48:26,977
I was just going for
a drive then I saw you.

789
00:48:27,186 --> 00:48:29,167
Are you going for an interview?
I'll drop you.

790
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:31,469
No, it's fine. I can take the subway.

791
00:48:31,563 --> 00:48:34,675
Hey, just get in. Get in. Quick! Come!

792
00:48:35,462 --> 00:48:37,864
-It's really fine.
-Get in.

793
00:48:49,944 --> 00:48:52,548
Dusik? You were here too?

794
00:48:52,646 --> 00:48:54,246
Yes, Seojin!

795
00:48:54,446 --> 00:48:55,548
Take this.

796
00:48:56,649 --> 00:48:57,744
It's fine. I don't want.

797
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,244
I'll eat! I will.

798
00:48:59,347 --> 00:49:00,433
Seojin, take it for me.

799
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:03,235
What? The door and window are broken here.

800
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:06,346
Just get it for me. It opens a little bit.

801
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:08,519
She's right. This is delicious.

802
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:14,133
Give it to me.

803
00:49:16,238 --> 00:49:18,126
-What are you doing?
-Up!

804
00:49:21,535 --> 00:49:22,535
God, I'm stuck again!

805
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,940
-I told you! I knew this would happen!
-Okay!

806
00:49:25,052 --> 00:49:26,448
-Success!
-Okay!

807
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:30,241
What are you talking about? Success?

808
00:49:30,748 --> 00:49:33,146
-Sua, what're you doing! Press!
-Alright!

809
00:49:36,658 --> 00:49:38,658
What? What are you doing?
Where are we going?

810
00:49:38,762 --> 00:49:42,081
Jungi told me to kidnap you.
So stay still.

811
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:43,057
What?

812
00:49:43,378 --> 00:49:44,573
You guys!

813
00:49:44,664 --> 00:49:47,246
-I'm getting out!
-Hey, hey! Stay quiet!

814
00:49:47,762 --> 00:49:50,468
-Stop right now! Now!
-Don't do that! It's dangerous!

815
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,063
-She's inexperienced driver!
-Do something!

816
00:49:54,052 --> 00:49:55,052
Stay still!

817
00:50:06,773 --> 00:50:07,773
Excuse me?

818
00:50:09,154 --> 00:50:10,668
What are you doing?

819
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:12,557
Hey!

820
00:50:18,654 --> 00:50:19,654
Yuna.

821
00:50:20,844 --> 00:50:22,239
Why are you here?

822
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:24,350
I'm here to give you back your things.

823
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,865
-Yuna, that's just...
-I know how you feel.

824
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,468
I know you're truly sorry to me and Seol.

825
00:50:37,474 --> 00:50:39,661
But even if you try hard...

826
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:42,161
I won't change my mind.

827
00:50:42,854 --> 00:50:44,754
I really love Donggu.

828
00:50:46,148 --> 00:50:49,253
It was hard for me to live
because of the hurtful memory...

829
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,560
He helped me to stand up again.

830
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:56,741
I don't hate you anymore.
I'm telling you the truth.

831
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:59,324
Me and my Seol...

832
00:51:00,222 --> 00:51:01,728
We met Donggu...

833
00:51:03,425 --> 00:51:04,220
No.

834
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:07,337
We met this family...

835
00:51:09,415 --> 00:51:11,130
We are really happy now.

836
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,316
So, Sungmin.

837
00:51:14,923 --> 00:51:17,625
Let's just keep the good memories of us.

838
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,922
But if you keep doing this,

839
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:23,906
our good memories will fade away too.

840
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:28,610
That would be really sad.

841
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,904
I'll be going then.

842
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:39,007
If you miss Seol a lot,

843
00:51:39,812 --> 00:51:41,092
just call me anytime.

844
00:51:54,128 --> 00:51:56,542
Now, now! Check thoroughly
so that we don't miss anything.

845
00:51:56,637 --> 00:51:59,637
Don't say you forgot something
when we arrive in Dubai. Aright?

846
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,034
-Yes.
-Yes.

847
00:52:01,537 --> 00:52:02,449
Donggu.

848
00:52:02,754 --> 00:52:04,949
-Give me the location schedule.
-Yes.

849
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:11,445
-Here you go.
-Right, thanks.

850
00:52:31,822 --> 00:52:34,828
How can a parent leave
this little child alone?

851
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:37,612
I'm really sorry. I'll be going.

866
00:54:14,741 --> 00:54:18,242
Really! What is this! Where are we?

Who are these people?

"Urgent Press Conference of Lee Jungi'"

869
00:54:56,138 --> 00:54:57,234
Good afternoon.

870
00:54:57,641 --> 00:54:58,940
I'm actor, Lee Jungi.

871
00:54:59,236 --> 00:55:03,836
Thank you for coming here
although you were on a sort notice.

872
00:55:05,644 --> 00:55:06,549
Today,

873
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:08,533
I'll tell you the truth about...

874
00:55:08,729 --> 00:55:11,515
...Cindy and my rumors.

875
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:18,825
-First, me and Cindy...
-What?

876
00:55:18,937 --> 00:55:19,937
What is this?

877
00:55:20,022 --> 00:55:23,711
Cindy's wedding announcement?
3 months pregnant?

878
00:55:23,817 --> 00:55:27,706
Cindy is marrying actor Lee Minseok!
And she's pregnant before marriage.

879
00:55:29,115 --> 00:55:34,359
Man, I knew it. Cindy would never date
someone like him who is just a rookie.

880
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:35,954
-Man...
-Let's go, go!

881
00:55:41,267 --> 00:55:42,464
Excuse me! I!

882
00:55:42,557 --> 00:55:44,030
I! Me and Cindy!

883
00:55:44,118 --> 00:55:45,927
Excuse me!

884
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,528
Reporter? Reporters?

885
00:55:47,613 --> 00:55:49,816
Excuse me, reporters! Where're you going?

886
00:55:49,912 --> 00:55:51,117
I, Lee Jungi!

887
00:55:57,767 --> 00:55:58,663
All gone...

888
00:55:59,277 --> 00:56:00,758
What? Where are they going?

889
00:56:00,843 --> 00:56:02,960
Cindy announced her marriage.

890
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:04,246
What's here to interview?

891
00:56:04,338 --> 00:56:07,256
Man... He pretended he's so cool.

892
00:56:07,355 --> 00:56:08,756
What's this? So embarrassing.

893
00:56:08,852 --> 00:56:10,058
That's what I mean.

894
00:56:10,143 --> 00:56:12,844
He told us to bring Seojin
with all our efforts.

895
00:56:12,944 --> 00:56:14,741
It was to show us this?

896
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:16,543
My, my! So embarrassing.

897
00:56:18,037 --> 00:56:20,045
What in the world are you doing?

898
00:56:21,346 --> 00:56:22,434
I'm going.

899
00:56:22,737 --> 00:56:25,149
-Wait...
-Hey, hey! Seojin!

900
00:56:25,247 --> 00:56:27,649
-You can't just go!
-Let this go.

901
00:56:28,244 --> 00:56:30,348
I was going to tell the reporters
the truth.

902
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:31,856
Tell them that you're my girlfriend,

903
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:34,157
and that Cindy and I are not dating.

904
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,452
Are you an idiot?

905
00:56:35,545 --> 00:56:37,347
When did I tell you to do that?

906
00:56:38,453 --> 00:56:39,253
You didn't?

907
00:56:39,957 --> 00:56:41,455
Then what?

908
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:45,043
God, you're such an idiot.

909
00:56:45,128 --> 00:56:46,416
Forget it! I'm going.

910
00:56:46,522 --> 00:56:47,622
Seojin!

911
00:56:49,729 --> 00:56:50,932
I'm really sorry.

912
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:52,834
Until now,

913
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,620
I was a coward.

914
00:56:55,437 --> 00:56:56,437
But,

915
00:56:56,721 --> 00:56:57,939
now I know.

916
00:56:58,727 --> 00:57:01,121
The most important person in my life is...

917
00:57:02,421 --> 00:57:03,542
...you.

918
00:57:05,928 --> 00:57:07,136
Is that true?

919
00:57:08,431 --> 00:57:09,431
Seojin!

920
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:11,845
I love you.

921
00:57:13,236 --> 00:57:14,537
I really love you.

922
00:57:22,256 --> 00:57:24,048
Now I can see.

923
00:57:25,254 --> 00:57:27,546
-See what?
-Someone told me,

924
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:32,141
if you look at the other person's eyes,
you know how much he cares and loves you.

925
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:33,848
But...

926
00:57:34,545 --> 00:57:39,064
Now I can see it, just a little bit.

927
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:41,150
Really?

928
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:45,172
But just a little?

929
00:57:45,952 --> 00:57:47,268
That's impossible.

930
00:57:47,355 --> 00:57:48,756
Look, look, look.

931
00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:50,645
Look! You'll see a lot.

932
00:57:50,746 --> 00:57:52,550
-Look!
-It's disgusting. Stop it.

933
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,450
Look closely. Look how much I love you
and care about you. Look!

934
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,847
You can't stop joking around, really.

935
00:58:17,135 --> 00:58:18,225
They look great.

936
00:58:19,093 --> 00:58:20,400
You're right.

937
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:24,003
Why do they fight every time
when they love each other so much?

938
00:58:25,397 --> 00:58:28,209
Shall we really go to a
restaurant together this time?

939
00:58:28,494 --> 00:58:30,795
-Yes!
-Let's go! It's on me!

940
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,812
My, I'm starving.

941
00:58:37,703 --> 00:58:40,214
Sua, aren't you hungry?

942
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:42,706
Well, just a little.

943
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:47,665
You are? Then, shall we go
somewhere nice and eat something?

944
00:58:48,354 --> 00:58:49,045
What?

945
00:58:49,766 --> 00:58:52,856
You and me only?

946
00:58:52,965 --> 00:58:53,753
Why?

947
00:58:54,354 --> 00:58:57,959
Is there any reason that bans
two friends to eat in a nice restaurant?

948
00:59:00,553 --> 00:59:01,562
No, there's not.

949
00:59:03,474 --> 00:59:06,363
But somewhere nice...

950
00:59:06,462 --> 00:59:07,363
Where?

951
00:59:07,861 --> 00:59:08,974
Well, I don't know.

952
00:59:09,161 --> 00:59:10,678
We can look for it outside.

953
00:59:13,677 --> 00:59:14,868
-Let's go.
-Alright.

954
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:39,287
What? Where's everyone?

955
00:59:39,469 --> 00:59:40,684
It's strange.

956
00:59:48,212 --> 00:59:50,738
Yes, hello? This is Waikiki guesthouse.

957
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,015
Yes.

958
00:59:53,706 --> 00:59:54,396
What?

959
00:59:54,821 --> 00:59:56,008
Donggu did what?

960
00:59:56,804 --> 00:59:58,015
Alright.

961
00:59:58,114 --> 00:59:59,000
Yes.

962
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:05,456
"Donggu"

963
01:00:17,766 --> 01:00:20,280
Donggu. What's all this?

964
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:36,506
What are you doing?

965
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:38,792
Yuna.

966
01:00:41,493 --> 01:00:42,601
No, hey, Yuna.

967
01:00:43,003 --> 01:00:44,595
Will you marry me?

968
01:00:45,797 --> 01:00:48,491
I'll make you and Seol happy forever.

969
01:00:50,503 --> 01:00:52,096
Marry me, Yuna!

970
01:00:59,551 --> 01:01:00,750
I don't want to.

971
01:01:02,465 --> 01:01:04,155
Pardon? What...

972
01:01:04,555 --> 01:01:05,850
Wh..why?

973
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:08,454
Is it because I wasn't polite?

974
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:09,763
Then I will do it again.

975
01:01:09,857 --> 01:01:10,747
Miss Yuna.

976
01:01:11,758 --> 01:01:13,241
Will you please marry me?

977
01:01:14,856 --> 01:01:16,249
I don't want to.

978
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:24,382
Really, why?

979
01:01:24,678 --> 01:01:26,478
Let's talk about that later.

980
01:01:27,182 --> 01:01:29,209
What is going on with your movie, Donggu?

981
01:01:29,328 --> 01:01:31,312
The director called just now.

982
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:37,797
I decided not to go to Dubai.

983
01:01:38,397 --> 01:01:40,280
Leaving you and Seol,

984
01:01:40,389 --> 01:01:42,296
I just can't go.

985
01:01:42,395 --> 01:01:43,201
Why?

986
01:01:44,093 --> 01:01:45,923
Is it because of Seol's dad?

987
01:01:47,387 --> 01:01:48,387
No...

988
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:49,682
That's not it.

989
01:01:52,092 --> 01:01:54,788
I really need to take a
great deal of care of you.

990
01:01:55,801 --> 01:01:56,486
Pardon?

991
01:01:58,286 --> 01:01:59,596
Hey, Kang Donggu.

992
01:02:02,293 --> 01:02:03,795
Are you that insecure?

993
01:02:04,486 --> 01:02:06,283
What's there to feel insecured?

994
01:02:06,677 --> 01:02:09,791
I don't feel like that at all,
why do you feel that?

995
01:02:10,289 --> 01:02:12,076
You're such a coward.

996
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:14,565
What did I do...

997
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:16,478
You thought you proposing now,

998
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,771
would make me so touched?

999
01:02:19,373 --> 01:02:22,278
Giving up on your job
that you dreamed of doing?

1000
01:02:22,569 --> 01:02:24,873
Because of me?

1001
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,869
-Can't you trust me, Donggu?
-No...

1002
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,172
That's not what I mean...

1003
01:02:34,445 --> 01:02:35,445
Donggu.

1004
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:37,964
Don't worry...

1005
01:02:38,737 --> 01:02:39,948
...and go.

1006
01:02:41,536 --> 01:02:43,444
I'll always be here.

1007
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:46,230
Forever,

1008
01:02:47,135 --> 01:02:49,146
I'll be right next to Kang Donggu.

1009
01:02:58,796 --> 01:02:59,898
Did you say forever?

1010
01:03:44,919 --> 01:03:46,016
I'll be going, then.

1011
01:03:46,228 --> 01:03:48,024
-Safe trip.
-Bye.

1012
01:03:50,133 --> 01:03:52,745
You two don't fight or break up
just because I'm not here.

1013
01:03:52,846 --> 01:03:54,350
Fine.

1014
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:57,552
Jungi, take a good care of my sister.
If not, you already know, right?

1015
01:03:57,637 --> 01:03:59,242
I know! I know!

1016
01:03:59,634 --> 01:04:03,235
I'll be buried in the
mountain before I know it.

1017
01:04:03,334 --> 01:04:07,744
I will treat her like a princess
as I really don't want to hear this.

1018
01:04:08,036 --> 01:04:09,599
Okay. That's good.

1019
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:11,496
Sua, good luck with your shop.

1020
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:14,194
Stop bullying Dusik. Alright?

1021
01:04:14,306 --> 01:04:16,210
When did I bully Dusik?

1022
01:04:16,312 --> 01:04:18,021
I don't bully him these days!

1023
01:04:18,311 --> 01:04:19,444
Why is that?

1024
01:04:20,006 --> 01:04:23,012
Why won't you bully him?
I'm very curious about that.

1025
01:04:24,219 --> 01:04:25,331
What is!

1026
01:04:25,534 --> 01:04:27,927
Shut up! Just go! Just go to Dubai!

1027
01:04:28,617 --> 01:04:29,625
Dusik you too!

1028
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:32,809
Stop dating and work on the scenario.
Alright?

1029
01:04:32,904 --> 01:04:34,221
What dating?

1030
01:04:34,502 --> 01:04:36,216
-When did I!
-Anyway!

1031
01:04:36,301 --> 01:04:39,723
Finish the scenario until I get back.
I'll be checking on you frequently.

1032
01:04:39,824 --> 01:04:42,406
Fine! Stop nagging!

1033
01:04:44,022 --> 01:04:46,402
Yuna. I'll go then.

1034
01:04:46,524 --> 01:04:49,403
Sure. Take care and have a safe trip.

1035
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:50,309
Alright.

1036
01:04:51,197 --> 01:04:52,126
Even if I'm not here,

1037
01:04:52,211 --> 01:04:57,546
eat well, sleep well, digest
well, go to restroom well,

1038
01:04:57,634 --> 01:04:59,340
and don't look at other man.

1039
01:04:59,446 --> 01:05:01,634
God, alright! Alright!

1040
01:05:01,746 --> 01:05:03,950
-Stop it and just go.
-Alright.

1041
01:05:04,035 --> 01:05:05,736
But I need to say bye to Seol.

1042
01:05:07,722 --> 01:05:09,013
Seol.

1043
01:05:09,214 --> 01:05:11,127
Don't forget me.

1044
01:05:11,212 --> 01:05:13,719
Don't be sick and be healthy.

1045
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:16,418
I'll be back soon. Alright?

1046
01:05:17,722 --> 01:05:19,108
I'm really going!

1047
01:05:19,222 --> 01:05:21,107
Right? Seol!

1048
01:05:21,391 --> 01:05:22,607
I'll be back.

1049
01:05:22,805 --> 01:05:23,606
Alright?

1050
01:05:26,205 --> 01:05:27,396
Daddy!

1051
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:30,998
What?

1052
01:05:35,956 --> 01:05:36,857
Seol.

1053
01:05:37,552 --> 01:05:39,357
What did you just say?

1054
01:05:40,342 --> 01:05:41,342
Daddy!

1055
01:05:44,151 --> 01:05:45,249
Did you hear that?

1056
01:05:45,334 --> 01:05:46,456
Did you hear?

1057
01:05:46,937 --> 01:05:49,354
Did you hear her say daddy to me?

1058
01:05:49,439 --> 01:05:51,151
Well, yes. Yes, we did.

1059
01:05:51,236 --> 01:05:53,845
-Are you that happy?
-Of course I am! Seol!

1060
01:05:53,938 --> 01:05:57,430
Do it one more time. Please?
Say daddy! Daddy!

1061
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:01,041
My, my, you're doing that again.
You don't just give me what I want.

1062
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:04,339
Please? Just once. Just once more. Please?

1063
01:06:04,456 --> 01:06:07,359
Donggu! Stop it.
You might miss your flight.

1064
01:06:07,454 --> 01:06:10,363
God, I really don't want to go
after I heard Seol say daddy.

1065
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:13,071
Yuna, should I cancel the flight?

1066
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:14,646
You're doing that again!

1067
01:06:14,857 --> 01:06:16,162
Go quickly.

1068
01:06:16,342 --> 01:06:17,456
Fine.

1069
01:06:20,654 --> 01:06:21,562
I'm really going then.

1070
01:06:21,662 --> 01:06:22,769
-Sure.
-Alright.

1071
01:06:24,462 --> 01:06:25,274
Seol.

1072
01:06:28,386 --> 01:06:29,575
Daddy will be back.

1073
01:06:34,611 --> 01:06:36,928
-Bye!
-Bye!

1074
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:39,420
Careful and safe trip!

1075
01:06:49,267 --> 01:06:50,166
Who is that!

1076
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:52,649
I know you are there.

1077
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:55,451
Will you come out by yourself
or should I drag you out?

1078
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,632
Come out, right now!

1079
01:07:09,052 --> 01:07:11,064
You found me.

1080
01:07:12,865 --> 01:07:15,357
Maybe you have good sense
as you're a president.

1081
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:16,846
Shut up!

1082
01:07:17,648 --> 01:07:20,061
Release my citizens, you alien!

1083
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,156
A president on Earth,
who cares so much about his citizens.

1084
01:07:23,241 --> 01:07:24,350
That's really new.

1085
01:07:24,547 --> 01:07:29,350
But you're too late.
Earth is compromised by Bbiratutu Star.

1086
01:07:30,157 --> 01:07:33,060
Don't you dare harm my citizens.

1087
01:07:33,673 --> 01:07:34,974
Or else!

1088
01:07:40,762 --> 01:07:44,244
My finger zap will never forgive you.

1089
01:07:44,347 --> 01:07:45,561
That's so laughable.

1090
01:07:51,214 --> 01:07:52,716
Cut! NG!

1091
01:07:52,829 --> 01:07:53,829
"Director Kang Donggu"

1092
01:07:54,127 --> 01:07:55,518
"President is Bruce Lee"

1093
01:07:55,614 --> 01:07:56,422
Jerk!

1094
01:07:57,417 --> 01:07:59,484
How can you cough there, you jerk!

1095
01:07:59,569 --> 01:08:01,995
I can't breath inside!
Also, why are you making me do this?

1096
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,493
I'm a writer. Writer!

1097
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,967
We don't have enough money.
Can't you sacrifice for your work?

1098
01:08:08,078 --> 01:08:10,944
Hey! It was hard for me to make
some time to act as a main character.

1099
01:08:11,047 --> 01:08:12,745
What is this? This?

1100
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:15,349
I'm Song Joon Seok.
Song Joon Seok from the News Room!

1101
01:08:15,445 --> 01:08:20,794
Song Joon Seok, my ass! You did only one.
Now you have nothing to do.

1102
01:08:20,884 --> 01:08:21,890
What did you say?

1103
01:08:21,991 --> 01:08:25,580
I told you I'm searching
for a good scenario. Alright?

1104
01:08:25,788 --> 01:08:28,282
I'm filming this even without guarantee.
How dare he...

1105
01:08:28,382 --> 01:08:31,682
And also, will this movie
even be released?

1106
01:08:31,777 --> 01:08:33,777
How can there be more actors than staffs?

1107
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,886
Hey! Having many staffs doesn't
mean, that it's a good movie.

1108
01:08:36,977 --> 01:08:39,680
Instead, the director is good. Isn't it?

1109
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:41,783
Director, my ass.

1110
01:08:41,894 --> 01:08:44,187
-You're right. He's really being funny.
-You're more funny!

1111
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:45,584
You wrote this kind of scenario!

1112
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,396
How can a writer wear this kind of thing!
I'm a writer!

1113
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:52,396
Shut up!

1114
01:08:54,982 --> 01:08:57,807
You called me to write an article for you.
Now you're fighting again?

1115
01:08:57,892 --> 01:09:00,282
Should I write a story about you fighting?

1116
01:09:01,196 --> 01:09:03,378
My, my... You pain in the neck!

1117
01:09:05,195 --> 01:09:07,585
Hey, this movie is bad.

1118
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:10,478
-Why don't you just stop here?
-What are you talking about!

1119
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:12,986
-Our movie is going to be a hit.
-Of course!

1120
01:09:13,073 --> 01:09:15,880
-We'll go to the Cannes Film Festival.
-I'll receive the best actor award!

1121
01:09:17,564 --> 01:09:18,684
Donggu!

1122
01:09:21,383 --> 01:09:22,176
It's our meal.

1123
01:09:23,264 --> 01:09:25,358
Your meals are here. Have some.

1124
01:09:25,462 --> 01:09:26,652
Yuna, are you here?

1125
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:29,771
Seol, you're here too?

1126
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:31,580
How's your shooting?

1127
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,192
Sure. I can already feel
that this movie will be a hit.

1128
01:09:36,481 --> 01:09:37,815
Everyone, let's eat.

1129
01:09:37,891 --> 01:09:39,382
-Come!
-Meal, meal!

1130
01:09:39,478 --> 01:09:40,676
Let's eat!

1131
01:09:41,081 --> 01:09:41,969
Hey!

1132
01:09:42,384 --> 01:09:43,805
What are you doing there?

1133
01:09:45,295 --> 01:09:47,695
Hey, you said you got a permit
to shoot here.

1134
01:09:47,797 --> 01:09:49,391
You didn't! Right?

1135
01:09:49,502 --> 01:09:52,189
What?
Then we were shooting without permit?

1136
01:09:53,294 --> 01:09:55,403
Well, I didn't have enough money.

1137
01:09:55,898 --> 01:09:57,202
What should we do now?

1138
01:09:57,295 --> 01:09:59,294
What do you mean what should we do?

1139
01:09:59,387 --> 01:10:00,400
-Run!
-What?

1140
01:10:00,495 --> 01:10:02,694
-God!
-My god! Really!

1141
01:10:02,789 --> 01:10:04,592
-Run!
-Right!

1142
01:10:05,788 --> 01:10:06,997
Hey!

1143
01:10:55,433 --> 01:11:00,333
"Welcome to Waikiki"
