1
00:00:00,635 --> 00:00:03,570
Seojin, wake up.

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:05,772
You haven't eaten in days.

3
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:08,557
She's right. This is not your first time
failing an interview.

4
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:10,512
When are you going to get up?

5
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:12,469
Stop bothering me and get out.

6
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:13,704
This brat.

7
00:00:13,793 --> 00:00:16,093
Why did you slap him with pork?

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,744
He was harassing her.

9
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,868
Still, you shouldn't have slapped
the interviewer!

10
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:22,011
With pork at that!

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,216
You have such a bad temper...

12
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:25,246
That's enough!

13
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:27,536
Jeez! Don't yell at me!

14
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:30,457
You should shave.

15
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:32,648
What if the guests see you...?

16
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:36,906
Are you crying?

17
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:42,042
I really wanted to work
at that newspaper company.

18
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:46,121
That's the company I aimed for
when I decided to become a journalist.

19
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,368
You should be consoling me,
not yelling at me.

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,907
No, I just...

21
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:53,420
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,245
Stop crying.

23
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:57,642
-You'll pass the next interview.
-Forget it.

24
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:02,165
Who would hire a hot-headed,
reckless person like me?

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,734
I want to give up on becoming
a journalist or getting a job.

26
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:08,023
You want to give up?

27
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,067
Kang Seojin!

28
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:12,780
You can't give up on your dream over this.

29
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:14,901
You're being ridiculous.

30
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:17,112
-Our family...
-You're right.

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,867
That's why I'm giving up!

32
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,246
I only said one word.

33
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:27,679
Jeez, Donggu!

34
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,900
Read the room!

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,892
-Read the room!
-You're so stupid.

36
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:33,839
Seojin. Please?

37
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,629
Eat something,
then you can go back to sleep.

38
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:37,401
I don't want to.

39
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:38,446
You have to eat.

40
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:39,868
"Journalist Exam"

41
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:45,278
How is Seojin doing?

42
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:46,569
Did she eat something?

43
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:50,044
No, she's still crying in her room.

44
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,944
This is bad.

45
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:54,337
How can we make her feel better?

46
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:58,891
Seojin likes chicken feet.
Shall we have that for dinner?

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,712
That won't make her feel better.

48
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:06,012
What she really needs is consolation.

49
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,045
Consolation?

50
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,284
Something like
"Pain is a blessing for the youth"?

51
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,934
It's such a cliche. I can't do it.

52
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,359
Right, Yuna?

53
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,912
How much do I need to open
a bakery like this?

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,506
A lot.

55
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:29,154
You want to open a bakery?

56
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:32,145
A pastry chef? That's a big dream.

57
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:33,345
I didn't say that.

58
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:35,888
I was just talking to myself.

59
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:38,744
You always say the wrong thing.

60
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:42,125
That's not true. I only said one word.

61
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:45,534
-Why are you yelling at me?
-I'm not!

62
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:47,613
I've never yelled at anyone in my life!

63
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,289
What you are doing right now is yelling.

64
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,214
No, I'm not.

65
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,780
-When did I yell?
-Right now!

66
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:54,574
Don't you know the word "yell"?

67
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:57,196
Donggu.

68
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:58,619
What are you doing?

69
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,253
Are you having a lovers' quarrel?

70
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:01,712
That's ridiculous.

71
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,075
What is that car?

72
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:05,132
My TV drama series will begin soon.

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,986
So, I bought one.

74
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:09,692
It's only a small part.
Why would you buy a car?

75
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:10,649
Shut up.

76
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:12,784
It's cold. I'll give you a ride.

77
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,302
Gee...

78
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:20,200
Welcome.

79
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,911
How old is this car? Does it even run?

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,473
Of course. Rebecca is stronger
than she seems.

81
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,659
All right, here we go.

82
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:35,348
Re... Rebecca...

83
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:36,412
What happened?

84
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:38,245
Did the engine die?

85
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:40,001
It's okay. It's okay.

86
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,055
I'll just start it again.

87
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:50,678
-What the hell?
-It's no big deal.

88
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:53,066
I'll just sew it back on.

89
00:03:57,534 --> 00:03:59,301
It's okay. It's okay.

90
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,745
This is not okay!

91
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,557
I'm getting out. What the hell?

92
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,211
It's not opening!

93
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,123
It only opens from the outside.

94
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:07,335
What?

95
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,626
It's okay. It's okay.

96
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,349
I'll open the door for you.

97
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,115
Don't do that to Rebecca!

98
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:17,814
What the hell! Why did this come off?!

99
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,813
Leave Rebecca alone.

100
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:22,745
-I can see the inside of the car!
-Rebecca is a transparent car.

101
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,360
Did you assemble this car yourself?

102
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:25,735
The engine is on.

103
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:28,535
All right, let's go.

104
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,253
-What's wrong with Donggu?
-We almost died.

105
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:49,112
I will never ride Rebecca again.

106
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,430
You're such a scaredy-cat.

107
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:53,231
It's okay. It's okay.

108
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,074
-Stop saying that.
-Dusik.

109
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:56,746
I'll take Seol. Thanks so much.

110
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:58,732
-Seol, go to Mommy.
-Seol, I missed you.

111
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:00,722
I missed you.

112
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:02,085
I missed you.

113
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:04,282
What are you doing?

114
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:07,979
This jerk. You're manipulating
the view count again.

115
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,684
Everyone does it.

116
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,618
The view count is not increasing
these days.

117
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:14,461
That's because your novel is really bad.

118
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,390
It's not good?

119
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:18,512
Dusik is a good writer.

120
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:19,445
A good writer?

121
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:22,344
Have you read his web novel?

122
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:23,535
Listen.

123
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:26,162
The president gets kidnapped by aliens.

124
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:29,445
But he shoots palm blasts
and defeats all the aliens.

125
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:31,003
Guess who that president is.

126
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:33,711
It's the President of the United States.

127
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:37,722
He's the reincarnation of Bruce Lee.

128
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,890
See?

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,905
Bruce Lee can't shoot palm blasts!

130
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:42,401
Fine, make fun of my work.

131
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:45,979
But if I become a successful writer,
I will never cast you!

132
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,299
Good. Thank you.

133
00:05:47,454 --> 00:05:48,504
Move over.

134
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,824
-Dusik!
-He's sulking again.

135
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,079
You're sulking again!

136
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,334
Stop it.

137
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:55,809
What's this book?

138
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,944
"Youth consolation project."

139
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:02,785
"Falling is not a failure,
but not getting back up is"?

140
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,779
That's pretty good.

141
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:07,087
That's such a cliche.

142
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,079
It's so corny.

143
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,814
Do people find that comforting?

144
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:13,640
Tell me about it.

145
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:14,812
I'm hungry.

146
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,612
I'm going to have a bowl of ramyeon.

147
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,137
-I'll have some too.
-Okay, two bowls.

148
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:20,580
Jeez!

149
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:26,906
-Seojin.
-Seojin.

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,834
Seojin!

151
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,098
-Seojin.
-Kang Seojin!

152
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:36,071
How long is she going to be like that?

153
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,720
I don't know. I'm worried about her.

154
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:42,201
Yuna.

155
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,678
Can you take her out on a walk,
get some fresh air and comfort her?

156
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:49,246
Me?

157
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:55,163
You said that what she needs
is consolation, right?

158
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:56,817
Do it as a favor for me.

159
00:06:57,934 --> 00:07:00,716
-Okay, I'll try.
-Thanks.

160
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:02,712
Wait and see.

161
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:05,479
I'll succeed and take revenge on everyone!

162
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:07,360
-Lee Jungi!
-Dusik.

163
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,301
I told you not to use your computer
at work, didn't I?

164
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:11,978
I'm sorry!

165
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,846
Put this in the washing machine
at my house.

166
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,946
The entrance code is #8914#. Okay?

167
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:22,542
I got it. Let go of my ear!

168
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:25,540
When are you going to hire
a new part-timer?

169
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,187
I already hired one, so stop whining.

170
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:32,758
Here she comes.

171
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,312
Say hi.

172
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:43,830
This is Kim Seonwoo.
She'll be working with you.

173
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:44,898
She's my daughter.

174
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,476
-What?
-Why are you so shocked?

175
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,279
Hello.

176
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:53,378
Don't mistreat her. Teach her well.

177
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,842
-Okay?
-Yes, Father-in-law.

178
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,295
-Huh?
-What?

179
00:07:57,637 --> 00:07:58,471
What?

180
00:07:58,767 --> 00:07:59,780
I didn't say anything.

181
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:01,854
-That's strange.
-Dad.

182
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:04,539
We have to work. Go!

183
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,678
My dad's giving you a lot of trouble, huh?

184
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:12,052
-He has a temper.
-No, he's great.

185
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:15,198
You can call me Seonwoo.
I'm much younger than you.

186
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:17,645
-Okay, I will.
-Good.

187
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:19,453
What do you do?

188
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:23,466
I'm actually an aspiring writer.

189
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:25,412
Wow, that's amazing.

190
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,832
-What do you write?
-Scenarios.

191
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:34,879
My dream is to write a pure love story
like Iwai Shunji's "Love Letter."

192
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:36,769
I love that movie.

193
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,919
Can I be first one to read your scenario?

194
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,222
-Okay.
-Promise?

195
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:47,923
I promise, honey.

196
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:49,321
-Sorry?
-What?

197
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,122
I didn't say anything. Not a word.

198
00:08:57,501 --> 00:08:59,935
How many times have we watched this?

199
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:03,842
A UFC match is on.

200
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,568
-Shall we switch the channel?
-Sure.

201
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:21,161
Okay, okay.
Watch it for the rest of your life.

202
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:25,622
What's that sound?

203
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:27,908
What is that?

204
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,676
Where is it coming from?

205
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:45,632
Is that the sound of your heart beating?

206
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:46,568
Jungi.

207
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,184
I think I'm in love.

208
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:54,468
There he goes again.

209
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:56,329
Who is it this time?

210
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:59,435
The daughter of my boss.

211
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:02,173
-She's super cute and adorable...
-We don't care.

212
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:04,535
I told you this before.

213
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,379
The cuter and more adorable she is,

214
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:09,021
the possibility of you dating her
gets closer to zero.

215
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:11,135
So don't even dream about it.

216
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:12,146
It's different this time.

217
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:14,617
She seems interested in me.

218
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,136
Hello?

219
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:19,119
Yes.

220
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:21,054
A film production company?

221
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,767
I'm Tak Myeonghwan, the CEO
and the director of Artist Tak Film.

222
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:33,770
I see.

223
00:10:34,911 --> 00:10:38,011
Your web novel was very impressive.

224
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,200
I see.

225
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:43,075
-You enjoyed it?
-No.

226
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:45,222
Your web novel is garbage.

227
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:48,603
-Then why did you call...
-But!

228
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:52,934
On the fourth page of chapter 7
in your web novel "President Bruce Lee",

229
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:55,246
there's a bed scene
between the main characters.

230
00:10:55,334 --> 00:11:00,484
I think you're a master...
No, the personification of eroticism.

231
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:02,879
I'll get to the point.

232
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:04,979
I want you to write me a scenario.

233
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:05,901
What?

234
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:07,462
A scenario?

235
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,813
-What kind of...
-Well...

236
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:12,152
Have you heard of
the "Goodbye Sister-in-law" series?

237
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,446
I've never heard of that movie.
What is it about?

238
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:18,435
An erotic movie about the forbidden love
between brother and sister-in-law.

239
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:20,713
I'd like you to write the fifth movie
of the series...

240
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,700
I'm offended.

241
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,381
I don't write that kind of stuff.

242
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,904
Paul Verhoeven! Ang Lee! Stanley Kubrick!

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,701
-Do you know these masters?
-I do.

244
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:36,165
Then you must know "Basic Instinct,"
"Lust, Caution," "Eyes Wide Shut".

245
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:40,592
I'm not trying to make
a lewd erotic movie.

246
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:45,403
Mr. Bong, won't you create
a masterpiece with me?

247
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:49,101
And let's go to Cannes together.

248
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:50,786
What do you think?

249
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,001
Seojin.

250
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,911
Isn't it nice to be outside?

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,335
It's refreshing, isn't it?

252
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:17,780
This is terrible.

253
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:20,169
Not at all. I'm freezing.

254
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:22,928
Yuna, I'm cold. Let's go home.

255
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:23,965
Wait.

256
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,813
I brought you out to tell you something.

257
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:28,088
What is it?

258
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,624
Say it quickly. I'm freezing.

259
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:32,702
Seojin.

260
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,645
"Falling is not a failure,
but not getting back up is."

261
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:39,802
What?

262
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:43,957
Do you see that kid?

263
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:48,935
He fell so many times
trying to fly that kite.

264
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,635
But he didn't give up
and he got back on his feet.

265
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,338
In the end, he succeeded
at flying that kite.

266
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:55,579
And?

267
00:12:55,667 --> 00:13:00,395
So, you need to get back on your feet
no matter how many times you fall.

268
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:04,684
Then you'll be able to fly
as high as that kite some day.

269
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,689
Look at that kite flying.

270
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:13,207
What's the point? I'm freezing!

271
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,212
Seojin, don't be like that.

272
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,444
Fine, I'll look.

273
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,380
Why do I have to look at...

274
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,668
Seojin!

275
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,834
Oh my goodness!

276
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,306
Seojin, are you okay?

277
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:28,695
-Blood...!
-Blood!

278
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,545
Seojin, I'm so sorry.

279
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:37,034
Seojin, please open the door.

280
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,413
Seojin!

281
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:41,063
Just leave me alone!

282
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:46,765
I asked you to comfort her,
not go and watch a kite.

283
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:48,829
I didn't know this would happen.

284
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:51,209
-I'll talk to her again.
-Forget it.

285
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,199
You stay out of this. I'll do it.

286
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:56,045
Comforting her shouldn't be that hard.

287
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:57,333
You're useless.

288
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:11,663
What is it?

289
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,020
What is it?!

290
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,034
Donggu?

291
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,478
Why did you wake me?

292
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:22,911
We have to go somewhere.

293
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,146
Where? It's too early.

294
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:26,476
You'll see.

295
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:27,696
Get up.

296
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,312
I'm sleepy.

297
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,362
Where are we going?

298
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:40,309
Why did we climb a mountain
so early in the morning?

299
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:45,613
I have something to tell you.

300
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:46,535
What?

301
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:48,345
What is it?

302
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:49,268
Seojin...

303
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:54,427
"Falling is not a failure,
but not getting back up is."

304
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:57,301
Seojin.

305
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:03,199
The sun rises from the east
and sets in the west every day.

306
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:08,011
Then it continues to travel
around the earth to rise again, right?

307
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,409
So what?

308
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,403
So, if you keep going like the sun,

309
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:17,989
you'll shine bright one day.

310
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,014
You know what I'm saying, don't you?

311
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:24,802
Kiddo.

312
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:26,526
Let's go back down now.

313
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:27,931
Seojin.

314
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,898
Let's race to the bottom.

315
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:31,502
Come on.

316
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:36,627
Donggu!

317
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:37,535
Are you okay?

318
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,071
I can't get up!

319
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:42,218
Ouch. It hurts.

320
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:43,825
I bumped my knee on the rock!

321
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:46,215
Why did you make us come here?!

322
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:47,877
Can you get up?

323
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,926
I can't get up!

324
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:53,755
On the rock! My knee!

325
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,108
It hurts!

326
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,391
You said you have to get back up
after falling.

327
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:04,635
Sorry.

328
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:07,426
But Seojin, don't forget what I said.

329
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:09,602
-Falling is not a failure, but...
-Shut up!

330
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:10,719
Okay.

331
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:12,038
This is so annoying.

332
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:19,174
Seojin.

333
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,047
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

334
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:22,712
It's all my fault.

335
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:25,945
Gee... After giving me that lecture...

336
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:27,890
It really hurt.

337
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:31,806
My knee hit the rock really hard.

338
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,834
Shut up!

339
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:36,529
You two can't do anything right.

340
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:40,078
I'll make Seojin feel better.

341
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,434
You two stay out of it.

342
00:16:41,523 --> 00:16:43,345
Don't you know what she's going through?

343
00:16:43,434 --> 00:16:45,834
Comforting her shouldn't be that hard.

344
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:49,491
Amateurs...

345
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,001
What is it this time?

346
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:05,961
What is it?!

347
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:10,102
Get up. We have to go somewhere.

348
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:12,345
Where?

349
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:14,564
Why are you guys doing this to me?!

350
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:15,987
You'll see when we get there.

351
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:17,613
Get up now.

352
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:20,061
Jeez...

353
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:21,668
I'm not going.

354
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:23,967
Come on.

355
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:25,999
I don't want to go!

356
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:27,479
I'm not going!

357
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:28,774
I don't want to!

358
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:30,586
I'm not going!

359
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:40,679
What the hell!

360
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:43,638
Jeez! Who is it?

361
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:47,378
It's Seonwoo.

362
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,126
Dusik, did you have lunch?

363
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:53,282
I did. I ate noodles...

364
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:55,523
I had pasta.

365
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:59,007
Wow, that sounds delicious.

366
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:01,401
I love pasta.

367
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:06,734
Then shall we have pasta together
some time?

368
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:09,697
Really? I'd love that.

369
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,150
She's adorable!

370
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:18,864
It's Director Tak.

371
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,474
Thank you for sending me the scenario.

372
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,581
But the bed scene is not hot enough.

373
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:27,713
I see.

374
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:33,988
I've saved screen shots of good bed scenes.

375
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:40,853
You can look through those
and tell me which style you prefer.

376
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:45,190
Where did I save those screen shots?

377
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:50,068
Here they are.

378
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:53,966
-This one...
-Dusik.

379
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:55,879
Can you recommend me a movie?

380
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,769
Your favorite movie.

381
00:18:58,701 --> 00:18:59,535
Send.

382
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:00,967
Okay.

383
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:04,457
Something like this?

384
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:09,820
That's done.

385
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:12,597
Why is Seonwoo so quiet?

386
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:29,155
Why...! Why did it go to Seonwoo...?!

387
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:30,951
Darn it!

388
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:37,446
She hasn't read it. Please don't read it!

389
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:38,944
-Please don't read it!
-Dusik!

390
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:41,501
Seonwoo.

391
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:43,413
Hello, sir.

392
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:46,112
Where are you running to like a maniac?

393
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:47,578
Is something wrong?

394
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,790
No, I'm jogging on this fine day.

395
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:52,472
Seonwoo.

396
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,679
Have you read my message?

397
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,816
You sent me a message?
I haven't read it yet.

398
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,535
My dad suddenly wanted to go out for lunch
so I left it at home.

399
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,111
I see.

400
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,405
Why did you send her a message?!

401
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:10,755
I asked him to recommend me a good movie.

402
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:13,756
Let's go eat, Dad.

403
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:15,915
-See you later.
-Bye.

404
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,169
See you later.

405
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:21,701
Thank goodness.

406
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:24,068
She hasn't seen it yet.

407
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,401
She hasn't seen it yet.

408
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:26,702
Wait.

409
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:29,462
They're going to have lunch right now.

410
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:31,735
That means their house is empty.

411
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:44,747
This is why you woke me up?

412
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:47,379
It's nice, isn't it?

413
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:50,319
Plus, I have something to tell you.

414
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:51,862
You too?

415
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,578
Everyone has something to tell me.

416
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,855
What are you going to say?

417
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,101
Seojin.

418
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:04,834
-Falling is not a failure...
-But not getting back up is?

419
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:06,479
How do you know that?

420
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,111
Did the three of you plan this together?

421
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,569
What the hell are you guys talking about?!

422
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:14,406
Don't you get it?

423
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:15,735
Seojin.

424
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:18,167
Look at the reeds.

425
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,814
Look. Those reeds.

426
00:21:23,674 --> 00:21:27,745
The reeds shake with the wind
but they never fall down.

427
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:28,672
So what?

428
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:32,146
So, if you overcome this harsh wind,

429
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:36,462
you'll be able to bloom
into a beautiful flower.

430
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:38,534
Do you understand?

431
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,467
Yes. Let's go home now.

432
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,135
Kiddo.

433
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:45,974
I cheered you up, didn't I?

434
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,008
Yes. So please let's go home!

435
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:50,384
Kiddo.

436
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:52,012
You're so cute.

437
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,638
Okay, let's go home.

438
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:57,761
All right, let's go.

439
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,544
Here we go.

440
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:04,423
-What the hell?
-It's okay. It's okay.

441
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:07,212
It's not okay! The car keeps stopping!

442
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,094
The engine is heating up.

443
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:16,335
Lee Jungi, well done.

444
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,178
What is that?

445
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:23,943
This thing...
It's stuck...

446
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:25,403
What is that?

447
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:28,083
Seojin, wake up!

448
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:30,978
Take this off the windshield!
I can't see properly.

449
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:32,801
Unbelievable...

450
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,879
What's wrong with this window?

451
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:36,813
It's broken.

452
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:39,582
Take this thing off!

453
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,435
Gee! You bought a car
that's just like you!

454
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:49,867
Thanks.

455
00:22:51,901 --> 00:22:53,539
-What's happening?!
-What?

456
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,856
-Do something!
-Hold on.

457
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,279
It's going up!

458
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:01,746
It's broken.

459
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,568
Then pull over!

460
00:23:03,878 --> 00:23:05,878
I can't pull over!
There's a truck behind us!

461
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,279
Then I have to keep going like this?!

462
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:09,886
Hold on!
I'll pull over at the intersection.

463
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:13,211
How could you do this to me?

464
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,112
How could you?

465
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,287
I've always been like this.

466
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,268
It's not a crime to meet other women.

467
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,837
You're making a fuss over nothing.

468
00:23:20,926 --> 00:23:22,339
Are you serious?

469
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,150
You jerk...

470
00:23:24,732 --> 00:23:26,311
Fine. Slap me.

471
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,600
Slap me and let's break up.

472
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:30,145
Go ahead. I'm ready.

473
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:31,068
Go on.

474
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:34,569
Stop crying and hit me,
so we can break up.

475
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,018
Darn it!

476
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:22,011
Sixth floor! Unit 605!

477
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,246
605... 605...

478
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:25,633
605!

479
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,168
Seonwoo's room! Seonwoo's room!

480
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:35,674
Bathroom!

481
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:39,044
What's that smell?!

482
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:42,268
This is it!

483
00:24:47,963 --> 00:24:48,954
Found it.

484
00:24:55,697 --> 00:24:57,436
Darn it! Who is that?

485
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:06,334
How could you forget your wallet?

486
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:08,745
Yeah, I'm sorry.

487
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,335
I'm sorry!

488
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,248
Seonwoo!

489
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,498
Dusik sent me a message.

490
00:25:16,234 --> 00:25:18,217
-What is this?!
-What is it?

491
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,101
What is this?!

492
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:21,546
That jerk!

493
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:24,011
Crazy jerk!

494
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,591
I'll kill him!

495
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:28,245
No, Dad. He's not like that.

496
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:30,211
He's really pure.

497
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,078
Why do you keep taking his side?

498
00:25:33,204 --> 00:25:34,965
Do you like him?

499
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,979
No, I don't have any
feeling for him yet...

500
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:39,879
You do like him!

501
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:42,646
How could you like him?

502
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:44,779
It's none of your business!

503
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:45,746
Give me my phone.

504
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:46,934
What are you doing?

505
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:49,997
I'm asking him if he sent it by mistake.

506
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,402
Sir.

507
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:10,446
This is a misunderstanding.

508
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:13,012
It's not what it seems, Seonwoo.
This is a misunderstanding.

509
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:15,437
So what happened was...

510
00:26:19,734 --> 00:26:21,001
Why am I holding this?

511
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,034
You pervert!

512
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:24,068
No...

513
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:26,326
Ms. Kang.

514
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:29,104
Why did you slap a stranger?

515
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,012
What happened was...

516
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,880
Her arm got stuck in the window,
so she involuntarily...

517
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:37,162
That's ridiculous!

518
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:39,713
The guy is badly hurt!

519
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:41,700
I'm telling you the truth.

520
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:45,979
Why did you slap a stranger?!

521
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:47,780
-He blacked out!
-Guys!

522
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:48,978
Seojin, are you all right?

523
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,578
What happened?

524
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,342
Why are you in the police station?

525
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,934
What did you do to her?!

526
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:58,978
I was driving and a newspaper got stuck
on the windshield....

527
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:02,754
-What?
-Her arm got stuck in the window...

528
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:05,379
I'm not a pervert!
This is a misunderstanding!

529
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:06,382
Dusik!

530
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,079
Why are you here?

531
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,262
Donggu!

532
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:11,463
Let go of me!

533
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:12,798
Donggu!

534
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:15,095
Donggu!

535
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,147
What's wrong?

536
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:19,424
Please tell them that I'm not a pervert.

537
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,368
Of course you're not!
Who said that you were?

538
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:23,942
-Unbelievable...
-What is it?

539
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:27,168
Dusik.

540
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:29,781
Why did you break into that house?

541
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:33,248
I don't know. Don't ask me anything.

542
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:37,746
You're lucky you got away
with a restraining order.

543
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:40,924
You could've worn an ankle monitor.

544
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:46,212
Seojin. I'm sorry.

545
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,011
I didn't do it on purpose.

546
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,940
-I was trying to cheer you up...
-I didn't ask you to.

547
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:53,605
Please just leave me alone.

548
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:56,679
I'm already upset as is.
Why are you doing this to me?

549
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:58,250
I didn't do anything.

550
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:00,958
Wait, Seojin!

551
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,300
I'm sorry!

552
00:28:03,534 --> 00:28:04,734
What will make you forgive me?

553
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:07,731
I'll do anything you ask.

554
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,672
If you tell me to die, I'll die right here.

555
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:13,212
If you want me to strip, I'll do it!

556
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:14,478
Just tell me anything.

557
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,863
We can do it, right?

558
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:17,190
Yes, we can!

559
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:20,513
-Go ahead then.
-What should I do?

560
00:28:20,606 --> 00:28:22,334
-Strip.
-What?

561
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:24,735
Right now?

562
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:26,535
Right here?

563
00:28:26,858 --> 00:28:27,743
In this cold?

564
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,420
Why? You can't do it?

565
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,148
Then don't talk to me ever again.

566
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,175
Got it?

567
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:36,245
Wait, Seojin!

568
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:38,101
Seojin!

569
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,134
Seojin!

570
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:46,356
Strip...

571
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:52,931
Kang Seojin!

572
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,935
What!

573
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,062
-What the...
-What is he doing?

574
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:09,279
Jungi, what are you doing?

575
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,011
What's wrong? You told me to strip.

576
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:15,253
Come one, guys.

577
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:17,413
Come on!

578
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:18,549
Just do it!

579
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:20,203
I just got released.

580
00:29:26,045 --> 00:29:27,484
So cold!

581
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:28,808
Kang Seojin!

582
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,648
You didn't do anything wrong.

583
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:35,987
He deserved to get slapped in the face.

584
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:37,834
-Right?
-Yeah.

585
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:39,803
He deserved it.

586
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:42,855
You give up your dream
because of that jerk.

587
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,412
You'll get a better job soon.

588
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:47,911
-Don't worry!
-Yeah.

589
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,618
So, cheer up, you brat!

590
00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:54,868
You can do it.

591
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,701
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

592
00:30:12,868 --> 00:30:14,378
That's enough.

593
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:16,467
People are staring.

594
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:18,850
-You laughed!
-You forgive me?

595
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,034
She laughed!

596
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,078
All right, I feel better.

597
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:24,346
Get dressed.

598
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:26,158
-Get dressed!
-Put it back on!

599
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:29,101
-So cold.
-What are you doing!

600
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:31,530
-Run!
-Run.

601
00:30:31,634 --> 00:30:32,968
I'm not a pervert!

602
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,564
What is he doing?

603
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:52,584
Pervert...

604
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:54,921
Seonwoo!

605
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:57,719
I'm sorry!

606
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:03,769
I got a restraining order
to stay 100m away from you.

607
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:06,545
I can't go near you!

608
00:31:06,634 --> 00:31:07,933
What is he saying?

609
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,435
Seonwoo!

610
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:13,035
I'm sorry!

611
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:17,008
I guess I can't help it!

612
00:31:17,326 --> 00:31:18,844
To tell you the truth...

613
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:21,843
...I'm writing a scenario
for an erotic movie!

614
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,534
I'm so sorry!

615
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:32,979
Hurry up.

616
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:35,783
It's almost check-in time.

617
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:36,972
Okay.

618
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:40,879
I know a group of guests is important,
but do we have to give them our room?

619
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,179
Where will we sleep?

620
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,570
Sleep in the living room.

621
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:46,579
We haven't had a group booking in ages.

622
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:49,486
Yeah, we need to pay the rent,
so suck it up.

623
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,461
The landlady called again.

624
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:52,469
Really?

625
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:54,645
She wants us to vacate the place?

626
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:57,442
-Yeah.
-Oh no...

627
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:01,712
What is he doing when we're so busy?

628
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:05,246
Can't you see that I'm trying to maintain
a good condition.

629
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:07,926
-Mind control.
-Mind control, my foot.

630
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,012
Let him be. He starts shooting
the TV drama series tomorrow.

631
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,082
He has to do everything that actors do.

632
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:15,101
Right, Yuna?

633
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:17,535
Yuna?

634
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:19,445
Yeah? What is it?

635
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:20,411
What's wrong?

636
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,368
Are you ill?

637
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,541
-I don't feel good.
-Really?

638
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:29,918
You're sweating.

639
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:34,187
You have a fever.

640
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,212
You have the swine flu.

641
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,430
The swine flu?

642
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:44,846
But there's no need to worry.

643
00:32:44,934 --> 00:32:47,171
Most patients get well
with medication and rest.

644
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:51,488
But it's highly contagious,
so you need to stay in isolation.

645
00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:52,845
It's highly contagious?

646
00:32:52,934 --> 00:32:55,043
-How high?
-Very high.

647
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:58,046
It can easily spread via coughs.

648
00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:05,945
I'm sorry.

649
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:08,293
We have a group booking
coming in today but I'm sick.

650
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:09,623
It's okay.

651
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:12,968
You'll get better when you take
medication and rest, so that's a relief.

652
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:14,612
What are we going to do?

653
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,479
What if the guests catch it?

654
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:18,600
Yeah.

655
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:22,423
We need to isolate her,
but the guests will be using our room.

656
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:24,302
There's no other room.

657
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:27,434
Should we send her to a motel room?

658
00:33:27,534 --> 00:33:29,179
What? No!

659
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:31,345
We can't send her alone to a motel room.

660
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:33,112
You're so cold-hearted.

661
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,738
If you're so worried about her,
take the mask off.

662
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:38,950
It's the first shooting today.

663
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:40,901
You understand, right?

664
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:43,579
-Of course.
-Thanks.

665
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,301
I don't feel comfortable
sending her to a motel.

666
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:48,082
The guests at the motel
could catch it too.

667
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:49,435
Right.

668
00:33:49,534 --> 00:33:50,934
What do we do, then?

669
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,334
This isn't right.

670
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:00,846
We can't leave a sick person in there.

671
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:02,445
Can you think of anything else?

672
00:34:02,534 --> 00:34:04,551
Should we tell
the group of guests not to come?

673
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:06,444
But this is...

674
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:08,568
It's okay.

675
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:12,527
The guests are one thing,
but I also don't want Seol to catch it.

676
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,878
There's an electric pad and a heater
so it won't be that cold.

677
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,192
Frankly, it's your fault
for not taking care of yourself.

678
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:21,485
So, just stay up here.

679
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:22,460
Hey, you jerk!

680
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:24,779
Can't you say it in a nice way?

681
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:26,513
You're so cold-hearted.

682
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:27,732
Shut the door.

683
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:31,734
Wait.

684
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,436
There's no bathroom though.

685
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,434
I didn't think of that.

686
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,475
Bathroom...

687
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:47,802
Donggu.

688
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:49,613
This is so not right.

689
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:51,079
I agree!

690
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,578
This is a human rights abuse!

691
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,912
A grown woman can't use that!

692
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,576
There's no other option.

693
00:34:58,686 --> 00:35:00,331
Where did you get this?

694
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,038
I borrowed it from Midal's Snack Stand.

695
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:06,513
This is Midal's.

696
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:09,212
This button plays music,
so it'll be less embarrassing.

697
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,646
Yeah, right...

698
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,001
You can tell he's evil at one glance.

699
00:35:13,582 --> 00:35:14,979
Stop it.

700
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:18,279
I'm fine. Just look after Seol.

701
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,935
Don't worry about Seol, Yuna.

702
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:23,955
The guests will be here soon. Let's go.

703
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,375
They should be here by now.
Why aren't they here yet?

704
00:35:40,634 --> 00:35:41,758
They'll be here soon.

705
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,745
Is Yuna going to be okay?

706
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,312
I'm worried. It's really cold.

707
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,375
You're right.

708
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:48,368
What did you say?

709
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:51,546
It's her fault
for not taking care of herself?

710
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:53,031
What about it?

711
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,333
It's true that she didn't
take care of herself.

712
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:56,288
Jeez...

713
00:35:56,434 --> 00:35:57,479
Here they come.

714
00:35:57,567 --> 00:35:58,401
They're here.

715
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,392
Over here!

716
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:02,446
Seojin, take them to their rooms.

717
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:03,435
Okay.

718
00:36:05,645 --> 00:36:06,965
This is great.

719
00:36:10,443 --> 00:36:11,870
Spasiba.

720
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:14,639
Come on. Come on.

721
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:21,079
We haven't had a group of guests
in a while.

722
00:36:21,168 --> 00:36:22,414
Yeah.

723
00:36:22,534 --> 00:36:24,301
Donggu, the thing I told you about...

724
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,862
Your nose is dripping.

725
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,834
What?

726
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,545
Why is my nose running?

727
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:35,338
Wait.

728
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,034
Oh my god.

729
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,928
You have a fever too.

730
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:40,435
Are you...

731
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,903
No way. I'm not sick.

732
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:48,001
-No, I'm not...
-Don't touch me!

733
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,934
Virus!

734
00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:51,876
Silly.

735
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,122
Donggu.

736
00:36:58,167 --> 00:36:59,534
Why do you have a sleeping bag?

737
00:37:00,307 --> 00:37:03,188
He has the swine flu as well.

738
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,834
Go.

739
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:08,166
Go inside.

740
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:11,062
I'm going. Stop poking me!

741
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,735
You're taking too long!

742
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:26,067
Did you get the flu from me?

743
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,379
Who else has the flu?

744
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:32,232
I was supposed to film
a birthday party tomorrow.

745
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:47,001
I'll make a left turn.

746
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,450
I'll make a right turn.

747
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,024
Right turn.

748
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,669
Right turn.

749
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:55,673
Why is my voice is hoarse?

750
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,934
Wait...

751
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,901
Did I catch the flu?

752
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:03,318
I have to do well on my first day.

753
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,410
Who did that?!

754
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:10,065
Ouch, my neck. My eye.

755
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:16,929
Open!

756
00:38:19,868 --> 00:38:21,536
Ouch, my eye. My neck!

757
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,335
Rebecca!

758
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:26,971
Oh no, Rebecca!

759
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,179
Are you blind or something?

760
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,446
I'm sorry! I just got my license.

761
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:34,512
If you can't drive, don't drive!

762
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:36,268
This sucks!

763
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:38,646
I'm in a hurry. Give me your number.

764
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:39,953
Oh, o-okay.

765
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:41,713
Hurry up!

766
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:44,312
-Give me your business card!
-Yes! I'm sorry!

767
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,145
You're an outlaw of the road!

768
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:47,592
You're going to kill someone one day!

769
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:49,961
What were you thinking?!

770
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,534
Ouch, my eye!

771
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:53,601
Rebecca, don't cry.

772
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:54,867
Rebecca...

773
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,148
Hello.

774
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:07,779
Hi, Jungi.

775
00:39:08,634 --> 00:39:09,513
Your eye...

776
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:10,545
What's wrong with your neck?

777
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:13,051
I had a minor collision on the way.

778
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:16,879
-But I can do my scene.
-All right.

779
00:39:16,968 --> 00:39:17,802
That's a relief.

780
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:18,888
Did you practice?

781
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:20,374
Of course.

782
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:22,805
Don't you worry.

783
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:25,461
This is why I like you.

784
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,049
Sir,

785
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:28,495
the writer is here.

786
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:29,734
Ms. Kwon?

787
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:33,033
-Jungi.
-Yes?

788
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:35,246
-You haven't met Ms. Kwon, right?
-No.

789
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:37,168
Come with me. I'll introduce you.

790
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,479
-Introduce me?
-Yes.

791
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:39,401
Okay.

792
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,475
Ms. Kwon!

793
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:48,068
Hello.

794
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:50,167
You didn't have to come.
You must be busy writing.

795
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,131
Where did he go?

796
00:39:58,033 --> 00:39:58,846
Who?

797
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:00,231
Nothing. This way.

798
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:02,467
Take a 10-minute break!

799
00:40:08,467 --> 00:40:09,834
That outlaw is the...

800
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:22,379
Donggu, I'm sorry.

801
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:23,866
You got sick because of me...

802
00:40:26,054 --> 00:40:27,254
It's fine.

803
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:30,720
Yuna.

804
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:34,764
Can I give you an advice?

805
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:36,967
What is it?

806
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:41,339
Yuna, you're kind of a nuisance.

807
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:47,749
You don't mean to but you keep
troubling people around you.

808
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:50,235
That's really bad.

809
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,753
It'll become a habit.

810
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:56,153
I'm saying this because I worry about you.

811
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,713
-So don't take it the wrong way.
-Okay.

812
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:01,879
I'll be more careful.

813
00:41:01,968 --> 00:41:06,278
I'd rather die than be a nuisance.

814
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,599
I really don't understand.

815
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,368
How could she do that?

816
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,433
Over here.

817
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:28,200
It's cold, isn't it?

818
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:31,802
I'll push your chair in.

819
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:33,091
Thank you.

820
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:39,246
Do you feel all right?

821
00:41:39,334 --> 00:41:42,129
I feel perfectly fine.

822
00:41:42,271 --> 00:41:45,872
My body feels better after the accident.

823
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,305
My appetite is back.

824
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:50,274
That's a relief.

825
00:41:51,534 --> 00:41:53,344
Why did you call me?

826
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,042
Actually,

827
00:41:56,131 --> 00:41:58,863
I wanted to apologize for being rude.

828
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:04,767
I was worried if I had hurt your feelings.

829
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,485
I'm fine.

830
00:42:07,749 --> 00:42:08,659
The truth is,

831
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:11,769
I wasn't in my right mind this morning.

832
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:15,235
I don't know if I should tell you this...

833
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:17,471
Actually...

834
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,671
...my best friend passed away
this morning.

835
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,634
His name was Kang Donggu.

836
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:28,402
He was like a brother to me.

837
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,262
I'm so sorry...

838
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:34,619
This steak house
was his favorite restaurant...

839
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,234
Here you go.

840
00:42:44,701 --> 00:42:45,701
Have this.

841
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:49,345
-You don't have to...
-Take it.

842
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:51,412
I really wanted to apologize.

843
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:52,601
It's all right.

844
00:42:53,434 --> 00:42:54,402
Wait.

845
00:42:54,734 --> 00:42:56,234
Are you cold?

846
00:42:56,968 --> 00:42:57,968
Waitress!

847
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:01,063
Can you bring us a blanket?

848
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,298
Go ahead, eat.

849
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:14,934
Hope you liked the food.

850
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:16,267
It was really delicious.

851
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:18,293
I'm glad you liked it.

852
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:20,168
Then...

853
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:24,001
Please forget what happened this morning.

854
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,233
Of course.

855
00:43:27,033 --> 00:43:29,119
Get home safely.

856
00:43:29,314 --> 00:43:30,314
I'll get going.

857
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,401
Excuse me.

858
00:43:32,734 --> 00:43:33,867
Yes?

859
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:37,781
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-Sorry?

860
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:39,850
A girlfriend?

861
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:42,419
I don't have a girlfriend.
Why do you ask?

862
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:44,501
What?

863
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:46,765
You're dating the writer?

864
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:48,845
I had no choice.

865
00:43:48,934 --> 00:43:52,379
Refusing her would be worse
than yelling at her.

866
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:56,075
I'll just go out with her
until the TV drama ends.

867
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:00,304
You lead such a hard life.

868
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:03,967
Wait.

869
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,234
What time is it?

870
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:12,653
Eat your dinner!

871
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,308
I have to go. Bye.

872
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:21,949
Is this a farm?!

873
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:23,086
Are we animals?!

874
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,567
Are we in prison?!

875
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:27,734
I'll bring them.

876
00:44:28,434 --> 00:44:29,545
Stay.

877
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:30,836
I'll bring them.

878
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:47,245
Donggu!

879
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:48,528
-My back!
-Are you okay?

880
00:44:48,617 --> 00:44:49,453
My back.

881
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:51,755
Donggu!

882
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:53,990
Are you okay?

883
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:55,860
I'm all right.

884
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:57,001
I'm okay...

885
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:01,199
Darn it.

886
00:45:11,033 --> 00:45:12,412
Aren't you going to eat?

887
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,991
I will.

888
00:45:18,777 --> 00:45:20,284
Ouch, my back...

889
00:45:21,133 --> 00:45:23,702
Yuna, can you help me up?

890
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:26,301
Why?

891
00:45:26,868 --> 00:45:29,545
You said you hate troubling people.

892
00:45:29,634 --> 00:45:30,801
That you hated being a nuisance.

893
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:32,296
That it'll become a habit.

894
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:35,068
Fine, don't help me.

895
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,130
I was just asking.

896
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,237
I can eat lying on my side.

897
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:41,068
Eyeballing me...

898
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:44,467
This is hard.

899
00:45:46,634 --> 00:45:47,738
Shall I feed you?

900
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:48,945
No thanks.

901
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:50,053
Never mind then.

902
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:03,110
If you really want to feed me, you can.

903
00:46:14,968 --> 00:46:15,873
Yuna.

904
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:21,078
As I told you before,
I hate troubling people.

905
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:23,247
So, don't mistake this for...

906
00:46:25,234 --> 00:46:26,446
Water! Water!

907
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,234
Here.

908
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,300
I almost died.

909
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:40,945
I hate troubling people...

910
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:42,233
I got it.

911
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,134
I got it. Just eat.

912
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:47,238
Yuna!

913
00:46:48,342 --> 00:46:50,076
Can you put a piece of ham on it?

914
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:51,582
With seaweed..

915
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,935
You already fed me plain rice.

916
00:47:07,234 --> 00:47:08,278
I have to pee.

917
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,420
I drank too much water earlier.

918
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,601
Gee, I really have to pee.

919
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,926
Donggu, are you okay?

920
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,601
Were you trying to go outside?

921
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:43,834
I wanted to get some fresh air.

922
00:47:44,567 --> 00:47:46,797
You can't even move properly.

923
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,400
Lie back down.

924
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,326
Ihavetopee...

925
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:56,435
What?

926
00:47:58,367 --> 00:48:00,400
I... Ihavetopee...

927
00:48:01,267 --> 00:48:03,450
-What?
-I have to pee...

928
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:07,422
We're almost there. We'll stop now.

929
00:48:09,901 --> 00:48:10,988
Slowly kneel down.

930
00:48:18,968 --> 00:48:19,836
Donggu.

931
00:48:19,968 --> 00:48:22,403
Can you unzip your pants?

932
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:23,468
Of course.

933
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,341
I can do that by myself.

934
00:48:25,434 --> 00:48:27,546
That's offensive.

935
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:30,168
I told you that I hate troubling people.

936
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:33,968
Leave me now.

937
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:45,979
She'll be able to hear me.

938
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:46,968
Darn it...

939
00:48:47,934 --> 00:48:49,168
Jeez...

940
00:49:15,734 --> 00:49:17,134
Hi, Hyejin.

941
00:49:18,968 --> 00:49:21,692
Okay, see you tonight.

942
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:24,767
Bye.

943
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,544
So hot!

944
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:29,945
Are you teenagers?

945
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,575
How could you talk all night?

946
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:34,238
She never hangs up first.

947
00:49:35,067 --> 00:49:38,108
Do you know what she said
before we hung up?

948
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:41,012
She wants to tell me more about it
when we meet tonight.

949
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,378
Doesn't she have to write the script?

950
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:44,301
What?

951
00:49:44,434 --> 00:49:46,884
-You're going on another date tonight?
-Yeah.

952
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,668
Life is so hard...

953
00:49:49,934 --> 00:49:51,268
Why do I...

954
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:54,258
It's the director.

955
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:56,694
Hello, sir. This is Jungi.

956
00:49:58,334 --> 00:49:59,168
Okay.

957
00:50:00,534 --> 00:50:01,487
Right now?

958
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:09,001
Why are you drinking so much
in the morning?

959
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:11,041
Did something happen?

960
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,267
My girlfriend and I had a fight
a few days ago.

961
00:50:14,634 --> 00:50:15,468
Then...

962
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:19,534
She said she needed time to think.

963
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,968
But I think she's going out
with another guy.

964
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:22,967
What?

965
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:26,126
She's terrible.

966
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:29,201
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

967
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:30,961
It's a secret.

968
00:50:31,968 --> 00:50:33,245
Don't tell anyone.

969
00:50:33,334 --> 00:50:34,185
Sure.

970
00:50:34,734 --> 00:50:35,897
It's Ms. Kwon, the writer.

971
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:42,801
Ms... Ms. Kwon?

972
00:50:43,662 --> 00:50:45,743
The Ms. Kwon who writes our script?

973
00:50:45,832 --> 00:50:46,645
Yeah.

974
00:50:46,734 --> 00:50:48,079
Just wait...

975
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:49,761
If I catch that guy,

976
00:50:50,635 --> 00:50:52,288
I'll kill him.

977
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:54,585
How is she...

978
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:58,276
I'm going to find him
with whatever means...

979
00:51:00,868 --> 00:51:01,859
...and I'll destroy him.

980
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:06,335
What?

981
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:09,512
The writer was the director's girlfriend?

982
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:10,801
Yes.

983
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:14,201
What am I going to do?

984
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,001
How can this be...?

985
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:19,868
I feel sorry for you.

986
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,614
"Kwon Hyejin"

987
00:51:24,133 --> 00:51:26,026
-This is why I told you...
-Shh.

988
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:31,600
Hi, Hyejin.

989
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:35,159
Yes, of course.

990
00:51:36,073 --> 00:51:37,738
I'm heading out now.

991
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:39,501
Okay.

992
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:45,135
I'm going to a date with Hyejin.

993
00:51:48,234 --> 00:51:50,574
What is he thinking?

994
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:52,201
I have no idea.

995
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:55,945
I wonder if Donggu and Yuna
are doing okay.

996
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:58,246
I hope Donggu isn't scolding her.

997
00:51:58,334 --> 00:51:59,501
Yeah.

998
00:52:01,534 --> 00:52:02,719
Blow!

999
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:05,446
Harder.

1000
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:06,667
Blow!

1001
00:52:08,534 --> 00:52:09,934
Eww, it's disgusting.

1002
00:52:11,334 --> 00:52:12,264
Yuna.

1003
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:14,746
I'll tell you this again.

1004
00:52:14,834 --> 00:52:16,713
-I hate troubling...
-Don't say it!

1005
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:17,635
Okay.

1006
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:26,803
Why is your face so dirty?

1007
00:52:27,434 --> 00:52:30,968
Now I have a big baby instead of Seol.

1008
00:52:40,498 --> 00:52:41,531
We're here.

1009
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:43,679
This is my place.

1010
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:45,337
I see.

1011
00:52:45,634 --> 00:52:48,399
It's late. Go in and rest.

1012
00:52:49,776 --> 00:52:51,769
I don't want you to go.

1013
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:54,846
Would you like a drink?

1014
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:55,967
Drink?

1015
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,447
No drink for me! I'm fine.

1016
00:52:59,868 --> 00:53:01,780
You must be tired. Go ahead.

1017
00:53:01,868 --> 00:53:03,135
I'm not tired.

1018
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:05,601
-Come in.
-What? Where....

1019
00:53:05,734 --> 00:53:07,151
Wait... Wait.

1020
00:53:19,901 --> 00:53:21,235
This is my place.

1021
00:53:30,601 --> 00:53:31,475
Then...

1022
00:53:31,868 --> 00:53:34,179
I'll just have one cup and go.

1023
00:53:34,267 --> 00:53:35,734
Okay.

1024
00:53:36,267 --> 00:53:38,632
Wait here. I'll go make coffee.

1025
00:53:38,721 --> 00:53:39,683
Yes, sure.

1026
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,367
Who is it?

1027
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:01,212
Why is he here?

1028
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,235
Hyejin, open the door.

1029
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:05,846
It's me. Open the door.

1030
00:54:05,934 --> 00:54:07,346
-We need to talk.
-Jungi.

1031
00:54:07,434 --> 00:54:09,095
I haven't told you something.

1032
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,286
I was seeing this guy...

1033
00:54:11,397 --> 00:54:14,767
I'll explain everything
and break up with him.

1034
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:16,880
No, please don't do that.

1035
00:54:16,968 --> 00:54:18,764
Please don't do anything!

1036
00:54:18,934 --> 00:54:19,768
Hyejin.

1037
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,513
Come on!

1038
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:22,601
I know...!

1039
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:25,512
I know you're home!

1040
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:29,233
I saw you going in with that guy!

1041
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:31,402
Don't worry. I won't let you get hurt.

1042
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,546
I will get hurt!

1043
00:54:32,634 --> 00:54:35,034
Please don't do anything! Please!

1044
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:36,536
If you keep ignoring me,

1045
00:54:37,146 --> 00:54:38,608
I'm going to open the door myself.

1046
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,578
Don't open it! Don't open it!

1047
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,086
Darn it.

1048
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:52,856
What... What do you think you're doing?

1049
00:54:54,355 --> 00:54:55,242
You reek of alcohol!

1050
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:56,779
You drank again?!

1051
00:54:56,868 --> 00:54:58,215
I did. So what?

1052
00:54:58,534 --> 00:55:00,701
Where is he?

1053
00:55:01,267 --> 00:55:02,394
Where is he!

1054
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,111
Who do you think you are?

1055
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,145
It's none of your business who I date.

1056
00:55:07,234 --> 00:55:09,158
Where did you hide him?

1057
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:11,168
I want to see his face.

1058
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:14,979
Oh, he's in here!

1059
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:16,467
Darn it...!

1060
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:18,415
Open this door.

1061
00:55:19,367 --> 00:55:20,201
Open it.

1062
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:22,219
If you don't, I'll break the door!

1063
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:26,790
Where did he go?

1064
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,571
Come out. Come out...!

1065
00:55:32,068 --> 00:55:33,545
Stop. Stop.

1066
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:34,634
Stop right there!

1067
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:35,735
Stop!

1068
00:55:44,534 --> 00:55:45,435
I got you!

1069
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:48,290
How dare you steal my girlfriend.

1070
00:55:48,434 --> 00:55:50,797
Let me see your face.

1071
00:55:50,968 --> 00:55:52,312
Get this off your face.

1072
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,234
Move this towel.

1073
00:55:54,136 --> 00:55:55,703
Get this off your face!

1074
00:56:05,701 --> 00:56:06,535
You...

1075
00:56:07,734 --> 00:56:08,668
You jerk...

1076
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,367
Hello, sir.

1077
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:14,234
It's Jungi.

1078
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:17,001
What the hell?

1079
00:56:17,184 --> 00:56:18,797
You're the guy Hyejin's dating?

1080
00:56:18,886 --> 00:56:19,831
It's a misunderstanding.

1081
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,287
Hyejin and I were in a minor accident.

1082
00:56:22,376 --> 00:56:25,382
Then she asked me out,
so I had no choice but to date her...

1083
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:28,468
Hyejin is not that great.

1084
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,802
-She's not my style.
-Jungi!

1085
00:56:34,968 --> 00:56:35,802
Hyejin!

1086
00:56:36,234 --> 00:56:37,868
No, what I meant to say was...

1087
00:56:38,567 --> 00:56:39,713
Sir, what happened was...

1088
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:41,901
I meant... Sir...

1089
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,534
Sir... Not you... Sir...

1090
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:44,646
Hyejin... I mean, sir...

1091
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:48,146
I'm the director, jerk!

1092
00:56:48,234 --> 00:56:49,202
I'm Lee Jungi.

1093
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:55,568
Jeez...

1094
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,567
Why do you live like that?

1095
00:56:59,434 --> 00:57:01,910
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

1096
00:57:02,566 --> 00:57:05,388
Do you think I'll get fired?

1097
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:07,271
No way.

1098
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:10,469
The writer is a professional.
She won't get back at you over this.

1099
00:57:11,901 --> 00:57:13,034
I'll be fine, right?

1100
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:14,479
Everything will be all okay, right?

1101
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:16,185
It'll be fine.

1102
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:19,411
Everything is okay.

1103
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:20,737
Everything is okay.

1104
00:57:24,801 --> 00:57:26,592
Donggu, are you okay?

1105
00:57:30,467 --> 00:57:31,667
Your fever is going up.

1106
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:33,679
I'm fine.

1107
00:57:33,767 --> 00:57:36,253
I'll feel better in the morning.

1108
00:57:54,434 --> 00:57:55,806
Are you going to sleep?

1109
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:57,766
I have to read this book.

1110
00:58:02,868 --> 00:58:06,416
You still want to become a pastry chef?

1111
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:09,201
Yes. It's my dream.

1112
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:13,812
And I can't give it up for Seol.

1113
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:15,968
You're so persistent.

1114
00:58:18,267 --> 00:58:20,440
Sorry, but can you hand me my phone?

1115
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:25,017
Hello?

1116
00:58:26,634 --> 00:58:27,468
What?

1117
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:31,079
I have enough loans already!

1118
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:32,478
Yuna, hang up the phone.

1119
00:58:32,567 --> 00:58:34,215
Don't they sleep?

1120
00:58:38,267 --> 00:58:40,582
Who is this person?

1121
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:43,979
She's my mom.

1122
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:46,198
Wow, she's beautiful.

1123
00:58:46,934 --> 00:58:50,293
I've never heard you talk
about your mother.

1124
00:58:52,701 --> 00:58:54,072
She passed away.

1125
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:58,834
I'm sorry...

1126
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:06,134
What was she like?

1127
00:59:06,234 --> 00:59:07,334
My mom?

1128
00:59:09,834 --> 00:59:13,450
She was stubborn, had a temper
and she nagged all the time.

1129
00:59:13,734 --> 00:59:18,942
She never gave up on anything
that she set her mind to like you.

1130
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:22,559
She hit me a lot when I was a kid.

1131
00:59:23,801 --> 00:59:25,513
She sounds like a strong woman.

1132
00:59:25,601 --> 00:59:27,469
But she had a soft heart.

1133
00:59:28,133 --> 00:59:32,166
She used to nurse me all night.

1134
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:37,568
Do you miss her?

1135
00:59:39,428 --> 00:59:40,854
Of course I miss her.

1136
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,580
I miss her so much.

1137
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:46,050
But I can't see her.

1138
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:52,568
Your cough is getting worse.

1139
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:56,802
-Get some sleep, Donggu.
-Yeah, I should.

1140
01:00:21,067 --> 01:00:22,267
What's this?

1141
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,024
Why is this on my...

1142
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,201
Did Yuna put this...

1143
01:00:49,534 --> 01:00:51,615
I must've dozed off...

1144
01:00:55,534 --> 01:00:57,368
Is his fever down?

1145
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:03,496
It cooled down.

1146
01:01:04,534 --> 01:01:06,135
Thank goodness.

1147
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,539
Donggu.

1148
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,300
Are you asleep?

1149
01:01:21,434 --> 01:01:23,634
Donggu.

1150
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:35,001
That's better.

1151
01:01:35,868 --> 01:01:37,435
Phew...

1152
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,645
Seol, did you miss me?

1153
01:01:54,734 --> 01:01:57,012
I missed you too.

1154
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,582
I missed you.

1155
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:01,424
Seol must have given you a hard time.

1156
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:02,645
I'm sorry.

1157
01:02:02,734 --> 01:02:05,012
It was no big deal.

1158
01:02:06,467 --> 01:02:08,692
Jungi's TV drama is starting.

1159
01:02:09,901 --> 01:02:10,968
Let's not watch it.

1160
01:02:11,067 --> 01:02:12,846
Don't watch it!

1161
01:02:12,934 --> 01:02:15,045
But it's your first TV drama.
We have to see it.

1162
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:17,204
-Where's the remote?
-It's starting.

1163
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:19,813
We're here, sir.

1164
01:02:19,901 --> 01:02:20,934
There he is.

1165
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:22,767
I'll teach them a lesson.

1166
01:02:23,234 --> 01:02:24,935
How dare they try to take over?

1167
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:27,133
I'll crush them in the board meeting.

1168
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,677
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir.

1169
01:02:30,133 --> 01:02:31,233
Would you like a candy?

1170
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:32,168
Out of the blue?

1171
01:02:44,734 --> 01:02:46,602
What's wrong with him?
He only ate a candy.

1172
01:02:48,316 --> 01:02:49,232
Hey!

1173
01:02:49,734 --> 01:02:50,642
Mr. Kim!

1174
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,937
Can't believe he died like that.

1175
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,034
I'm sorry.

1176
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:57,669
He's dead, and we need to move on.

1177
01:02:57,758 --> 01:02:59,340
Hire another driver.

1178
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:00,801
-Yes, sir.
-What just happened?

1179
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:02,245
That's it?

1180
01:03:02,334 --> 01:03:03,601
You choked on a candy and died?

1181
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:05,717
-You won't be on the show anymore?
-No.

1182
01:03:06,634 --> 01:03:08,551
She holds grudges, huh?

1183
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:10,720
How can she kill you off like that?

1184
01:03:15,267 --> 01:03:17,935
Where have you been?
Jungi's TV drama was on.

1185
01:03:18,234 --> 01:03:21,244
I saw him choking on a candy
and died on my phone.

1186
01:03:21,701 --> 01:03:23,846
Jungi. What kind of candy was it?

1187
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:25,183
Was it peppermint?

1188
01:03:27,434 --> 01:03:29,078
That's not important!

1189
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:31,146
Fine! It was peppermint!

1190
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:32,884
-Are you happy?
-Really?

1191
01:03:34,106 --> 01:03:35,586
It was the peppermint candy's fault.

1192
01:03:35,675 --> 01:03:37,509
Don't yell at me.

1193
01:03:41,701 --> 01:03:42,585
Yuna.

1194
01:03:42,968 --> 01:03:43,802
This is for you.

1195
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:44,978
What's this?

1196
01:03:45,067 --> 01:03:47,223
You want to become a pastry chef, right?

1197
01:03:47,567 --> 01:03:52,045
Will reading a home baking book
be enough to make you a pastry chef?

1198
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:53,645
You need to go to a baking school
to get a qualification.

1199
01:03:53,734 --> 01:03:55,767
I can't afford to go to a baking school.

1200
01:03:55,868 --> 01:03:57,000
You don't have to pay for it.

1201
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,436
There's a government program
for single mothers.

1202
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:02,179
-Really?
-Yes.

1203
01:04:02,267 --> 01:04:06,178
And there's a pretty good
baking school near here.

1204
01:04:06,267 --> 01:04:09,672
Let's ask about the subsidy
and drop by the baking school tomorrow.

1205
01:04:10,734 --> 01:04:12,976
Thank you, Donggu.

1206
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,751
There you go again.

1207
01:04:15,387 --> 01:04:17,663
Stop crying over everything.

1208
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:20,907
Thank you, Donggu.

1209
01:04:24,434 --> 01:04:26,982
Donggu. Why are you flushing?

1210
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,803
I'm not!

1211
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:34,297
I couldn't breathe.

1212
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,143
Why did you hug me all of a sudden?

1213
01:04:37,508 --> 01:04:39,111
You're so weird.

1214
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,234
Look.

1215
01:04:40,367 --> 01:04:41,791
He's even stammering.

1216
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:42,934
Why is that?

1217
01:04:43,033 --> 01:04:46,379
You've developed feelings
after a few days together on the rooftop?

1218
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:47,441
What are you talking about?

1219
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:48,834
You're wrong!

1220
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:56,434
-Gee...
-He's acting strange.

1221
01:04:57,334 --> 01:04:59,752
Let's watch something else. Jungi's dead.

1222
01:05:03,112 --> 01:05:05,536
What? Feelings?

1223
01:05:06,033 --> 01:05:08,738
Why did I flush? Why?

1224
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,367
Do I really...

1225
01:05:12,133 --> 01:05:14,300
No way.

1226
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:16,579
It's not possible.

1227
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:39,779
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1228
01:05:39,868 --> 01:05:41,337
We're in the same class.

1229
01:05:41,426 --> 01:05:43,112
He gave me a ride home.

1230
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,446
He seems really great.

1231
01:05:44,534 --> 01:05:47,128
He's handsome and gentle.
You should go out with him.

1232
01:05:47,217 --> 01:05:49,044
You don't even know him.

1233
01:05:49,133 --> 01:05:50,513
He has a weird look in his eyes.

1234
01:05:50,601 --> 01:05:51,880
Yuna, be careful of that guy.

1235
01:05:51,968 --> 01:05:53,212
Do you like Yuna?

1236
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,212
Would you like to be in my movie?

1237
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,567
That pure and voluptuous Shin Sujeong?

1238
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:57,780
I'll do the bed scene.

1239
01:05:57,868 --> 01:05:59,713
You have to lose 10kg in one week?

1240
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:00,880
Ask Seojin to help you.

1241
01:06:00,968 --> 01:06:02,402
Run faster!

1242
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:03,746
Bed scene!

1243
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:04,901
Don't walk!

1244
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:06,846
Sim Sujeong!

1245
01:06:06,934 --> 01:06:08,146
Bed scene!

1246
01:06:08,234 --> 01:06:10,045
You're going to kill yourself.

1247
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:10,945
Hi.

1248
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,045
I'm here to collect rent.

1249
01:06:12,133 --> 01:06:15,479
We'll collect the overdue rent
and interest through an auction.

1250
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:17,700
Either vacate the place or get married.

1251
01:06:17,868 --> 01:06:18,945
Married?

1252
01:06:19,033 --> 01:06:21,885
Singer Wheesung is going to sing
at the wedding?

1253
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:25,101
Kiss! Kiss!

1254
01:06:25,567 --> 01:06:26,967
Kiss!

1255
01:06:27,767 --> 01:06:28,585
Donggu.

1256
01:06:28,673 --> 01:06:31,116
What am I going to do?
