1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,603
I see you as a man.

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,104
What should I do?

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:06,602
Of course I'm a man, not a woman.

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,800
That's not what I meant.

5
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:10,177
I think...

6
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,880
I like you.

7
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,183
-What?
-I like you.

8
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,491
What are you talking about? Come here.

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,159
Are you feeling sick?

10
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:27,427
You're totally fine.

11
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,130
Is this a prank?

12
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:31,732
Did you guys plan this together?

13
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,034
Now that you're dating a producer
you're acting got better.

14
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,036
I like you.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,741
What?

16
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,343
You're serious?

17
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:46,847
You like me?

18
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,116
Me?

19
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,934
I'll ask you again.

20
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:56,156
Do you see me... as a woman?

21
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,258
Stop that.

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,343
You're like my little sister.

23
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,964
I've watched you grow since you were
this big. And you borrow my razor.

24
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,567
Stop. Don't do that.

25
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:12,773
Okay.

26
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:16,376
I understand what you're saying.

27
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,477
Please leave now.

28
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,481
Don't do that. You're scaring me.

29
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:22,783
I said leave.

30
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:24,567
-Leave!
-Hey.

31
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,588
-Wait, Seojin.
-Leave!

32
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,984
Seojin. Open the door.

33
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:33,293
Let's talk. Kang Seojin!

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,595
-What are you doing?
-Oh my god.

35
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,280
Why are you banging on my sister's door?

36
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,765
I told you!

37
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,068
I told you to stay away from my sister.

38
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,569
-No, wait...
-Come here.

39
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,867
-Come here.
-Donggu!

40
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:46,273
-Donggu, wait.
-Come!

41
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:49,776
That's right.

42
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,979
I don't need him.

43
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,382
He always gets into trouble.

44
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,485
He's an unknown actor
who only gets small parts.

45
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,171
Do I know Goni?

46
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,874
He's the best gambler that I've seen.

47
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,745
I want to be just like Kim Hyesu.

48
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,848
I want to live a glamorous life like her.

49
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:31,451
Yes, she's amazing.

50
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,787
I'm home.

51
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,978
Dusik, why are you home so late?

52
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:38,191
-I've been waiting for you.
-What?

53
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,279
For me? Why?

54
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,375
-Do you have something to say?
-Yes.

55
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:44,798
You said I should find something
that will make me happy, right?

56
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,102
So I thought about it.

57
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,648
I'm pretty and you know that
I can dance and sing, right?

58
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:49,836
I didn't know that.

59
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,139
-So what do you want to do?
-An idol singer.

60
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:53,640
What? An idol singer?

61
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,742
At the age of 29?

62
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,844
You're old enough to have
a 100-day-old baby.

63
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:59,846
Have you lost your mind?

64
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,949
Maybe it's an impossible dream.

65
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,851
What should I do?

66
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,254
Is there anything
you've always wanted to do?

67
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,955
What was your dream when you were young?

68
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,634
There is one thing.

69
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:15,162
I actually wanted to study
fashion design at college.

70
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:17,139
But I'm too old to take
the college entrance exam.

71
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,433
Are you kidding me?
Haven't you seen the news?

72
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,270
There are a lot of older adults
to take the exam and go to college.

73
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,472
-You think I can do it too?
-Of course.

74
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,574
I'll help you study.

75
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:28,583
You?

76
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,676
'You'?

77
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:32,201
He was a top student.

78
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:34,877
He's a writer that's good at everything
except writing.

79
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:36,883
-Shut up.
-Okay, Mr. Writer.

80
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,187
-But you have to study hard.
-Okay.

81
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,988
Thanks.

82
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,193
I'm home.

83
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,501
Hey, Seojin. Have you eaten?

84
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,131
I'm not hungry. I'm going to bed.

85
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,901
Is everything okay with her?

86
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,304
She's been feeling down these days.

87
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,707
Why did we come to a bookstore so early?

88
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:01,508
What?

89
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,911
We need textbooks to start studying.

90
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,531
I need to know your level.

91
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,450
Let's do a short test.

92
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:13,820
Okay.
Let's start with history.

93
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,235
He's the second son of Yeongjo
and he's the father of Jeongjo.

94
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:19,826
He worked as a regent
as Yeongjo ordered him to.

95
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,330
But he died a tragic death ordered
by Yeongjo. What is his name?

96
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,949
I know this one.

97
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,833
-I saw the movie.
-That's right.

98
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,735
-Give me a hint.
-A hint? Okay.

99
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:30,036
-A wooden chest.
-A wooden chest?

100
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:30,771
Yes.

101
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,340
-I know! Yu Ain.
-Yu Ain...

102
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:36,076
No, he was a crown prince.

103
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,667
-Yes, Yu Ain was the crown prince.
-No, what was his character's name?

104
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:42,149
-The name of the crown prince.
-It's Yu Ain.

105
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:43,784
He says that famous line.

106
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,552
I'm speechless.

107
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,657
No, that line was from "Veteran".

108
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,459
The crown prince's name was Sado.

109
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:53,760
Crown Prince Sado?

110
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,365
-That's why the movie title was "Sado".
-Yes.

111
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:03,336
I had no idea what 'Sado' meant.

112
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,442
It's fine. You can learn it again.

113
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:11,444
So, don't be so discouraged.

114
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:12,846
Thanks.

115
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,515
I feel better because you're so positive.

116
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,951
It's better to think positive
about everything.

117
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,420
So, don't worry.
You can do this.

118
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:22,022
Okay. I can do this.

119
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:32,232
I haven't gone home or showered in days.

120
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,702
Come to think of it...

121
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:39,940
I can't even remember
when I saw Yuna last.

122
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:53,520
Goodness.

123
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:55,088
Han Donggu.

124
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,983
Did you find all the available
shooting locations?

125
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,566
Yes. Here you go.

126
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,462
That's a long list.

127
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,197
Did you work on it all night?

128
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,498
Good job.

129
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,201
You're going to have to
work all night again. Sorry.

130
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,400
It's my job.

131
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,405
Go to the sauna.

132
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:14,341
I'll give you an hour.

133
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:16,943
An hour?

134
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,647
Sua, you can read this, right?

135
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,738
Of course I can.

136
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:26,853
Don't underestimate me.

137
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:29,256
-I'll start.
-Okay.

138
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,758
Hi, 'Ja-neh.'

139
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:34,661
It's not "Ja-neh". It's "Jane".

140
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,763
Right. Jane.

141
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,964
I'll start again.

142
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,433
Hi, Jane.

143
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,637
Do you want some "pine"...

144
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,340
"Pine"...

145
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,242
"Pineapple".

146
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,012
Right. Pineapple.

147
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,246
I thought it was a different word.

148
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,614
My "misty".

149
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:56,149
It's not "misty".

150
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,151
It's "mistake".

151
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,052
What?

152
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:01,738
I was talking about the TV drama.

153
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,957
Don't you know "Misty"?
Kim Namju was in it.

154
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,026
It's my "fabric" drama.

155
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,161
"Fabric" is cloth.

156
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,168
You mean "favorite".

157
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:13,166
I see.

158
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,469
I'm sorry. I'm not good at English.

159
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:20,373
Don't worry. It's been a while
since you studied English.

160
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,776
-Thanks. I'll try it again.
-Okay.

161
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:24,778
Yuna! Yuna!

162
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,079
Yuna!

163
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:27,380
What's going on?

164
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:30,083
Donggu, nice to see you.

165
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:31,669
-Did you get off work today?
-Shut up.

166
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:32,668
Where's Yuna?

167
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:34,087
She's somewhere in the house.

168
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,789
-Why are you looking for her?
-What?

169
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:37,390
I have something to ask her.

170
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,493
I don't have much time.
Is she on the third floor?

171
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:42,095
What's this?

172
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,965
Yes, Director.

173
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:47,867
Me? I'm at the sauna. Yes.

174
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,310
Yes, I'm putting on my underwear.

175
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:55,114
I'm putting in my right leg.
Yes, I'm on my way.

176
00:07:58,586 --> 00:08:00,413
-What's going on?
-What's wrong with him?

177
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,283
Is someone here?

178
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,884
It sounded like Donggu.

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,801
Yes, but he left right away.

180
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:08,488
He said he had something to ask you.

181
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,789
Something to ask me?

182
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,791
I wonder what it is.

183
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,699
I've done tons of auditions.
Why am I so nervous?

184
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,703
I really want this part.

185
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,510
Let's get some support from my fans.

186
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,213
No comments.

187
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:36,632
Is Jungi Love busy?

188
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,519
Come in.

189
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:40,836
Okay.

190
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,424
Lee Jungi, don't be nervous.

191
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,835
You can do this, right?

192
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:47,227
Yes. Okay.

193
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:52,832
The press shouldn't cover up issues.

194
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:55,942
The press shouldn't distort the truth
or stir up divisions.

195
00:08:56,034 --> 00:09:00,040
The press shouldn't distort
or cover up the facts.

196
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:03,910
Fearing the weak and making news
that terrifies the strong.

197
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,014
That is the duty and fate of journalists.

198
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,616
Do you understand?

199
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,423
That's it from me.

200
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:18,958
Great.

201
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:29,269
Thank you for giving me a
chance to audition for you.

202
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,671
Wait.

203
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,474
Do you like bean sprouts gukbap?

204
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:35,735
Sorry?

205
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,267
I do.

206
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:41,047
Let's have bean sprouts gukbap
and discuss the role together.

207
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:41,948
Pardon?

208
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:43,950
What does that mean?

209
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:45,687
I like your acting.

210
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:48,388
I've been looking for a new face.

211
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:50,390
Really?

212
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:59,265
"Newsroom"

213
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:27,927
What are you doing?

214
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,564
What? Why?

215
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,966
What do you want?

216
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,267
It's nothing.

217
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,669
Congratulations!

218
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,974
Congratulations, Jungi.

219
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,775
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

220
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,375
-Thank you so much.
-Jungi!

221
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:47,480
-It's Donggu.
-Donggu?

222
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,582
-Hey, Donggu.
-Congratulations!

223
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:53,586
-Go, Lee Jungi!
-Okay. Thank you.

224
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:56,189
-I'm going to do my best.
-Yes!

225
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,694
Come on, get up. Come here.

226
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,196
Lee Jungi!

227
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,998
Lee Jungi!

228
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,699
Lee Jungi!

229
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,001
Lee Jungi!

230
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,900
Thank you. Thank you!

231
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:13,506
Lee Jungi!

232
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:20,813
It's the director.

233
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,115
Hello, Director.

234
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,918
Yes, I'm at Anchor Park Changho's house.

235
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,821
Thank you for setting up the interview.

236
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,924
Yes, I'll gather as much information
as I can.

237
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,125
Bye.

238
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:34,994
I'm so nervous.

239
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,298
I can't believe I'm about to interview
Anchor Park Changho.

240
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:43,201
"Park Changho"

241
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,309
This is a big house.

242
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,645
Mrs. Park.

243
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:53,947
This is for you.

244
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,049
Thank you.

245
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,757
What does he want for lunch?

246
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,061
He doesn't want to eat
because of the interview.

247
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:10,063
You've been through so much.

248
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:12,968
Go and take your vitamins.

249
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,970
-Lie down for a while.
-Thank you, ma'am.

250
00:12:26,968 --> 00:12:28,481
You can go inside.

251
00:12:28,587 --> 00:12:29,382
Alright.

252
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:35,288
If he asks for me,
tell him I'm not home.

253
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,490
Tell him that I went out.

254
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,893
Please do that for me.

255
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:42,295
Okay.

256
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,266
Not home?

257
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,670
Excuse me.

258
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,181
Hello, sir.

259
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,567
I'm actor Lee Jungi.
I came to interview you.

260
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,086
Oh, hello.

261
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,488
One moment, please.

262
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,192
Welcome. Nice to meet you.

263
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,394
Yes, sir.

264
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,501
It's an honor to meet you.

265
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,502
I hope I'm not interrupting
when you're busy.

266
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:25,071
No, I'm happy to help you create
a drama that depicts the anchor world.

267
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,973
-Take a seat.
-Yes.

268
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:33,146
Are you writing a book?

269
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,948
I'm planning to publish my autobiography.

270
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,151
I was arranging the manuscript.

271
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:41,467
I'm thinking it'll be about 20 books.

272
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,755
20 books?

273
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,535
Yes, because you've had a long career
as an anchor.

274
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,528
I bet you have lots of stories to tell.

275
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,231
I'm trying to cut it down,
but it's still a lot.

276
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,802
Shall we begin the interview?

277
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:01,007
I want to know why you decided
to become an anchor.

278
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,309
The reason?

279
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,311
The reason...

280
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,916
I think it was in 1987.

281
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:15,388
It was snowing that day.
It was probably December 12 or 13?

282
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:19,192
Anyway, my family lived in a wooden house
that was quite rare at the time.

283
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,495
It was built with both Japanese
and American style of architecture

284
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,098
-I see.
-There were two rooms.

285
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,799
In one room, my mother, father,
my brother and I slept

286
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:30,435
with our dogs "Boksil" and "Tteunsil".

287
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:34,001
My three older sisters slept
in the other room.

288
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,909
My family was a great influence on me.

289
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,612
I'll tell you about my
eldest sister first.

290
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:44,917
She's 170 cm which was quite tall
at the time, and she weighed 48 kg...

291
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,321
Wait. Why is he talking about his sister?

292
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:50,022
How strange.

293
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,534
She's studying hard.

294
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,131
Sua.

295
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,634
Sua, drink this.

296
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,838
-Then, let's see how much you did.
-What?

297
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:09,242
-Let's not.
-Are you worried you got something wrong?

298
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,777
It's okay. Let me see.

299
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,146
It's okay. Let me see.

300
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,347
It's okay.

301
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,219
You didn't write any answers.

302
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,822
What have you been doing?

303
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,324
'Gangnam Station Exit Four'?

304
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:27,727
It reminded me of my time in school.

305
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,530
I used to draw on the textbooks
all the time.

306
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:32,532
I was going to study
after I finish drawing it.

307
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:34,400
-I swear.
-It's fine.

308
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,502
I used to do this too.

309
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:37,503
Finish it.

310
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:38,704
Thanks.

311
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,306
I'll finish it quickly.

312
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,212
So, my oldest sister, who loved
eating bindaetteok and kimchi Jeon,

313
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,315
met her husband who was researching
flour in a flour company.

314
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,900
They got married in Autumn in 1973.

315
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,386
They had one boy and two girls.

316
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,688
To this day, they live in
the house with the red roof...

317
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,301
...located three blocks from the
post office in Pennsylvania, US.

318
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,693
I see...

319
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,297
Now, let me tell you
about second older sister.

320
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,000
My second older sister is
162cm tall and weighs 50 kg.

321
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,270
She has a oval shaped face.

322
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,573
She loved poetry.

323
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,575
Her hobby was knitting.

324
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:16,676
And...

325
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:19,579
Jungi?

326
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:21,481
Jungi?

327
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,983
Yes? What?

328
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:26,901
Oh, sir.

329
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:28,888
I'm sorry.

330
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,692
I stayed up all night practicing acting.

331
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,594
-I apologize.
-It's fine.

332
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,499
It's understandable.

333
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:41,100
Sleeping is a natural phenomenon
that lets you rest unconsciously.

334
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,401
Sleep...

335
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,103
Sleep.

336
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:48,908
To understand what sleeping is,
we need to discuss Freudianism.

337
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,478
To understand this field,
you need to know about Freud.

338
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,800
His full name is Sigmund Freud.

339
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:59,185
In 1856, in Freiburg, his father
Jacob Freud and his mother...

340
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,144
Yuna.

341
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:28,447
Donggu.

342
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:30,116
What are you doing here?

343
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:34,420
I had a business around here.
Then I saw you over here.

344
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:37,723
-Your class just ended?
-Yes.

345
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,032
Donggu, you look terrible.

346
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,961
Your eyes are really red.

347
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:44,664
-You didn't get any sleep?
-I did.

348
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:48,968
My eyes turn red easily. I'm okay.

349
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,372
Oh, were you looking for me yesterday?

350
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:55,841
Dusik said you had something to ask me.

351
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:57,663
Oh, that.

352
00:17:57,761 --> 00:18:01,147
-When will THAAD issue get resolved?
-What?

353
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:07,183
You did turn me down in five seconds
but we're both Koreans.

354
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,555
So we're allowed to discuss
these diplomatic issues, right?

355
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,057
That's true.

356
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:13,926
But I don't know much
about diplomatic issues.

357
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:19,147
Are you hungry?

358
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,540
This is what you wanted to eat? Sundae?

359
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,377
-Yes. It's my favorite food.
-I see.

360
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,980
Donggu, are you really okay?

361
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,983
-You look really tired.
-I'm not tired.

362
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:41,087
People say that I look tired all the time.

363
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:43,595
How are you doing these days?

364
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,057
Are you having fun in your baking classes?

365
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,259
Yes, it's a lot of fun.

366
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,362
Everyone's great.

367
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:53,532
I learned how to make a cake today...

368
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,434
Donggu?

369
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,537
Donggu.

370
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:00,039
What? Why?

371
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,907
Did you just fall asleep?

372
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,902
No, I was thinking.

373
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:09,248
Whether I should dip the sundae
in salt or in salted shrimp.

374
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,035
Here's your sundae.

375
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,019
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

376
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,654
Wow, this looks so good.

377
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:16,522
Okay.

378
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,291
Here, try some.

379
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,195
Donggu.

380
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:25,731
What? Why?

381
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,516
I wasn't sleeping. I was praying.

382
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:30,803
You normally don't pray.

383
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:32,938
I do when I eat street food.

384
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:35,240
Especially when I eat sundae.

385
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:41,147
I'm so hungry.

386
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,284
It's so good.

387
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,019
Right, Donggu?

388
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,454
So, the Society of Jesus was created
from the crisis of the Catholic.

389
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:25,357
I've come too far from
talking about sleeping.

390
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:29,161
There are more details left,
but I'll skip it.

391
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:30,367
Let's go back to the topic.

392
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:35,183
My second older sister, who loved poetry
and did knitting as a hobby.

393
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,669
My second older sister...

394
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:39,772
Jungi.

395
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,366
-Jungi!
-Yes.

396
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:44,577
Yes, I was listening.

397
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,879
The Freudianism...

398
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:51,483
I talked about that about 20 hours ago.

399
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:54,386
-You must've been tired.
-20 hours?

400
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,090
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:05,898
Excuse me, sir.

402
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:08,204
What would you like for lunch?

403
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,907
Just choose from pork,
fish, salad and porridge.

404
00:21:10,993 --> 00:21:12,404
Just pick one.

405
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:16,509
I looked up all the information
on each ingredient on an encyclopedia.

406
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,312
So, please just choose one.

407
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:23,916
Please.

408
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,518
I'm begging you.

409
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:35,795
Okay.

410
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:39,198
-Jungi, what would you like?
-What?

411
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,500
I...

412
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,603
I'll have meat.

413
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,501
Meat?

414
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,207
What kind of meat?

415
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,501
Pork? Beef? Lamb? Chicken?

416
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,502
Pork! Pork!

417
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,612
Pork.

418
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,214
Pork sounds good.

419
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,615
Shall we?

420
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,287
Wait.

421
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,800
You have to know if pork
agrees with your body.

422
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,994
Which body type are you?

423
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,996
In Donguibogam, which Heo Jun wrote,

424
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,200
you can read about how important it is
to eat foods that agree with your body.

425
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,399
You must first know who Heo Jun was.

426
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:20,272
He was a medical scientist
in the mid-Joseon period.

427
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:24,076
He was born to Heo Seonmun, who was
the propositus of the Yancheon Heo clan.

428
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,178
Heo Jun learned how to read
at an early age.

429
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,534
He excelled at several fields of study,
especially...

430
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,625
-Oh my goodness.
-Sua.

431
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,235
Are you still eating?

432
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:50,135
Yes. Why?

433
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:53,135
You said you'll be back after dinner,
but it's been two hours.

434
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,441
Sua, you need to study now.

435
00:22:57,434 --> 00:22:58,244
Dusik.

436
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,446
Don't provoke me when I'm eating.

437
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:02,214
You're so mean.

438
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,501
I can't study when I'm hungry.

439
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,587
Oh, I'm sorry. It was
inconsiderate of me.

440
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:10,489
Eat. Take your time.

441
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:12,992
I'm home.

442
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,802
Jungi. Where have you been?

443
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:20,299
-Interviewing Anchor Park Changho.
-What?

444
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,902
You went there yesterday,
but you finished today?

445
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:24,603
You spent two days interviewing him?

446
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,005
You have no idea.

447
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,308
I've never seen anyone who talks that much.

448
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,612
He talked about the history of hunting
in prehistoric times over lunch.

449
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:37,716
-I'm home.
-Hi.

450
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,335
-Did you have dinner?
-Yes.

451
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,388
I ran into Donggu
and we had dinner together.

452
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:44,790
Seol is awake.

453
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,494
She had dinner with Donggu?

454
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,497
He said he'll be hunting locations
in Sokcho for a few days.

455
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,400
Then why was he in Seoul?

456
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:09,415
Hello? Yes, Director.

457
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:11,016
Why aren't you here?

458
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:13,934
-Where are you?
-At the sauna.

459
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:15,921
I'm putting on my underwear.

460
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,233
I'm putting in my right leg.

461
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,826
I'm putting on pants right.
I'm leaving now.

462
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:24,129
I'll go shirtless. Love you.

463
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,701
He's going to scold me when I get there.

464
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,543
But I got to see Yuna, so it's worth it.

465
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:50,923
Sua.

466
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,559
-Can I come in?
-Of course.

467
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:58,464
Did you have something to say?

468
00:24:58,564 --> 00:24:59,748
No.

469
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,635
What did you have with Donggu for dinner?

470
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,870
-Sundae.
-I see.

471
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,972
Then, Donggu went back to Sokcho, right?

472
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,240
Sokcho?

473
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:11,043
-He went to Sokcho?
-Oh, you didn't know?

474
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,879
He went to Sokcho because of the movie.

475
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,181
I was wondering why he was in Seoul.

476
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,650
-He came to see you.
-What?

477
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,083
What do you mean?

478
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:23,866
He didn't travel all the way
from Sokcho to Seoul for sundae.

479
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:28,560
He's immature and incompetent,

480
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:30,863
and his future is dark,

481
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,965
but he's a decent guy.

482
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:37,069
He's kind, warm and has a big heart.

483
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:39,671
Just saying.

484
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:40,973
Get some rest.

485
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,044
Do you like the coat I gave you?

486
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:48,280
Yes. It's so warm and pretty.

487
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:49,368
Thanks, Sua.

488
00:25:49,462 --> 00:25:51,350
You should thank Donggu.

489
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,253
He bought it for you.

490
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:55,054
What?

491
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:58,635
Oh my!
You didn't know?

492
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,459
I thought you knew.

493
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:05,364
Don't tell Donggu that I told you that.
Okay?

494
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:23,949
Why isn't Jungi Love writing any comments?

495
00:26:25,531 --> 00:26:26,752
Hope everything's okay.

496
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:31,557
I'll send her a message.

497
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,893
She'll be surprised.

498
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,130
Hi, Jungi Love.

499
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,732
This is Lee Jungi.

500
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,103
Is everything okay with you?

501
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,293
Question mark.

502
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,501
Send.

503
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:51,176
What the heck?

504
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:53,812
Where's that coming from?

505
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,618
Kang Seojin left her phone again.

506
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,522
She's going to make a
big fuss over it later.

507
00:27:04,812 --> 00:27:05,724
What's this?

508
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:08,527
Jungi Love?

509
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,629
What is this?

510
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:22,441
What?

511
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:24,626
Don't come into my room without knocking.

512
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,944
Kang Seojin.

513
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:30,949
What's this?

514
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:35,220
You're the one who's been writing
those comments?

515
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:38,524
Why did you do that?

516
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,092
What do you think?

517
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,817
I'm busy.

518
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,335
Can you leave?

519
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:30,309
Sua. When are you going
to stop watching TV?

520
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,110
You watched this already.

521
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:34,880
Don't be so mean.

522
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,982
Fine, I'll turn it off.

523
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,786
-What should I do?
-What?

524
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,789
-Let's study math.
-Math?

525
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:45,791
I'm really bad at math.

526
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,994
Don't worry. We'll start from the basics.

527
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:52,898
Can you solve this one?

528
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:56,501
Here you go.

529
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,972
Hey, come on.

530
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,774
I suck at math, but I can solve this.

531
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,178
-It's 40.
-What?

532
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,881
How is this 40?

533
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:13,785
12 plus 8 is 20.
20 times 2 is 40.

534
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,088
Sua, actually...

535
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:19,891
You have to multiply or divide first
then add or subtract.

536
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:23,695
So, you have to multiply 8 by 2
and then add 12.

537
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,565
What? Why do you have to multiply first?

538
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:30,669
It's the rule of the four fundamental
arithmetic operations.

539
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,472
So, you always have to
multiply and divide first.

540
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:35,641
Who decided that?

541
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:39,244
-I'm not sure about that.
-What?

542
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:42,948
You're trying to teach me when you
don't even know who decided it?

543
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:45,350
Why do I have to learn something
that you don't know?

544
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:48,553
Unbelievable.

545
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:51,156
How can you teach
when you don't even know it yourself?

546
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,659
You act like you know everything.

547
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:56,067
You should have put the ones that need
to be calculated first at the front.

548
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,462
Why did you make it so difficult?

549
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,164
Are you messing with me?

550
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,366
Are you a psycho?

551
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:05,937
I'm starting to have doubts about
the origins of math because of you.

552
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,856
Do I know Dusik?

553
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:28,460
He was the most positive guy
I've ever seen.

554
00:30:28,734 --> 00:30:31,863
Do you want to know what happened to him?

555
00:30:32,243 --> 00:30:33,532
You idiot.

556
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:36,569
You have doubts about the origins of math
when you can't even so simple math?

557
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,037
Just quit. Darn it!

558
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,639
If you're dumb,
you should at least work hard.

559
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:45,444
You can't watch TV. Do you even understand
what they're saying on TV? Darn it!

560
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:48,048
What? A psycho?

561
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,067
I'm trying to help you. God darn it!

562
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:52,351
Darn idiot! You idiot!

563
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:54,920
Darn you! I'll smack you in the head.

564
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,656
You're a freaking idiot.

565
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,527
Jungi, see you on the day of shooting.

566
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,096
See you then.

567
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,497
Thank you!

568
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:12,371
Kang Seojin.

569
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:14,773
You're the one who's been writing
those comments?

570
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:15,874
Why did you do that?

571
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,376
What do you think?

572
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:27,652
I love Octopus Man.

573
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:31,590
You'll become the greatest actor
in the universe one day.

574
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,769
So charismatic even without a line.

575
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,361
It was a short appearance but you shined.

576
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,263
Your acting is the best.

577
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:39,664
I believe in you.

578
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:40,766
You can do it!

579
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:44,970
-Jungi!
-Oh my god.

580
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,662
Congratulations on getting the part!
I'm so happy for you!

581
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:50,041
It's all thanks to you.

582
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:52,043
-Thanks.
-What?

583
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,334
Thanks!

584
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,915
No, I should be thanking you!

585
00:31:57,033 --> 00:32:00,225
I met Seojin thanks to you!

586
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:04,022
And I'm going on a date with her today!

587
00:32:04,234 --> 00:32:05,123
What?

588
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,034
-Date?
-Yes!

589
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,394
I asked her if she wants to be
my girlfriend a few days ago

590
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,496
and she wants to meet today!

591
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,565
That means yes, right?

592
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,268
Thanks, Jungi!

593
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,104
I'll ask you again.

594
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:23,041
Do you see me... as a woman?

595
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:26,545
I see you as a man.

596
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:28,647
What should I do?

597
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:33,552
Wow.

598
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,788
Go, Seojin!

599
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:39,624
Congratulations, Chewbacca.

600
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,734
Buy us dinner
when you get your paycheck.

601
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,528
You're a troublemaker,
but you're a good actor.

602
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,230
I like you.

603
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,135
-Jaewoo!
-Why?

604
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,237
-You can't see Seojin today!
-What?

605
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:54,039
-Why?
-I think I'm going to regret it.

606
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,508
Regret? What are you talking about?

607
00:32:56,634 --> 00:33:00,545
I'm going to regret it for the rest
of my life if I lose her like this.

608
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,447
What!

609
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,549
Forget it if you didn't hear me.

610
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:20,165
What is it? Why are you here?

611
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,767
Seojin, we need to talk.

612
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:24,452
I have nothing to say to you.

613
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,108
I'll do it.

614
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,210
What are you talking about?

615
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:33,612
From now on,

616
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,680
I'll see you as a woman.

617
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,785
So, let's date.

618
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,188
As a man and a woman.

619
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,790
Jungi.

620
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,167
Jungi!

621
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,871
-We have to keep it a secret from Donggu.
-Okay.

622
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,674
If he finds out we're dating,
he'll kill me.

623
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:04,876
-Okay?
-Okay.

624
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,282
Let go. People are watching.

625
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,950
No, I'm not letting you go.

626
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,852
I'll hold onto you forever.

627
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:24,029
Hello.

628
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:28,633
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

629
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,735
-Welcome.
-Seojin, take them to their rooms.

630
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,937
-Sure.
-Hello.

631
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,138
Hello.

632
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:34,439
Jungi.

633
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,742
Follow me.

634
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,846
-Come in. Come in.
-Come in.

635
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:46,384
There was a problem at our
accommodation but you saved us.

636
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,868
Thank you for bringing in guests.

637
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,668
You're staying here too?

638
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,691
I need to give them a tour of the city.

639
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,292
Come this way.

640
00:35:04,008 --> 00:35:05,537
What is it?

641
00:35:06,534 --> 00:35:09,341
You didn't forget about our date later,
right?

642
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:10,742
Yes.

643
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,345
It's our first date.

644
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,447
I'm so excited, right?

645
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,334
Stop that. Someone might see us.

646
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,553
What? No one's here.

647
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:23,088
Really?

648
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:25,290
I'm home.

649
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:31,863
H...Hey...

650
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,159
-Are you coming from Sokcho?
-Yes.

651
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:36,868
I'm exhausted.

652
00:35:36,953 --> 00:35:38,570
Why are you two here together?

653
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:39,735
I warned you.

654
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,940
Stay away from my little sister.

655
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:44,042
-Where's the bamboo sword?
-No! No!

656
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:46,834
I ran into her on my way
to get a glass of water. True story.

657
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:48,246
Yes, that's the truth.

658
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,247
Is it?

659
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,950
What are you doing down there?

660
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,753
I was clea...cleaning.

661
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,521
There's lots of hair on the floor.

662
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,023
-So much hair.
-Yes?

663
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,324
So much hair.

664
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,926
What's that? Is that a gift for me?

665
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,428
This?

666
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,297
Sokcho's specialty, semi-dried squid.

667
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:08,199
The same species as you.

668
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,001
Squid. Squid.

669
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,503
-Squid.
-Shut up.

670
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:12,804
Your friend.

671
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:15,140
What's that noise?

672
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:18,934
You know Hyeonjun,
Yuna's baking class teacher?

673
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:22,034
He brought guests.
They'll be staying here for a few days.

674
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:25,250
Song Hyeonjun that jerk
is staying here? Darn it!

675
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,352
What's the matter with you?

676
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:32,257
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

677
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,958
I'm fine. I'm fine.

678
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,663
This guest house is adorable.

679
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,865
I'm glad that you like it.

680
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,469
Hello!

681
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,371
Look who it is.

682
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,574
-Donggu. When did you get back?
-Just now.

683
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,035
We meet again.

684
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:54,579
I hear that you'll be staying here
for a few days?

685
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,581
Yes, for a few days.

686
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:02,253
Why did you choose this small guest house
out of tens of guest houses?

687
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,856
It's better to have someone you know.

688
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,357
And Yuna is here.

689
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,228
I see.

690
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,330
Donggu, what's that?

691
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,932
This?

692
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:17,102
Semi-dried squid from Sokcho.

693
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:20,038
The same species as Hyeonjun.

694
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,741
What do you think?

695
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,943
Would you like to try some?

696
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:28,046
To welcome you to our guest house...

697
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,434
It's a welcome squid.

698
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:31,950
Thanks.

699
00:37:55,729 --> 00:37:57,509
Jungi, I just got off work.

700
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,445
Get here quickly. I miss you!

701
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,947
I can't get used to this.

702
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:07,886
Who'd have thought I'd be dating Seojin.

703
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:16,961
That's right.

704
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:21,332
She was this tiny little girl
with a mustache.

705
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,935
Who'd have thought I'd be dating
this hairy kid.

706
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:26,938
This is unreal.

707
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:29,841
No!

708
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,043
But we decided to give this a go.

709
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,745
Let's do it.

710
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,534
Let's do this!

711
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,048
Let's go!

712
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:38,449
Hairy, I love you.

713
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:43,555
When I was studying in New York,
there guys were like brothers to me.

714
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,859
We took road trips during breaks.

715
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,762
I see. That sounds fun.

716
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:55,967
Why isn't this opening?

717
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,671
-Donggu, can you open this for me?
-Sure.

718
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:06,978
You can't open it?

719
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,184
It's a bad jar.

720
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,387
-I'll try.
-It's a bad one.

721
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,889
The lid is stuck to the jar.

722
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:21,993
-Wow.
-Amazing.

723
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,395
Hyeonjun, you're really strong.

724
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,197
That was easy.

725
00:39:26,592 --> 00:39:29,901
-Hyeonjun, should we grab a drink?
-Okay. Sure.

726
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,400
-Yuna, do you want to join us for drinks?
-Hey, hey.

727
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,207
She's breast feeding.

728
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,911
Seol is on baby food and formula now.

729
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:40,912
Really?

730
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,615
But it's too late for a drink.

731
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,116
It's only 9 pm.

732
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:47,735
Seol is asleep.
Go with them and have a drink.

733
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:49,921
-I'll clean up here.
-That jerk...

734
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,623
Can I?

735
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,726
Thank you.

736
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:57,428
Then I'll join you too.

737
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,198
Well, I suddenly feel like a drink.

738
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:04,001
-Do you drink well?
-I've never lost to anyone.

739
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,305
-What about you?
-I drink as much as the next man.

740
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,308
-Would you like to join us?
-Let's go.

741
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:19,284
"Anchor Park Changho"

742
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,185
Why is he calling me?

743
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,367
Hello, sir.

744
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:26,591
How are you?

745
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,293
Good, how about you?

746
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:32,003
I still have so much to tell you
and was wondering when you'll come back.

747
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:32,897
What?

748
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:37,502
-I've been busy, so...
-I see.

749
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,805
You sound like you're far away.

750
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:46,202
-My phone is old.
-I see.

751
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,880
Mobile phones are so convenient,
aren't they?

752
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,181
By the way, do you know how...

753
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:53,284
-...the mobile phone was invented?
-What?

754
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,982
To understand the history
of mobile phones,

755
00:40:55,082 --> 00:40:57,188
you need to know the history of phones.

756
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:02,994
The first phone was invented by an Italian
called Antonio Meucci in Cuba in 1949.

757
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,296
The regular phone that
we're familiar with was...

758
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:23,481
How was the smart phone invented?

759
00:41:23,601 --> 00:41:26,084
The first smart phone was called 'Simon'
invented in 1992...

760
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:28,600
-...by IBM.
-Jungi, I'm here.

761
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,189
What are you doing?

762
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:32,902
One moment.

763
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,094
-IBM is...
-Yes, sir.

764
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,397
Thank you for that information.

765
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:42,300
I have to go and shoot a scene.

766
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,701
Yes. Yes.

767
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,803
I'll call you later.

768
00:41:46,334 --> 00:41:48,506
Okay. Bye.

769
00:41:49,934 --> 00:41:50,975
My ear's hot.

770
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:53,378
Who was that?

771
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:57,181
Anchor Park Changho.

772
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:59,750
Oh, the anchor who talks a lot?

773
00:41:59,868 --> 00:42:03,354
I didn't go to see him for a while
and now he's calling me.

774
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:05,857
Should I block his phone?

775
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:09,627
Sorry.

776
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,929
-Let's go. The movie will start soon.
-Okay.

777
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,034
Jungi. Let's have popcorn.

778
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,233
Popcorn, please?

779
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,236
What's wrong?

780
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:21,739
Nothing. Let's have popcorn.

781
00:42:38,152 --> 00:42:41,025
There are so many kiss
scenes in this movie.

782
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,162
It's already awkward as it is.

783
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,804
Why? You don't want to hold hands?

784
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,740
I do.

785
00:42:57,442 --> 00:43:01,402
It's so awkward.
This is super awkward.

786
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,214
No.

787
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,716
Stop thinking like that.

788
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,019
She's not the little hairy girl anymore.

789
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,455
She's an adult now.

790
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,658
What's this?

791
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:15,760
Her hand is so small.

792
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,962
Has her hands always been this small?

793
00:43:25,373 --> 00:43:26,471
What's wrong?

794
00:43:28,546 --> 00:43:30,141
Why are you looking at me like that?

795
00:43:30,634 --> 00:43:31,242
What?

796
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,845
Do I have a mustache?

797
00:43:34,634 --> 00:43:36,147
No, but...

798
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,767
Can't stop staring because I'm pretty?

799
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,853
Do you miss me when I'm next to you?

800
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:46,124
Gosh, you're so cute.

801
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:57,362
I don't want it to end.

802
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:00,659
I had so much fun today.

803
00:44:01,571 --> 00:44:03,844
-Yes.
-Good night.

804
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:07,226
Dream of me.

805
00:44:13,832 --> 00:44:16,447
Oh my god. I can't get used to it.

806
00:44:16,535 --> 00:44:17,835
Hey!

807
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:19,127
What's that?

808
00:44:19,942 --> 00:44:20,781
What's that noise?

809
00:44:24,689 --> 00:44:26,383
Get a hold of yourself!

810
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:27,777
Why did you drink so much?

811
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:29,743
Let go of me!

812
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,948
I want to drink more.

813
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:37,146
What's this? What's the matter with him?

814
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,474
He and Hyeonjun had a drinking bet.

815
00:44:40,574 --> 00:44:42,748
I'm sorry. He said he was fine.

816
00:44:42,868 --> 00:44:44,757
Donggu, are you okay?

817
00:44:44,857 --> 00:44:46,275
Hyeonjun!

818
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:48,764
Come on!

819
00:44:48,865 --> 00:44:52,860
You promised to call me "Deonggu".

820
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:55,371
Call me Deonggu.

821
00:44:55,455 --> 00:44:56,936
Deonggu.

822
00:44:57,036 --> 00:44:58,521
Okay, Donggu.

823
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,126
Get a hold of yourself.

824
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,019
Okay, Hyeonjun.

825
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:10,056
Don't forget, you promised
to make me sausage bread.

826
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:13,877
Deonggu loves sausage bread.

827
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:16,782
Okay, I'll put it two sausages.

828
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:19,181
Two? Two sausages!

829
00:45:19,267 --> 00:45:20,467
How much did he drink?

830
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:22,606
Sorry, I'll take him to bed.

831
00:45:23,027 --> 00:45:24,712
Get a hold of yourself!

832
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,656
Vitamin smell.

833
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:39,568
How many vitamin tablets did he take?

834
00:45:40,267 --> 00:45:42,482
It smells like red ginseng.

835
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:44,370
What the hell did he eat?

836
00:45:45,163 --> 00:45:46,665
Ow, my head.

837
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:48,477
I'm dying.

838
00:45:48,701 --> 00:45:50,076
Are you awake?

839
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,177
-What a butthead.
-I feel awful.

840
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:56,372
Why are you wiping the floor?

841
00:45:57,983 --> 00:45:59,961
What the hell!

842
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:03,568
Where are my clothes? Who undressed me?

843
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:04,882
We did!

844
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,836
-Why?
-Because you...

845
00:46:06,936 --> 00:46:09,740
You peed your pants last night.

846
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,234
What? Me?

847
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:12,723
That's not all.

848
00:46:12,823 --> 00:46:15,901
You decided to be friends with Hyeonjun
and hugged and kissed him on the cheeks.

849
00:46:16,004 --> 00:46:17,584
You were trashed last night.

850
00:46:17,684 --> 00:46:18,991
What? Best friend?

851
00:46:19,091 --> 00:46:21,091
I did that to Hyeonjun?

852
00:46:21,191 --> 00:46:22,781
Hyeonjun!

853
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,795
I kissed you.

854
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:28,002
You drank too much trying
to beat Hyeonjun.

855
00:46:28,102 --> 00:46:29,903
Why did you try so hard to beat Hyeonjun?

856
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,385
Isn't it obvious?

857
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:35,561
You're jealous because Yuna
is close to him, right?

858
00:46:36,136 --> 00:46:38,660
He still likes Yuna.

859
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:42,436
No, I stopped liking Yuna.

860
00:46:42,536 --> 00:46:46,522
Oh, yeah? Then you wouldn't care if
we tell Yuna that you peed your pants?

861
00:46:46,622 --> 00:46:47,642
Okay, then.

862
00:46:47,734 --> 00:46:50,806
-Yuna!
-Don't do that!

863
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:52,514
Don't!

864
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,697
Seriously, don't do it.

865
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:57,723
Why not? You said you don't
care about Yuna anymore.

866
00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:01,347
Fine, I still like Yuna. So what?

867
00:47:01,634 --> 00:47:05,220
I tried to forget, but I keep thinking
about her and missing her.

868
00:47:05,648 --> 00:47:07,889
That's why you tried to beat Hyeonjun.

869
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:12,200
That guy keeps hanging around Yuna.
It's bothering me.

870
00:47:12,314 --> 00:47:15,700
It looked like there's nothing going on
between them.

871
00:47:15,819 --> 00:47:16,886
Do you think so?

872
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:19,784
But I have a bad feeling.

873
00:47:20,175 --> 00:47:22,079
I can smell something suspicious.

874
00:47:22,183 --> 00:47:24,881
That smell is coming from your blanket.

875
00:47:24,981 --> 00:47:26,875
Go and wash it! It stinks.

876
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,779
Okay. What the...!

877
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:40,735
Dusik, please don't tell Yuna
about my peeing my pants.

878
00:47:40,834 --> 00:47:41,809
All right.

879
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:48,733
Did I really call Hyeonjun
my friend last night?

880
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:52,519
Yes, I thought you guys
were like life-long best friends.

881
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,134
Stop drinking.

882
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:56,017
Stupid.

883
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:57,335
You're up.

884
00:47:58,234 --> 00:48:00,529
-How's your hangover?
-It's okay.

885
00:48:00,613 --> 00:48:03,730
How will you face Yuna now?

886
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:06,337
Why? Did I do something bad?

887
00:48:06,437 --> 00:48:08,941
You gave her an airplane ride.

888
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:10,624
An airplane ride?

889
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,929
Donggu.

890
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:19,344
Let's go to Paris.

891
00:48:21,678 --> 00:48:23,465
Turbulence!

892
00:48:24,438 --> 00:48:27,668
But aircraft Donggu is really strong.

893
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:29,577
Scream!

894
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:32,489
Yesterday,
Yuna said she's never been abroad,

895
00:48:32,601 --> 00:48:35,136
then you lifted her up with your legs
and gave her an airplane ride.

896
00:48:35,237 --> 00:48:37,068
What? I did that?

897
00:48:37,153 --> 00:48:39,748
She doesn't need to go on a plane anymore.

898
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,856
Goodness, this butthead.

899
00:48:46,574 --> 00:48:47,772
Donggu.

900
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:51,876
-You're awake?
-Yes.

901
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,307
Hey, Donggu.

902
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:55,800
-How's the hangover?
-It's fine.

903
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,494
Mr. Song Hyeonjun.

904
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:01,598
Come on, we agreed to be friends
last night.

905
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:03,575
We did?

906
00:49:03,868 --> 00:49:06,465
I don't remember that at all.

907
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:09,490
I'm sorry, Mr. Song Hyeonjun.

908
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:12,845
It's fine.

909
00:49:19,628 --> 00:49:24,125
-We'll go upstairs.
-Okay.

910
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:28,923
Go ahead, Mr. Song Hyeonjun.

911
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,318
Yuna, I'm so sorry about last night.
I got so drunk...

912
00:49:34,423 --> 00:49:37,596
It's fine. Thanks to you, I get to
ride the airplane and the ride was fun.

913
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:44,404
Stupid!

914
00:49:44,879 --> 00:49:46,956
Hyeonjun, show me how to do it.

915
00:49:47,056 --> 00:49:49,353
Okay, just watch and learn.

916
00:49:57,567 --> 00:49:59,857
Hyeonjun, you're really good at gonggi.

917
00:50:00,601 --> 00:50:03,465
That's not how you play gonggi.

918
00:50:04,062 --> 00:50:04,861
What?

919
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:06,462
What do you mean?

920
00:50:06,562 --> 00:50:10,572
Your grip is the most important
when playing gonggi.

921
00:50:10,672 --> 00:50:12,768
You need to pick them up more lightly.

922
00:50:12,895 --> 00:50:16,197
If you pick them up roughly,
you'll make mistakes.

923
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:17,701
Are you good at gonggi too?

924
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:21,731
Of course.
I'm the "Huam-dong Gonggi King".

925
00:50:22,434 --> 00:50:23,950
Should I show you?

926
00:50:25,438 --> 00:50:27,759
All right. Give them to me.

927
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:33,480
Lightly. Like this.

928
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,731
You're really good at it.

929
00:50:40,815 --> 00:50:43,031
That was nothing.

930
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:46,817
It looks like you're pretty good
at gonggi.

931
00:50:46,901 --> 00:50:49,113
Would you like to play a game with me?

932
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,329
For fun.

933
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:54,320
Oh, sure.

934
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,428
But it's no fun without a bet.

935
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,978
The winner gets to flick the loser
in the forehead 10 times.

936
00:50:59,279 --> 00:51:00,189
Are you in?

937
00:51:01,681 --> 00:51:02,872
Sure.

938
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:04,385
How many points?

939
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:07,023
-50?
-Chicken.

940
00:51:08,834 --> 00:51:10,335
Let's do 100 points.

941
00:51:10,647 --> 00:51:12,235
100 points like men.

942
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:14,535
Let's decide who gets to go first.

943
00:51:14,634 --> 00:51:16,040
Rock-paper-scissors!

944
00:51:16,124 --> 00:51:18,147
Oh gosh.

945
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:19,334
Paper.

946
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:21,937
I guess I'm first.

947
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,391
Okay, 100 points.

948
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:35,903
Donggu, I won.

949
00:51:37,786 --> 00:51:40,197
Hyeonjun, you're really good at this.

950
00:51:42,601 --> 00:51:44,702
I'd have won, if I weren't hung over.

951
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:48,000
-You got lucky.
-Is it?

952
00:51:48,212 --> 00:51:49,517
Let's leave it at that.

953
00:51:49,601 --> 00:51:51,159
What do you mean by that?

954
00:51:51,259 --> 00:51:54,676
Are you saying I can't win even
when I'm not hung over?

955
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,476
No, I didn't mean that.

956
00:51:56,582 --> 00:51:57,947
Then, let's play another round.

957
00:51:58,067 --> 00:51:59,256
100 points again.

958
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:02,579
10 flicks, no, 20 flicks on the forehead.

959
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:03,767
Sure.

960
00:52:07,285 --> 00:52:08,380
Wait.

961
00:52:10,868 --> 00:52:12,081
Hello, Director.

962
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:14,371
Right now?

963
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:17,502
Okay, I'll be there.

964
00:52:18,726 --> 00:52:21,428
I have to go to work.

965
00:52:21,749 --> 00:52:24,546
We'll play this game when I get back.

966
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,458
Wait.

967
00:52:26,693 --> 00:52:30,264
Donggu. Are you forgetting something?

968
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:32,506
Sorry? What do you mean?

969
00:52:39,968 --> 00:52:44,678
I never thought Shin Hyeonjun would
agree to do the Saudi spy role.

970
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:47,680
He sounded very enthusiastic.

971
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:49,570
He probably thought
it was a fresh idea too.

972
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,881
He couldn't have imagined
doing a role of an Arab.

973
00:52:52,968 --> 00:52:54,672
It's all thanks to Donggu.

974
00:52:55,247 --> 00:52:58,952
So, we have Shin Hyeonjun
and the shooting location.

975
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:00,638
We need props now.

976
00:53:00,734 --> 00:53:04,357
-Which gun should our character carry?
-What about Beretta or Smith?

977
00:53:04,456 --> 00:53:06,065
It's too boring.

978
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:08,270
We need something new.

979
00:53:10,064 --> 00:53:11,200
Kang Donggu.

980
00:53:11,402 --> 00:53:12,923
-Kang Donggu, any idea?
-"I want to beat Song Hyeonjun."

981
00:53:14,136 --> 00:53:14,924
"Gonggi"

982
00:53:15,008 --> 00:53:16,019
Gonggi!

983
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:17,923
What the hell! Gonggi?

984
00:53:18,459 --> 00:53:20,076
-'Gonggi' as in 'air' in Korean?
-Sorry?

985
00:53:20,968 --> 00:53:22,267
An air gun!

986
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:23,467
That's fresh.

987
00:53:23,584 --> 00:53:25,534
-Kang Donggu.
-Yes?

988
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:27,726
You have amazing ideas.

989
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:30,509
-You did your part, so you can go home.
-What?

990
00:53:31,923 --> 00:53:32,826
Okay.

991
00:54:03,111 --> 00:54:04,012
Who are you?

992
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,115
Hello. I'm Kang Donggu.

993
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,716
Hanguk University, class of '09.

994
00:54:10,507 --> 00:54:14,983
We were in the film club "Ready, Go!"

995
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:16,890
Oh, Kang Donggu!

996
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:19,105
What are you doing here?

997
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:23,732
It's been so long.

998
00:54:24,734 --> 00:54:27,449
We haven't seen each other
since I graduated, huh?

999
00:54:27,747 --> 00:54:29,283
What brings you here?

1000
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,801
I have a favor to ask you.

1001
00:54:33,911 --> 00:54:36,100
What favor?

1002
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,769
Do you remember the festival
we had in college?

1003
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:42,492
Festival?

1004
00:54:42,766 --> 00:54:44,668
The one where we played movies?

1005
00:54:44,764 --> 00:54:46,269
The Jean-Luc Godard festival?

1006
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:47,434
Not that one.

1007
00:54:47,545 --> 00:54:50,329
-When we opened the stand-up bar?
-No, not that one.

1008
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:51,750
Then which one?

1009
00:54:52,344 --> 00:54:54,634
-The gonggi competition.
-What?

1010
00:54:54,734 --> 00:54:57,301
You won the whole competition.

1011
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:00,198
You got 100 points in the shortest time.
You set new records.

1012
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,311
Oh, I did. I remember.

1013
00:55:03,705 --> 00:55:04,901
What about it?

1014
00:55:05,788 --> 00:55:07,571
Teach me how to be good at gonggi.

1015
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:08,496
What?

1016
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:12,466
You came to see me for the first time
in eight years to learn gonggi from me?

1017
00:55:12,566 --> 00:55:15,229
Yes, I have a reason.

1018
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:18,128
I need to learn.
I really want to be good at it.

1019
00:55:18,234 --> 00:55:19,068
Please.

1020
00:55:19,634 --> 00:55:21,251
Please teach me.

1021
00:55:21,534 --> 00:55:22,490
Please.

1022
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:25,112
What are you doing?

1023
00:55:32,501 --> 00:55:35,899
Did you bring the gonggi stones?

1024
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:48,520
We need to make them lighter.

1025
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,915
There are too many metal bits in these.

1026
00:55:51,111 --> 00:55:54,994
3.2 g per stone is the
perfect weight for me.

1027
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:57,002
But it's different for everyone.

1028
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,462
So, you need to find the weight
that suits you.

1029
00:56:00,464 --> 00:56:01,178
Okay.

1030
00:56:01,572 --> 00:56:04,585
Throw the stones to your eye level.

1031
00:56:04,701 --> 00:56:06,668
If you throw them above your head,
it's called 'Baekdusan.'

1032
00:56:06,768 --> 00:56:09,778
It's considered as a foul
in the world of gonggi.

1033
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,475
Baekdusan...

1034
00:56:12,575 --> 00:56:14,786
Let's begin.

1035
00:56:15,968 --> 00:56:21,262
In level one, the important thing is to
spread the stones as much as you can.

1036
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,884
-Spread them...
-Like this.

1037
00:56:22,991 --> 00:56:23,865
Spread them!

1038
00:56:23,968 --> 00:56:25,320
-Okay?
-Okay.

1039
00:56:25,434 --> 00:56:27,829
In level two, you have to split them
into two.

1040
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:32,329
You raise your middle finger a little bit
so the opponent doesn't notice it.

1041
00:56:32,434 --> 00:56:33,626
-Wow.
-It happens in a flash.

1042
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:35,845
This is not a foul play.

1043
00:56:35,956 --> 00:56:37,242
It's a technique.

1044
00:56:37,345 --> 00:56:38,736
Level three.

1045
00:56:38,939 --> 00:56:41,137
Put one stone under your thumb.

1046
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:42,674
You'll let that one go at the end.

1047
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,467
Drop it right away.

1048
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,085
Grab three stones first to be safe.

1049
00:56:47,178 --> 00:56:49,678
-Okay?
-Three stones first.

1050
00:56:53,266 --> 00:56:54,077
So cold.

1051
00:56:56,267 --> 00:56:58,160
Why isn't she coming down?

1052
00:57:00,769 --> 00:57:01,645
What is it now?

1053
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,364
It's me. Park Changho.

1054
00:57:06,459 --> 00:57:07,372
My goodness.

1055
00:57:07,968 --> 00:57:11,233
I've blocked his calls
and now he's sending me texts.

1056
00:57:11,968 --> 00:57:14,256
Even his text is long.

1057
00:57:14,356 --> 00:57:16,835
Is this a thesis?

1058
00:57:19,107 --> 00:57:21,019
I better block his texts too.

1059
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:24,808
-Sorry, I'm late.
-It's okay.

1060
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,636
Jungi, what should we do today?

1061
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,230
Whatever you want to do.

1062
00:57:29,334 --> 00:57:31,942
Let's go to the karaoke.

1063
00:57:35,722 --> 00:57:36,534
Karaoke?

1064
00:57:36,634 --> 00:57:38,230
Why? You don't want to?

1065
00:57:40,033 --> 00:57:42,316
No, let's go to the karaoke.

1066
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:44,901
Karaoke!

1067
00:57:46,706 --> 00:57:47,999
I'm excited.

1068
00:57:49,084 --> 00:57:51,900
I wanted to sing this song
for my boyfriend.

1069
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,401
Can I go first?

1070
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:55,688
Sure, go ahead.

1071
00:58:01,934 --> 00:58:04,255
Darn it, I can't get used to this.

1072
00:58:21,286 --> 00:58:24,203
Why did you do that?

1073
00:58:24,982 --> 00:58:27,853
You're a kid.
You can't sing a sexy song like that.

1074
00:58:27,953 --> 00:58:30,248
-What are you talking about?
-Shut up!

1075
00:58:38,928 --> 00:58:40,414
We're already here.

1076
00:58:41,043 --> 00:58:42,113
I don't want to go in.

1077
00:58:42,335 --> 00:58:45,839
If we get married,
we could stay together all night.

1078
00:58:45,933 --> 00:58:46,743
What?

1079
00:58:47,534 --> 00:58:48,321
Married?

1080
00:58:48,434 --> 00:58:52,647
Where should we go on our honeymoon?

1081
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:53,741
What?

1082
00:58:54,337 --> 00:58:55,473
Honeymoon?

1083
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,195
I want to go to Maldives.

1084
00:58:57,981 --> 00:59:00,201
-And...
-Stop! Stop!

1085
00:59:01,094 --> 00:59:03,400
You're just a kid.

1086
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:07,413
No! No! This is not right.

1087
00:59:08,901 --> 00:59:09,978
Seojin.

1088
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:12,808
I have something to say.

1089
00:59:16,096 --> 00:59:17,121
Seojin.

1090
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:23,526
I tried, but I only see you
as the little kid.

1091
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:29,023
I really tried,
but I can't see you as a woman.

1092
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,396
So...

1093
00:59:32,587 --> 00:59:34,203
I think we should stop.

1094
00:59:34,806 --> 00:59:35,605
Okay?

1095
00:59:37,103 --> 00:59:39,694
I'm sorry. Seojin...

1096
00:59:47,406 --> 00:59:48,577
Wait.

1097
00:59:51,901 --> 00:59:53,971
Don't do this, Seojin.

1098
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:56,066
Please try to understand...

1099
01:00:17,934 --> 01:00:20,928
Do you still not see me as a woman?

1100
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:24,130
I do.

1101
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:26,844
I see you as a woman.

1102
01:00:26,944 --> 01:00:29,658
No, you don't sound certain enough.

1103
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:31,938
You still don't see me as woman, do you?

1104
01:00:32,432 --> 01:00:33,139
What?

1105
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:39,459
Get out of my way!

1106
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:47,926
What the heck?

1107
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,611
Donggu didn't see us?

1108
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,031
I think so.

1109
01:00:52,913 --> 01:00:54,726
-What's the matter with him?
-I don't know.

1110
01:00:55,226 --> 01:00:57,025
He seemed insane.

1111
01:00:58,167 --> 01:00:59,940
He didn't see us, so that's good.

1112
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:04,838
I'm home!

1113
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,319
Hi, Donggu.

1114
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:08,424
Did you eat dinner?

1115
01:01:08,508 --> 01:01:10,321
I'm not hungry. But more importantly!

1116
01:01:10,611 --> 01:01:13,329
Let's play another game.

1117
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:16,555
Gonggi.

1118
01:01:18,478 --> 01:01:19,165
What?

1119
01:01:40,976 --> 01:01:43,869
Whoever gets the 100 points first wins.

1120
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,667
The penalty is 20 flicks on the forehead.

1121
01:01:47,581 --> 01:01:48,685
Do you agree?

1122
01:01:49,176 --> 01:01:50,768
Yes. I agree.

1123
01:01:50,868 --> 01:01:52,514
Let's set the rules.

1124
01:01:54,901 --> 01:01:57,323
You can't do Baekdusan.

1125
01:01:58,218 --> 01:02:00,125
If the stones go above your head,
you lose your turn.

1126
01:02:00,221 --> 01:02:02,656
-Got it?
-Yes. I got it.

1127
01:02:02,754 --> 01:02:05,448
Then, no Sokuri either.

1128
01:02:05,534 --> 01:02:06,752
When you catch the stones,

1129
01:02:08,256 --> 01:02:09,812
you can't catch them like this.

1130
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,033
Obviously.

1131
01:02:12,834 --> 01:02:13,713
And...

1132
01:02:15,724 --> 01:02:18,160
Let's allow Arirang Catch.

1133
01:02:18,862 --> 01:02:19,869
Of course.

1134
01:02:20,565 --> 01:02:22,477
We'll allow that.

1135
01:02:23,975 --> 01:02:25,367
Let's begin.

1136
01:02:26,065 --> 01:02:28,725
Let's decide who'll go first.
Rock-paper-scissors!

1137
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,750
I'll go first.

1138
01:02:40,851 --> 01:02:43,328
Then, let's begin.

1139
01:02:56,634 --> 01:02:57,521
Foul!

1140
01:03:00,514 --> 01:03:01,525
Baekdusan.

1141
01:03:06,734 --> 01:03:07,631
Kong!

1142
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:15,004
Miracle.

1143
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:51,255
Current scores.

1144
01:03:51,753 --> 01:03:53,657
Song Hyeonjun, 96 points.

1145
01:03:53,767 --> 01:03:55,560
Kang Donggu, 83 points.

1146
01:04:02,601 --> 01:04:04,126
If I miss this chance,

1147
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:07,225
Song Hyeonjun will win.

1148
01:04:09,327 --> 01:04:10,324
Crisis.

1149
01:04:11,002 --> 01:04:12,218
What do I do?

1150
01:04:13,033 --> 01:04:14,233
What should I do?

1151
01:04:20,692 --> 01:04:21,994
Lastly,

1152
01:04:22,707 --> 01:04:26,839
I'll teach you the skill that
you must use only in a crisis.

1153
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,232
What is it?

1154
01:04:28,316 --> 01:04:34,310
Your opponent's turn has ended
and it's your turn.

1155
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:39,906
You threw the stones in the air and put
four stones on the back of your hand.

1156
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:43,600
What choice will you make in that moment?

1157
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:48,313
I'd catch the four stones
and start level one again...

1158
01:04:48,405 --> 01:04:50,289
No, no, no!

1159
01:04:50,491 --> 01:04:54,647
The moment you make that choice,
the game is over.

1160
01:04:55,217 --> 01:05:00,034
You can't be sure if you won't make
any mistakes from level one to level four.

1161
01:05:00,267 --> 01:05:01,786
Then what should I do?

1162
01:05:01,877 --> 01:05:03,982
You have to make the winning move.

1163
01:05:04,278 --> 01:05:05,866
With Arirang Catch.

1164
01:05:06,267 --> 01:05:07,689
Arirang Catch?

1165
01:05:07,789 --> 01:05:13,137
You catch the stones from the top
and then from the bottom.

1166
01:05:13,234 --> 01:05:16,844
You need to catch the stones in two steps.
It's a very difficult technique.

1167
01:05:16,968 --> 01:05:19,942
It'll multiply the points by five
if you perform this technique.

1168
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,549
It's the winning move.

1169
01:05:22,033 --> 01:05:22,851
Five times the points?

1170
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:24,731
When you're in a crisis,

1171
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:29,934
remember Arirang Catch.

1172
01:05:30,701 --> 01:05:34,124
I'm at the edge of the cliff.

1173
01:05:34,535 --> 01:05:36,634
I have to make the winning move.

1174
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,619
Chilling.

1175
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:42,824
A dagger pierces my heart.

1176
01:05:43,601 --> 01:05:45,502
But don't worry.

1177
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:47,830
I have...

1178
01:05:49,123 --> 01:05:51,336
...Arirang Catch.

1179
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:44,196
I did it.

1180
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:45,398
I did Arirang Catch!

1181
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:46,602
You saw that, right?

1182
01:06:46,693 --> 01:06:49,713
It's five times the points.
So, I get 20 points.

1183
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,581
Then, I win, right?

1184
01:06:59,701 --> 01:07:02,729
Donggu, I lose.

1185
01:07:03,501 --> 01:07:06,717
My back hurts from playing this game
so long.

1186
01:07:06,801 --> 01:07:09,529
I'm going to the bathroom.

1187
01:07:10,634 --> 01:07:11,827
Hyeonjun.

1188
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:15,919
Aren't you forgetting something?

1189
01:07:31,734 --> 01:07:33,737
Kang Donggu.

1190
01:07:48,767 --> 01:07:50,583
We enjoyed our stay.

1191
01:07:50,756 --> 01:07:52,165
Bye.

1192
01:07:53,267 --> 01:07:54,554
Travel safely.

1193
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:57,237
Wait.

1194
01:07:58,743 --> 01:08:00,344
Let me ask you one thing.

1195
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:01,631
Sure. What is it?

1196
01:08:01,742 --> 01:08:06,984
You let Yuna use your
workroom to practice, right?

1197
01:08:07,482 --> 01:08:08,571
What's that about?

1198
01:08:08,682 --> 01:08:10,665
What do you mean?

1199
01:08:10,801 --> 01:08:14,683
It's strange.
There are other students in your class.

1200
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:17,309
Why are you treating her specially?

1201
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:21,004
Because we're both single parents?

1202
01:08:21,601 --> 01:08:23,705
Oh, I see.

1203
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,499
-I thought...
-But now...

1204
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:29,395
I'm starting to like her.

1205
01:08:30,598 --> 01:08:31,600
What?

1206
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,025
I'm interested in Yuna.

1207
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,099
Actually...

1208
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,605
I like her.

1209
01:09:00,065 --> 01:09:03,183
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1210
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:05,580
She shouldn't keep hanging around him.

1211
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,197
Why are you in a wheelchair?

1212
01:09:07,282 --> 01:09:09,382
This is a problem.You can't move.

1213
01:09:09,467 --> 01:09:11,484
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

1214
01:09:11,584 --> 01:09:12,574
Yuna, are you home?

1215
01:09:12,701 --> 01:09:14,283
Hyeonjun, what are you doing here?

1216
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,683
I'm going to open an online shopping mall.

1217
01:09:15,767 --> 01:09:17,325
Not anyone can run a business.

1218
01:09:17,434 --> 01:09:18,929
How could we promote my site?

1219
01:09:19,062 --> 01:09:20,964
I'm good at nothing.

1220
01:09:21,067 --> 01:09:22,635
I really tried my best this time.

1221
01:09:22,734 --> 01:09:24,340
I'm Hong Dusik.

1222
01:09:31,506 --> 01:09:32,719
What the hell are you doing?

1223
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:33,768
Jungi suggested it.

1224
01:09:33,871 --> 01:09:35,456
Don't tell on him.

1225
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:42,260
If you try anything with my little sister,
I'm going to kill you.

1226
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,867
Do we have to do this?

1227
01:09:43,967 --> 01:09:45,364
Can't we just tell him we're dating?

1228
01:09:45,448 --> 01:09:46,538
I have a boyfriend.

1229
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,451
What? A boyfriend?
