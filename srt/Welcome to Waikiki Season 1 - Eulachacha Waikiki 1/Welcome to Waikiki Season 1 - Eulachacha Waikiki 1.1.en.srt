1
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:30,898
"Waikiki"

2
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:06,901
What's this? Yuck.

3
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:11,192
Water.

4
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,332
Water.

5
00:01:22,843 --> 00:01:23,676
What's this?

6
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:28,355
Gosh.

7
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:45,410
Hello.

8
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:49,109
Yes, this is he.

9
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:52,238
What?

10
00:01:54,817 --> 00:02:00,426
I'm sorry. If you could give us
more time, we'll pay this week.

11
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:02,339
What?

12
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:06,553
How are we supposed to run
our business then?

13
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:07,508
Hello?

14
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,958
Hello?

15
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:16,521
You're so loud. What is it?

16
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:18,599
They're going to cut our water...

17
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:20,334
...because we didn't pay the bill.

18
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:21,928
What?

19
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:24,572
When?

20
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:26,124
Right now.

21
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,099
Darn it.

22
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:32,015
You think this is funny?

23
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:33,478
Is this funny to you?

24
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:36,723
I told you that I hate
these kind of pranks.

25
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:41,595
You guys are so...

26
00:02:41,956 --> 00:02:43,096
Kang Donggu.

27
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:45,985
Turn the water back on right now
or I'll beat you up.

28
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:47,571
-Jungi.
-Yeah?

29
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,425
He's over here.

30
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:49,651
Over here.

31
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,023
Kang Donggu.

32
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:53,255
Stop playing around
and turn the water back on.

33
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:54,878
I'm not playing a prank on you.

34
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,092
They cut our water
because we didn't pay the bill.

35
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,678
They cut off our water?

36
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,948
Ouch. It stings.

37
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:05,310
-Ouch. Ouch.
-Geez you.

38
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:08,432
I told you to pay the bills on time!

39
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,653
You think I don't want to?

40
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:11,502
But we don't have any money.
What am I supposed to do?

41
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,057
The water bill shouldn't be a lot.

42
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:14,072
It's 420,000 won.

43
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,716
-420,000 won?
-Yeah.

44
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:17,065
That's a lot.

45
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:20,528
How can a CEO not even
have 400,000 won?

46
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,283
This is all your fault.

47
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:24,034
What?

48
00:03:24,123 --> 00:03:25,655
You said guesthouses were the Blue Ocean.

49
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:28,634
You said Chinese tourists
will pour in like floods.

50
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:30,854
You said we'll make a fortune
and be able to make a movie.

51
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:33,657
I didn't know THAAD was going to hit us.

52
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,583
-Northeast Asian affairs change rapidly...
-Shut up!

53
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:38,887
Do you know how much interest
we have to pay on a loan?

54
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:41,351
We're this close to going bankrupt.
Bankrupt!

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,111
Now the water is cut off,
how are we going to run this guesthouse?

56
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:46,248
Don't you worry.

57
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:49,539
Is it that hard for three men
to come up with mere 400,000 won?

58
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:51,902
Yeah, it can't get any worse at least.

59
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,099
Let's think positively, okay, Donggu?

60
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:55,021
What?

61
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,811
Positively?

62
00:03:58,076 --> 00:03:58,915
You're right.

63
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:00,428
I must be wrong.

64
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:02,477
I almost made a huge mistake.

65
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,846
We have no customers,

66
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:06,465
and our loan interest is snowballing.

67
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:07,753
On top of that, the water is cut off.

68
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,820
I was being too negative.

69
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:11,507
I'm so sorry. I've committed a great sin.

70
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:13,071
Shall I get down on my knees?

71
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,788
That's not what I meant, Donggu...

72
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,200
Why are you yelling at him?

73
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,861
It's all right.

74
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,173
I'm the crazy one.

75
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:26,766
I'm the crazy one for trusting
these idiots and starting a business.

76
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,601
Yes, I'm the crazy one.

77
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,002
What?

78
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,814
"Think positively"?

79
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:37,726
Nothing ever works out my way!

80
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:38,715
You know what?

81
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:41,648
He has anger management issues.

82
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,721
It's all right. Stop crying.

83
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:44,693
Are you crying?

84
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:46,619
Why are you crying?

85
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,771
You said to think positively.

86
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:56,487
What?

87
00:04:56,926 --> 00:04:59,848
Think positively because it can't get
any worse than this?

88
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:02,699
If things get worse than this,
then this place would be hell.

89
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,128
What is that?

90
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:10,092
What's that noise?

91
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,824
There's a baby here...

92
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:41,546
Jungi! Dusik!

93
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:43,478
-What's wrong?
-What is it?

94
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:44,690
-What?
-What is it?

95
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,212
-What?
-There's...

96
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,352
-Is something there?
-What is it?

97
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:49,933
-Go and see.
-What is it?

98
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:50,859
-Go and look.
-What?

99
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:52,279
-What?
-Open it.

100
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:56,323
It's a baby. A baby doll.

101
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:57,794
It's moving.

102
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,212
It moved.

103
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:14,610
It moved.

104
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,117
It looked me in the eye.

105
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:17,514
It moved.

106
00:06:38,842 --> 00:06:40,430
Why the hell is it...

107
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,030
W-Why? Why?

108
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:43,298
Maybe it's a guest's baby.

109
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:45,348
We haven't had a guest in a long time.

110
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:47,512
That's why we drank
in the daytime yesterday.

111
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:49,394
Maybe the guest came in
when we were drunk.

112
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:50,315
You think so?

113
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:52,745
I blacked out. I can't remember anything.

114
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:53,990
You don't know anything?

115
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:55,114
You didn't drink.

116
00:06:55,202 --> 00:06:57,484
I went to bed early
because I have to shoot a scene today.

117
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,563
Let's look through that bag first.

118
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,380
Contact information might be in there.

119
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:02,302
Let's do that.

120
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:14,027
There's nothing in here.

121
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:16,035
What the hell is happening?

122
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:18,657
They left the bag here,
so maybe they just went out for a walk.

123
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:20,310
That doesn't make sense.

124
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,043
What kind of parent leaves
a tiny baby alone?

125
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:27,221
It's crying. It's crying.

126
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,576
Do something.

127
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:29,975
-Do something!
-Like what?

128
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:30,897
Go on.

129
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:32,147
What am I...

130
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,254
Baby...

131
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:35,065
Are you hungry?

132
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:37,423
Or are you...

133
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:38,791
Or did you pee?

134
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:46,083
-What's this?
-Is something there?

135
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:47,005
Hold on.

136
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,792
What the hell!

137
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,041
He pooped!

138
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:15,877
Okay...

139
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:19,258
I'll unfold it.

140
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,722
What's wrong?

141
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:31,441
Is it smeared all over the place?

142
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,746
No... actually...

143
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:35,181
Actually...

144
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,636
It's not there.

145
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,475
Th-There's nothing there.

146
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:40,420
She's...

147
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,518
...a girl.

148
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:42,419
What about it?

149
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:45,889
She's only a baby,
but still she's a-a girl...

150
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:49,199
So I'm worried if I can change her
without permission.

151
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:51,232
You have great manners, Donggu.

152
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:52,563
What a gentleman.

153
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,422
-What are you talking about?
-What I'm saying is...

154
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:57,737
Stop saying nonsense
and just change the diaper!

155
00:08:58,521 --> 00:08:59,706
I will change it, all right!

156
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,033
Sorry.

157
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:08,792
Wet wipes.

158
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,330
-Wet wipes!
-Wet wipes!

159
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:12,544
Hurry up!

160
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:13,934
Give... Give me one!

161
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:15,132
-Give me one.
-Wet wipes!

162
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,990
Give me more! More!

163
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,157
-Here.
-More!

164
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,181
Diaper. Diaper!

165
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,129
-Diaper!
-Here you go.

166
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:32,534
Okay. I did it.

167
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:33,864
Good job.

168
00:09:34,338 --> 00:09:35,171
Well...

169
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:37,677
That was nothing.

170
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:44,817
Wet wipes.

171
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,197
Wet wipes!

172
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:50,063
Baby...

173
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:54,334
I fed you formula and changed your diaper.

174
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:56,596
Why are you still crying?

175
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,618
Let's just take her to the police.

176
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:01,688
What if her parents
just went out for a moment?

177
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:03,475
Yeah, let's wait for her
till the end of the day.

178
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:05,368
It'll be tougher for the baby
if we take her to the police.

179
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:06,428
She's so noisy.

180
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:09,067
No guests and no water...

181
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,734
On top of that, we've got a baby.

182
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,325
The universe is telling me to die.

183
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,026
Ouch, my back!

184
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:18,188
Jeez, my back!

185
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:24,527
Hey, she stopped crying.

186
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:26,893
-Right?
-That's cool.

187
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:29,984
That's much better.

188
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:34,686
-What?
-Come on.

189
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,752
Why is she crying again?

190
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,835
Do the thing you just did.

191
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:40,873
-Stand up.
-I just did...

192
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,364
I just stood up and...

193
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:44,764
I bent my back and bent my knees.

194
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:49,185
Donggu! Stay exactly like that.

195
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,473
-Keep doing it.
-I have to keep doing this?

196
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:52,575
That's the only way to stop her crying.

197
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:54,618
I can't keep doing this.

198
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:55,889
Then let's switch places.

199
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:57,187
I'm exhausted.

200
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:58,109
Goodness me!

201
00:10:58,435 --> 00:10:59,370
Would you look at the time.

202
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,421
I have to shoot a movie today. Bye.

203
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,336
Hold it. Isn't it in the afternoon?

204
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:06,366
I'm shooting with
the great actor Park Sungwoong.

205
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,971
I have to go early to practice.

206
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,170
Have fun. Bye.

207
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:13,673
Wait... You're leaving way too early!

208
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:16,809
Dusik.

209
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:19,894
I have to go to a part-time job.
Have fun, Donggu.

210
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,428
What part-time job?

211
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,179
At the convenient store!

212
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,946
-Wait! Wait!
-Good luck.

213
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:27,053
You can't leave me alone with her!
Bong Dusik!

214
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:30,587
This is not happening...

215
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:32,051
This is not happening...

216
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:37,961
Hello?

217
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,299
Hi, Sua. What's up?

218
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:40,933
Something important?

219
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:43,412
Right now?

220
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:44,684
Very nice.

221
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:45,805
Very good.

222
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:47,540
Okay.

223
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:49,773
Okay, very nice.

224
00:11:49,863 --> 00:11:50,782
Okay.

225
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:51,854
Smile.

226
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:54,278
Last one.

227
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,053
Okay.

228
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,367
-Good job, Sua.
-Thank you.

229
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,566
"[Yuhan Bank] Ms. Min Sua, you have
overdue loan payments of 12,316,340 won."

230
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:19,961
Sua. I'm here.

231
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,290
Hi, Donggu.

232
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:24,272
-Who is this?
-Oh...

233
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,364
Actually...I woke up this morning
and found her in my room.

234
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:28,574
So, a guest...

235
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:30,234
Never mind.

236
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:31,640
-It's a long story.
-Good luck.

237
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:32,785
Thanks.

238
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,786
Sua.

239
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,189
You're the only thing I live for.

240
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:38,327
-What did you want to tell me?
-Oh.

241
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:39,901
Let's break up.

242
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:42,907
What?

243
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,776
B-Break up?

244
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,891
What are you talking about?

245
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:48,568
How should I put this...

246
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:49,793
Let's just break up.

247
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:52,018
Why?

248
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:52,944
What's the reason?

249
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:55,308
I need three days to list all the reasons.

250
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,364
Let's just break up.

251
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:57,676
Tell me the reasons!

252
00:12:57,764 --> 00:12:59,972
I'll listen to them for three days,
for a year!

253
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,893
Really?

254
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,353
All right then.

255
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:04,177
First, you're too immature.

256
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:06,026
Second, you're incompetent.

257
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:07,747
Third, you don't have a future.

258
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,582
Fourth, you're... Fifth...

259
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,213
Sixth... Seventh... Eighty-second...

260
00:13:12,302 --> 00:13:14,663
Eighty-ninth, your hairstyle sucks.

261
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:17,719
Ninetieth, it's so annoying
when you make noises when you eat.

262
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:19,784
-Ninety-first, you're...
-Stop!

263
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:22,339
I got it, so stop it.

264
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:27,044
Wow, how did you put up with me
for this long?

265
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,262
Did you even love me?

266
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:29,242
Love?

267
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:30,710
I did.

268
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:33,501
But I need more than love.

269
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,919
You appear really shallow right now.

270
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:38,718
I'm not shallow.
It's just that you're really immature.

271
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:41,183
Anyway, I had fun.

272
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,055
I'll give this back.

273
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:46,396
Fine. Let's break up.

274
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:49,801
I don't need that stupid ring,
so you can throw it away.

275
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:52,599
Thank you so much for going out
with a pathetic guy like me.

276
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:55,084
I hope you live a happy life!

277
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:11,217
I wish you all the best!

278
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,442
-Do well today.
-Hey!

279
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:15,862
Hey, Jungi.

280
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:19,880
I begged the director to get this job,
so don't screw it up.

281
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:21,465
I won't.

282
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,212
You'll wire my pay
right after the shoot, right?

283
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,565
I will.

284
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:29,870
-You haven't said hello to Sungwoong?
-No.

285
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,353
Let's go. I'll introduce you.

286
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:32,372
Sure.

287
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,249
Sungwoong. This is Lee Jungi,
he's shooting a scene with you.

288
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,218
"Heartless Man"

289
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:48,236
Hello.

290
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:52,862
It is truly an honor to work with my idol.

291
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,771
Pardon?

292
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:05,398
What?

293
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:10,414
Sorry?

294
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:16,348
S-Sungwoong!

295
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,308
Why did he leave?

296
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:21,917
-Did I do something wrong?
-You're so slow-witted.

297
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:25,291
He complemented you on your eyes.
Why didn't you say thank you?

298
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:28,991
-When did he say that?
-He did like this.

299
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,402
That's what he meant?

300
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:32,587
Why didn't he just say it?

301
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:34,448
He doesn't talk much.

302
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:37,952
He hates people who don't understand him,
so be careful.

303
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,616
-Got it?
-Okay...

304
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,671
See you later.

305
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:45,347
He doesn't speak but hates it
when people don't understand him?

306
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:46,679
That's ridiculous.

307
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,008
Is that charisma?

308
00:15:53,022 --> 00:15:55,944
He's so charismatic.

309
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:04,010
Ready!

310
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:05,898
Action!

311
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:10,875
Cut!

312
00:16:10,964 --> 00:16:12,371
What's wrong, Sungwoong?

313
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:22,044
M-Me?

314
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:27,126
What?

315
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:34,110
What...

316
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,438
Where are you going?

317
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:43,412
Sungwoong!

318
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:47,506
Assistant director...

319
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:50,463
-Who hired him?
-Sorry, sir.

320
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:52,678
Darn it.

321
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:55,356
Come on...

322
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:58,447
Get your head on straight.

323
00:16:58,536 --> 00:16:59,579
What did I do?

324
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:02,677
Sungwoong told you to take a step back.
How could you not get that?

325
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,290
He told me to step backward?

326
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,458
-When?
-He kept doing this with his fingers.

327
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,180
He said it three times like this.

328
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:10,961
That means I have nice eyes, doesn't it?

329
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:12,815
It's different for different situations.

330
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:14,767
You're so slow.

331
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:17,570
Sungwoong!

332
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,707
Can't he use his words?

333
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:25,211
This is driving me crazy.

334
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:31,317
Darn it.

335
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,999
Why can't he give me my wages in advance?

336
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,621
What am I going to tell Donggu?

337
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,938
Geez.

338
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:43,541
How is this...

339
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:47,032
Jeez, how am I supposed to understand this?

340
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:48,386
Jungi!

341
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,535
Jungi!

342
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:51,128
Jungi, are you going home?

343
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:53,264
Yeah, did you finish work?

344
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:55,127
Yeah. Do you want one?

345
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:57,716
-It's only four days past the expiry date.
-No thanks.

346
00:17:57,897 --> 00:18:00,450
You can have it and live
until you smear poop on the walls.

347
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:03,048
Why are you being so cranky?

348
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,117
Did something happen?

349
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:06,553
Right!

350
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:08,309
You did a scene with
Park Sungwoong, right?

351
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:10,222
How was it? Was he super charismatic?

352
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:12,858
He was charismatic.

353
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:16,111
-But he's weird.
-Why?

354
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,833
He doesn't speak.

355
00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:20,420
But he hates it
when people don't understand him.

356
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:21,343
What?

357
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:24,270
He doesn't speak but hates it
when people don't understand him?

358
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,376
-That doesn't make sense.
-Tell me about it.

359
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:30,158
Look. I'm Park Sungwoong and you're me.

360
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:31,844
We were shooting and he...

361
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,445
He did this. What do you think that means?

362
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,452
-To take a step back?
-How did you know that?

363
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,983
It's obvious.

364
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:41,282
All right, fine.

365
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,327
I was saying hello to him
for the first time.

366
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,538
I told him that it was
an honor to meet him.

367
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:46,619
Then he...

368
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:49,337
He did this.
What do you think that means?

369
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:51,334
-That you have nice eyes?
-Does everyone know that?

370
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,595
I'm the only one who didn't know?

371
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:54,425
I was just taking a guess.

372
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:56,008
-You're so slow-witted.
-What?

373
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,659
How are you going to succeed as an actor?

374
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:58,771
How did he know...

375
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,170
Darn finger...!

376
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,961
We're home.

377
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:11,249
The baby's mother?

378
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:13,446
Are you sick?

379
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:15,453
What's wrong?

380
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:16,722
Did something happen?

381
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,740
Is not speaking a popular trend?

382
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,308
Would you just speak, you jerk!

383
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,030
I broke up with Sua.

384
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:26,281
What?

385
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:27,933
Why all of a sudden?
What's the reason?

386
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:28,965
Reasons?

387
00:19:29,054 --> 00:19:30,492
I stopped her at ninetieth reason.

388
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,214
If I hadn't,
she would've talked all night.

389
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:33,830
Why? You're a great guy.

390
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,021
Isn't it obvious?

391
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,411
Sua is getting older,
so her family must want her to marry.

392
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,846
But look at him.

393
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:42,923
He doesn't have a stable job.

394
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:45,024
He has no money nor a future.

395
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:48,176
On top of that, this guesthouse is
this close to going out of business.

396
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:49,755
I would've dumped him if I were Sua.

397
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:55,869
For poor guys like us dating
is a luxury we can't afford.

398
00:19:57,724 --> 00:20:00,866
So, you're feeling down
because a girl dumped you?

399
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:03,508
You didn't cling to her
like a pathetic loser, right?

400
00:20:03,597 --> 00:20:05,056
Of course not!

401
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:07,749
When she said she wanted to break up,
I said fine!

402
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:10,353
Then I took off my ring
and threw it on the floor!

403
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,687
Why did you throw it away?

404
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,717
It's gold. Gold is expensive these days.

405
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:15,876
Yeah, we could've paid
the water bill with that.

406
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,117
You never think things through!

407
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:20,082
-Shall we go and get it?
-Are you crazy?

408
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:22,582
I'm not doing that.
My pride doesn't allow it.

409
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,862
Keep your pride in here
while we go and look for the ring.

410
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,102
-Let's go.
-Be quiet!

411
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,958
-Did you ask for money?
-Tuna-mayo gimbap is the best.

412
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:31,303
Tuna... You can have it all.

413
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:33,977
I had no expectations of you
in the first place.

414
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:34,967
Donggu.

415
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:38,879
I'll get paid after the shooting tomorrow.
Don't worry.

416
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:41,140
What should we do with her?

417
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:42,658
We can't wait forever.

418
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:43,584
I don't know.

419
00:20:43,672 --> 00:20:45,350
Let's call the police. I'm exhausted.

420
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:47,601
Let's wait for a while longer.

421
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:49,610
Yeah, let's wait till tomorrow.

422
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:52,618
-Poor baby.
-Then you take care of her.

423
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:55,392
I have a headache from
shaking my body all day.

424
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:57,173
It's your turn. Untie this.

425
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:59,368
-Take a step forward.
-Okay.

426
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:00,290
This thing.

427
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:02,919
Untie...

428
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:04,359
Where are you going?

429
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:06,184
Come back here!

430
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:07,947
Come back here!

431
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:09,721
Open it! You locked it?!

432
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,686
I'll break this door!

433
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:13,717
I really can break it! I'm mad!

434
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,463
I'm going to get a hammer!

435
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:16,976
You think I won't do it?

436
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:20,236
Come here!

437
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:22,165
Open it!

438
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:23,086
Hey!

439
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,056
This tiny baby is killing me.

440
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,985
These jerks...

441
00:21:40,074 --> 00:21:41,073
They left already?

442
00:21:41,162 --> 00:21:42,778
They've become so diligent.

443
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:44,180
They've become better people.

444
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,363
My goodness.

445
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:47,730
Hello?

446
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:49,517
Yes, this is he.

447
00:21:49,854 --> 00:21:50,709
What?

448
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:51,840
The electric bill?

449
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:53,340
By the end of this week?

450
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:56,464
We can't run our business
without water and electricity.

451
00:21:56,552 --> 00:21:57,775
We're a guesthouse...

452
00:21:57,863 --> 00:21:59,196
Hello?

453
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,453
They hung up.

454
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,046
They hung up again!

455
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,221
What am I going to do?

456
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:06,907
Help me, please.

457
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:15,968
Gee... No, I can't do that.

458
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:24,575
No, I have my pride.

459
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:36,951
Donggu, what are you doing here?

460
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,267
Sua isn't here yet.

461
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,543
Oh, then can I wait for her inside?

462
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:42,528
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

463
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:43,695
By the way...

464
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:46,147
Did you clean the studio yesterday?

465
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:47,252
No, we didn't.

466
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:48,582
-Why do you ask?
-It's nothing.

467
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:12,424
What are you doing here?

468
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:15,547
Hey, you're here.

469
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,721
Oh, actually...

470
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:21,157
-Actually...
-I thought I'd never see you again.

471
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,334
What are you doing here?

472
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:24,306
Oh, actually...

473
00:23:24,395 --> 00:23:26,179
So, um...

474
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:27,802
-I wanted to ask you something.
-What is it?

475
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:29,842
So, the question is...

476
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:33,065
When do you think THAAD will get resolved?

477
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,384
You came here to ask me that?

478
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:40,658
Yes.

479
00:23:40,904 --> 00:23:43,592
We did break up, but we're both Koreans,

480
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:45,774
so we're allowed to discuss
diplomatic issues, right?

481
00:23:46,262 --> 00:23:47,095
Right?

482
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,550
Right?

483
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:52,631
So, Trump...

484
00:23:53,078 --> 00:23:56,068
They should have a good chat...

485
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:04,752
Wait.

486
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:06,314
Why? What?

487
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,711
Don't we have to solve
the North Korean nuclear issue first?

488
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:15,087
I think we need to enforce sanctions
and request the six-party talks.

489
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:18,453
Yes.

490
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:19,873
That's a good idea.

491
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:22,293
But would that be the best option?

492
00:24:27,354 --> 00:24:30,355
-What do you think?
-Politicians will think of that.

493
00:24:30,444 --> 00:24:31,277
I'm going.

494
00:24:32,052 --> 00:24:33,109
What was that?

495
00:24:36,187 --> 00:24:38,385
Geez, Kang Donggu.
He's always leaving stuff behind.

496
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,214
Donggu! Kang Donggu!

497
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,820
"Jewelry and Watches Store"

498
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:50,848
-Welcome.
-Hello.

499
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:52,759
-You buy gold rings, right?
-Yes.

500
00:24:52,848 --> 00:24:55,611
I do buy them, but what are you selling?

501
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:57,074
This one.

502
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:01,728
Oh, not this...

503
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:02,668
This one.

504
00:25:04,578 --> 00:25:07,289
How much can I get? It's gold, 18K.

505
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:10,650
You were there for that?

506
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:15,722
Sua.

507
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,801
You should've told me.

508
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,213
I would've looked for it with you.

509
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:22,611
The truth is...

510
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:26,242
Our water got cut off and
the electricity will get cut off soon.

511
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,189
Really?

512
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:28,327
Then...

513
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:30,962
You can take mine too.

514
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:35,516
You left your phone.

515
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:40,105
Sua. Sua!

516
00:25:58,482 --> 00:26:01,112
Sungwoong, you're so funny.

517
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,180
Can't believe that happened to you.

518
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:09,802
That's hilarious.

519
00:26:12,768 --> 00:26:13,889
Hello, Sungwoong.

520
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,912
About yesterday,

521
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:22,346
I'm sorry for not understanding you.

522
00:26:22,435 --> 00:26:23,553
Please forgive me.

523
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,292
Thank you for forgiving me.

524
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,124
You understood him this time.

525
00:26:50,213 --> 00:26:52,765
-Now you're adjusting.
-Really?

526
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:55,546
-I really got it right?
-Yeah.

527
00:26:55,635 --> 00:26:58,357
He did this and patted you
on the shoulder.

528
00:26:58,446 --> 00:27:01,445
Make sure not to offend him anymore
and do a good job.

529
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:04,389
Okay.

530
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:07,669
I did it.

531
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:22,001
My goodness. I'm sorry.

532
00:27:24,103 --> 00:27:25,894
Cut! Okay.

533
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:28,430
Good job, everyone!

534
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:32,238
Sungwoong, great job today.

535
00:27:37,373 --> 00:27:39,430
Thank you for the compliment.

536
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:40,826
I'll work harder.

537
00:27:48,772 --> 00:27:50,357
What? Really?

538
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:54,956
Yes, I got it.

539
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:56,411
Everyone!

540
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,249
Sungwoong will treat us
to Korean beef today!

541
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:05,997
-Park Sungwoong!
-Park Sungwoong!

542
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:07,498
-Park Sungwoong!
-Park Sungwoong!

543
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,218
-Park Sungwoong!
-Park Sungwoong!

544
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:10,941
-Park Sungwoong!
-Park Sungwoong!

545
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:24,594
Sungwoong, could you propose a toast?

546
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:32,918
-Thank you for the meal!
-...the meal!

547
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:35,681
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

548
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,764
It's been a while.
My stomach is loving this beef!

549
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:57,813
Sungwoong, thanks for buying us dinner.

550
00:29:04,031 --> 00:29:05,243
What's wrong?

551
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:12,584
Sorry?

552
00:29:14,697 --> 00:29:15,808
What do you mean...

553
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:06,986
I'm home.

554
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,551
Did something happen?
What's wrong with him?

555
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,150
Jungi can never work
in the movie industry ever again.

556
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:22,410
-Why?
-Sungwoong said there's rice on his face,

557
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:23,855
but he kissed him instead.

558
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:26,388
Why did you do that?

559
00:30:27,017 --> 00:30:28,703
He had a weird look in his eyes.

560
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:30,589
It was misleading.

561
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:33,977
I thought he wanted me
to kiss him for the beef.

562
00:30:35,287 --> 00:30:36,160
What's wrong with you?

563
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,505
Sua caught him selling their couple ring.

564
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:41,608
What?

565
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:47,278
She was looking at me
with contempt in her eyes.

566
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:48,831
Jeez...

567
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,156
Then we can pay the water bill?

568
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:52,762
I didn't sell the ring.

569
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,448
I've hit rock bottom,

570
00:30:54,537 --> 00:30:56,030
but I couldn't sell our couple ring.

571
00:30:56,118 --> 00:30:59,209
We can't get customers without water.

572
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:00,725
Tell me about it.

573
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:06,856
We sure are pathetic.

574
00:31:07,581 --> 00:31:11,873
Three guys couldn't make
400,000 won in two days.

575
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:20,412
Let's...

576
00:31:21,342 --> 00:31:22,281
...just...

577
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,449
...give up.

578
00:31:25,447 --> 00:31:26,457
"Give up"?

579
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:27,268
What?

580
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:28,780
This guesthouse.

581
00:31:28,868 --> 00:31:30,221
Let's close it down.

582
00:31:30,493 --> 00:31:32,753
But we were going to make
lots of money and make a movie.

583
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:35,069
-We have to go to Cannes together.
-Wake up, you brat.

584
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:36,819
We can't make a movie.

585
00:31:37,192 --> 00:31:38,730
We'd be lucky if we don't starve to death.

586
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,926
Yeah, I don't think this will work out.

587
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,769
Let's give up the guesthouse
and the movie.

588
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:46,989
Let's just give it all up.

589
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:50,157
I give up on everything I do in life.

590
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,210
What kind of a life is this?

591
00:31:53,654 --> 00:31:54,960
What do we do about her?

592
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:56,656
What else.

593
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:58,145
We should take her to the police.

594
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:00,187
Her parents gave her up.
We can't raise her.

595
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:02,703
Shouldn't we feed her one last time?

596
00:32:02,822 --> 00:32:04,578
We're out of formula.

597
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:11,030
Darn it.

598
00:32:18,594 --> 00:32:20,081
Is this her formula?

599
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:24,590
It's so expensive.

600
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,064
Give me your money.

601
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:27,739
-Let's see.
-Excuse me.

602
00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:28,680
Yes?

603
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,016
That's ours.

604
00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:32,369
We were going to buy that.
We just put it down for a second.

605
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:34,811
Whoever picks it up, gets to buy it.

606
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,584
No, this is ours.

607
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:38,770
What are you doing? Let it go.

608
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:41,536
What's the problem?

609
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,800
What's going on?

610
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:46,085
They keep insisting that this is theirs.

611
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,735
We only put it down for a second.

612
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,506
This is not a big deal.

613
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,593
You should give up.

614
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,514
What?

615
00:32:58,764 --> 00:32:59,655
Give it up?

616
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:01,358
Why?

617
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:03,212
Why do we have to give it up?

618
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:04,566
Well, because...

619
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:06,787
We're doing our best
but nothing works out for us!

620
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:10,371
We worked hard
but the universe is not helping us!

621
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,568
We renovated the whole place
with our own sweat and tears.

622
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:16,628
It was our last hope!

623
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:19,409
What are you talking about...

624
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,329
We gave up on everything else
but we can't give up on this formula!

625
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:23,376
Understand?

626
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,522
Give it to me!

627
00:33:25,532 --> 00:33:26,481
I won't give up!

628
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:27,842
I won't give up!

629
00:34:06,673 --> 00:34:08,947
Did you see the lady's face?

630
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:11,749
Her face went pale.

631
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:12,684
I know right.

632
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,727
She picked the wrong people to mess with.

633
00:34:17,743 --> 00:34:20,792
It's the perfect weather to drink formula.

634
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:23,528
A warm bottle of formula.

635
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:27,699
What are you doing?

636
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:29,242
Are you shooting a movie?

637
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:31,469
What? It's fun.

638
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:33,705
You always ruin the fun.

639
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,945
You really do.

640
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:39,211
Baby, you saw us fighting
for your formula, right?

641
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,094
-Don't forget that.
-That's right.

642
00:34:42,183 --> 00:34:44,703
Don't ever forget it, okay?

643
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,097
Yeah, don't forget.

644
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:48,386
-Oh my god.
-Would you look at that.

645
00:34:48,475 --> 00:34:49,413
-Oh my god.
-So cute.

646
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:50,607
-So cute.
-He's so cute.

647
00:34:50,696 --> 00:34:51,633
Oh my god.

648
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,916
Yeah, cute baby.

649
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:55,497
Thank you. Thank you.

650
00:34:57,455 --> 00:35:00,246
-You're touring?
-Yes, we're traveling together.

651
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:01,717
Where are you going now?

652
00:35:01,806 --> 00:35:04,909
Actually, we're just looking for
a place to sleep.

653
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:06,120
-Sleep?
-They're sleepy?

654
00:35:06,209 --> 00:35:07,305
Sleep.

655
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:09,509
We have a guesthouse.

656
00:35:09,598 --> 00:35:10,796
Really?

657
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:13,506
Do you happen to have an empty room?

658
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:15,379
Yeah, room, room, room, room.

659
00:35:15,467 --> 00:35:18,202
We have many rooms. Many rooms.

660
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:20,101
So, you want rooms?

661
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,145
Yeah, sure.

662
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:22,080
Tonight?

663
00:35:23,228 --> 00:35:25,023
Tonight! Let's go!

664
00:35:25,112 --> 00:35:27,716
Let's go! We have guests!

665
00:35:27,986 --> 00:35:29,995
Okay. Follow me.

666
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:31,927
They're here.

667
00:35:33,462 --> 00:35:34,773
Let's go!

668
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:37,711
Guests?

669
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:39,139
Guests.

670
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,212
-Guests!
-Guests.

671
00:35:51,554 --> 00:35:53,006
I can't believe this is happening.

672
00:35:53,095 --> 00:35:54,890
-This isn't a dream, right?
-It's amazing.

673
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:57,020
This is the most guests we've had
since we opened.

674
00:35:57,108 --> 00:36:01,025
-The baby is a lucky charm.
-Totally.

675
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,021
Now we can pay the water bill
and the electricity bill.

676
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,108
If we keep going like this,
we'll pay back our loan and shoot a movie.

677
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:09,263
Are you happy?

678
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:12,016
-Didn't you want to give up?
-Well, that's...

679
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:15,745
I mean let's give up giving up.

680
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,290
Get out of my way.

681
00:36:18,606 --> 00:36:20,106
Look at him.

682
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,072
Yes, you did.

683
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:31,598
Is my little princess feeling happy?

684
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,484
You like me that much?

685
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:36,861
Do you have to talk like that?

686
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:41,232
Does Donggu hate the way I talk?

687
00:36:42,423 --> 00:36:44,678
-Stop it.
-Shut up.

688
00:36:45,388 --> 00:36:47,010
Is Donggu angry?

689
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:49,289
I'm so scared.

690
00:36:49,377 --> 00:36:50,970
Hide me.

691
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:51,996
You're a devil.

692
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,395
I said stop it!

693
00:36:57,163 --> 00:36:58,615
Don't shout.

694
00:36:58,747 --> 00:37:00,318
You made her cry.

695
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:04,318
Wait, maybe she's hungry.

696
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:06,958
-Where's the formula?
-I put it in the kitchen.

697
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:09,236
Princess, one moment please.

698
00:37:09,324 --> 00:37:11,396
We'll get your dinner.

699
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:13,944
Come here.

700
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:15,166
-Come here.
-Hey, stop it.

701
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,075
By the way...

702
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:26,795
...did her parents really abandon her?

703
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:29,408
How could they abandon
such a precious baby?

704
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:31,109
They must have had their reasons.

705
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:33,377
What if they never come back?

706
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:35,253
Then we'll raise her.

707
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:36,803
She dragged all those customers in.

708
00:37:36,892 --> 00:37:39,090
I'm worried her mother
might come back for her.

709
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,401
-We can't raise her.
-Whatever.

710
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,628
Let's think about that later.

711
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:46,231
Dinner for our lucky charm.

712
00:37:48,007 --> 00:37:50,156
Princess, it's time to eat...

713
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,337
Where is she?

714
00:37:53,303 --> 00:37:55,791
Hey! A thief!

715
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:57,375
-What?
-Who was it?

716
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:03,657
Stop!

717
00:38:08,357 --> 00:38:09,363
Catch that guy!

718
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:35,179
Stop right there!

719
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:36,266
Come here!

720
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:37,549
-Come here!
-Jungi!

721
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:39,772
Stop!

722
00:38:44,052 --> 00:38:45,723
-Why did you stop?
-Go that way!

723
00:39:05,378 --> 00:39:07,401
-Are you okay?
-Get him.

724
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,483
-Ouch. It hurts.
-Let's go.

725
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:10,982
-Let's go.
-Wait.

726
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:12,050
-We lost her.
-Just go.

727
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,442
You run so well.

728
00:39:19,063 --> 00:39:21,011
You're dead. Let's see your face.

729
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:25,078
Gosh...

730
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,547
You didn't get hurt, did you?

731
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:29,623
I'm Lee Jungi.

732
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,805
This is a bit...

733
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:42,378
I'm sorry, Seol.

734
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:45,333
Mommy's so sorry.

735
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,765
I'm so sorry. I'll never do that again.

736
00:39:49,025 --> 00:39:50,198
I'm sorry.

737
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,441
Seol, I'm so sorry.

738
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,363
I'm sorry.

739
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:55,361
Her name is Seol?

740
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:59,630
If you're going to cry like that,
you shouldn't have abandoned her.

741
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:02,949
That's too harsh.

742
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,175
It's been tough, hasn't it?

743
00:40:04,442 --> 00:40:05,624
You can cry on my shoulder.

744
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:08,847
This is not the time for flirting.

745
00:40:08,936 --> 00:40:10,280
I didn't do anything.

746
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:11,630
Stop it.

747
00:40:11,882 --> 00:40:14,330
Why did you leave your baby here?

748
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:15,252
Oh, right.

749
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:18,411
Where's her father?

750
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,480
Her father.

751
00:40:21,651 --> 00:40:23,738
-Where do you live?
-Where?

752
00:40:25,412 --> 00:40:27,262
Stop crying and say something.

753
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:29,836
So we can take you home or something.

754
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:32,964
You punk! I'm sure she has the reasons.

755
00:40:36,614 --> 00:40:38,054
I'm so sorry for everything.

756
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:39,301
I'll leave now.

757
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:40,297
Right now?

758
00:40:40,386 --> 00:40:41,384
Do you have a place to go?

759
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:44,687
You can't leave with a baby
this late at night.

760
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,944
You should spend the night here.

761
00:40:47,397 --> 00:40:48,832
Spend the night here? What are you doing?

762
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:51,193
-We don't have a spare room.
-She can sleep in Seojin's room.

763
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,466
She'll be studying all night
at the library anyway.

764
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:55,800
No, I don't want to trouble you anymore.

765
00:40:55,925 --> 00:40:58,517
No, it's fine. Spend the night here.

766
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:01,350
And don't mind this guy.

767
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:04,712
He's cranky because he was dumped
by his girlfriend.

768
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:05,871
I didn't get dumped.

769
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,925
We broke up amicably.

770
00:41:08,014 --> 00:41:10,114
And I have no feelings for Sua now.

771
00:41:11,278 --> 00:41:13,040
Why did you bring that up!

772
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,681
You didn't have to shout at me!

773
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,792
-Donggu!
-Stop it.

774
00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:22,426
It's all right. Don't mind him.

775
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,081
Come with me. It's fine.

776
00:41:24,203 --> 00:41:26,434
Relax. Slowly.

777
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:24,593
Sleepy. Sleepy.

778
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,344
I need to sleep.

779
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:28,161
I need to sleep.

780
00:42:29,823 --> 00:42:31,474
I need to sleep.

781
00:42:43,525 --> 00:42:44,599
What the hell?

782
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:45,563
Who are you?

783
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:48,938
-Are you a thief?
-No, I'm...

784
00:42:50,176 --> 00:42:51,756
What is that?

785
00:42:51,846 --> 00:42:53,457
-What was it?!
-Seojin! What's wrong?

786
00:42:53,546 --> 00:42:55,483
-What is it?
-What's wrong?

787
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:57,106
-What is it?!
-A thief!

788
00:42:57,195 --> 00:42:58,037
There's a thief...

789
00:42:58,126 --> 00:42:58,977
....over there!

790
00:43:03,154 --> 00:43:04,057
Jeez...

791
00:43:04,146 --> 00:43:06,475
Stop making a fuss.

792
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:08,535
Yuna, are you okay?

793
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:10,629
-She must have scared you right?
-Who's she?

794
00:43:10,918 --> 00:43:12,769
-You know her?
-Yeah.

795
00:43:12,914 --> 00:43:14,893
She's Yuna. She came in last night...

796
00:43:14,982 --> 00:43:16,840
Chewbacca, nice...

797
00:43:17,204 --> 00:43:19,121
You're a woman now.

798
00:43:19,669 --> 00:43:20,502
What?

799
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:21,810
Why you...

800
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:24,335
Get out. Now!

801
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,030
Oh, I see...

802
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,355
You should've called me
to let me know.

803
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:36,013
Little sister, we're not close enough
to call for stuff like this.

804
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:37,433
You're right.

805
00:43:37,522 --> 00:43:39,041
Sorry, it's all my fault.

806
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,405
No, it's all right.

807
00:43:40,507 --> 00:43:41,850
Sorry for calling you a thief.

808
00:43:41,939 --> 00:43:43,337
It's late.

809
00:43:43,522 --> 00:43:45,779
You can share the bed with Yuna tonight.

810
00:43:45,868 --> 00:43:47,782
-In my bed?
-She can't sleep in my bed.

811
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:50,593
Donggu, you know that I can't sleep
with another person in the bed.

812
00:43:50,682 --> 00:43:53,286
I already told them she can't stay
but these two insisted.

813
00:43:53,379 --> 00:43:55,560
-There are other rooms.
-They're all full.

814
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,858
We don't have any empty room left.

815
00:43:56,947 --> 00:43:58,543
All the rooms are full?
How did that happen?

816
00:43:58,631 --> 00:44:01,762
It's a long story. Just suck it up
and let her sleep in your bed.

817
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,904
I can't sleep with a stranger in my bed...

818
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:06,846
It's not a big deal.

819
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,452
You can sleep on the floor then!

820
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,496
You woke us up in the middle of the night.

821
00:44:10,585 --> 00:44:11,578
You clean this up!

822
00:44:13,129 --> 00:44:14,700
Don't sleep here. Go to your room.

823
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:16,130
Get up. Come on.

824
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:20,157
If you're sleepy then
go to your room and sleep.

825
00:44:55,932 --> 00:44:57,094
Oh my gosh!

826
00:44:59,681 --> 00:45:01,605
Why didn't you wake me up?

827
00:45:01,694 --> 00:45:03,869
You were sleeping so deeply.

828
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:07,371
Sorry, I have bad sleeping habits.

829
00:45:07,851 --> 00:45:10,469
Did I do something bad?

830
00:45:10,557 --> 00:45:13,179
No, you just farted a few times.

831
00:45:13,268 --> 00:45:14,772
It didn't smell that bad.

832
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:28,192
Enjoy your breakfast.

833
00:45:30,797 --> 00:45:32,696
Your toast is bleeding.

834
00:45:35,001 --> 00:45:37,919
Cover your mouth in front of the guests.
Don't yawn like that.

835
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:40,596
I couldn't sleep
because it was uncomfortable.

836
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:44,343
-What was uncomfortable?
-Sleeping with a stranger.

837
00:45:44,438 --> 00:45:48,145
Whenever I fell asleep, the baby started
crying and the lady started snoring.

838
00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:51,145
Plus, she makes people uncomfortable.

839
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:52,750
On top of that...

840
00:45:53,206 --> 00:45:54,309
What?

841
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:02,862
Thank you for letting me stay the night.

842
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:05,036
-I'll get going now.
-You said you have no where to go.

843
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:07,237
-You can stay a few days.
-What?

844
00:46:07,326 --> 00:46:08,753
She has no place to go.

845
00:46:08,841 --> 00:46:10,716
-You have no compassion.
-What?

846
00:46:10,804 --> 00:46:12,623
No, I don't want to trouble you anymore.

847
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:14,605
Then have some breakfast at least.

848
00:46:14,694 --> 00:46:17,349
No, I'm fine. I'm not hungry...

849
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:24,381
-Sit down. I'll make you a toast.
-It sounded like thunder.

850
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:42,821
Slow down.

851
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:44,747
Drink some milk too.

852
00:46:45,288 --> 00:46:48,739
Dusik is taking care of the baby,
so don't worry.

853
00:46:49,046 --> 00:46:50,355
I'll bring you some more.

854
00:46:55,008 --> 00:46:57,559
-What do we do?
-What's wrong? Why is she crying?

855
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,402
I don' know. She suddenly started crying
and I can't get her to stop.

856
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,886
Oh, look at the time.

857
00:47:03,548 --> 00:47:04,788
Thank you.

858
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:07,932
You're hungry, aren't you?
I'm sorry.

859
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,684
I'll give you breakfast.

860
00:47:13,671 --> 00:47:14,765
More toasts.

861
00:47:18,756 --> 00:47:20,556
-Oh my god.
-What was that?

862
00:47:20,645 --> 00:47:21,405
What did I just see?

863
00:47:21,494 --> 00:47:22,553
-Did you see it?
-No.

864
00:47:22,642 --> 00:47:25,409
See. I told you she makes
people feel uncomfortable.

865
00:47:28,226 --> 00:47:30,147
Why is she not eating? That's strange.

866
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:32,360
W-What's wrong?

867
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,852
She can't suck my milk.

868
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:36,927
Shall we get her some formula?

869
00:47:36,994 --> 00:47:37,941
No.

870
00:47:38,268 --> 00:47:41,862
I have to breastfeed her
because her immune system is weak.

871
00:47:43,165 --> 00:47:44,763
Maybe I have to pump the milk.

872
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:46,417
Pump...?

873
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,710
I don't have a breast pump.

874
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:50,195
What's a breast pump?

875
00:47:50,283 --> 00:47:51,523
-What is it?
-How should I know?

876
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:53,203
-Ask her.
-Excuse me.

877
00:47:53,712 --> 00:47:56,707
-What's a breast pump?
-It's...

878
00:47:57,687 --> 00:47:59,113
It's a machine that pumps breast milk.

879
00:47:59,202 --> 00:48:02,361
When the baby can't suck well,
I have to pump the milk.

880
00:48:02,774 --> 00:48:05,710
Where can we buy one?

881
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,182
I think...

882
00:48:07,775 --> 00:48:09,554
They sell it at baby stores.

883
00:48:09,643 --> 00:48:13,655
But it's quite expensive
and I don't have any money.

884
00:48:13,743 --> 00:48:16,001
It's okay. We'll buy it.
We'll buy it for you.

885
00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:18,354
So, please just stay still.

886
00:48:19,785 --> 00:48:21,097
-I'll go.
-I'm coming with you.

887
00:48:21,186 --> 00:48:22,856
I have to go to a part-time job.

888
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:24,388
Guys!

889
00:48:24,923 --> 00:48:26,934
Take me too.

890
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,035
We can't all go when guests are here.

891
00:48:29,124 --> 00:48:30,741
-You stay here.
-Yes. You stay.

892
00:48:30,901 --> 00:48:32,307
-Sorry.
-No...

893
00:48:32,556 --> 00:48:34,103
I'm uncomfortable around her.

894
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:36,457
-Take me with you.
-Look after the place, Chewbacca.

895
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:38,148
Jungi!

896
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:50,506
It is true about mothers only caring
about her baby.

897
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,019
How could she lift up her shirt
in front of us...

898
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:55,920
I was so surprised.

899
00:48:56,009 --> 00:48:57,393
Tell me about it.

900
00:48:58,202 --> 00:49:00,137
There are all kinds of stuff here.

901
00:49:00,665 --> 00:49:02,781
What does a breast pump look like?

902
00:49:04,038 --> 00:49:05,009
They sell clothes too.

903
00:49:07,436 --> 00:49:08,269
What's this?

904
00:49:08,753 --> 00:49:09,700
There's nothing here.

905
00:49:14,628 --> 00:49:15,817
Hello.

906
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:18,789
You're looking at a nursing outfit.

907
00:49:18,877 --> 00:49:19,782
What is a nursing outfit?

908
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:24,488
There are times when the baby cries
for milk when they're outside.

909
00:49:24,577 --> 00:49:28,449
But there are so many people around
so the mother can't feed the baby.

910
00:49:28,538 --> 00:49:30,333
But she doesn't have to worry about that.

911
00:49:30,422 --> 00:49:33,633
She can just lift the zipper
and take out her breast.

912
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:37,503
Then she can breastfeed
without worrying about people staring.

913
00:49:37,592 --> 00:49:41,109
It's a breast pocket if you will.

914
00:49:41,882 --> 00:49:43,347
Breast... I see...

915
00:49:43,728 --> 00:49:45,240
A breast pocket?

916
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:47,960
A lot of interesting stuff.

917
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:50,719
What's this?

918
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:53,390
Hello.

919
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:56,755
What you're looking at is a nursing pad.

920
00:49:56,844 --> 00:49:58,018
What is a nursing pad?

921
00:49:58,107 --> 00:50:01,092
The baby sucks the mother's milk
and gets full.

922
00:50:01,181 --> 00:50:02,533
Then what will the baby do?

923
00:50:02,622 --> 00:50:04,505
The baby will take her mouth
off the breast.

924
00:50:04,593 --> 00:50:06,490
Then what will happen?

925
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:11,377
The milk has no where to go
and it will gush out like a fountain.

926
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,564
When that happens
just put this pad on the breast.

927
00:50:14,653 --> 00:50:16,922
Then she can relax.

928
00:50:17,707 --> 00:50:22,396
It's a milk shield if you will.

929
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:31,455
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

930
00:50:31,543 --> 00:50:34,083
I'm here to buy a breast pump.

931
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,130
It's so awkward that I want to die.

932
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,612
I have to say something.

933
00:50:57,818 --> 00:51:00,490
Gosh, your baby has such dark eyebrows.

934
00:51:00,818 --> 00:51:02,667
Look at his chubby cheeks.

935
00:51:02,756 --> 00:51:04,757
He's like a general, a little prince.

936
00:51:04,846 --> 00:51:05,792
She's a girl.

937
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:08,498
I see.

938
00:51:08,748 --> 00:51:11,006
She has that boyish charm.

939
00:51:11,094 --> 00:51:13,142
Girl crush is the trend, right?

940
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:15,121
Her father must adore her.

941
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:16,574
We broke up.

942
00:51:19,014 --> 00:51:20,132
I see.

943
00:51:22,228 --> 00:51:25,579
She'll do fine without her father.

944
00:51:25,668 --> 00:51:28,279
Her grandfather and grandmother
will love her twice as much.

945
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:31,056
They both passed away.

946
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:33,094
When I was two years old.

947
00:51:34,747 --> 00:51:35,580
In a fire.

948
00:51:44,907 --> 00:51:47,820
Come home now. Now!

949
00:51:49,545 --> 00:51:54,464
There's a manual breast pump
and an automatic breast pump.

950
00:51:54,552 --> 00:51:59,832
With the manual breast pump,
place the funnel on the breast,

951
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:02,267
and pull this handle.

952
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:04,046
Shoop. Shoop.

953
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:05,006
Shoop.

954
00:52:05,095 --> 00:52:05,950
Shoop.

955
00:52:06,053 --> 00:52:08,471
That's how it pumps breast milk.

956
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,816
With the automatic, just press one button,

957
00:52:11,905 --> 00:52:13,709
it'll pump 40 to 50 times per minute.

958
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:16,053
Shoop. Shoop. Shoop. Shoop.

959
00:52:16,142 --> 00:52:18,204
Shoop. Shoop. Shoop. Shoop.

960
00:52:18,293 --> 00:52:19,570
Shoop. Shoop. Shoop. Shoop.

961
00:52:19,658 --> 00:52:21,164
Shoop. Shoop. Shoop. Shoop.

962
00:52:21,253 --> 00:52:22,495
Okay, stop!

963
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:24,793
Just give us one. Please stop explaining.

964
00:52:24,882 --> 00:52:26,546
Please...

965
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:31,921
That was a real culture shock.

966
00:52:32,381 --> 00:52:33,214
Right?

967
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,674
Should we take something
to help calm us down?

968
00:52:39,502 --> 00:52:40,524
Yeah.

969
00:52:41,447 --> 00:52:42,280
Hey.

970
00:52:42,964 --> 00:52:43,994
That's Sua.

971
00:52:45,742 --> 00:52:46,933
Donggu, that's Sua.

972
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:49,867
Donggu?

973
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,059
Kang Dong...

974
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:53,859
What are you doing over there?

975
00:52:54,824 --> 00:52:56,188
What? Oh...

976
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:57,920
Here's a pillar.

977
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,877
It's sturdy.

978
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:03,519
Of course a pillar is sturdy!
Would it be wobbly instead?

979
00:53:05,534 --> 00:53:06,417
Are you...

980
00:53:06,757 --> 00:53:08,903
-Sua!
-What are you doing?

981
00:53:08,992 --> 00:53:10,917
Don't do that. Don't!

982
00:53:11,005 --> 00:53:11,922
What's wrong with you?

983
00:53:12,152 --> 00:53:14,525
-Don't do that.
-Jeez...

984
00:53:14,951 --> 00:53:18,157
If you can't get over her,
go and beg on your knees.

985
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,562
Why would I beg?
I didn't do anything wrong.

986
00:53:20,651 --> 00:53:23,197
Getting caught while trying to sell
your ring isn't something to applaud.

987
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:24,866
That's...

988
00:53:25,137 --> 00:53:27,331
I told you not to talk about that.

989
00:53:28,355 --> 00:53:30,826
-You're obviously hung up on her.
-No.

990
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:32,209
No, I'm not!

991
00:53:33,807 --> 00:53:36,397
All right. You keep your stupid pride,

992
00:53:36,485 --> 00:53:38,813
and live with regret forever.

993
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:40,149
Sua went that way.

994
00:53:40,238 --> 00:53:42,290
You can head that way. Bye.

995
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:44,525
-See you.
-Wait for me.

996
00:53:44,613 --> 00:53:45,816
Fine, go!

997
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,691
Shoot.

998
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,169
What the heck.

999
00:54:12,614 --> 00:54:14,284
Pride isn't that important.

1000
00:54:14,556 --> 00:54:16,345
Fine, I'll get on my knees.

1001
00:54:16,803 --> 00:54:18,729
It'll be better than
living with regret forever.

1002
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,021
Listen, Sua...

1003
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:31,943
Sua!

1004
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:36,148
Yunseok, why are you so late?

1005
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:37,074
I'm sorry.

1006
00:54:37,163 --> 00:54:40,015
I'll treat you to
delicious pasta, instead.

1007
00:54:40,618 --> 00:54:41,451
Let's go.

1008
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,051
-What's wrong with him?
-What is it?

1009
00:54:47,466 --> 00:54:48,850
He collapsed.

1010
00:54:49,193 --> 00:54:50,208
One moment.

1011
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:53,205
Excuse me, are you okay?

1012
00:54:55,206 --> 00:54:56,293
Are you feeling sick?

1013
00:54:58,067 --> 00:54:58,900
Hey.

1014
00:55:01,557 --> 00:55:02,390
Hey.

1015
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,568
Lift up your head.

1016
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:05,743
Hey.

1017
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,444
Jungi!

1018
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:11,708
Jungi!

1019
00:55:12,845 --> 00:55:14,347
What took you so long!

1020
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,299
Get off of me. I can't breathe!

1021
00:55:16,994 --> 00:55:18,448
It was so awkward!

1022
00:55:18,537 --> 00:55:21,166
I almost went crazy
because of this breast pump.

1023
00:55:21,254 --> 00:55:23,018
Why? Did something happen?

1024
00:55:23,106 --> 00:55:25,392
Don't even ask.
I don't even want to think about it.

1025
00:55:25,481 --> 00:55:27,139
-So...
-Be quiet. Sit down.

1026
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:28,892
Sit down.

1027
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,062
Yuna, I brought a breast pump.

1028
00:55:32,467 --> 00:55:34,661
Thank you. Sorry for troubling you.

1029
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:35,938
Don't worry about it.

1030
00:55:36,027 --> 00:55:38,669
Seol must be hungry. Let's feed her.

1031
00:55:38,764 --> 00:55:40,554
Seol, are you hungry?

1032
00:55:40,642 --> 00:55:42,338
Let's eat.

1033
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,009
So this is how it looks.

1034
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:49,546
Jeez!

1035
00:55:52,122 --> 00:55:53,775
Why does she keep doing that?

1036
00:55:53,864 --> 00:55:56,753
I told you she makes people uncomfortable.

1037
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:00,180
This is strange.

1038
00:56:00,406 --> 00:56:02,997
What... What's wrong?

1039
00:56:03,086 --> 00:56:04,812
My milk isn't coming out.

1040
00:56:05,478 --> 00:56:08,411
-My milk ducts must be clogged.
-Milk duct?

1041
00:56:08,793 --> 00:56:09,626
Milk ducts?

1042
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:11,648
-What's that?
-Well...

1043
00:56:11,737 --> 00:56:13,677
They carry milk to the nipple.

1044
00:56:13,765 --> 00:56:15,259
I think they're clogged.

1045
00:56:15,348 --> 00:56:17,008
How do we unclog it?

1046
00:56:17,097 --> 00:56:19,590
A massage will unclog it.

1047
00:56:19,783 --> 00:56:22,079
But the masseuse is expensive, so...

1048
00:56:22,168 --> 00:56:24,924
I'll bring a masseuse
if I have to take out a loan.

1049
00:56:25,013 --> 00:56:27,657
Please stop moving. Please.

1050
00:56:31,364 --> 00:56:32,197
What?

1051
00:56:32,805 --> 00:56:34,224
100,000 won for one massage?

1052
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:36,181
It is expensive.

1053
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:37,813
You can send us a masseuse right away?

1054
00:56:38,118 --> 00:56:38,951
What?

1055
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:40,781
That's not good for us.

1056
00:56:41,718 --> 00:56:43,897
-Okay. Thanks.
-They can't come?

1057
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:46,548
They're all booked.

1058
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:48,410
What do we do?

1059
00:56:48,499 --> 00:56:49,934
It's fine.

1060
00:56:52,736 --> 00:56:55,475
-What's wrong?
-My breasts are full. It's painful.

1061
00:56:55,563 --> 00:56:56,821
What do we do?

1062
00:57:00,512 --> 00:57:01,527
What?

1063
00:57:02,274 --> 00:57:03,397
Why are you looking at me?

1064
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:04,772
-You do it.
-What?

1065
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:07,035
-What are you talking about?
-Massage.

1066
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:08,611
Massage her.

1067
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,899
-You just need to knead them.
-Are you crazy?

1068
00:57:11,997 --> 00:57:13,902
You want me to massage
a stranger's breasts?

1069
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:16,041
I can't do it, although I'd like to.

1070
00:57:16,152 --> 00:57:18,116
If I can, I want to become a masseuse.

1071
00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:20,472
-Shall I just do it?
-Are you crazy?

1072
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:22,386
That's why I'm telling you to do it.

1073
00:57:22,554 --> 00:57:24,710
Yuna is in pain.
Don't you feel sorry for her?

1074
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:25,632
Ouch.

1075
00:57:25,933 --> 00:57:27,708
Of course I feel bad for her, but...

1076
00:57:27,796 --> 00:57:31,424
But still, I can't...
massage a stranger's breasts...

1077
00:57:31,962 --> 00:57:33,784
No, I'm really okay...

1078
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:37,339
Ouch, it hurts.

1079
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:43,187
This is ridiculous!

1080
00:57:45,517 --> 00:57:46,350
Are you all right?

1081
00:57:51,947 --> 00:57:53,774
Hey, are you all right?

1082
00:57:55,078 --> 00:57:58,309
Jeez... Just leave.

1083
00:57:58,397 --> 00:57:59,753
Please just leave.

1084
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:02,279
Yunseok, let's go.

1085
00:58:03,204 --> 00:58:04,420
We can't do that.

1086
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,889
We can't leave a sick person alone.

1087
00:58:07,047 --> 00:58:10,940
Please just leave me. Go!

1088
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:15,553
Over here.

1089
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:21,910
-Did you call us?
-He suddenly collapsed.

1090
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:23,984
He can't seem to get up.

1091
00:58:24,073 --> 00:58:25,518
I think he hurt his face.

1092
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:26,457
I see.

1093
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:30,774
Sir, can you hear me?

1094
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:32,142
Try to get up.

1095
00:58:33,585 --> 00:58:35,279
This won't do.

1096
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:36,890
We'll have to lift him up.

1097
00:58:36,979 --> 00:58:37,812
Grab him.

1098
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,056
One, two, three!

1099
00:58:44,138 --> 00:58:45,323
Sir, relax.

1100
00:58:45,411 --> 00:58:48,338
One more time. One, two, three!

1101
00:58:51,451 --> 00:58:52,761
The body's going stiff.

1102
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,103
Call a bigger hospital.

1103
00:58:54,192 --> 00:58:55,665
One moment.

1104
00:58:56,348 --> 00:58:59,334
Okay, I'll get up.

1105
00:58:59,457 --> 00:59:01,107
Can you hear me?

1106
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:04,940
This is so humiliating.

1107
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,390
Let's run!

1108
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:38,782
Sir.

1109
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:43,480
Are you okay?

1110
00:59:44,843 --> 00:59:47,984
Oh no! He must have hurt his head.

1111
01:00:25,001 --> 01:00:26,089
Well...

1112
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:28,050
Let's begin.

1113
01:00:32,005 --> 01:00:33,195
I'm exhausted.

1114
01:00:34,654 --> 01:00:36,970
When can I quit this part-time job?

1115
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:43,459
I must be the only CEO
who does a part-time job to pay rent.

1116
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:49,893
What's this?

1117
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:00,549
Oh my goodness!

1118
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,633
What happened? Did it work?

1119
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,644
Can't you see?

1120
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:15,130
It was like oil spurting
from an oil field.

1121
01:01:15,946 --> 01:01:16,779
That's a relief.

1122
01:01:17,606 --> 01:01:19,104
Good job.

1123
01:01:19,193 --> 01:01:21,052
I'm so proud of you.

1124
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:23,244
Shut up. Where's the breast pump?

1125
01:01:23,373 --> 01:01:25,567
-She wants it now.
-The pump?

1126
01:01:25,655 --> 01:01:26,983
It was in the living room...

1127
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,458
Is Yuna older than you?

1128
01:01:30,866 --> 01:01:33,612
-You look so much older than her.
-What?

1129
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:36,457
I haven't disciplined you in a while, huh?

1130
01:01:36,586 --> 01:01:38,288
I was only joking. A joke.

1131
01:01:38,376 --> 01:01:40,013
-A joke?
-It was a joke.

1132
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:41,991
-Come here.
-I was joking.

1133
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,000
-I was joking!
-I'll kill you!

1134
01:01:44,803 --> 01:01:46,313
Nice and relaxing.

1135
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:51,919
Hey!

1136
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,668
-You scared me.
-What do you think you're doing!

1137
01:01:54,757 --> 01:01:57,144
-What did I do?
-What?

1138
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,667
-Why did you turn it off?
-Why? Why?

1139
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,210
Do you know what this is?

1140
01:02:02,299 --> 01:02:04,019
Why did you hit me!
Isn't it a massage machine?

1141
01:02:04,108 --> 01:02:05,120
It's not a massage machine!

1142
01:02:05,208 --> 01:02:07,306
It pumps milk out of...

1143
01:02:07,507 --> 01:02:09,281
-You idiot!
-What? It's really nice.

1144
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:10,529
-Try it.
-Try it?

1145
01:02:10,617 --> 01:02:12,462
It's a sacred device.

1146
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,150
Do you know how much it costs?

1147
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,167
"Waikiki"

1148
01:02:18,256 --> 01:02:19,684
You just need to do well.

1149
01:02:22,596 --> 01:02:23,675
What happened to you?

1150
01:02:23,764 --> 01:02:24,615
Did something happen?

1151
01:02:24,704 --> 01:02:26,705
Don't ask. Don't ask.

1152
01:02:30,528 --> 01:02:32,078
Why is it so quiet in here?

1153
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:34,410
-Where are the guests?
-Huh?

1154
01:02:35,078 --> 01:02:36,286
They're having a party on the rooftop.

1155
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,455
I grilled some pork belly
and they went crazy.

1156
01:02:39,207 --> 01:02:41,142
Yeah? Well done.

1157
01:02:43,236 --> 01:02:45,738
-Did that woman and the baby leave?
-Huh?

1158
01:02:46,111 --> 01:02:48,632
Of course. They left.

1159
01:02:49,124 --> 01:02:51,187
Yeah? That's great.

1160
01:02:51,778 --> 01:02:55,324
Doesn't the house feel empty without Seol?

1161
01:02:56,194 --> 01:02:58,526
I wonder if Yuna is doing okay.
She didn't have anywhere to go.

1162
01:02:58,614 --> 01:03:00,330
-I'm worried.
-Me too.

1163
01:03:00,484 --> 01:03:02,576
Yeah, she could've just stayed.

1164
01:03:02,664 --> 01:03:04,948
Donggu, you're worried
about her too, right?

1165
01:03:05,443 --> 01:03:06,276
What's going on?

1166
01:03:06,903 --> 01:03:08,818
You seem suspicious.

1167
01:03:09,064 --> 01:03:11,806
You're hiding something
from me, aren't you?

1168
01:03:11,936 --> 01:03:13,846
-Right?
-No, we're not hiding anything.

1169
01:03:13,935 --> 01:03:15,166
We're not hiding anything.

1170
01:03:15,255 --> 01:03:17,661
-We're not hiding anything.
-Of course not.

1171
01:03:23,206 --> 01:03:24,067
What's that?

1172
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,822
Isn't that the baby crying?

1173
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:28,691
What sound? I didn't hear anything.

1174
01:03:28,779 --> 01:03:30,984
-I didn't hear anything.
-Me neither.

1175
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:37,879
Seojin, I think my ducts
got clogged again.

1176
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,756
Why... Why is she here?

1177
01:03:43,845 --> 01:03:46,064
-You said she left.
-Who?

1178
01:03:46,153 --> 01:03:47,046
Her?

1179
01:03:47,135 --> 01:03:49,434
That's not Yuna. It's someone else.

1180
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,663
Yes, we're coming!

1181
01:03:52,466 --> 01:03:53,484
Oh, really?

1182
01:03:53,852 --> 01:03:54,685
I see...

1183
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,967
Do you take me for a fool?

1184
01:03:57,055 --> 01:03:59,661
-Unbelievable...!
-Donggu. Donggu.

1185
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:01,146
Donggu. Donggu!

1186
01:04:01,382 --> 01:04:03,039
Don't you feel sorry for Yuna?

1187
01:04:03,122 --> 01:04:05,406
We may not have any money
but we have compassion.

1188
01:04:05,494 --> 01:04:06,746
I have neither!

1189
01:04:06,903 --> 01:04:09,059
-Wait!
-Donggu!

1190
01:04:09,147 --> 01:04:10,834
-Donggu!
-Let go of me!

1191
01:04:12,623 --> 01:04:14,094
You guys are idiots!

1192
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:17,227
She's got nowhere to go.
Let her stay, please.

1193
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,601
Yuna, go back inside!

1194
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,502
Go inside!

1195
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:23,093
-It's fine.
-Donggu!

1196
01:04:53,517 --> 01:04:56,560
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1197
01:04:56,649 --> 01:04:59,889
She's going to cause
a huge problem some day.

1198
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,311
Oh no!

1199
01:05:01,887 --> 01:05:02,899
Oh no.

1200
01:05:03,616 --> 01:05:04,428
Oh no!

1201
01:05:04,516 --> 01:05:07,176
I don't like her.
I really don't like her.

1202
01:05:07,264 --> 01:05:08,997
-I'll get this one.
-Who is she?

1203
01:05:09,302 --> 01:05:11,386
-She's my girlfriend.
-Girlfriend?

1204
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:14,811
Korean X-men. It'll be a mega hit.

1205
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,014
If you ruin your costume,
I'm going to fire you.

1206
01:05:20,986 --> 01:05:23,903
You lead such a hard life.

1207
01:05:23,992 --> 01:05:24,856
Chewbacca?

1208
01:05:24,945 --> 01:05:26,356
-Seojin.
-Yuna...

1209
01:05:26,491 --> 01:05:29,769
If I don't shave again in the
afternoon, I grow a full mustache.

1210
01:05:30,434 --> 01:05:32,496
Chewbacca! I'm dying!

1211
01:05:32,585 --> 01:05:34,381
Did you put these
mushrooms in the stew?

1212
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:35,863
Everyone has an upset stomach...

1213
01:05:35,951 --> 01:05:36,693
I'm sorry.

1214
01:05:36,782 --> 01:05:39,787
I can't stand this anymore.
Pack up and leave.

1215
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:41,771
Watch where you are going!

1216
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:43,763
Sua.
