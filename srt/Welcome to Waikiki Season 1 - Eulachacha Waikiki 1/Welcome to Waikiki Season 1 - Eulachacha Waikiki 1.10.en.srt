1
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:03,604
Today...

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,976
...I was moved by you a little bit.

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,982
Stop it.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,873
It was a very important interview
for you, wasn't it?

5
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,034
So...

6
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,112
...you better pass this one.

7
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:22,322
Got it?

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,191
You know something?

9
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,261
When I saw you just now,

10
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:31,064
my heart started beating fast.

11
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,267
I wonder why.

12
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:35,068
Maybe I've gone crazy.

13
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,803
Let me see you.

14
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:39,406
What are you doing?

15
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:41,575
Let me see you.

16
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,577
I don't understand.

17
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:52,986
Why do I think you're great?

18
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:19,580
That startled me!

19
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:21,381
Kang Donggu,

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,649
what are you doing here?

21
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,651
I can't sleep.

22
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,954
Why the long face?

23
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:33,375
I'm thinking about what you said.

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,862
Whether I can handle Yuna's situation.

25
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,099
But no matter how hard I think,
I can't think of an answer.

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,134
I don't know if I can handle it.

27
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,551
Well...

28
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,571
It is not easy.

29
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,642
Do you want to drink soju with me?

30
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:51,011
I was going to ask you to join me
because my life is in the dark too.

31
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:52,212
Yes.

32
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,314
Let's drink.

33
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:56,416
Let's go.

34
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,493
Your shoes.

35
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:10,897
Come on. Keep walking.

36
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,386
-We're almost there.
-Shut up.

37
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,644
-Come on.
-I want to drink more.

38
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:29,449
-It's not that way. It's this way.
-I want to drink more.

39
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,652
I want to drink more!

40
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,332
Oh my gosh!

41
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,424
That hurts! This thing!

42
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,842
Are you okay?

43
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:40,827
What is this...?

44
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:48,910
This is Donggu's camera.

45
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,406
Seojin, what do we do?

46
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,209
We broke Donggu's camera.

47
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,145
What do we do?

48
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,014
Hey. Don't do it.

49
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:04,430
No! No! Don't!

50
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:12,993
I'm dying.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,198
I'm so hung over.

52
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,530
Why did you drink so much?

53
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:22,502
I'm tired. Don't talk to me.

54
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,271
Sua...

55
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,273
You drink too much.

56
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:27,974
Hello?

57
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,977
Yes, Detective.
Did you catch that swindler?

58
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:32,946
Not yet?

59
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,149
Okay.

60
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,454
He always tells me to just wait.

61
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:43,757
They haven't found, Yoonseok,
that Thai speaking swindler?

62
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:44,858
Not yet.

63
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,462
Where the hell is he?

64
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,475
If they find him, I'll kill him.

65
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,632
Don't worry.

66
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,736
They'll find him soon.

67
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:55,936
Dusik, are you okay?

68
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,738
I mean, about Malgeum thing.

69
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:01,942
I'm okay.

70
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,344
It's a good opportunity for her.

71
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,613
It's a good thing.

72
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,907
Plus, I have to start writing
my web novel again,

73
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:11,918
so I don't have time to think about her.

74
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,803
Your web novel?

75
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,009
Didn't you finish it?

76
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:20,193
But my fans want season two
of "President is Bruce Lee".

77
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,886
Season two?

78
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,191
Of American President shooting
palm blasts at aliens?

79
00:04:25,304 --> 00:04:27,291
I was going to take a break,

80
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,171
but I can't ignore my fans' requests.
It's the fate of a writer.

81
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,473
I'm off to my part-time job.

82
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:37,978
Season two?

83
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:49,356
I made pollack soup for your hangovers.

84
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,557
You did?

85
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,563
So refreshing.

86
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,532
Donggu, try some.

87
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,534
Yes, thank you.

88
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:08,909
Are Seojin and Jungi still sleeping?

89
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:10,911
I think they drank a lot last night.

90
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,614
Why do those two always hang out together?

91
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:16,920
They might fall in love.

92
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,634
Fall in love? What?

93
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:21,015
That's disgusting.

94
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:26,092
How dare you put my precious sister,
with someone like him?

95
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,395
-What's bad about Jungi?
-What?

96
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,598
I'm not saying that he's a bad guy.

97
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,536
But I saw him growing up.
He can't date my sister!

98
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,727
Min Sua.

99
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:41,007
Never mention that ever again.
It's gross. Geez.

100
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:44,711
Gosh, my head.

101
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:46,112
What's this?

102
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,111
Why did you two drink last night?
Where? Until what time?

103
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,419
I don't know.

104
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:51,534
Seojin.

105
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,916
What time did we get home?

106
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:55,822
I blacked out. I only remember bits.

107
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,593
I also blacked out.
I only remember bits.

108
00:05:59,682 --> 00:06:00,393
"Blacked out"?

109
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:04,775
So, we started drinking
soju at around 7 PM.

110
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:06,085
Then we ordered beer.

111
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,678
And then, we had noodles with sea snails.
Then we had fish cake soup and rice wine.

112
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,591
We were about to leave,
but the owner gave us free tofu kimchi.

113
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:18,712
-So we ordered another bottle of soju.
-We drank one or two glasses of that.

114
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:25,485
Why?

115
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,320
What did we do...

116
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,231
Wait.

117
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,725
I want to drink more!

118
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,698
What? What is it?

119
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,001
Did something happen between you two?

120
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,872
No, nothing happened.

121
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:46,773
Yes, nothing happened.

122
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,882
I'm going to take a shower.

123
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,777
I'm going to sleep some more.

124
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:15,384
Darn it, it wasn't a dream.

125
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,170
It really happened.

126
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,708
I'm dead if Donggu finds out.

127
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:33,987
You must be crazy!

128
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,488
Why did I do that?

129
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:37,205
Why?

130
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,359
Why did I kiss him?

131
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,593
Why?

132
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:45,865
-Seojin.
-What?

133
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,668
Do you remember the thing
that happened last night?

134
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:52,072
You remember it too?

135
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,974
Of course. How can I not remember that?

136
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,276
How did this happen?

137
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,160
What do we do?

138
00:07:58,248 --> 00:08:00,580
Jungi. Can we just pretend...

139
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:02,365
...it didn't happen?

140
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,366
What?

141
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,352
We can't do that. It's already happened.

142
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,054
We just need to keep it a secret
and don't talk about it.

143
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,457
-What if Donggu finds out?
-What?

144
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:11,474
Donggu?

145
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,695
-He won't find out. He didn't see us.
-Hey!

146
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,465
There's a no secret in this world.

147
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:18,580
Don't say that.

148
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:22,268
There's no witness,
so we just need to keep it a secret.

149
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,685
Maybe you're right.

150
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:27,374
Totally. So...

151
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:32,679
Let's take this secret to our graves.

152
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,950
All right.

153
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,185
I have a bad feeling about this.

154
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,567
I must've been crazy.

155
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:43,456
Why did I kiss him?

156
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:45,458
Darn the alcohol.

157
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,869
Why did I have to break Donggu's camera?

158
00:08:56,798 --> 00:08:57,670
Darn the alcohol.

159
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,673
Darn the alcohol. Darn it! Darn!

160
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,381
The President died fighting
the aliens in season one.

161
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,283
Should I revive him?

162
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:12,285
A zombie.

163
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:16,489
Yes, he becomes a zombie
and fights against the aliens again.

164
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:22,395
President is Bruce Lee is a zombie.

165
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,899
What a great title.

166
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:29,536
-Excuse me, where's that ramyeon?
-Which one?

167
00:09:29,623 --> 00:09:31,838
Ppappai Ttappo Tomyum Thai.

168
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,607
-That ramyeon.
-Ppappai ppoppai... What?

169
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,179
Oh, that Thai ramyeon? It's sold out.

170
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,580
Really?

171
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,382
I really wanted to have it.

172
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,985
Sua has a new boyfriend already?

173
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:48,999
-What does he do?
-He runs a Thai restaurant.

174
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:50,606
Talek kaprik paw.

175
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,392
Tengpit Kai somtam.

176
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,489
Hold on.

177
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:55,528
Ppappai ppoppai...?

178
00:09:57,818 --> 00:09:58,731
Thai.

179
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,840
I'm sure he was Sua's ex-boyfriend.

180
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:16,015
You're dead!

181
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,922
Did someone just pass by?

182
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:20,121
Yes.

183
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:21,454
Who's dead?

184
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:24,951
Donggu, I'm sorry but
I need to go to class.

185
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:27,827
-Can you take care of Seol?
-Sure.

186
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:28,828
Thank you.

187
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:32,532
Seol, Mommy needs to go to class.

188
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,735
-Thanks. See you later.
-Bye.

189
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,237
See you later.

190
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,442
I'll check on the bookings.

191
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:47,714
Who knocked this over?

192
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:52,519
What the...

193
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:53,820
Why is this on the floor?

194
00:10:56,723 --> 00:11:00,326
What is this?
What the hell?

195
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,228
My camera!
What happened to my camera?

196
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:04,631
Who broke my camera?!

197
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,333
You did this, didn't you?

198
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:09,135
It wasn't me.

199
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:11,437
Kang Seojin!

200
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:12,727
It was you, wasn't it?

201
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,040
You did this, didn't you?

202
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,841
What are you talking about?
I didn't even see your camera.

203
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:21,648
Dusik did this.

204
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,051
Hello?

205
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,854
Bong Dusik!
You broke my camera, didn't you?!

206
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:28,864
What?

207
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,149
You didn't?

208
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,157
Hang up!

209
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,855
Who broke my camera?!

210
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:39,265
If I catch the culprit,
I'll fold them in half!

211
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,271
My camera! No!

212
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,874
Who did this?!

213
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:50,476
It won't fit.

214
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:58,100
Why the hell did I kiss Jungi?

215
00:11:58,189 --> 00:11:58,999
I must be crazy.

216
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:02,589
But Jungi did look cool
at the interview room.

217
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:03,799
But still...

218
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:04,991
Why?

219
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:05,992
Why?

220
00:12:07,162 --> 00:12:08,361
I don't know.

221
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,164
-Seojin...
-You startled me!

222
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,666
-Knock first.
-Sorry.

223
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,463
I need to talk to you.

224
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:18,338
What is it?

225
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:23,443
Seojin.

226
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:27,313
Let's just tell Donggu what happened
last night.

227
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,147
What?

228
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:31,451
Why do you insist we tell him that?

229
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,171
You saw him just now.

230
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,356
I'm scared he's going to be super mad
when he finds out later.

231
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,757
I'm so anxious.

232
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,674
But why do we have to
tell him what happened?

233
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:43,973
Seojin, no secret lasts forever.

234
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:48,249
If he finds out later, he will kill us.

235
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:49,736
You know what he's like.

236
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,939
Let's just come clean.

237
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,756
All right, let's say we come clean to him.

238
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,660
Do you think Donggu will be okay with it?

239
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:03,461
As soon as we tell him, we're dead.

240
00:13:06,174 --> 00:13:07,755
Why did I...

241
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:10,441
Just erase it from your memory.

242
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,860
If we keep our mouths shut,
no one will find out.

243
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,662
Okay.

244
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:28,941
Why does he want to tell my brother
that we kissed? Is he out of his mind?

245
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,857
Maybe he won't find out
if we keep our mouths shut.

246
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,549
She's unbelievable.

247
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,186
How could she not tell him
about the camera that he loves?

248
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,123
I'm scared I might end up
dating someone like her.

249
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:51,898
Now that you got a footage of him,
you can catch him, right?

250
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,534
I have to wait again?

251
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,103
How long do I have to...

252
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,237
Hello?

253
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,139
Detective?

254
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,711
How long do I have to wait?

255
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,013
This won't do.

256
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:10,316
What are you doing?

257
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,820
I'm going to wait for him here.

258
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,621
Why? Can't I?

259
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:20,026
No, it's just that when he
sees you, won't he run away?

260
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,427
Will he?

261
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:23,996
What should I do?

262
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:27,994
This is so tacky.

263
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:31,404
-This uniform sucks.
-It's a uniform. Just wear it.

264
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,722
How long are you going to stay here?

265
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,008
Until I catch that guy.

266
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:38,611
-Why? Can't I?
-No. It's fine.

267
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,755
I'm going to organize some things.
Watch the counter.

268
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:42,822
Okay.

269
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,726
-Hello.
-A can of Coke.

270
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,729
-And grab a chocolate bar too.
-What?

271
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,831
Why should I do that?

272
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:01,334
A customer is telling you to bring it.
Shut up and do it.

273
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,435
What did you say?

274
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,938
You're being rude.

275
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,731
Are you offended?

276
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,942
You can't talk to a customer like that.
You're just a part-timer.

277
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,477
What did you say?

278
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,165
How dare you.

279
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:15,648
Sua, stop.

280
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,683
I'll bring it for you.

281
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,685
That's better.

282
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:31,564
-Here you go, sir.
-Sure.

283
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,270
Just go with it.

284
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:38,104
Take this.

285
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:45,812
Excuse me.

286
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:48,815
Why did you throw it on the floor?
The bin is over there.

287
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:53,920
You get paid to clean the floor too.

288
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:55,321
What did you say?

289
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,613
How dare you.

290
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:59,091
Stop it.

291
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,594
It's her first day.

292
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,796
Goodness.

293
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,915
I'll let this slide, okay?

294
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,233
Do your job properly.

295
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:08,501
What the...

296
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,902
Thank you.

297
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,204
Bye.

298
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,914
-What's the matter with you?
-What? He was being rude.

299
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,446
He owns the restaurant near by.

300
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,140
It's best to not get
into a fight with him.

301
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:25,136
Gosh! What a pushover.

302
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,452
My goodness.

303
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:35,261
Yuna.

304
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,364
Hello.

305
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:40,666
Wait a second.

306
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,437
You sound really down.
Is something wrong?

307
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:50,676
I feel like I'm not following the class,
as well as everyone else.

308
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,678
Don't worry.

309
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,646
You can catch up with some practice.

310
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,284
I can't practice anywhere else
except in the class.

311
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,987
Yuna, are you free today?

312
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:03,858
Come in.

313
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,091
Thank you.

314
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:09,762
Why did you bring me to a bakery?

315
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:11,680
Hello, boss.

316
00:17:12,674 --> 00:17:14,634
This is your bakery?

317
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,434
Yes.

318
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,236
Yuna, come this way.

319
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:19,238
What?

320
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:32,527
What is this place?

321
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,329
This is my private workroom.

322
00:17:34,443 --> 00:17:38,437
I develop recipes in here.
And I take secret naps in here.

323
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,825
I see.

324
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,261
Yuna.

325
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,550
Do you want to try making the
doughnuts we made in the class today?

326
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:46,566
I'll teach you.

327
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,867
Really?

328
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:51,637
This camera is so expensive.

329
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,575
I don't even have money to
eat, how can I buy this?

330
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,280
Donggu.

331
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,083
Where have you been?

332
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,885
The camera repair shop.

333
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,388
But they can't fix it.

334
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:14,688
My poor Olivia.

335
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:15,895
Olivia?

336
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:18,798
Who's Olivia?

337
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:20,600
It's her name.

338
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,804
I loved her more than my own sister.

339
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:29,089
I bought her with the money I earned
from working at a construction site.

340
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:33,913
I cleaned her and loved her every day.

341
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:37,316
I've grown fond of her.

342
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:40,824
Donggu.

343
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,289
Are you crying?

344
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,292
You know...

345
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:51,097
I feel empty and sad
as if I've lost my little sister.

346
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,935
Olivia...

347
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,771
Olivia...

348
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:06,646
When are they going to
publish the interview results?

349
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:11,517
Seol, maybe I didn't make it.

350
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,720
Hope that doesn't happen.

351
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:19,199
Seojin.

352
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:21,046
You scared me. What is it this time?

353
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:24,196
I really think we should
tell him the truth.

354
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,698
What?

355
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:29,098
Donggu is crying. He's crying right now.

356
00:19:29,197 --> 00:19:31,203
What? Why is he crying?

357
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:34,106
What does that have to do with us?

358
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,510
Kang Seojin, don't you have a conscience?

359
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,413
Why are you talking about conscience?

360
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,615
Don't you feel guilty?

361
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,216
Don't you feel sorry for Donggu?

362
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:46,995
Why should I feel sorry for Donggu
over this matter?

363
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:49,321
You're unbelievable.

364
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,724
I can't even see Donggu
straight in his face.

365
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:58,311
Jungi, it was just a drunken mistake.
We don't need to feel guilty about it.

366
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,033
You are unbelievable.

367
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,936
Don't you feel ashamed in front of Seol?

368
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:07,236
I had no idea you were so shameless.

369
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:08,841
Shameless?

370
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:14,920
Jungi, you're too worked up right now.
Get some sleep.

371
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:18,551
Then you'll feel better. Okay?

372
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:20,953
Get some sleep.

373
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,556
It'll be okay, right?

374
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,552
Why did you laugh?

375
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,550
Your novel is ridiculous.

376
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:37,527
The President of America turns
into a zombie and shoots palm blasts?

377
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:38,738
It doesn't make sense.

378
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:43,109
I've explained in season one that
the president is Bruce Lee incarnated.

379
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,643
It doesn't make sense.

380
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,746
Even I could write stuff like this.

381
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,545
Sua!

382
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,951
How long are you going to stay here?

383
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,553
Until I catch that guy.

384
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:57,456
But my shift is almost over.

385
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,141
Get changed.

386
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,693
"Fat Ugly Restaurant Owner"

387
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:05,464
Yes, sir?

388
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,766
It's me.

389
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,368
Pour hot water into five cup ramyeon
and bring them to the restaurant.

390
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,336
Sorry?

391
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:12,930
I have to go home now, so...

392
00:21:13,018 --> 00:21:14,940
Then you can deliver them
on your way home.

393
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,425
-Hurry.
-What?

394
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,944
Hello? Hello?

395
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,516
Why? What is it?

396
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,118
I'm not his errand boy.

397
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,524
Sir, I brought five cup ramyeons.

398
00:21:31,621 --> 00:21:34,627
You're late. Hurry next time.

399
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:35,828
How much is it?

400
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:37,922
4,500 won.

401
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:53,279
-Bye.
-Yes.

402
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:54,780
Let's go Sua.

403
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,258
Dusik.

404
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,620
Let's eat some pork.

405
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,837
My treat.

406
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:05,311
Pork? All of a sudden? Let's just leave...

407
00:22:12,894 --> 00:22:14,004
Hey.

408
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:16,896
What?

409
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:19,004
You want to eat pork? What do you want?

410
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,607
Bring us two servings of pork belly
and a bottle of soda.

411
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,610
And grill them in the kitchen.
I can't be bothered to grill them myself.

412
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,413
-What?
-Why? You don't want to?

413
00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:29,815
Just do what the customer tells you.

414
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,218
You can't speak to me like that.

415
00:22:32,345 --> 00:22:34,220
Why? Do you feel offended?

416
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,222
Customers are entitled
to talk down to you, right?

417
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,223
What?

418
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,033
Why did you throw that on the floor?

419
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:47,548
Cleaning fee is included
in the bill, right?

420
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,535
You said so.

421
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,649
This wench, have you lost your mind?

422
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:52,805
What did you say?

423
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,506
"Wench"?

424
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:59,011
Did you just call a customer a wench?

425
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:03,415
Is this how you treat your customers?!

426
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,521
What are you doing?

427
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:05,442
What?

428
00:23:05,614 --> 00:23:07,421
-What are you doing?
-What?

429
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,421
Did you just hit me?

430
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:11,724
You hit a vulnerable woman?

431
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,950
No, I just grabbed your shoulder...

432
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:14,960
What?

433
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,701
Look.
Look, it's dangling.

434
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,204
-I think my arm's broken.
-All of a sudden?

435
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,106
Dusik, call the police.

436
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:28,908
-Police...?
-It hurts so much.

437
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:31,631
Don't do that. Stop.

438
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,416
Mommy!

439
00:23:44,312 --> 00:23:46,558
Why are you just standing there? Go ahead.

440
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:52,956
Gosh, it's hurting again.
Dusik, call the police.

441
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,617
I'm... I'm sorry.

442
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:57,736
I think you forgot something.

443
00:23:58,419 --> 00:23:59,520
You forgot to bow.

444
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,707
I apologize, miss.

445
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:05,244
Apologize to him too.

446
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,014
Go on.

447
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,116
I apologize, sir.

448
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,487
-Sorry for everything I've done.
-Okay.

449
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,024
-Look here, sir.
-Yes.

450
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,225
He may not be that smart,

451
00:24:21,314 --> 00:24:25,631
but his parents had a party
when he was born.

452
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:32,438
He's not your slave that you can
talk down to or order around.

453
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,643
If I catch you mistreating him again,

454
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:40,746
I don't even know what I'll do then.

455
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:41,947
Got it?

456
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,048
Yes.

457
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:46,552
How's your shoulder?

458
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,459
All better.

459
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,762
Your employees can share
my hospital bill as tips.

460
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,364
Dusik, let's go.

461
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:09,241
Bye.

462
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,243
Sua, that was amazing.

463
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,945
You're incredible.

464
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,447
My stress is all gone thanks to you.

465
00:25:16,044 --> 00:25:21,253
So, when you see a bully,
do something about it.

466
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,944
If you let them,
they think their behavior is okay.

467
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,025
That makes you a real push over.

468
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,426
Got it.

469
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:31,530
My bag is so heavy.

470
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,600
Hey, hold my bag.

471
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:38,103
-What?
-Carry my bag for me.

472
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,805
It's heavy. Take it.

473
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:42,808
My arm hurts!

474
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,712
I'm hungry after putting on that show.

475
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:49,014
Dusik, get me some tteokbokki.

476
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:52,117
-What?
-What are you waiting for? I'm hungry.

477
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:56,314
-I'm so hungry.
-Oh, okay...

478
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:57,726
Tteokbokki...

479
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,224
Tteokbokki...

480
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,126
Wait.

481
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:05,132
Sua, I think you're ordering me around.

482
00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:05,931
What?

483
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:10,636
I'm asking for a favor as a friend.

484
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:14,940
Go and buy some Tteokbokki.
Hurry up.

485
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:16,842
Move! Move!

486
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:18,644
Move! Move!

487
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:20,212
Okay...

488
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,695
It tastes...

489
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,431
-...good.
-Really?

490
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,333
Yes, it's really good.

491
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,238
I told you you'll get better
with some practice.

492
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:46,939
Thank you so much.

493
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,341
It's all thanks to you.

494
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,744
Yuna. Why do you want
to become a pastry chef?

495
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,246
The thing is...

496
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,949
It's a bit embarrassing to say it.

497
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,752
I make mistakes every day.

498
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,955
I received my first compliment...

499
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,257
...when I baked something.

500
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:09,962
So, I thought this might be the
only thing that I could be good at.

501
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,230
I'm going to study hard and succeed.

502
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,912
And I'll open a big bakery like this.

503
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:21,740
So that Seol could do
anything she wants to do.

504
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,783
I see.

505
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:25,511
Yuna.

506
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,514
Come here and practice
whenever you have time.

507
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,215
I'll tell my staff.

508
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:31,416
Really?

509
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:35,220
Thank you. Thank you so much.

510
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:48,105
What's that noise?

511
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:57,242
What the hell!

512
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,312
It's me.

513
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,007
Olivia.

514
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,916
Olivia?

515
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,018
As in...

516
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,820
...Donggu's camera?

517
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:13,325
Donggu loved me so much.

518
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,261
You ruined everything.

519
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:17,963
It's all your fault.

520
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,765
It's all your fault!

521
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:21,567
I'm sorry.

522
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,770
-I didn't do it on purpose.
-Shut up!

523
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,270
You thought you could
hide the truth forever?

524
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,553
I wanted to tell him,

525
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,574
-but Seojin...
-Don't give me an excuse!

526
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:34,746
In the end, you didn't tell him.

527
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,049
I will never forgive you.

528
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,851
I won't forgive you!

529
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:44,856
Blood... Blood...

530
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,360
I'm sorry!

531
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:53,365
No!

532
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,466
This is wrong.

533
00:28:54,855 --> 00:28:56,568
This is wrong. No!

534
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,172
Seojin, wake up.

535
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:01,773
Seojin, wake up.

536
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,575
What is it this time?

537
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,177
Olivia...

538
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:06,878
Olivia was in my dream.

539
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,480
Who's Olivia?

540
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,681
She cried blood.

541
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:10,882
Donggu...

542
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:13,385
What are you talking about?

543
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,487
I can't live like this.

544
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,056
I have to tell Donggu the truth.

545
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:21,760
Jungi, wait.

546
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,651
What's wrong with you?

547
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,231
Why do you want to tell my brother that?

548
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,933
That's the only way I can survive.

549
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,134
Olivia...

550
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,636
Olivia!

551
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:34,139
Jungi!

552
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,141
What is the matter with him?

553
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,546
Did it hurt a lot?

554
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,854
Donggu, I have something to confess.

555
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,355
What is it?

556
00:29:50,852 --> 00:29:53,946
The truth is, Seojin and I...

557
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:57,562
-We...
-Wait!

558
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,166
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

559
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:02,349
Kang Seojin, stop it!

560
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:04,269
We can't lie to him forever.

561
00:30:04,373 --> 00:30:07,572
How long are you going
to keep lying to your poor brother?

562
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:11,376
If you keep lying,
she'll come for you one day.

563
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:14,780
Olivia... Olivia...

564
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,983
-What the hell are you saying?
-What are you talking about?

565
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,584
Tell me.

566
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:21,086
Kang Seojin,

567
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:22,387
you tell him.

568
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,691
This is the last chance
to ask for forgiveness.

569
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:27,292
Are you insane?

570
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:30,762
Why do we have to tell him that?

571
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,964
Kang Seojin, stop!

572
00:30:35,356 --> 00:30:38,570
Fine. I'll tell him.

573
00:30:39,424 --> 00:30:40,530
Darn it.

574
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:42,040
What are you two doing?

575
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,725
I still don't understand
why we need to tell him.

576
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,044
Go on.

577
00:30:47,837 --> 00:30:48,947
Donggu.

578
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,349
The truth is...

579
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:51,149
Yes.

580
00:30:51,257 --> 00:30:53,355
Last night we had some drinks...

581
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:55,454
-Just a few drinks.
-Yes.

582
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:58,523
Jungi and I...

583
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:02,227
What is it? Just spit it out.

584
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:04,781
We kissed.

585
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,499
We kissed last night. What?

586
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,468
What the hell are you saying?

587
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:11,491
I did what with you?

588
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,301
You weren't talking about the kiss?

589
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:14,988
What the hell are you talking about?

590
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,872
I was talking about us
breaking his camera.

591
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:18,877
What?

592
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:25,154
Wait. Wait.

593
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,886
So, let's recap.

594
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,223
You guys drank together last night.

595
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:35,394
Then you broke my camera...
No! No!

596
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:36,995
Before you did that...

597
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,400
You guys drank together...

598
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,502
...and kissed?

599
00:31:43,604 --> 00:31:44,603
Kiss?

600
00:31:44,883 --> 00:31:46,905
The two of you? Is that true?

601
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:53,612
Donggu, it was a mistake.

602
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:54,808
A mistake?

603
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:56,815
Donggu...

604
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,484
Hey, calm down.

605
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,019
Calm down?

606
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,021
How can I calm down?!

607
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:04,723
Come here.

608
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,325
I said come here!

609
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,464
Come here!

610
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:14,166
Gosh these brats!

611
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,067
What are you two doing in there?!

612
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,560
Open the door! I'll break it down!

613
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,770
I'll break the door! Lee Jungi!

614
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,071
Kang Seojin!

615
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,507
Donggu, please calm down.

616
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:26,978
Calm down. Let's talk rationally.

617
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,380
Open the door!

618
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:32,984
Why is he so quiet?

619
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,286
Did he leave?

620
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,389
I thought he was going to kill us.

621
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,564
Chewbacca.

622
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:42,961
You and I ki...

623
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,664
We did that?

624
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:47,866
Yes.

625
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,969
-You can't tell him that!
-You told me to.

626
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,964
You said it was our last
chance to come clean!

627
00:32:53,095 --> 00:32:55,373
I was talking about the camera thing!

628
00:32:58,449 --> 00:32:59,444
Wait.

629
00:33:00,157 --> 00:33:01,346
Look here.

630
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:02,241
What?

631
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,017
You got me drunk on purpose, didn't you?

632
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,620
What? Are you out of your mind?

633
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,036
-I would never date you.
-Hold it!

634
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,123
Come here!

635
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,125
Stay right there!

636
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,363
Come here!

637
00:33:26,824 --> 00:33:28,340
-Donggu.
-Shut up!

638
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,243
How dare you... With my sister?

639
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:32,711
Ki... Kiss?

640
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,315
My blood pressure.

641
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,019
Donggu, it really was a mistake.

642
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,722
I must've gone crazy
because I was so drunk.

643
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:47,425
I'd never get involved with a guy like him
even when there's no one else.

644
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,127
What? Hey!

645
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,749
I hate a girl like you who has a temper
and grows more facial hair than me.

646
00:33:51,838 --> 00:33:53,765
-What? I'll kill you.
-Shut up.

647
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,966
Shut up!

648
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:58,637
Stay 5 meter away from
each other from now on.

649
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,318
Don't even look at each other.

650
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:03,324
Don't talk to or think about each other.
Got it?

651
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,210
Okay.

652
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,132
Okay.

653
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,215
Get away from each other!

654
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,617
Go to your rooms. Now!

655
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,219
-I'm going.
-Move!

656
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,520
Faster! Stay away from each other!

657
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:23,128
I've got enough problems as it is.

658
00:34:30,265 --> 00:34:31,271
Donggu.

659
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:32,881
I can do that.

660
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,565
It's fine. I'll do it.

661
00:34:34,654 --> 00:34:35,874
Give it to me.

662
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,742
I'll do it.

663
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:40,353
Don't mind me. Go and do your thing.

664
00:34:40,442 --> 00:34:41,146
Okay.

665
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:42,247
Okay then.

666
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,349
Donggu.

667
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,851
Are you mad at me about something?

668
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:50,355
-You don't really talk to me these days.
-What?

669
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,355
That's not true.

670
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:53,758
It's not like that.

671
00:34:54,956 --> 00:34:56,661
That's good.

672
00:34:57,858 --> 00:35:00,365
I'll go downstairs and make dinner.

673
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,167
Go ahead.

674
00:35:21,807 --> 00:35:22,988
What are you doing here?

675
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,389
Nothing.

676
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,791
What's that?

677
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,193
This?

678
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,496
It reduces the swelling. Models use this.

679
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:36,201
My eyes are swollen from all the stakeouts
at the convenient store.

680
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,203
I see.

681
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:44,209
Hey.

682
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,910
That's a big sigh.

683
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:48,380
What's the problem?

684
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,849
Is it because of Yuna?

685
00:35:51,388 --> 00:35:52,484
The thing is...

686
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,654
I told myself I should stop here,

687
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,555
but I can't stop.

688
00:35:58,962 --> 00:35:59,891
Sua.

689
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,595
I like her more and more every day.
What do I do?

690
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:07,065
What do you like so much about her?

691
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,968
I don't know.

692
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,071
I don't know what I like about her.

693
00:36:13,232 --> 00:36:14,906
Or why I like her.

694
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:27,652
"Waikiki"

695
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,834
I don't know what to do.

696
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:33,058
There's no answer.

697
00:36:33,156 --> 00:36:35,504
How can I take
responsibility for anyone...

698
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:38,196
...when I'm filming birthday parties?

699
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:47,638
Can I really become a film director?

700
00:36:50,183 --> 00:36:53,315
Will it just end as a dream?

701
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,694
Donggu.

702
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,081
Long time no see.

703
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:01,680
-Nice to see you.
-Hello, Director.

704
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:02,869
What are you up to these days?

705
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:04,277
Nothing much.

706
00:37:04,546 --> 00:37:05,473
What about you?

707
00:37:05,573 --> 00:37:07,207
I'm shooting a movie.

708
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:08,527
Congratulations.

709
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,626
I'm recruiting people for my team.

710
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:13,123
Would you like to work
in my directing team?

711
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:14,322
Me?

712
00:37:18,107 --> 00:37:19,511
I'll think about it.

713
00:37:20,192 --> 00:37:21,617
-See you.
-Bye.

714
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:31,708
We're losing money.

715
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:33,940
We're going to be homeless at this rate.

716
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:36,435
Exactly. What should we do?
We're in trouble.

717
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:39,829
-I'm home.
-Hey.

718
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:40,844
Hi.

719
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,322
How was your work?

720
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:43,867
Good.

721
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,466
Why did you sigh?

722
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:49,848
Is something wrong?

723
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:54,988
-I met a film director that I worked with.
-Okay.

724
00:37:55,088 --> 00:37:58,805
He offered me a job in his directing team.

725
00:37:58,894 --> 00:38:00,684
So, you're thinking of taking the job?

726
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:02,406
I told him I'll think about it.

727
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:04,406
There's nothing to think about.

728
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:07,107
You'll get minimum pay
and work every night.

729
00:38:07,196 --> 00:38:09,123
And you won't be able to come home.

730
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:10,876
What are you going to do
about the guest house?

731
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:13,861
We've been losing money for months.
We may not be able to pay rent.

732
00:38:13,948 --> 00:38:14,979
You can't do it!

733
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:17,374
I didn't say I was going to do it.
Can't I even think about it?

734
00:38:17,474 --> 00:38:18,839
I am just telling you about it.

735
00:38:26,332 --> 00:38:27,592
Hello?

736
00:38:27,884 --> 00:38:30,180
Yes, this is Kang Seojin speaking.

737
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:32,488
Sorry?

738
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:33,985
Really?

739
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:37,780
Okay. Thank you.

740
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,089
Who was that?

741
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:42,471
Did something happen again?

742
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,569
No, it was the newspaper company
that I had the interview with.

743
00:38:45,674 --> 00:38:47,493
I got the job.

744
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:49,895
I start working there tomorrow.

745
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,982
Really?

746
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:52,296
Yes.

747
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:55,251
Yuna, this isn't a dream, is it?

748
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,347
Why did you pinch me?

749
00:38:59,852 --> 00:39:01,059
It's not a dream.

750
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:03,033
I really got the job?

751
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:05,595
Oh my gosh!

752
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:07,212
Well done!

753
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:08,486
Congratulations.

754
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:09,994
I'm proud of you, little sister.

755
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,487
What's with all the noise?

756
00:39:11,587 --> 00:39:14,066
Seojin got the job
at the newspaper company.

757
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:16,165
-She starts tomorrow.
-Really?

758
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:18,165
Congratulations, Chewbacca!

759
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:19,942
Congratulations, Chewbacca!

760
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:24,176
Stay away from her.
Keep 5 meters between you.

761
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:25,981
Fine.

762
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:27,374
Congratulations, Chewbacca.

763
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:29,367
-Buy us dinner when you get your paycheck.
-Yes.

764
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:39,989
You'll train for three months.

765
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,578
The entertainment team is short on hands.

766
00:39:42,678 --> 00:39:44,380
So, you can start there.

767
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,387
This is your desk.

768
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:49,672
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

769
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,783
Wait, I should introduce myself first.

770
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:02,077
Hello.

771
00:40:02,188 --> 00:40:04,062
I'm the new reporter, Kang Seojin.

772
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:05,710
I look forward to working with you.

773
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,919
Everyone seems busy.

774
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:17,909
Who are you?

775
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:21,901
I'm the new reporter, Kang Seojin.

776
00:40:22,012 --> 00:40:24,338
-Oh, the new trainee?
-Yes.

777
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,603
Nice to meet you.

778
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:28,486
But why aren't you working?

779
00:40:31,114 --> 00:40:34,546
I don't know what I should be doing.

780
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:37,039
I can do any task you give me.

781
00:40:37,136 --> 00:40:38,552
You know the show 'King of Mask Singer'?

782
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,622
The identity of the King hasn't been
revealed for seven weeks.

783
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:44,716
Everyone's running around
trying to figure out who it is.

784
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:46,501
-I see.
-Find out who it is.

785
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:47,912
Pardon?

786
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:51,268
Find out who the "Red-faced Squid" is.

787
00:40:51,394 --> 00:40:52,781
How am I supposed to...

788
00:40:52,865 --> 00:40:55,492
You said you can do anything.

789
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:57,383
So, find out who it is.

790
00:40:57,468 --> 00:41:02,176
And make sure you take a photo
of the face behind the mask.

791
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,587
Got it?

792
00:41:03,872 --> 00:41:04,873
Okay.

793
00:41:09,962 --> 00:41:12,267
How am I supposed to find out who it is?

794
00:41:12,565 --> 00:41:14,770
What do I do?

795
00:41:22,745 --> 00:41:25,545
Excuse me, this is the King
of Mask Singer set, right?

796
00:41:25,668 --> 00:41:27,507
Yes, but who are you?

797
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:30,811
I'm a reporter. I need to go in
to do some interviews.

798
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,805
Wait, you can't go in there.

799
00:41:32,905 --> 00:41:34,817
It's a private recording today.

800
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:37,489
But I'm a reporter. A reporter.

801
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:39,491
You can't go in.

802
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,992
Not even the president can get in.
Just leave.

803
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:43,264
What?

804
00:41:43,365 --> 00:41:45,757
You're obstructing
the people's right to know.

805
00:41:45,857 --> 00:41:47,148
If you keep stopping me,

806
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:48,950
I'll have to use force.

807
00:41:49,564 --> 00:41:50,655
Did you just scoff?

808
00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:52,852
Let go of me.

809
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:54,073
Let go of me.

810
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:56,688
Don't undermine
the people's right to know.

811
00:41:56,788 --> 00:41:58,295
Just leave.

812
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:01,076
Wait. Come on!

813
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,192
Hey!

814
00:42:03,762 --> 00:42:05,260
What do I do?

815
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,576
Are you kidding me with this?

816
00:42:07,676 --> 00:42:09,568
What is this?

817
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:12,302
-Why? You look good.
-I know that voice.

818
00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:13,912
It's perfect for you.

819
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:17,802
This costume sucks.

820
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:18,905
What is that?

821
00:42:20,258 --> 00:42:24,243
-And you said this was a TV drama.
-It is.

822
00:42:24,371 --> 00:42:26,253
-A TV drama for children.
-What?

823
00:42:26,353 --> 00:42:27,857
I can accept that.

824
00:42:27,957 --> 00:42:29,648
But you said I was the counterpart
to the leading role.

825
00:42:29,736 --> 00:42:31,323
You are.

826
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:35,636
It's about Aquaman defeating
you the octopus villain.

827
00:42:35,747 --> 00:42:37,321
That makes you the counterpart of Aquaman.

828
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:38,745
You are a swindler.

829
00:42:38,868 --> 00:42:41,061
-Excuse me.
-What?

830
00:42:41,837 --> 00:42:44,553
I knew it was you.

831
00:42:44,653 --> 00:42:46,855
Why are you in that costume?

832
00:42:46,943 --> 00:42:48,840
-Are you a squid?
-I'm an octopus.

833
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:52,048
Squids don't have big suckers like these.

834
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:54,061
-Why are you here?
-Me?

835
00:42:55,915 --> 00:42:56,928
I'm here to write a story.

836
00:42:57,016 --> 00:42:59,707
Wow, on your first day?

837
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,534
That's awesome, Chewbacca.

838
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:04,095
I told you not to call me Chewbacca.

839
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:06,494
Right, Jungi.

840
00:43:06,594 --> 00:43:09,988
Do you know who the "Red-faced Squid" is?

841
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,892
-"Red-faced Squid"?
-Yes.

842
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:14,054
Of course I don't know.

843
00:43:14,236 --> 00:43:15,046
Why do you ask?

844
00:43:15,146 --> 00:43:17,142
A senior reporter told
me to find out who it is.

845
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,956
That will be tough.

846
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:20,931
They're dead serious about security.

847
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:24,194
-They won't even tell the other producers.
-Really?

848
00:43:24,294 --> 00:43:27,295
I'm supposed to take a picture
of the Red-faced Squid.

849
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:29,798
I don't know who this
"Red-faced Squid" or Octopus is.

850
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:31,946
What are you going to do about this?

851
00:43:32,046 --> 00:43:33,755
Nothing.

852
00:43:33,856 --> 00:43:35,255
You have to shoot the scene
in that costume.

853
00:43:35,355 --> 00:43:38,164
-Let's go.
-Where are you going?

854
00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:39,679
Come on, hurry.

855
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:45,033
He's not helpful at all.

856
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,165
I can't believe I kissed that guy...

857
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:49,637
Darn the alcohol.

858
00:43:49,923 --> 00:43:53,839
How do I find out
who the Red-faced Squid is?

859
00:43:55,753 --> 00:43:57,136
I'm back.

860
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,802
Hey. Donggu, come sit here.

861
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:05,219
Do you have something to say?

862
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:09,047
Someone ordered a video that
documents a baby growing up.

863
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,980
Would you like to take it?

864
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:12,047
Me?

865
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,350
I can direct the whole thing?

866
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:20,775
Yes. You can download all
the materials from the cloud.

867
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:22,876
I don't assign this kind of job to anyone.
Do it well.

868
00:44:22,987 --> 00:44:25,798
I will make a movie-like video.

869
00:44:25,898 --> 00:44:27,992
Be prepared to be amazed.

870
00:44:33,513 --> 00:44:36,861
It's been so long since
I last made a storyboard.

871
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:39,353
It reminds me to the time
when I made short films.

872
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,573
How exciting.

873
00:44:40,768 --> 00:44:43,349
I probably need to take more videos.

874
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:44,957
What should I do?

875
00:44:46,956 --> 00:44:48,662
It's tough guarding the entrance, huh?

876
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:50,761
This is for you.

877
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,502
Thank you.

878
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,811
I'll go inside then.

879
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,898
You can't go in.

880
00:44:56,015 --> 00:44:58,509
Please...

881
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,505
Here. All good?

882
00:45:04,605 --> 00:45:05,782
Thank you.

883
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,698
I'll go inside then.

884
00:45:08,295 --> 00:45:09,089
You can't go in.

885
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,786
Please...

886
00:45:17,773 --> 00:45:19,625
Please...

887
00:45:19,725 --> 00:45:21,142
Please...

888
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:25,523
Come on!

889
00:45:25,728 --> 00:45:28,156
Let me in just this once.

890
00:45:28,256 --> 00:45:31,044
I'll get in trouble
if I go back empty-handed.

891
00:45:31,668 --> 00:45:33,236
I'm begging you.

892
00:45:33,435 --> 00:45:37,006
If you attempt to get inside again,
I'll call the police.

893
00:45:40,796 --> 00:45:42,106
Darn it.

894
00:45:42,528 --> 00:45:44,114
What do I do?

895
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:46,224
Where am I?

896
00:45:46,313 --> 00:45:47,818
Where am I?

897
00:45:47,906 --> 00:45:49,414
Here I am!

898
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,871
It never works.

899
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:00,958
I can't film her like this.

900
00:46:04,642 --> 00:46:05,855
Oh, right.

901
00:46:07,755 --> 00:46:09,060
Who's a happy baby?

902
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,548
Who's a happy baby?

903
00:46:12,196 --> 00:46:13,501
Sorry about this.

904
00:46:13,808 --> 00:46:15,710
I have to film her,
but she wouldn't stop crying.

905
00:46:15,825 --> 00:46:19,205
It's fine. But what are you making?

906
00:46:19,399 --> 00:46:24,684
It's a video that documents her
growing up. I need more footage.

907
00:46:24,888 --> 00:46:26,284
Speaking of which...

908
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:30,663
Yuna, can you help me?

909
00:46:30,945 --> 00:46:31,925
Me?

910
00:46:32,171 --> 00:46:33,845
How can I help?

911
00:46:35,052 --> 00:46:36,355
Donggu.

912
00:46:37,038 --> 00:46:39,047
Do I just hold her like this?

913
00:46:39,147 --> 00:46:41,525
Yes, don't move.

914
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:44,251
But do I have to wear this?

915
00:46:44,355 --> 00:46:44,936
Yes.

916
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,694
Yes, so I can erase you
on my computer later.

917
00:46:47,794 --> 00:46:49,500
I know it's hard, but hang in there.

918
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,401
I'll be quick.

919
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:51,804
Ready.

920
00:46:52,504 --> 00:46:53,492
Action!

921
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:55,903
Nice. Nice.

922
00:46:55,991 --> 00:46:57,035
Good girl.

923
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,112
-Good girl.
-Nice!

924
00:46:59,506 --> 00:47:00,517
Cut!

925
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:02,817
Very nice.

926
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,131
Good job, Yuna.

927
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:05,958
That's it? Are we done?

928
00:47:06,062 --> 00:47:07,644
It's out of focus.

929
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:08,972
Ready.

930
00:47:09,064 --> 00:47:10,048
Action!

931
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,067
Look here. Yuna, lift her up higher.

932
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:14,344
-Like this?
-Yes!

933
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:15,733
Look over here.

934
00:47:15,852 --> 00:47:18,028
Very nice.

935
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:19,038
Look over here.

936
00:47:19,156 --> 00:47:19,964
Cut!

937
00:47:20,229 --> 00:47:21,231
Cut!

938
00:47:23,447 --> 00:47:24,845
Well done.

939
00:47:25,518 --> 00:47:27,437
Yuna, that was great.

940
00:47:33,428 --> 00:47:34,731
Let's film it one more time!

941
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,229
This is so embarrassing.

942
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:38,539
How long do I have to do
these small parts?

943
00:47:40,844 --> 00:47:42,805
Octopus ink gun?

944
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,107
That's a big name for a gun.

945
00:47:46,205 --> 00:47:48,211
I can't even pee
because of these tentacles.

946
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:05,052
-We meet again.
-Yes, hi.

947
00:48:05,152 --> 00:48:07,545
I guess we're meant to be friends.

948
00:48:08,262 --> 00:48:09,074
Your costume...

949
00:48:09,163 --> 00:48:12,370
I got a part in the children's TV drama
'Super Aquaman.'

950
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:13,844
As the Crab Man.

951
00:48:14,745 --> 00:48:15,658
-Really?
-Yes.

952
00:48:15,753 --> 00:48:16,655
Me too.

953
00:48:17,586 --> 00:48:18,694
I'm the Octopus Man.

954
00:48:19,487 --> 00:48:23,779
Why don't we have parboiled
octopus and soju tonight?

955
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:25,690
-I'd love to.
-Good.

956
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:38,645
First day of work sucks.

957
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:41,732
I thought everything
will be easy once I got the job.

958
00:48:44,278 --> 00:48:46,048
Hey, trainee.

959
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:47,960
What are you doing here?

960
00:48:48,456 --> 00:48:49,467
Ma'am...

961
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:52,174
Did you find out who
the "Red-faced Squid" is?

962
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,762
No, not yet.

963
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,566
Their security is too tight.

964
00:48:56,759 --> 00:49:00,170
Is that your excuse to not do your job?

965
00:49:00,766 --> 00:49:01,864
No.

966
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:04,063
-Seojin.
-Trainee.

967
00:49:04,164 --> 00:49:06,465
You can't work as a reporter
with that attitude.

968
00:49:07,155 --> 00:49:11,385
I don't care about the security.
Find out by any means.

969
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:14,080
Why did they hire you?

970
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,084
-I'm sorry.
-Whatever.

971
00:49:16,184 --> 00:49:19,166
Don't come back to the office
until you find out who it is.

972
00:49:19,266 --> 00:49:22,857
If you can't find out who it is,
you should just quit.

973
00:49:22,957 --> 00:49:24,061
Got it?

974
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:25,677
Yes.

975
00:49:34,647 --> 00:49:35,848
What a jerk.

976
00:49:35,944 --> 00:49:36,943
Why?

977
00:49:37,345 --> 00:49:38,761
Do you know her?

978
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,231
-Crab Man.
-Yes?

979
00:49:41,461 --> 00:49:43,038
Can you do me a favor?

980
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:48,691
Crab Man.

981
00:49:49,202 --> 00:49:50,215
Are you ready?

982
00:49:51,294 --> 00:49:52,185
Okay.

983
00:49:59,971 --> 00:50:00,888
You!

984
00:50:01,663 --> 00:50:03,077
Do you know what crabs taste like?

985
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,277
What the hell is that?

986
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,277
Excuse me.

987
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:06,477
Who are you?

988
00:50:06,561 --> 00:50:08,774
-I protect the peace in the sea.
-Crab Man.

989
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:10,177
I fight in the name of justice.

990
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:13,101
-I'm Crab Man!
-What are you doing?

991
00:50:13,202 --> 00:50:14,575
Fool! Fool!

992
00:50:14,686 --> 00:50:15,790
Hey!

993
00:50:16,588 --> 00:50:18,657
Octopus Man! Now!

994
00:50:18,744 --> 00:50:20,546
Let me go! I said let me go!

995
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:26,373
Octopus ink!

996
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:28,998
Gun!

997
00:50:38,684 --> 00:50:39,800
Go!

998
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:41,286
Go! Octopus Man!

999
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:43,379
-Thank you.
-Go!

1000
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:51,614
There it is.

1001
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:54,123
Scallop?

1002
00:50:54,207 --> 00:50:56,326
Spoon worm?

1003
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,431
Sea squirt?

1004
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:01,331
Is this a seafood special?

1005
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:02,318
Squid.

1006
00:51:02,452 --> 00:51:04,830
Squid. Squid.

1007
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,030
Squid.

1008
00:51:06,127 --> 00:51:08,775
I found it.
Squid!

1009
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,289
What the hell!

1010
00:51:16,452 --> 00:51:17,965
Who are you?

1011
00:51:18,258 --> 00:51:21,762
Hello. You're Red-faced Squid, right?

1012
00:51:21,851 --> 00:51:23,686
You've been on the throne
for seven weeks, right?

1013
00:51:23,774 --> 00:51:25,774
Yes. But who are you?

1014
00:51:25,862 --> 00:51:26,883
Nice to meet you.

1015
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:30,268
I'm Octopus Man,
the villain that fights Aquaman.

1016
00:51:30,368 --> 00:51:31,484
My name is Lee Jungi.

1017
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:34,983
-What's your name?
-What?

1018
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,098
Why do you want to know my name?

1019
00:51:36,198 --> 00:51:39,173
I'm an octopus, you're a squid.

1020
00:51:39,273 --> 00:51:41,976
Us seafood creatures
should get to know each other.

1021
00:51:42,076 --> 00:51:43,565
I can't tell you my name.

1022
00:51:43,654 --> 00:51:44,654
It's a secret.

1023
00:51:45,657 --> 00:51:48,445
Come on, we're the same kind.

1024
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,842
I told you my name,
so it's good manners to tell me yours.

1025
00:51:51,946 --> 00:51:53,523
I can't tell you.

1026
00:51:54,786 --> 00:51:55,816
Wait.

1027
00:51:55,925 --> 00:51:58,301
I wasn't going to do this,
but you leave me no choice.

1028
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,906
Come here!

1029
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,750
What are you doing?

1030
00:52:09,928 --> 00:52:11,023
My tentacle!

1031
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:12,753
Murderer!

1032
00:52:12,846 --> 00:52:14,039
Who the hell are you?

1033
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:15,844
Security!
Security!

1034
00:52:15,944 --> 00:52:17,726
Where are they? Oh my gosh!

1035
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:18,963
What is this?

1036
00:52:19,064 --> 00:52:20,161
Crab Man!

1037
00:52:20,377 --> 00:52:21,555
Nice timing.

1038
00:52:27,919 --> 00:52:28,932
Come here.

1039
00:52:33,226 --> 00:52:34,527
Grab his legs!

1040
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:40,004
Octopus Man!
Do it now!

1041
00:52:40,104 --> 00:52:41,612
Take his make off!

1042
00:53:01,114 --> 00:53:02,222
What are you doing?

1043
00:53:06,355 --> 00:53:08,732
Don't cry when people are watching.
It's embarrassing.

1044
00:53:08,821 --> 00:53:11,137
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

1045
00:53:11,238 --> 00:53:13,644
I came to tell you who
the "Red-faced Squid" is.

1046
00:53:14,648 --> 00:53:15,857
But if you want me to leave, I will.

1047
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:20,543
Really?
How did you find out?

1048
00:53:22,596 --> 00:53:25,190
It was thanks to Crab Man's sacrifice.

1049
00:53:25,406 --> 00:53:27,411
-What?
-But you wanted me to go, right?

1050
00:53:27,697 --> 00:53:28,687
I'll go.

1051
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:29,997
Jungi!

1052
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:32,079
You can't just leave!

1053
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:33,473
You petty jerk!

1054
00:53:38,652 --> 00:53:39,572
What's this?

1055
00:53:39,672 --> 00:53:42,687
The "Red-faced Squid" is Kang Kyunsung.

1056
00:53:43,962 --> 00:53:45,388
Here's a photo of him.

1057
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:55,950
You're the "Red-faced Squid"?

1058
00:53:56,536 --> 00:53:57,848
I'm a fan.

1059
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:03,645
Jungi.

1060
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:06,672
Kid.

1061
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:09,089
Don't frown.

1062
00:54:09,369 --> 00:54:12,089
Don't be intimidated.

1063
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,589
Kang Seojin, you know
you have a strong will.

1064
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:16,215
Kang Seojin.

1065
00:54:17,824 --> 00:54:18,912
You can do this.

1066
00:54:19,692 --> 00:54:20,605
You can do it.

1067
00:54:21,306 --> 00:54:22,305
I have to go.

1068
00:54:22,798 --> 00:54:23,701
Bye.

1069
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:53,937
I'm home.

1070
00:54:56,128 --> 00:54:57,249
Why are you two coming home together?

1071
00:54:57,338 --> 00:54:59,931
Yuna helped with shoot a video today.

1072
00:55:00,735 --> 00:55:03,627
-Dusik, I'll take her.
-Sure.

1073
00:55:03,727 --> 00:55:06,012
-Go to Mommy.
-Hi, Seol.

1074
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,822
Did you have fun today?

1075
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,325
How are you?

1076
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:12,223
Yuna, thanks for helping me out today.

1077
00:55:12,311 --> 00:55:13,296
No problem.

1078
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,213
Are you hungry? I'll make dinner.

1079
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:16,608
I'm fine.

1080
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:19,168
I have to do editing.
I don't have time to eat.

1081
00:55:36,217 --> 00:55:37,320
Donggu.

1082
00:55:37,404 --> 00:55:38,570
Good morning.

1083
00:55:39,368 --> 00:55:40,574
What are you doing?

1084
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:42,667
Did you stay up all night?

1085
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:45,290
I couldn't sleep
because I wanted to finish this.

1086
00:55:45,378 --> 00:55:47,321
So, I finished editing it too.

1087
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:51,429
-Really?
-Yes.

1088
00:55:52,395 --> 00:55:53,924
Okay. All done.

1089
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,358
I'll be at the studio.

1090
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,637
Good morning.

1091
00:56:12,123 --> 00:56:13,597
Why are you here?

1092
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:18,321
Didn't I tell you you can't come back here
unless you find out who the king is?

1093
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:22,199
Here.

1094
00:56:22,299 --> 00:56:23,207
Let's see.

1095
00:56:23,307 --> 00:56:26,322
Is it a photo of a squid?

1096
00:56:26,432 --> 00:56:27,628
Let's see.

1097
00:56:28,196 --> 00:56:29,109
What?

1098
00:56:29,201 --> 00:56:30,007
Hey!

1099
00:56:30,406 --> 00:56:31,626
Is this real?

1100
00:56:31,715 --> 00:56:33,143
How did you do it?

1101
00:56:34,235 --> 00:56:35,820
An octopus did it for me.

1102
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:37,630
An octopus?

1103
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:38,735
Well...

1104
00:56:40,044 --> 00:56:41,956
He's usually crazy,

1105
00:56:42,157 --> 00:56:45,649
but sometimes he's pretty cool.

1106
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,677
I'm exhausted.

1107
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,390
Min Sua.

1108
00:56:53,818 --> 00:56:56,420
How long are you going to
stay at the convenience store?

1109
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:59,700
Until I catch him.

1110
00:57:00,325 --> 00:57:03,620
-I got a nose bleed because of you.
-Dusik.

1111
00:57:03,717 --> 00:57:06,006
I saved you from the bully.
That's the least you can do.

1112
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:07,534
You're a bad friend.

1113
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:10,247
You're worse than the restaurant owner.
You big bully!

1114
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:11,845
-What did you say?
-I take it back.

1115
00:57:13,353 --> 00:57:14,653
I'm home.

1116
00:57:15,928 --> 00:57:17,218
Hi, Donggu.

1117
00:57:17,821 --> 00:57:18,605
How did it go?

1118
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:20,206
He hated it.

1119
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:21,907
He thought it was weird.

1120
00:57:22,115 --> 00:57:23,306
He called me crazy.

1121
00:57:23,405 --> 00:57:25,552
What are you talking about?
What happened?

1122
00:57:25,847 --> 00:57:28,528
I made a video that documents
a baby growing up.

1123
00:57:28,629 --> 00:57:30,421
But my boss hated it.

1124
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:31,729
It can't be that bad.

1125
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:34,701
Can you watch it
and give me an objective review?

1126
00:57:46,603 --> 00:57:47,524
Donggu.

1127
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:49,523
What are those?

1128
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,899
Sperms.

1129
00:57:52,016 --> 00:57:52,898
What?

1130
00:57:53,486 --> 00:57:55,401
Why did you put sperms in the video?

1131
00:57:55,548 --> 00:57:57,307
The intro is about...

1132
00:57:57,998 --> 00:58:00,343
...the creation of life.

1133
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:03,184
The scene where the sperm meets the egg.

1134
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:05,668
Then the baby is conceived!

1135
00:58:05,756 --> 00:58:07,865
It's reality. Isn't it fresh?

1136
00:58:08,762 --> 00:58:10,561
It is fresh.

1137
00:58:10,649 --> 00:58:12,734
But I don't know
if this intro is necessary.

1138
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:13,851
Is it?

1139
00:58:14,338 --> 00:58:15,647
The next scene is amazing.

1140
00:58:15,735 --> 00:58:16,649
Watch.

1141
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,425
What was that?

1142
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,739
Why did the baby jump out of her belly?

1143
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:32,819
-What was that?
-Don't you know Matrix?

1144
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,383
The baby grows inside
the mommy's belly for 10 months,

1145
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:37,171
then bam!

1146
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:39,979
I've shown the moment
of birth dynamically.

1147
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,794
But this is too bizarre.

1148
00:58:42,883 --> 00:58:45,704
Why? Doesn't it make
you want to watch more?

1149
00:58:45,792 --> 00:58:47,607
It's like a real movie, isn't it?

1150
00:58:47,927 --> 00:58:51,925
The next scene is like the scene
in "Whispering Corridors".

1151
00:58:52,013 --> 00:58:53,509
The baby's here then it's there.

1152
00:58:53,693 --> 00:58:55,417
-Bam! Bam!
-That's enough.

1153
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,315
We don't need to see it.

1154
00:58:57,412 --> 00:59:00,309
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

1155
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:01,900
Matrix...

1156
00:59:01,989 --> 00:59:03,598
Why?

1157
00:59:04,299 --> 00:59:05,306
Donggu.

1158
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:08,106
Do you really have
to become a film director?

1159
00:59:08,694 --> 00:59:09,494
What do you mean?

1160
00:59:09,594 --> 00:59:13,791
I'm scared that one day your movie
will be revealed to the world.

1161
00:59:15,903 --> 00:59:16,903
Sua...

1162
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:20,082
The video isn't finished. Watch the rest.

1163
00:59:45,337 --> 00:59:49,067
I thought your video looked like
a movie and it was interesting.

1164
00:59:49,475 --> 00:59:50,678
I'm telling the truth.

1165
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:52,254
It's fine.

1166
00:59:53,469 --> 00:59:55,666
Cheer up.

1167
00:59:56,476 --> 00:59:59,576
I want to cheer up, but I can't.

1168
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:05,546
I'm worried I'll just keep filming
birthday parties.

1169
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:09,856
I may never make it
into the film industry.

1170
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,941
You can start now.

1171
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:13,826
Make a movie.

1172
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:16,519
You got an offer, right?

1173
01:00:17,525 --> 01:00:21,131
-That's...
-I've never seen you so happy.

1174
01:00:21,902 --> 01:00:26,461
I thought you only knew how to frown,
get angry and yell at people.

1175
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:30,256
When we were shooting
that video yesterday,

1176
01:00:30,665 --> 01:00:34,222
I realized you were capable
of making such a happy smile.

1177
01:00:34,906 --> 01:00:37,907
I could tell that you
really love this work.

1178
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:40,021
That's what I felt.

1179
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:43,427
Was I like that?

1180
01:00:43,617 --> 01:00:46,903
So, don't be afraid.

1181
01:00:47,003 --> 01:00:48,398
Give it another go.

1182
01:00:48,498 --> 01:00:50,712
It's not as easy as it sounds.

1183
01:00:50,812 --> 01:00:51,835
What?

1184
01:00:52,935 --> 01:00:55,038
I didn't know you were a big coward.

1185
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:56,526
What?

1186
01:00:56,626 --> 01:01:02,013
If you can't do what you really
want to do because you're scared,

1187
01:01:03,729 --> 01:01:05,429
...would that be a happy life?

1188
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:09,207
Won't you regret it later?

1189
01:01:12,404 --> 01:01:14,595
So what if you fail?

1190
01:01:14,695 --> 01:01:16,247
You can start again.

1191
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:17,551
Don't you think so?

1192
01:01:20,654 --> 01:01:21,446
Oh my!

1193
01:01:23,171 --> 01:01:26,023
That was over the line, wasn't it?

1194
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:30,832
I'm sorry.

1195
01:01:32,739 --> 01:01:35,811
Donggu. I finished all the chores
around the house.

1196
01:01:35,911 --> 01:01:38,729
I'll go and practice baking.

1197
01:01:40,187 --> 01:01:41,211
Okay.

1198
01:01:47,907 --> 01:01:49,516
Kang Donggu, you can do it!

1199
01:01:49,904 --> 01:01:50,792
You can do it!

1200
01:02:10,134 --> 01:02:11,157
Hello.

1201
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:13,491
Donggu.

1202
01:02:13,994 --> 01:02:15,304
What are you doing here?

1203
01:02:17,002 --> 01:02:19,202
The job you offered...

1204
01:02:19,588 --> 01:02:20,832
I'll take it.

1205
01:02:21,145 --> 01:02:22,348
I look forward to working with you.

1206
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,310
Kang Donggu.

1207
01:02:33,099 --> 01:02:36,033
Sua! Where are you going?

1208
01:02:36,706 --> 01:02:39,374
I was at the convenient store
and came out for fresh air.

1209
01:02:39,702 --> 01:02:41,294
You're in a good mood.

1210
01:02:41,394 --> 01:02:42,572
Did something good happen?

1211
01:02:43,773 --> 01:02:45,681
I'm back in the movie business.

1212
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:48,175
-I decided to just do it.
-Yes?

1213
01:02:48,562 --> 01:02:49,560
That's great.

1214
01:02:52,562 --> 01:02:54,965
Now I know why I like Yuna.

1215
01:02:55,366 --> 01:02:56,054
Really?

1216
01:02:56,271 --> 01:02:57,131
Why?

1217
01:02:58,127 --> 01:03:00,419
I just like her for no particular reason.

1218
01:03:02,113 --> 01:03:03,131
I just like her.

1219
01:03:04,423 --> 01:03:05,824
What is that?

1220
01:03:07,527 --> 01:03:09,313
Then what about her situation and Seol?

1221
01:03:09,709 --> 01:03:11,533
I'm not sure yet.

1222
01:03:11,798 --> 01:03:13,415
But I know one thing for sure.

1223
01:03:13,597 --> 01:03:16,554
If I think too much, I'll
get scared and lose her,

1224
01:03:17,229 --> 01:03:19,360
then I will never be happy.

1225
01:03:19,658 --> 01:03:21,360
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

1226
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,238
That's why I'm going
to confess how I feel.

1227
01:03:23,436 --> 01:03:24,439
Confess?

1228
01:03:24,846 --> 01:03:25,839
When?

1229
01:03:26,638 --> 01:03:27,448
Right now.

1230
01:03:42,721 --> 01:03:43,951
Go ahead.

1231
01:03:44,049 --> 01:03:47,153
I'm sorry. You don't have
to drive me home every time.

1232
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:49,337
It's fine. It's on my way anyway.

1233
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:51,014
It's cold. Go inside.

1234
01:03:51,114 --> 01:03:53,304
Okay. See you next week in class.

1235
01:04:08,502 --> 01:04:09,706
My phone.

1236
01:04:11,084 --> 01:04:13,104
I must've left it in Hyeonjun's car.

1237
01:04:17,158 --> 01:04:18,269
Donggu.

1238
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,936
Yuna, I have something to say to you.

1239
01:04:30,036 --> 01:04:31,843
What is it?

1240
01:04:42,656 --> 01:04:43,646
I like you.

1241
01:04:45,054 --> 01:04:46,862
I really like you, Yuna.

1242
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,782
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1243
01:05:35,882 --> 01:05:37,455
You got a part in a drama?

1244
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:38,771
Congratulations, Jungi.

1245
01:05:38,855 --> 01:05:40,286
Are you like a star now?

1246
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:41,637
I'm on social media now.

1247
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,521
Pretend to be my fan.
Let's a photo.

1248
01:05:43,655 --> 01:05:44,548
No thanks.

1249
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:45,641
Can you clean my ears?

1250
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,343
What the hell are you doing?

1251
01:05:47,427 --> 01:05:48,537
Why is she acting
like that toward me lately?

1252
01:05:48,626 --> 01:05:50,057
Calm down, heart.

1253
01:05:50,176 --> 01:05:51,865
-What are you look at?
-I'm looking for something.

1254
01:05:51,965 --> 01:05:54,097
Ways to be happy for the rest of my life.

1255
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:56,561
I stopped studying early.

1256
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:58,081
You can always study again.

1257
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:00,538
Thanks. I feel better
because you're so positive.

1258
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:01,942
Do you have that ramyeon today?

1259
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:03,837
Ppappai Ttappo Tomyum Thai.

1260
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:05,333
You! Stop right there!

1261
01:06:05,433 --> 01:06:07,159
Dusik. Stop him!

1262
01:06:08,433 --> 01:06:10,446
Donggu, you're saying you like Yuna?

1263
01:06:10,545 --> 01:06:12,116
Donggu, you look terrible.

1264
01:06:12,216 --> 01:06:13,221
You didn't get any sleep?

1265
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:15,752
There was a problem
at our accommodation,

1266
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:17,100
but you saved us.

1267
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,107
Hyeonjun!

1268
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:21,209
The two of them are alone in a house?

1269
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:22,415
This late at night?

1270
01:06:22,528 --> 01:06:24,021
Why isn't she picking up?

1271
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:25,408
Who is it?

1272
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:26,920
Donggu!

1273
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:32,038
"Welcome to Waikiki"
