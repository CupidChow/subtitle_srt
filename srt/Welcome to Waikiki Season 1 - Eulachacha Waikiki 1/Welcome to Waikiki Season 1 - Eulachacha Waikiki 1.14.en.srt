1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:02,092
It was you, wasn't it?

2
00:00:02,983 --> 00:00:04,922
-It was your doing.
-Yes.

3
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:07,140
I removed that story.

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:10,124
Don't you know that the anchor
has the editorial rights?

5
00:00:10,263 --> 00:00:11,096
What?

6
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:13,498
You call yourself a journalist?

7
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:14,849
Aren't you ashamed?

8
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:17,085
Stop being such a stickler.

9
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,018
Or...

10
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,123
Or...

11
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:24,328
...you will break in half.

12
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,249
What?

13
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:27,179
You jerk.

14
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:30,531
Cut!

15
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,860
Good. Let's move on to the next scene.

16
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:34,730
Jaehyeon, are you okay?

17
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:36,529
I punched you too hard.

18
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,457
It's okay. These things happen
when you're acting.

19
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:40,739
Don't worry about it.

20
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:42,442
Thank you.

21
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:44,873
Jungi. Your phone.

22
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:47,622
There are several missed calls. Answer it.

23
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:49,027
Thank you.

24
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:50,760
Hello?

25
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,197
Yes, Lee Jungi speaking.

26
00:00:55,316 --> 00:00:56,149
Pardon?

27
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:01,337
Okay. Thank you.

28
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:07,073
Who was it?

29
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:09,769
Actually...

30
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:13,400
They want to hire me for a TV commercial.

31
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:16,140
A coffee commercial.

32
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:17,070
Really?

33
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:20,160
Wow, I haven't done
a coffee commercial yet.

34
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:22,067
Congratulations.

35
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:23,867
Impressive.

36
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,557
Thank you.

37
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:39,652
Don't you know that the anchor
has the editorial rights?

38
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:40,570
What?

39
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:42,773
You call yourself a journalist?

40
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:43,790
Aren't you ashamed?

41
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:46,039
Stop being such a stickler.

42
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:47,156
Or...

43
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:49,082
...you will break in half.

44
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,444
You jerk.

45
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:51,508
Stop!

46
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,587
Look at my expression.

47
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:58,185
Don't I look super charismatic?

48
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:00,004
You bastard.

49
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:03,891
-That was awesome, right?
-We get it.

50
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:05,079
Can we please watch something else?

51
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:06,427
I'm sick of it.

52
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,562
You're sick of it?

53
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,081
You jerk.

54
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,817
How much fuss is going to make
when he gets a leading role?

55
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:21,481
What? You jerk.

56
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,633
Why do they want you for their commercial?

57
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:27,953
Only top celebrities
do coffee commercials.

58
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:29,177
Are they trying to sabotage themselves?

59
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:30,527
That mouth...

60
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:31,516
What?

61
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:32,997
You jerk.

62
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:36,721
Stop that. All right?

63
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:38,517
I'm going to the meeting
with the commercial agency.

64
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:39,669
Wait.

65
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:41,582
Can I borrow your car?

66
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,049
My precious Rebecca?

67
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:44,495
Why? What for?

68
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,048
It's difficult to carry all the clothes
that I buy for our business.

69
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,169
And taxi fares are too high.

70
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:49,887
So, I'm going to practice driving.

71
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:51,563
Is your car in good condition?

72
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:52,773
Of course.

73
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:55,025
My Rebecca is indestructible.

74
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:58,596
But don't open the window on the right.

75
00:02:58,763 --> 00:02:59,596
Why?

76
00:03:02,676 --> 00:03:05,503
There's a sad story about that window.

77
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:07,203
Treat my Rebecca...

78
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,438
...with love and care.

79
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,117
Sure.

80
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:12,082
I advise you not to get in that car.

81
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:13,004
Don't worry.

82
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,763
Driving lessons cost quite a bit.

83
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:17,032
No worries.

84
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:18,702
Dusik will teach me.

85
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:19,830
What? Me?

86
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:21,531
When? Where? What? How? Why?

87
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:22,876
Shut up and come with me, Director Bong.

88
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,278
I'm not even wearing any socks. Look.

89
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:27,945
It's okay. We'll be inside
the car the whole time.

90
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:29,726
-See you guys.
-Wait. Wait.

91
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:31,516
-Dusik, it's dangerous.
-Wait.

92
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:33,113
-See you.
-Be careful.

93
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:35,200
That car is rough.

94
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:36,943
I'll get going too.

95
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,041
Excuse me.

96
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:40,928
I have to go to work. I'll go with you.

97
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:41,846
Okay.

98
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:44,925
Kang Seojin, stop.

99
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,091
I told you to stay five meters
away from him.

100
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:50,765
You can go five minutes after he leaves.

101
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,683
What?

102
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:54,109
How long are you going to keep this up?

103
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:55,150
I don't know.

104
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,976
Until my strange suspicion dies away.

105
00:03:58,061 --> 00:03:59,210
Sit down.

106
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:00,334
Please.

107
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:01,394
Darn it.

108
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,704
"Darn it"?

109
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:05,189
Okay then, I'll leave first.

110
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:06,498
Okay, bye.

111
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:14,254
You are such a bully.

112
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:16,287
This is so troublesome.

113
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:17,221
Why?

114
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,288
Do you have something better to do?

115
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,498
- No.
- I thought so.

116
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:28,985
You know how to drive, right?

117
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:31,763
Of course. I got my license
eight years ago.

118
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:33,473
Although, I have never driven a car since.

119
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,032
What? Never?

120
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,185
It's okay. It's okay.

121
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,446
I can do it once I get the hang of it.

122
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,501
Let's do this.

123
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,452
This is so annoying.

124
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:47,232
Dusik.

125
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:49,358
Which one is the brake?

126
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:50,856
The left one? The right one?

127
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,773
What?

128
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:54,494
How can you drive
when you don't even know that?

129
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:57,998
I'm just not sure
because it's been a while.

130
00:04:58,135 --> 00:04:59,059
I'm getting a bad feeling.

131
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:00,497
This is very bad.

132
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,946
What the hell?

133
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:09,902
Why is this not opening?

134
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:11,919
That door only opens from the outside.

135
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,181
This car is a junk.

136
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,366
Wait here.

137
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:17,350
What are you doing?

138
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:19,332
Seriously. Gross.

139
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,520
Geez. You're unbelievable.

140
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:32,441
Director Bong, what are you doing?

141
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:33,845
Let's go!

142
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,568
Okay, I'm coming.

143
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,357
Okay. I'll start driving.

144
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:50,210
Geez.

145
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:51,601
What are you doing, you dummy?

146
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,851
What? "Dummy"?

147
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,454
-Do you want to die?
-I take it back.

148
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,288
Here we go.

149
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,574
"Doesn't know which one is the brake!"

150
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,292
"Beginner driver"
"Potential killer!"

151
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,932
Hey! Slow down.

152
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:14,212
Jerk!

153
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,812
Wait! Stop!

154
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:18,193
Seojin! It's me!

155
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,181
Jungi?

156
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,714
You scared me.

157
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,031
Are you okay?

158
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,952
He wasn't following you, was he?

159
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:27,283
Where is Donggu?

160
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:28,828
Of course not.

161
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:30,505
He has things better to do.

162
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:32,104
Didn't you see his eyes?

163
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:33,763
The eyes of the Grim Reaper?

164
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,690
-We have to be extra careful.
-Jeez...

165
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:39,233
Are we in a spy movie?

166
00:06:39,322 --> 00:06:41,280
You can't be too careful.

167
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,300
Shall we have some coffee?

168
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:46,873
Don't you have that meeting
with the commercial agency?

169
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:50,644
I have time to have coffee with my Bacca.
Don't worry about it.

170
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,706
I hope you get the commercial.

171
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:58,957
Don't worry. It's pretty much confirmed.

172
00:06:59,042 --> 00:06:59,881
Really?

173
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:02,390
Did you tell your father?

174
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:03,831
-He's happy, huh?
-Yeah.

175
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,092
He told me he's proud of me.

176
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:10,554
I've made my father proud
for the first time in my life.

177
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,356
I'm so proud of you, my boyfriend.

178
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,044
Darn it!

179
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:25,433
I lost them.

180
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,772
They must know I'm following them.

181
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:30,202
Kang Seojin, Lee Jungi...

182
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,219
If I ever catch you,

183
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:40,193
I'm going to send you to your graves
on the same day.

184
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:52,229
There are no cars or people on this road
so it's perfect for practicing.

185
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:54,440
Driving is easy.

186
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:57,405
Oh, I forgot something important.

187
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:01,639
Are you crazy?

188
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:03,762
You can't let go of the steering wheel!

189
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,426
You got it, so it's fine.

190
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:11,860
Sunglasses are essential
to driving in style.

191
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:14,314
Shut up and grab the steering wheel.

192
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:16,623
This is not an autonomous car, you psycho.

193
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:18,901
-Do you want to die?
-I take it back. So just grab it.

194
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:20,411
Be quiet.

195
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:21,564
I'm looking at the mirror.

196
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:23,636
You're a psycho.

197
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,947
Why am I doing this?

198
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,628
Do you think this is ridiculous too?

199
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:40,488
What are you doing?

200
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:42,133
Why are you hollowing out loaves of bread?

201
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:43,566
Oh, these?

202
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,747
I need to check
if an air gun fits in here.

203
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:49,688
You want to put an air gun
inside a loaf of bread?

204
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:52,098
The lead character of our movie is a spy.

205
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,135
He carries his air gun
inside a loaf of bread.

206
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,026
-Why?
-I have no idea.

207
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:58,933
He said I came up with this idea,
but I have no memory of it.

208
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,669
He just told me to put an air gun
inside a loaf of bread.

209
00:09:01,753 --> 00:09:03,466
This is ridiculous.

210
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:05,127
Are you going somewhere?

211
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,356
Yes, to the workroom.

212
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,439
Again?

213
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:10,803
You're going there too often.

214
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:12,555
We have a lot of things to do
around the house.

215
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,963
I finished all my chores.

216
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,183
Really?

217
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:20,270
Yesterday, I saw lots of things
that need to be fixed.

218
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:22,128
Really? Like that?

219
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:24,547
The second floor dormitory...

220
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,992
Oh, the knob that's slightly loose?

221
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:29,569
I bought a new knob and replaced it.

222
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:31,059
I see.

223
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:33,201
The second floor private room...

224
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:35,970
Oh, the ceiling light flickering
every 4.2 seconds?

225
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,290
I climbed up a ladder
and replaced all the short circuit

226
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,442
Then... Oh, the third floor...

227
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:44,895
The banister on the third step
shaking a bit?

228
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:48,449
I bought a welder this morning
and welded it.

229
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:50,410
Then you may go.

230
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:51,478
See you later.

231
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:53,383
Sol, I'll be back later.

232
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,774
Thanks for looking after Sol.

233
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,006
Bye.

234
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:57,755
Bye.

235
00:09:58,407 --> 00:09:59,992
What was that?

236
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:01,333
Seol.

237
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:05,598
Your mom welds now. She's technician.

238
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:09,847
I don't want her hanging around
Song Hyeonjun.

239
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:11,344
Don't think about it.

240
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:15,396
Why does he want to put
an air gun in here?

241
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:17,242
What kind of a movie is this?

242
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,066
Jungi, I'm sorry.

243
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:23,272
The advertiser recommended Kim Jaehyeon.

244
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:24,789
Jungi, I'm sorry.

245
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,542
I told them I didn't want to do it.

246
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,429
But my agency forced me.

247
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:29,434
No.

248
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:31,436
It's fine, Jaehyeon.

249
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:32,562
But still...

250
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:35,515
I look like a jerk who's trying
to steal someone else's gig.

251
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,337
This is not right.

252
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:42,149
But why did they recommend me?

253
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:47,183
The most important thing
in this commercial is your smile.

254
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:52,217
They said that Jungi's smile
isn't quite what they're looking for.

255
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:55,993
What kind of smile are you looking for?

256
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,348
A smile that's refreshing
like morning dew.

257
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:04,940
A smile that's refreshing
like morning dew?

258
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:07,133
Let's have lunch first
and discuss this later.

259
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:08,120
Okay.

260
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:12,089
Ouch!

261
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:13,876
-Jaehyeon.
-Are you okay?

262
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,731
I'm fine.

263
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:18,604
What the hell?

264
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:20,299
Why is he smiling?

265
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:22,667
But you fell pretty hard.

266
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,519
It does hurt a bit, but...

267
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,734
...I'm fine.

268
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,833
Huh?

269
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:32,808
He's smiling again.

270
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,317
Is he trying to show them his smile?

271
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,064
I feel much better...

272
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:40,771
...now.

273
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:45,471
He is trying to show them his smile.

274
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,498
He might steal my commercial.

275
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,261
Let's go to lunch.

276
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:51,207
Yes.

277
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,447
My phone is ringing.

278
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,882
One moment.

279
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:57,669
Hello?

280
00:11:58,786 --> 00:11:59,619
What?

281
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:01,618
Are you serious?

282
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:03,805
How could this happen...

283
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:05,158
Okay.

284
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,413
What's wrong?

285
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:08,666
Is everything all right?

286
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:12,879
A friend of mine collapsed
and he's in surgery right now.

287
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:15,201
He's like a brother to me.

288
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,013
His name is Kang Donggu.

289
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:19,309
You must be very concerned.

290
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:20,329
Yes...

291
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:22,675
...but I'm okay.

292
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:29,801
It's probably nothing much.

293
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:31,076
Don't worry, Jungi.

294
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:35,103
I should think positively
especially during difficult times.

295
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,889
I'm okay.

296
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:44,545
Okay, then. What should we have for lunch?

297
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,673
Tofu and kimchi?

298
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:51,104
Or sandwich?

299
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:52,443
Tofu and kimchi? Sandwich?

300
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:53,731
What about you, Jungi?

301
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:54,649
Oh, um...

302
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:56,836
Tofu and kimchi....

303
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:58,861
...and sandwich.

304
00:12:58,946 --> 00:12:59,903
Sounds good, but how about...

305
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,458
...sushi?

306
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,869
What do you think?

307
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:05,351
Sua!

308
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,198
Aren't you finished yet?

309
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:09,653
Why are you fixing your make-up now?

310
00:13:10,844 --> 00:13:13,575
The color of these sunglasses
and my skin tone don't match.

311
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,523
Shut up and grab the wheel.

312
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:17,357
Fine, I will.

313
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:19,801
I need to put on more foundation.

314
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:22,486
Sua! Slow down.

315
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:25,228
You're going too fast! Step on the brake!

316
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:29,838
What is this?

317
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:30,755
What's that?

318
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:33,381
Is this the brake? Give it to me.

319
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,134
It is the brake pedal.

320
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:38,330
The brake pedal came off?

321
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:39,557
Amazing.

322
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,799
This is not amusing.

323
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,899
Jeez, what do we do?

324
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:47,806
-Can't believe the brake came off.
-Oh no!

325
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,684
Dusik, what do we do?

326
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:51,843
Take your foot off the accelerator.

327
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,326
It'll make the car slow down a bit.

328
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:54,680
Okay.

329
00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:57,518
I took my foot of the pedal
but it's not slowing down.

330
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:00,144
Dusik, what do we do?

331
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:02,819
Oh my god. This is dangerous.

332
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,080
The emergency brake.

333
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:07,829
What the hell?

334
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:10,673
This car is a junk.

335
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:13,813
Dusik, what do we do?

336
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:16,829
Sua, let's call for help.

337
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:18,137
911. 911.

338
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:21,160
- Yeah, 911.
- My phone. My phone!

339
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,106
Darn it.

340
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:31,545
I left my phone on the roof of the car.

341
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:33,392
Give me your phone.

342
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:35,795
-Your phone, phone, phone.
-Okay. My phone.

343
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,283
My phone!

344
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:39,807
Where's my phone?

345
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,089
Darn it.

346
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:47,418
Oh no! I think I left it at home.

347
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:48,776
Geez.

348
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:51,663
This won't do. I have no other choice.

349
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,729
Don't do that!

350
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:56,978
Jungi said we shouldn't open that window.

351
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,549
He said there was a sad story about it.

352
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:01,234
We have no other option.
My phone is on the roof.

353
00:15:03,098 --> 00:15:04,098
What the hell?

354
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:05,592
It won't go down any more.

355
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:08,657
Oh my god. I'll kill Lee Jungi.

356
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,002
This is unbelievable.

357
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:19,652
Almost there. I think I almost reach it.

358
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:23,037
Why are you raising the window?

359
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,115
I'm not doing that.

360
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,016
Hey, hey hey, it hurts. Do something.

361
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:29,232
-Okay.
-My arm will get cut off.

362
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:30,365
It's freezing outside.

363
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:32,190
This button is not working either.

364
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:34,254
This car is a junk!

365
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:35,824
Ouch. Sua.

366
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:36,742
Oh no.

367
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,041
It's the main road!

368
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:39,071
The main road?

369
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:41,094
Turn left! Turn left. Left. Left.

370
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:43,506
Drive to that empty lot.

371
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:44,778
-To the empty lot.
-Okay.

372
00:15:44,863 --> 00:15:47,182
Ouch. Drive slowly.

373
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:48,738
Keep going. Keep going.

374
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,184
-What do I do?
-We're going to crash.

375
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:52,518
-Steer to the side!
-Oh, no!

376
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,077
I told you to avoid that thing.

377
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,061
Dusik, what do we do now?

378
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:59,300
Okay, just drive around the lot.

379
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:01,224
Just keep driving in a circle.

380
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,465
What? Keep driving around the lot?

381
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:05,430
We'll cause an accident
if we leave this lot.

382
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:07,957
Why did you have to practice driving?

383
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:09,917
I had no idea this would happen.

384
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,572
"Tea House"

385
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:18,212
Jungi.

386
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,535
Try this.

387
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:26,185
Thank you, Jaehyeon.

388
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,924
You two seem close.

389
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,345
Are you good friends?

390
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:33,584
Yes, we're like brothers.

391
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,700
By the way...

392
00:16:38,723 --> 00:16:40,876
...have you confirmed
the concept for this commercial?

393
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,329
Yes.

394
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:47,666
Like we said, the most important
in this commercial is your smile.

395
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,603
The second important thing
is facial expressions.

396
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:52,895
Facial expressions as colorful...

397
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:54,909
...as the seven colors of a rainbow.

398
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:59,999
Facial expressions as colorful
as the seven colors of a rainbow?

399
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,058
That's right. Let's eat.

400
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:02,975
Okay.

401
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:10,508
It's so sour.

402
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:11,859
It's so sour.

403
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:13,371
It's so sour.

404
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,500
-The kimchi is that sour?
-Yes.

405
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:20,144
It's like biting into a sour lemon.

406
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:22,174
So sour. I'll drink some water.

407
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:27,346
Cold!

408
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:30,367
-It's so cold.
-Here he goes again.

409
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:31,567
Fine.

410
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,352
The game is on.

411
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,689
This chili looks delicious.

412
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:45,760
My mouth is burning.

413
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:47,583
It's so spicy.

414
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:49,149
I need dongchimi.

415
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:53,986
So sweet and sour.

416
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:56,844
It's sour...

417
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:58,737
...and sweet at the same time.

418
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:00,207
It has rich flavors.

419
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:01,661
Sweet and sour.

420
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,474
How long do we have to do this?

421
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:12,756
I don't know.

422
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:16,729
We run out of gas,
the car will stop somehow.

423
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:20,727
Why is there no one passing by?

424
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:25,638
I feel gassy.

425
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:28,207
Did I eat too much pizza?

426
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:31,058
I think I'm going to fart. What do I do?

427
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,756
Jeez.

428
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:39,312
Why did you honk?

429
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:41,190
There was a cat.

430
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:43,200
A cat? What cat?

431
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:46,085
What's that smell?

432
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:48,277
Is there a sewer nearby?

433
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:52,610
Min Sua.

434
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:54,567
You farted, didn't you?

435
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:56,902
That's why you honked, right?

436
00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:00,005
No, I did it because of the cat.

437
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:01,253
Yeah right.

438
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:04,292
You covered the sound,
but what about the smell?

439
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,552
Fine! I farted.

440
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:08,731
You have the worst manners.

441
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,091
You should just pretend
not to know when a lady farts.

442
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:13,245
Did you really have
to make a big fuss over it?

443
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:16,727
Why are you getting mad?
You're the one who farted.

444
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:19,785
Forget it. This is why you've
never had a girlfriend.

445
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,703
What?

446
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,937
Why are you adding salt to my wound?

447
00:19:23,021 --> 00:19:24,974
Whatever. I'm not talking to you.

448
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:29,338
What the hell?

449
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:30,479
Did you fart again?

450
00:19:30,564 --> 00:19:32,481
No! It was the cat.

451
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,087
It stinks.

452
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:35,676
What did you eat?

453
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:37,979
No, there's a cat!

454
00:19:38,063 --> 00:19:39,267
Stop farting!

455
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:41,667
I'm not farting!

456
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:42,945
By the way, sir...

457
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:46,579
Other than expressions,
is there anything else...

458
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,619
...that you're looking for
for the commercial?

459
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:49,722
Something else?

460
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:53,402
The voice is important too.

461
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:55,142
How can I put this...

462
00:19:55,623 --> 00:20:01,305
A sweet voice that melts
like coffee powder in hot water.

463
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:03,796
Like Gong Yoo from "Goblin"...

464
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:05,389
...or Sung Sikyung.

465
00:20:05,473 --> 00:20:07,173
Gong Yoo or Sung Sikyung?

466
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:11,711
Sir, you finished your soup.

467
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:15,047
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

468
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:16,019
Yes?

469
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:18,530
The taste was good.

470
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:20,509
The seasoning was just right.

471
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:23,389
Every moment with the soup was great.

472
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:25,470
So we want one more bowl of doenjang soup.

473
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:27,452
-Pardon?
-And also...

474
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,094
The texture was good.

475
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,443
It was cooked just right.

476
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:36,413
Every moment with the rice was great.

477
00:20:37,544 --> 00:20:39,314
So we want one more bowl of rice.

478
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:43,960
Okay. One bowl of doenjang soup
and one bowl of rice.

479
00:20:47,353 --> 00:20:48,543
This is hell.

480
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:51,266
How many hours have we been driving?

481
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:54,656
My stomach is upset because of the pizza.

482
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:56,712
Darn it.

483
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,500
Ow, my stomach.

484
00:20:58,651 --> 00:21:01,356
I keep farting and that's not a good sign.

485
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:05,837
Hey.

486
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:08,260
Stop farting for goodness sake.

487
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:10,962
What? It was because of the cat.

488
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:13,400
Stop talking about the cat.

489
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:16,100
You're not the only one
with an upset stomach.

490
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:21,037
A major disaster will happen
if I loosen up just a little bit.

491
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:24,902
But I'm holding it because
I have a sense of decency.

492
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:28,080
Whatever. I'm not talking to you.
So don't talk to me.

493
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,322
Why don't you just take a dump!

494
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:58,223
Why are you staring?
I can't concentrate.

495
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,652
You look happy.

496
00:22:00,763 --> 00:22:02,720
You look happy when you're baking.

497
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:04,412
-I do?
-Yes.

498
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:08,694
You wanted to become a pastry chef
since you were young?

499
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:12,765
Yes. I loved to eat
bread since I was young.

500
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,924
I used to spend a lot of money on bread.

501
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,841
So, I thought I should
just bake it myself.

502
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:22,369
That's how I started
and I've been doing it ever since.

503
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:24,376
You're funny.

504
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:26,827
What about you?

505
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,951
You've always wanted
to become a pastry chef?

506
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,876
No.

507
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:32,244
I had another dream.

508
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:33,959
I gave it up.

509
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:36,255
Really? What was it?

510
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,052
A rapper.

511
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,803
A rapper?

512
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:43,963
I think my raps are pretty unique.

513
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:46,632
But people don't get my swag.

514
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,494
You rapping?

515
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:50,267
I want to hear it.

516
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:53,661
Really? Do you want to hear it?

517
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:55,375
That would be an honor.

518
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:59,201
I'll do a freestyle rap about you.

519
00:23:00,486 --> 00:23:01,669
♪ Yeah

520
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:05,430
♪ Get it. This is Hyeonjun's story

521
00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:09,206
♪ A boy loved bread.
♪ That boy is Hyeonjun Song

522
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:12,290
♪ Hyeonjun loves bread
♪ It's delicious

523
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,666
♪ Baguette, croissant, sausage roll

524
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:18,057
♪ Vegetable buns,
red bean buns, cream buns

525
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:19,267
♪ Bang bang

526
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:20,376
♪ Chew it well

527
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,346
♪ Yum yum

528
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,263
♪ Whoo

529
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,574
Why is it taking them so long to decide?

530
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,240
I don't even want this job.

531
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,882
They're wasting my time.

532
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:43,322
I think the director really liked you.

533
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:46,579
Jungi, buy me a dinner
when you get this job.

534
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,099
Sure.

535
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,999
"Father"

536
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,337
Yes, father. What's going on?

537
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,418
Oh, the commercial?

538
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:03,881
They're still deciding.

539
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:06,441
I'm waiting for them right now.

540
00:24:06,742 --> 00:24:09,216
Don't worry, Mr. Park.

541
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,854
We're going with Jaehyeon.

542
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,712
One moment.

543
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:19,551
Of course. I'm always happy
to help you out.

544
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:23,291
I pushed the director to pick Jaehyeon,
so don't worry.

545
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:26,021
You remember the bag you promised?

546
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:29,387
I'll text you the name of the bag. Bye.

547
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:36,442
Father?

548
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,012
I'm sorry, but can I call you back?

549
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:41,924
Bye.

550
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:50,967
My stomach hurts so much.

551
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:53,463
I can't even breathe anymore.

552
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,622
I'm going to crap my pants
in front of Sua.

553
00:24:56,707 --> 00:24:57,835
That can't happen...

554
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:02,896
My stomach... I've reached my limit.

555
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,363
But Dusik is here.

556
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:05,656
Darn it.

557
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:08,640
Yeah. I have no other choice.

558
00:25:09,037 --> 00:25:10,506
I'll jump out of the car.

559
00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:11,796
Dusik.

560
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:16,375
I'm sorry, but can you take the wheel?

561
00:25:17,854 --> 00:25:19,618
Sure.

562
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:26,319
Min Sua, are you crazy?

563
00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:27,466
What are you doing?

564
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,465
Don't stop me. My stomach hurts so bad.

565
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:31,898
So you're going to jump out of the car?

566
00:25:31,982 --> 00:25:33,361
You're going to kill yourself.

567
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:34,504
I don't care.

568
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:35,797
Die jumping out of the car...

569
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,021
...or die of embarrassment
after I crap my pants in front of you.

570
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:39,307
It's one and the same.

571
00:25:39,391 --> 00:25:41,469
No. I'd rather die jumping out of the car.

572
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:44,013
What are you talking about?
Get it together, Min Sua!

573
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,441
Please don't stop me. Don't stop me!

574
00:25:58,611 --> 00:25:59,879
It stopped.

575
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,794
Right?

576
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,290
It stopped.

577
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,731
We're saved.

578
00:26:05,968 --> 00:26:08,590
-We're saved.
-Dusik!

579
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,081
Tissues.

580
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,674
Tissues.

581
00:26:21,255 --> 00:26:22,541
Found them!

582
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:23,706
Found the tissues!

583
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,166
-Give me one.
-Yeah.

584
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:31,832
There's only one left?

585
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:38,831
Dusik.

586
00:26:41,662 --> 00:26:42,495
No.

587
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,051
I can't give this up.

588
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:48,599
I want to keep my dignity
as a human being.

589
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,676
I'm sorry, Sua.

590
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:52,764
Yes.

591
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:55,347
I wouldn't give it up either.

592
00:26:56,936 --> 00:26:57,860
I understand.

593
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,053
You don't have to feel guilty.

594
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:04,930
I'll manage it somehow.

595
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:10,152
I'll tear up a cement sack.

596
00:27:10,482 --> 00:27:11,525
Min Sua!

597
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:22,364
-Dusik...
-Take it before I change my mind.

598
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:23,837
Take it.

599
00:27:31,638 --> 00:27:33,377
What about you?

600
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,026
I can't move.

601
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:44,514
So, you go ahead.

602
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:46,330
And go far.

603
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,665
As far as possible.

604
00:27:56,824 --> 00:27:57,897
Dusik.

605
00:27:58,633 --> 00:27:59,878
I'm so sorry...

606
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,342
...but I have favor to ask you.

607
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:07,186
Min Sua.

608
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,390
You're unbelievable.

609
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,580
You can't ask me to do this.

610
00:28:16,489 --> 00:28:18,666
You have no conscience.

611
00:28:19,392 --> 00:28:20,876
Dusik!

612
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:23,230
Now!

613
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:37,796
Where's Yuna? It's getting late.

614
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:41,753
What is she doing with Song Hyeonjun?

615
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,135
Oh, Yuna...

616
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:45,561
I'm home.

617
00:28:45,796 --> 00:28:47,759
Donggu, how are you?

618
00:28:48,924 --> 00:28:50,462
No, I'm not good.

619
00:28:51,574 --> 00:28:54,836
Yuna, why are you coming home so late?

620
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,936
Do you know how much chores
got piled up while you were gone?

621
00:28:58,215 --> 00:29:00,821
Sorry, I didn't know it was so late.

622
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,052
Fine.

623
00:29:02,137 --> 00:29:04,996
Get changed and clean up
the kitchen first.

624
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,093
Sure.

625
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,249
See you in class.

626
00:29:09,536 --> 00:29:12,037
-Yuna, here you go.
-Right.

627
00:29:13,456 --> 00:29:14,646
Thank you for the gift.

628
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,941
Don't mention it.

629
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:19,224
I had to give you something
in return for your rap.

630
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:20,651
Thank you.

631
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,208
I'll use it well.

632
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:23,548
See you in class.

633
00:29:30,344 --> 00:29:31,688
I'll get going.

634
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:33,245
Wait. Wait.

635
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:36,458
Song Hyeonjun, we need to talk.

636
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:38,609
Okay. About what?

637
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:44,209
We can't manage the guest house properly
when Yuna comes in late.

638
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:47,489
So, let her leave early from now on.

639
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:50,006
She's my employee.

640
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,991
It's a matter of ethics.

641
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:54,471
Are you that anxious?

642
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:58,255
-What?
-You look anxious.

643
00:29:58,426 --> 00:30:00,766
Obviously, I'm the one
with the disadvantage...

644
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:02,513
...but you're the one
who seems more anxious.

645
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:04,540
I feel pretty good.

646
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:06,149
Have a good evening.

647
00:30:07,025 --> 00:30:07,858
Hey.

648
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,258
What do you mean by that?

649
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,446
We're not done talking.
Where are you going?

650
00:30:13,297 --> 00:30:15,763
What? I look anxious?

651
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:19,619
I'm not anxious.

652
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:21,787
I'm not anxious at all.

653
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,281
Don't make me laugh.

654
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:33,394
Hi, Jungi.

655
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:35,784
Did you get the commercial job?

656
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:39,990
Well...

657
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:43,951
...I didn't get it.

658
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:45,094
But why?

659
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:46,750
You said it was almost confirmed.

660
00:30:46,872 --> 00:30:48,801
It just happened.

661
00:30:48,886 --> 00:30:50,308
What are you talking about?

662
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,036
There must be a reason.

663
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:55,467
What happened was...

664
00:30:57,178 --> 00:30:58,084
What?

665
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:00,821
How can they do that? Those jerks!

666
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:02,461
What can I do?

667
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:05,442
I can't do anything because
I have no money or any strings to pull.

668
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,305
Cheer up, Jungi.

669
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,167
You'll get another good opportunity.

670
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:10,997
I'm fine.

671
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:13,542
I'm totally fine with it.

672
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:16,708
But I'm worried my father
will be disappointed.

673
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,644
He was so happy about it.

674
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,260
Are you just getting back
from the driving lesson?

675
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:32,020
Dusik, why are you dressed like that?

676
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:34,389
Isn't that Sua's coat?

677
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:36,170
Why are you wearing that?

678
00:31:36,506 --> 00:31:37,498
You're right.

679
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:39,327
Dusik, where are your pants?

680
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,501
What have you two been doing?

681
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:43,783
Don't ask.

682
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:46,231
Don't ask us anything.

683
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:48,108
Not a thing.

684
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,172
Sua.

685
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:59,684
I'll wash this coat
and give it back to you tomorrow.

686
00:32:00,823 --> 00:32:01,869
It's okay.

687
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:03,767
You keep it.

688
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,892
I can't wear this again.

689
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:08,960
You can have it.

690
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:13,765
Then, I'll go to my room.

691
00:32:19,891 --> 00:32:20,724
Jungi.

692
00:32:21,822 --> 00:32:26,411
Let's just scrap Rebecca.

693
00:32:27,722 --> 00:32:30,469
What? Why would I scrap my Rebecca?

694
00:32:30,553 --> 00:32:32,261
Don't ask why.

695
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,690
Just do as you're told.

696
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,666
It's for your sake.

697
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,916
Why are you talking nonsense
in a shaman's dress?

698
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:53,974
Cheer up, Jungi.

699
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,087
You'll get another chance
to shoot an commercial.

700
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:57,931
That's right, Jungi.

701
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:00,465
Have some bread.

702
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,185
You didn't eat breakfast.

703
00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:03,434
No, thanks.

704
00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:05,472
I have no appetite.

705
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,118
Isn't that the commercial
you were supposed to shoot?

706
00:33:14,945 --> 00:33:17,073
It is. Columbia Espresso.

707
00:33:17,158 --> 00:33:18,620
-Right?
-I don't know.

708
00:33:19,317 --> 00:33:20,665
I don't want to watch it.

709
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,281
I'll be in my room.

710
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:25,613
What is that?

711
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:32,233
Coffee beans wake up with a smile
as refreshing as morning dew.

712
00:33:35,072 --> 00:33:38,870
Emma roasts freshly-picked
coffee beans every morning.

713
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:43,423
The flavor and aroma are as colorful...

714
00:33:43,508 --> 00:33:46,247
...as the seven colors of a rainbow.

715
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:52,197
Coffee grains melt with a sound
as warm as spring sunshine.

716
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:56,701
Relax with a cup of coffee every morning.

717
00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:59,303
Columbia Espresso.

718
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,831
What was that? That was so tacky.

719
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,496
-What did I just watch?
-Yeah.

720
00:34:03,581 --> 00:34:05,210
It made me cringe.

721
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:07,358
Thank goodness you didn't get the job.

722
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:09,052
What the heck?

723
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:13,481
That guy played dirty to get that job?

724
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:16,126
Yeah. He must be so embarrassed.

725
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:18,807
Come on, he's the best looking
coffee bean I've ever seen.

726
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,613
A smile as refreshing as morning dew.

727
00:34:20,697 --> 00:34:22,516
Facial expressions as colorful
as the rainbow.

728
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,366
A sweet voice that's
as warm as the morning sunlight.

729
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,834
He's perfect.

730
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:28,395
You got your smile back.

731
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,676
Are you happy?

732
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:30,832
Yeah, I'm happy.

733
00:34:31,183 --> 00:34:33,394
I got my appetite back.

734
00:34:35,112 --> 00:34:36,097
It's so good.

735
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:38,417
It's making my taste buds sing.

736
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:46,387
-Help yourself.
-It's making my taste buds sing.

737
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:12,739
What are you doing?

738
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:18,755
It's been 49 days
since Olivia passed away.

739
00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:21,729
Poor Olivia.

740
00:35:22,649 --> 00:35:24,777
I hope she's not hurting in heaven.

741
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,918
Donggu.

742
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:29,989
You know that you're
as weird as me, right?

743
00:35:30,224 --> 00:35:30,955
Right?

744
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,310
How could you say that?

745
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:34,987
You broke my Olivia!

746
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:38,043
I'm going to buy you a better camera
when I make some money.

747
00:35:38,127 --> 00:35:41,434
It's going to take you forever
to make that money.

748
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:44,549
How can I be a film director
without a camera?

749
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:48,620
If I had even a cheap camera,
I'd think less about Olivia.

750
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:51,370
This won't bring your camera back.

751
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,014
That's not why I'm doing this.

752
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:55,977
Jungi! I made something awesome.

753
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:56,913
It's super cool!

754
00:35:56,997 --> 00:35:58,016
Something awesome?

755
00:35:58,218 --> 00:35:59,409
-What is it?
-Want to see?

756
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:00,909
-Follow me.
-What is it?

757
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:03,268
Shut up! I'm mourning.

758
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:09,162
"Lee Jungi"

759
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,303
"Bong Dusik"

760
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:22,647
Ready.

761
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:27,082
Go! Go!

762
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:33,544
Go! Go! Go!

763
00:36:33,629 --> 00:36:34,978
Okay!

764
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:38,963
3.8 seconds! Awesome. It's a new record.

765
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:43,578
Move. It's my turn.

766
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:57,244
Here I go.

767
00:36:57,412 --> 00:36:58,245
Ready.

768
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:00,234
Go!

769
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,555
Go! Go! Go!

770
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,994
What are you doing?

771
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,503
Are you playing skeleton this time?

772
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:22,015
This is not skeleton.
It's called 'cart-ton.'

773
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:23,888
-Dusik made it.
-Shut up.

774
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,079
Why do you always play
these childish games?

775
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:27,645
Do you know how old you are?

776
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:30,454
-31 years old.
-You're not a kid anymore.

777
00:37:32,325 --> 00:37:33,191
Sorry.

778
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:39,166
You know that we're meeting
my friend today, right?

779
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,436
That's today?

780
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:41,852
You forgot already?

781
00:37:42,032 --> 00:37:43,776
Go and get ready.

782
00:37:43,902 --> 00:37:45,897
Okay. Okay.

783
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:56,341
"Bong Dusik", "Lee Jungi"

784
00:37:58,557 --> 00:37:59,609
How's the food?

785
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:01,243
I ate here a few days ago.

786
00:38:01,328 --> 00:38:03,552
I thought it was delicious.

787
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:05,278
It's really good.

788
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:07,175
I get to enjoy this luxury thanks to you.

789
00:38:07,426 --> 00:38:08,583
You're welcome.

790
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:12,724
Seojin talked so much about you
so I was really curious.

791
00:38:12,943 --> 00:38:15,209
You're as awesome as she described.

792
00:38:15,582 --> 00:38:16,569
Thank you.

793
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:19,717
I hear it all the time.

794
00:38:20,787 --> 00:38:22,564
Wow, you're funny too.

795
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:24,291
Girl, I envy you.

796
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:25,603
Gosh, stop.

797
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,635
Jiyeong's boyfriend is a potter.

798
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,811
A potter?

799
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,226
Oh, you're an artist.

800
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,622
Please visit my studio when you're free.

801
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:37,598
-I'll show you around.
-Sure.

802
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,991
We would be honored.

803
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:41,821
I heard you're an actor.

804
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,567
You're in the drama "Newsroom," right?

805
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:45,528
Yes.

806
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:49,489
What dramas have you done before?

807
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:52,212
Do you know this one?

808
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:54,428
Octopus...

809
00:38:54,513 --> 00:38:56,593
Octopus ink!

810
00:38:56,677 --> 00:38:57,669
Gun!

811
00:39:01,438 --> 00:39:03,273
Oh, yeah. The children's TV drama.

812
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:05,089
You were really funny in that.

813
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:09,040
Gosh, no. I'm not that funny.

814
00:39:09,124 --> 00:39:10,463
It's a misunderstanding.

815
00:39:13,538 --> 00:39:15,522
-You're so funny!
-Yeah!

816
00:39:15,607 --> 00:39:18,343
Let me show you another one.

817
00:39:18,428 --> 00:39:19,261
Okay?

818
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,348
You're hilarious!

819
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:32,512
Seojin. What's the matter?

820
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:34,508
Did I do something wrong?

821
00:39:35,008 --> 00:39:36,426
You don't know?

822
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:38,067
What did I do?

823
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:39,758
What's the matter with you?

824
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:42,614
You kept making weird jokes
in front of my friends.

825
00:39:42,698 --> 00:39:45,874
I was trying to lighten to mood
because it was awkward.

826
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:48,206
You didn't have to do that.

827
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:49,465
You're not a clown.

828
00:39:49,938 --> 00:39:51,889
Why is everything a joke to you?

829
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,625
Can't you act more like an adult?

830
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:55,560
Sorry.

831
00:39:56,492 --> 00:39:57,918
I'll be more careful from now on.

832
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,284
That's not good enough.

833
00:40:00,027 --> 00:40:01,160
Can't you just stop all together?

834
00:40:02,368 --> 00:40:03,801
Stop all together?

835
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:06,183
That's a bit...

836
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:10,158
Then I'll only play at home.
That should be fine, right?

837
00:40:11,871 --> 00:40:14,323
Okay. I won't do it.

838
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,518
I won't do anything silly from now on.

839
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:17,882
Okay?

840
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:20,139
You're serious, right?

841
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,789
Promise?

842
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,541
I promise.

843
00:40:26,897 --> 00:40:28,493
You're the best.

844
00:40:39,178 --> 00:40:40,842
It fits!

845
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,564
I can't believe it fits.

846
00:40:44,882 --> 00:40:45,715
Wait.

847
00:40:46,123 --> 00:40:47,874
Why are you two coming in together?

848
00:40:49,765 --> 00:40:51,604
We met in front of the house.

849
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:53,024
Yeah, that's what happened.

850
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:55,801
-Really?
-Yeah.

851
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:57,477
Jungi! Jungi!

852
00:40:57,562 --> 00:40:58,395
Jungi!

853
00:40:58,866 --> 00:41:01,410
Jungi! I've been waiting for you.

854
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:03,356
Let's play cart-ton.

855
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,196
Cart-ton?

856
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:06,588
That sounds fun!

857
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,419
My throat is sore.

858
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:18,257
Dusik, I'm sorry.

859
00:41:19,154 --> 00:41:20,419
I can't play that game anymore.

860
00:41:20,508 --> 00:41:21,341
What?

861
00:41:21,886 --> 00:41:22,791
Why?

862
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:26,451
I won't play any of these games
from now on.

863
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:28,618
You can play by yourself.

864
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,609
Jungi. Jungi!

865
00:41:33,743 --> 00:41:35,357
What's the matter?

866
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:37,207
Jungi, what's the matter?

867
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:49,907
Yuna.

868
00:41:50,238 --> 00:41:51,350
You're still here.

869
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:54,105
Yes. I wanted to finish these.

870
00:41:54,653 --> 00:41:55,486
Okay.

871
00:41:55,588 --> 00:41:56,581
I almost forgot.

872
00:41:57,362 --> 00:41:59,217
I have something for you.

873
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:01,619
This is yours.

874
00:42:03,595 --> 00:42:04,519
What is it?

875
00:42:04,604 --> 00:42:06,597
Your share of the profit
from selling your muffins.

876
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:08,092
It's not much.

877
00:42:09,556 --> 00:42:11,036
Go on, take it.

878
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:15,214
I don't know if it's okay
for me to take this.

879
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:18,205
Of course it's okay. You earned it.

880
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,038
Go on, take it.

881
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:21,900
Ow, my arm hurts.

882
00:42:21,984 --> 00:42:23,770
I'm dropping it.

883
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,051
Thank you.

884
00:42:28,737 --> 00:42:30,210
Thank you so much.

885
00:42:39,145 --> 00:42:41,620
Jungi. Play one game of cart-ton with me.

886
00:42:47,487 --> 00:42:49,007
I said I don't want to.

887
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:50,646
Come on, Jungi.

888
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:52,825
Why are you doing this?

889
00:42:53,216 --> 00:42:56,023
I stopped playing these silly games.

890
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,839
You're cruel.

891
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:00,168
You've changed.

892
00:43:11,863 --> 00:43:13,226
I'm home.

893
00:43:13,332 --> 00:43:14,301
Hi, Yuna.

894
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:16,371
What's all this?

895
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:18,395
I got my share of the profit
from selling my muffins.

896
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:21,030
So, I bought gifts for you.

897
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:37,986
How is it?

898
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:39,272
Do you guys like it?

899
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:42,438
Sure. I love it.

900
00:43:42,523 --> 00:43:44,488
I'm going to wear it everyday.

901
00:43:48,611 --> 00:43:51,048
I've always wanted an elephant hat.

902
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:52,774
Thanks, Yuna.

903
00:43:53,723 --> 00:43:54,678
Me too.

904
00:43:55,954 --> 00:43:58,326
I've always wanted this Mimi hand mirror.

905
00:43:58,411 --> 00:43:59,837
How did you know?

906
00:44:00,577 --> 00:44:02,073
I love it.

907
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:03,659
But, what is it?

908
00:44:04,038 --> 00:44:04,940
How do I use it?

909
00:44:05,024 --> 00:44:06,167
Is it a blusher brush?

910
00:44:06,592 --> 00:44:07,899
It's a shaving brush.

911
00:44:07,983 --> 00:44:09,385
You can apply shaving cream with it.

912
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:11,469
Shaving brush?

913
00:44:11,554 --> 00:44:14,070
It's made with badger hair.

914
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,320
So it applies shaving cream smoothly.

915
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:18,723
I see.

916
00:44:19,277 --> 00:44:23,361
I can't wait to apply shaving cream
with badger hair.

917
00:44:25,385 --> 00:44:27,183
I knew you'd love it.

918
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:30,192
I'm pretty good at choosing gifts.

919
00:44:33,227 --> 00:44:35,816
Is Donggu in his room?

920
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,979
I bought a gift for him.

921
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,041
How is it?

922
00:44:42,214 --> 00:44:43,254
Do you like it?

923
00:44:44,225 --> 00:44:45,058
Huh?

924
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:49,186
Absolutely. I adore baby chicks.

925
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:51,300
That's why I don't eat fried chicken.

926
00:44:51,986 --> 00:44:54,726
I knew you'd like it.

927
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,528
Donggu, are you free tomorrow?

928
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,236
Why do you ask?

929
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:02,457
You've done so much for me.

930
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:04,178
So, I want to buy you lunch.

931
00:45:04,263 --> 00:45:05,150
Lunch?

932
00:45:06,813 --> 00:45:08,751
You don't have to.

933
00:45:09,012 --> 00:45:10,613
Where and what time shall we meet?

934
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:21,879
This is so embarrassing.

935
00:45:22,527 --> 00:45:25,189
I look like a 10-year-old.

936
00:45:27,294 --> 00:45:30,339
Yuna gave it to me as a gift,
so I have to wear it.

937
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,763
Donggu.

938
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:35,780
Hi, Yuna.

939
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,536
Sorry I'm late.

940
00:45:41,237 --> 00:45:42,899
You're wearing the sweatshirt.

941
00:45:42,984 --> 00:45:46,100
Yes, I loved it so much that I had to wear it.

942
00:45:47,517 --> 00:45:49,200
What shall we eat?

943
00:45:49,285 --> 00:45:50,435
Wait.

944
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:53,951
He should be here by now.

945
00:45:54,712 --> 00:45:56,721
Is someone else coming?

946
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:58,392
Yuna.

947
00:45:59,653 --> 00:46:00,691
Hi, Hyeonjun.

948
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:12,569
Why are you here?

949
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:14,205
Why are you here?

950
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:19,512
Hyeonjun called and asked to have lunch
together while I am on my way here.

951
00:46:19,616 --> 00:46:21,865
So, I thought the three of us could have
lunch together.

952
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,525
-Is that okay?
-Yeah, sure.

953
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,169
Oh, okay.

954
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,613
Why are you wearing that...

955
00:46:27,697 --> 00:46:31,808
I thought it was cute
so I gave one to Hyeonjun too.

956
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:34,724
I had no idea both of you
were going to wear it today.

957
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,561
You both love it, huh?

958
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:41,168
Of course I love it.

959
00:46:41,694 --> 00:46:44,987
I really love it. It has a chick.

960
00:46:45,576 --> 00:46:46,943
Let's go to lunch.

961
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:47,861
-Shall we?
-Okay.

962
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:51,609
Why did you wear that?

963
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,109
Oh my. What are you doing?

964
00:47:02,941 --> 00:47:04,180
We need to talk.

965
00:47:04,265 --> 00:47:06,023
Let go of me.

966
00:47:09,656 --> 00:47:12,687
Don't grab my arm. People are watching.

967
00:47:12,772 --> 00:47:16,500
Why are you trying to sit next to Yuna?

968
00:47:16,696 --> 00:47:18,278
I was just taking a seat.

969
00:47:18,363 --> 00:47:20,326
One of us has to sit there anyway.

970
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,033
Why do you get to be
the one to sit there?

971
00:47:23,118 --> 00:47:24,776
Then what do you suggest?

972
00:47:24,861 --> 00:47:27,777
Hyeonjun. I know that
we're rivals in love...

973
00:47:27,862 --> 00:47:30,055
...but let's play fair like real men.

974
00:47:30,143 --> 00:47:31,098
Play fair.

975
00:47:31,335 --> 00:47:32,389
Fair?

976
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:40,359
It's my treat, so help yourselves.

977
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:41,625
-Yes.
-Thanks.

978
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,066
I got a call.

979
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,888
I need to take this call. Excuse me.

980
00:47:49,973 --> 00:47:50,806
-What?
-Sorry?

981
00:47:52,853 --> 00:47:54,648
People might misunderstand...

982
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:03,481
This is so embarrassing.

983
00:48:05,876 --> 00:48:08,417
Don't touch my arm.

984
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:09,829
I can't help it. This table is too small.

985
00:48:09,913 --> 00:48:11,777
Do your best not to touch me.

986
00:48:15,238 --> 00:48:17,564
I got the inspiration for this piece...

987
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:20,379
...from Peter Voulkos,
the master of modern ceramics.

988
00:48:21,228 --> 00:48:24,308
I wanted to add Korean beauty
to his abstractionism.

989
00:48:24,392 --> 00:48:26,439
Oh, I see.

990
00:48:27,436 --> 00:48:29,140
-Would you like to see those too?
-Sure.

991
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:30,872
Seojin.

992
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:33,373
Don't I look like Uhm Jeonghwa?

993
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:34,678
-Put them down.
-Yes, ma'am.

994
00:48:36,353 --> 00:48:37,915
I told you not to joke around.

995
00:48:39,212 --> 00:48:40,045
Sorry.

996
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,970
What are you doing by yourself?

997
00:49:15,788 --> 00:49:16,720
Nothing.

998
00:49:17,562 --> 00:49:19,757
It's no fun playing by myself.

999
00:49:21,355 --> 00:49:23,194
I want to play cart-ton.

1000
00:49:25,243 --> 00:49:26,697
Can I play with you?

1001
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:28,866
Really?

1002
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:46,707
I'm good, aren't I?

1003
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:48,280
-Should I do it again?
-No.

1004
00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:50,430
Forget it. Let's just stop.

1005
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,946
It's no fun with you.

1006
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:54,888
What? Why?

1007
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:57,928
You lack...

1008
00:49:59,068 --> 00:50:01,206
...the excitement that Jungi has.

1009
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,124
What?

1010
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:03,501
Excitement?

1011
00:50:03,729 --> 00:50:06,054
It's just a stupid cart.

1012
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,515
What? A stupid cart?

1013
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:10,009
Take that back.

1014
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,444
What... What did I say?

1015
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:14,701
Forget it.

1016
00:50:15,331 --> 00:50:17,118
This is why you're no fun.

1017
00:50:20,194 --> 00:50:21,187
Gosh.

1018
00:50:21,528 --> 00:50:24,575
This is what I get for being
nice enough to play with him?

1019
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:32,319
Did you like the food?

1020
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,820
Yes, it was delicious.

1021
00:50:34,905 --> 00:50:37,310
It'd have been even better
without certain someone.

1022
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:41,637
I enjoyed it too.

1023
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:43,874
Right back at you.

1024
00:50:47,106 --> 00:50:48,585
Bicycles.

1025
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,549
It looks fun.

1026
00:50:52,346 --> 00:50:53,964
Do you want to ride a bike?

1027
00:50:54,048 --> 00:50:56,630
Watching people ride is making
me want to ride too.

1028
00:50:56,715 --> 00:50:58,400
-Then...
-Let's ride bikes.

1029
00:50:58,947 --> 00:51:00,024
I'll go and rent them.

1030
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:12,414
There you go, Hyeonjun.

1031
00:51:12,763 --> 00:51:13,925
Yuna, let's go.

1032
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:14,918
Okay.

1033
00:51:21,142 --> 00:51:23,087
Why do you get the tandem bike?

1034
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,285
They were the only ones left.
What am I suppose to do?

1035
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:30,485
You're going to ride
the tandem bike with Yuna?

1036
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:31,291
That's right.

1037
00:51:31,376 --> 00:51:33,930
You said we should play fair
like real men.

1038
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:35,987
Then what do you suggest?

1039
00:51:40,989 --> 00:51:43,227
Isn't this a bit much?

1040
00:51:45,379 --> 00:51:49,112
You were the one who wanted to play fair.

1041
00:51:49,298 --> 00:51:52,472
Never mind. Just work the pedals.

1042
00:51:57,172 --> 00:51:58,515
This is so embarrassing.

1043
00:52:01,904 --> 00:52:03,896
What the hell are you doing?

1044
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,451
Why are you burying your face on my back?

1045
00:52:06,535 --> 00:52:07,778
Please let's just keep going.

1046
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:09,745
People are getting the wrong idea.

1047
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:11,405
You're so weird.

1048
00:52:11,489 --> 00:52:13,055
-My gosh.
-Just keep going.

1049
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:13,973
Geez.

1050
00:52:18,223 --> 00:52:19,784
Thank you for inviting us today.

1051
00:52:19,872 --> 00:52:20,977
I really enjoyed it.

1052
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:23,375
I'll invite you to my next exhibition.
You have to come.

1053
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:24,921
Of course.

1054
00:52:25,005 --> 00:52:26,243
It would be our pleasure.

1055
00:52:26,587 --> 00:52:28,879
How's the life as a reporter?

1056
00:52:29,381 --> 00:52:30,611
It's hectic.

1057
00:52:30,695 --> 00:52:33,550
I had no idea this job was this rough.

1058
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:35,888
-Is it a lot of work?
-Yeah.

1059
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:38,322
How long have you two been dating?

1060
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:57,306
- What's wrong?
- My tooth... My tooth...

1061
00:52:57,704 --> 00:52:58,809
What's wrong with your tooth?

1062
00:53:02,736 --> 00:53:05,092
Oh my god. Did your tooth just fall out?

1063
00:53:06,602 --> 00:53:10,597
It's not my tooth. It's not my tooth

1064
00:53:10,682 --> 00:53:14,038
It's a pine nut. It's a pine nut.

1065
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:16,581
Oh my gosh.

1066
00:53:16,669 --> 00:53:17,699
You surprised me.

1067
00:53:17,783 --> 00:53:20,264
Jungi, you're hilarious.

1068
00:53:20,474 --> 00:53:21,972
It's funny, huh?

1069
00:53:22,057 --> 00:53:24,095
It's not a pine nut,
I mean, it is a pine nut.

1070
00:53:24,179 --> 00:53:25,484
It's funny, huh?

1071
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,538
Pine nut, pine nut.

1072
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:31,041
Jungi, what are you doing?

1073
00:53:31,288 --> 00:53:32,787
Why are you smiling?

1074
00:53:36,426 --> 00:53:37,715
It's nothing.

1075
00:53:39,757 --> 00:53:40,784
Full of love.

1076
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:43,620
How nice. I'm loved too.

1077
00:53:48,521 --> 00:53:49,604
It's so refreshing.

1078
00:53:50,623 --> 00:53:54,315
It feels great to ride a bike
and have a beer. Right?

1079
00:53:54,404 --> 00:53:55,481
Totally.

1080
00:53:56,265 --> 00:53:59,236
It'd have been even better
without certain someone.

1081
00:54:01,627 --> 00:54:04,875
Let's ride bikes and drink beer
from time to time.

1082
00:54:05,181 --> 00:54:06,014
I'd like that.

1083
00:54:06,553 --> 00:54:09,177
Just the two of us.

1084
00:54:10,032 --> 00:54:12,550
Sorry but I need to go to the bathroom.

1085
00:54:12,635 --> 00:54:13,676
Okay.

1086
00:54:20,402 --> 00:54:24,109
Thank you for coming to our bar tonight.

1087
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:29,406
You all know that today's
our first anniversary, right?

1088
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,723
Yes!

1089
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:33,409
As we promised...

1090
00:54:33,494 --> 00:54:39,076
...we'll have a couple's event
with amazing prizes!

1091
00:54:40,192 --> 00:54:41,678
It's so loud.

1092
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:44,097
Why are they doing this in a bar?

1093
00:54:44,653 --> 00:54:45,706
Tell me about it.

1094
00:54:45,797 --> 00:54:47,512
I wanted to drink quietly.

1095
00:54:47,596 --> 00:54:51,922
The first prize that goes
to the winner of this event is...

1096
00:54:52,507 --> 00:54:56,794
...the latest model of DSLR!

1097
00:54:57,904 --> 00:54:58,862
The prize...

1098
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:00,717
...is a camera?

1099
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:05,418
Couples who'd like to participate
in this event, come to the front.

1100
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:08,105
I have to enter.

1101
00:55:08,334 --> 00:55:10,867
Why is Yuna taking so long?!

1102
00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:12,157
Why?

1103
00:55:12,406 --> 00:55:14,358
You want to enter
the couple's event with Yuna?

1104
00:55:14,443 --> 00:55:18,184
Yes. I really need a camera.

1105
00:55:18,444 --> 00:55:19,719
But that's still not fair.

1106
00:55:19,803 --> 00:55:22,133
You can't just decide to enter
the couple's event with Yuna.

1107
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,326
No, I don't mean to do anything with her.

1108
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:25,985
I just need the camera. That's all.

1109
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,649
Please be understanding just this once.

1110
00:55:28,082 --> 00:55:31,762
We'll wait for 30 seconds and begin.

1111
00:55:31,846 --> 00:55:33,090
Yuna is not here yet.

1112
00:55:33,174 --> 00:55:34,647
What do I do?

1113
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,267
Looks like she's not coming.

1114
00:55:41,095 --> 00:55:42,067
Wait.

1115
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,653
What?

1116
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:45,824
Why are you looking at me like that?

1117
00:55:45,908 --> 00:55:46,877
Hyeonjun.

1118
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:49,479
Can you be my partner
for the couple's event?

1119
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:50,938
What?

1120
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:53,362
Have you gone nuts? That's ridiculous.

1121
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:55,487
Don't be mean.

1122
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:56,928
We are rivals in love...

1123
00:55:57,013 --> 00:55:59,834
...but you can enter the couple's event
for me just this once.

1124
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,791
No, I can't do that.

1125
00:56:04,885 --> 00:56:06,844
I really need that camera.

1126
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:09,000
I really need that camera, Hyeonjun.

1127
00:56:09,084 --> 00:56:10,357
All right. Ten.

1128
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:13,000
Nine.

1129
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:15,806
This is too weird.

1130
00:56:15,891 --> 00:56:16,724
Eight.

1131
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:18,342
All right, fine.

1132
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,820
If we ever have a chance
to ride bikes again...

1133
00:56:22,189 --> 00:56:24,287
...you can take the tandem bicycle.

1134
00:56:24,656 --> 00:56:25,497
Really?

1135
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,591
Then can I sit next to Yuna?

1136
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:28,590
What?

1137
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:31,104
-You're being too greedy.
-Forget it then.

1138
00:56:31,189 --> 00:56:32,052
Three.

1139
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:35,006
Deal. But we have to win.

1140
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,627
-Two.
-Deal.

1141
00:56:37,016 --> 00:56:38,219
One!

1142
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,396
-Wait!
-Wait!

1143
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:43,934
Okay. The couple that maintains
this pose till the end...

1144
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:48,628
...will win the the latest model of DSLR.
So hold on as long as you can.

1145
00:56:48,712 --> 00:56:49,689
Don't fall.

1146
00:56:50,457 --> 00:56:52,432
Hyeonjun, are you doing okay?

1147
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:54,692
Yes, I'm fine.

1148
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:58,447
I'll stand up here if it kills me.
Donggu, hang in there.

1149
00:56:58,957 --> 00:56:59,790
Sure.

1150
00:56:59,938 --> 00:57:02,632
I will maintain this position
even it means losing my legs.

1151
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:04,710
-We got this!
-We got this!

1152
00:57:04,795 --> 00:57:06,995
Let's go!

1153
00:57:14,317 --> 00:57:15,473
You're sweating.

1154
00:57:15,661 --> 00:57:16,700
Thank you.

1155
00:57:18,575 --> 00:57:20,381
-We can do this!
-We got this!

1156
00:57:20,465 --> 00:57:23,293
-We got this!
-We got this!

1157
00:57:25,836 --> 00:57:27,285
Where is everyone?

1158
00:57:28,285 --> 00:57:29,982
I'm hungry.

1159
00:57:30,203 --> 00:57:31,892
Do you want to eat ramyeon?

1160
00:57:32,418 --> 00:57:33,852
I have no appetite.

1161
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:36,436
I'll just go to bed.

1162
00:57:36,841 --> 00:57:38,659
Oh, okay.

1163
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:44,702
Jungi.

1164
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:49,514
Dusik...

1165
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,038
"Lee Junggi"

1166
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:33,244
3.8 seconds!

1167
00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:35,641
Awesome! It's a new record!

1168
00:58:37,135 --> 00:58:37,968
Junggi.

1169
00:58:40,564 --> 00:58:42,133
Should I feed you?

1170
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:44,949
-Kiss me.
-Oh my god.

1171
00:58:51,459 --> 00:58:53,314
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

1172
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:56,643
How long do we have to do this?!

1173
00:58:56,916 --> 00:58:58,523
It's okay. Stop crying.

1174
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:01,717
Don't cry. Think positively.

1175
00:59:04,629 --> 00:59:05,462
Jackpot!

1176
00:59:39,767 --> 00:59:40,600
What's this?

1177
00:59:40,826 --> 00:59:41,860
What happened to him?

1178
00:59:42,142 --> 00:59:45,135
He got dehydrated.

1179
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,218
Dehydrated?

1180
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:47,984
What was he doing?

1181
00:59:48,623 --> 00:59:50,332
I'll tell you later.

1182
00:59:50,709 --> 00:59:51,788
Yuna.

1183
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:54,293
I'll put him on his bed.

1184
00:59:54,547 --> 00:59:56,564
Okay. I'll bring some water.

1185
00:59:56,648 --> 00:59:57,561
Okay.

1186
01:00:02,096 --> 01:00:03,867
So heavy.

1187
01:00:08,732 --> 01:00:09,957
Matilda.

1188
01:00:10,533 --> 01:00:12,864
-Matilda.
-Then I'm Leon.

1189
01:00:14,055 --> 01:00:15,776
What are you doing?

1190
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,568
You can leave now.

1191
01:00:17,653 --> 01:00:21,307
Aren't you being too harsh?

1192
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:23,556
I carried you all the way up here...

1193
01:00:23,641 --> 01:00:25,843
...and I helped you win the camera.

1194
01:00:26,301 --> 01:00:29,449
The least you can do is thank me.

1195
01:00:29,533 --> 01:00:32,169
Thank you? As if.

1196
01:00:32,611 --> 01:00:35,252
It was my first date with Yuna.

1197
01:00:35,336 --> 01:00:38,482
But it's all ruined because of you.

1198
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:40,131
That's what I want to say.

1199
01:00:40,216 --> 01:00:42,539
You're unbelievable.

1200
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:45,575
Tell me now, Yuna.

1201
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:47,328
Tell me.

1202
01:00:49,243 --> 01:00:51,023
What the heck am I seeing?

1203
01:00:51,688 --> 01:00:53,697
They're like newlyweds.

1204
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:55,517
When did they become so close?

1205
01:01:04,767 --> 01:01:07,169
Where's Donggu?
Is he still sleeping?

1206
01:01:07,306 --> 01:01:10,088
Yeah, he's still sleeping
in Hyeonjun's arms.

1207
01:01:11,407 --> 01:01:13,885
They'll become best friends.

1208
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,072
Those two can never be friends.

1209
01:01:16,618 --> 01:01:18,642
Why not? What do you mean?

1210
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:20,977
Nothing.

1211
01:01:22,819 --> 01:01:25,202
Jungi, have some breakfast. Sit down.

1212
01:01:25,287 --> 01:01:26,365
Oh, I...

1213
01:01:30,366 --> 01:01:31,231
Dusik...

1214
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,469
What's wrong?

1215
01:01:41,607 --> 01:01:42,489
Are you sick?

1216
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:43,742
You don't look good.

1217
01:01:43,827 --> 01:01:45,920
Yeah. Is something wrong?

1218
01:01:47,228 --> 01:01:48,840
No, I'm fine.

1219
01:01:56,136 --> 01:01:57,690
Jungi! What's wrong?

1220
01:01:57,775 --> 01:01:59,235
Jungi, wake up!

1221
01:02:01,094 --> 01:02:02,933
We ran some tests.

1222
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:05,067
He has elevated liver enzymes
and high blood pressure.

1223
01:02:05,152 --> 01:02:06,989
His health is not good overall.

1224
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:09,405
But we don't know
what is causing his condition.

1225
01:02:09,494 --> 01:02:10,327
What?

1226
01:02:10,487 --> 01:02:12,290
You don't know the cause?

1227
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:15,689
A person's health can't deteriorate
this fast over night.

1228
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:18,365
Usually, stress is the cause
in cases like this.

1229
01:02:18,455 --> 01:02:23,331
Did he experience anything shocking
or traumatizing recently?

1230
01:02:23,619 --> 01:02:26,329
- There is one thing.
- What is it?

1231
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:28,548
He loves joking around and playing games,

1232
01:02:28,632 --> 01:02:30,244
...but I made him promise to stop.

1233
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:31,643
Now that I think about it,

1234
01:02:31,727 --> 01:02:34,858
he got quieter and
lost his energy since then.

1235
01:02:34,942 --> 01:02:37,147
That was a big shock for him.
I'm sure of it.

1236
01:02:37,232 --> 01:02:38,065
Really?

1237
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:41,677
He's sick because I wouldn't
let him joke around?

1238
01:02:41,761 --> 01:02:45,242
This is a very rare case,
but that's the only plausible cause.

1239
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:49,756
Perhaps joking around is
everything in his life.

1240
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,511
Everything in his life?

1241
01:02:52,038 --> 01:02:53,370
-Jokes?
-Right.

1242
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:56,973
"Intensive Care Unit"

1243
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:59,445
Hey.

1244
01:03:02,469 --> 01:03:03,313
What did he say?

1245
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:05,330
Is it serious?

1246
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:06,251
Yeah.

1247
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:07,971
He said you could die.

1248
01:03:09,098 --> 01:03:09,931
What?

1249
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,322
Do I have a terminal disease?

1250
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:14,889
They can't fix me with surgery?

1251
01:03:14,974 --> 01:03:15,992
No.

1252
01:03:16,285 --> 01:03:18,194
You'll get better if you just make
jokes and play games.

1253
01:03:18,355 --> 01:03:19,188
What?

1254
01:03:20,061 --> 01:03:21,150
What do you mean?

1255
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:23,633
You're sick because I stopped you
from joking around.

1256
01:03:23,943 --> 01:03:27,543
So, just do whatever you want now.

1257
01:03:27,748 --> 01:03:28,581
Really?

1258
01:03:29,545 --> 01:03:30,508
Can I?

1259
01:03:30,616 --> 01:03:33,176
I don't want you to die.

1260
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:36,339
So, act silly as much as you want.

1261
01:03:36,423 --> 01:03:37,526
Thank you, Seojin.

1262
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:39,115
Thank you so much.

1263
01:03:39,743 --> 01:03:44,087
I actually wanted to try something.

1264
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:45,439
Can I do it?

1265
01:03:45,524 --> 01:03:47,151
Go ahead. Do whatever you want.

1266
01:03:47,235 --> 01:03:48,068
Yes!

1267
01:03:52,436 --> 01:03:53,772
Seojin, look.

1268
01:03:53,857 --> 01:03:55,165
It looks like I'm flying, huh?

1269
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,737
Seojin, do it on the other side.

1270
01:04:12,538 --> 01:04:13,960
Eat some.

1271
01:04:14,339 --> 01:04:16,568
You haven't eaten all day.

1272
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:17,587
No, thanks.

1273
01:04:18,577 --> 01:04:19,546
I have no appetite.

1274
01:04:19,631 --> 01:04:21,430
What's going on with you?

1275
01:04:21,514 --> 01:04:22,627
Is something wrong?

1276
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:23,605
I don't know.

1277
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:25,929
I have no energy.

1278
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,331
And no appetite either.

1279
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:31,668
Dusik!

1280
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:37,963
Jungi!

1281
01:04:38,728 --> 01:04:39,561
Dusik.

1282
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:41,482
I'm sorry.

1283
01:04:41,853 --> 01:04:43,413
You resented me, didn't you?

1284
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,353
What?

1285
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:46,723
Does this mean you're back?

1286
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,985
To the old Lee Jungi that I knew?

1287
01:04:52,629 --> 01:04:53,723
Really?

1288
01:04:54,701 --> 01:04:57,311
-Really?
-Yes!

1289
01:04:57,751 --> 01:05:00,938
Dusik, we haven't played
cart-ton in a long time.

1290
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:02,907
Let's play!

1291
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,052
Let's play!

1292
01:05:06,643 --> 01:05:07,476
Oh, right.

1293
01:05:07,758 --> 01:05:10,357
I made some upgrades to the game.

1294
01:05:11,415 --> 01:05:12,575
Do you want to try?

1295
01:05:14,514 --> 01:05:15,961
Let's go!

1296
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,719
Let's try the upgrades!

1297
01:05:18,172 --> 01:05:20,502
-With you!
-With you!

1298
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:21,469
Oh, I forgot.

1299
01:05:21,748 --> 01:05:22,943
I was going to give you this.

1300
01:05:38,175 --> 01:05:39,424
Here we go.

1301
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,043
Ready.

1302
01:05:43,479 --> 01:05:44,312
Go!

1303
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:55,741
Did you see that?
I knocked down all the pins.

1304
01:05:55,825 --> 01:05:57,614
That's called "cart-strike."

1305
01:05:57,698 --> 01:05:59,834
It's the highest score in "cart-bowling."

1306
01:05:59,919 --> 01:06:02,216
If you hit two "cart-strikes"
then it's "double cart-strike."

1307
01:06:02,301 --> 01:06:04,387
Three "cart-strikes,"
is "turkey cart-strike."

1308
01:06:04,472 --> 01:06:06,381
So structured. Awesome.

1309
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,387
-I want to try it.
-Come.

1310
01:06:11,317 --> 01:06:12,854
Here. It's your turn.

1311
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:15,257
I'll get the pins ready.

1312
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:16,457
Get ready.

1313
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:17,422
Thanks.

1314
01:06:22,322 --> 01:06:23,188
Sua.

1315
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:25,915
Why do men play these games?

1316
01:06:27,682 --> 01:06:30,916
They don't understand
why women are crazy about shopping.

1317
01:06:31,511 --> 01:06:32,555
So...

1318
01:06:33,314 --> 01:06:34,691
...just let them be.

1319
01:06:45,023 --> 01:06:46,259
Cart-strike!

1320
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:10,118
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1321
01:07:10,203 --> 01:07:12,224
I said I can shave myself.
Look what happened!

1322
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:13,346
I didn't do it on purpose.

1323
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:14,488
Is that all you can say, jerk?

1324
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:15,779
Did you just call me a jerk?

1325
01:07:15,863 --> 01:07:16,700
Let's break up.

1326
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:17,832
Let's just break up!

1327
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:19,613
Fine! Let's break up!

1328
01:07:19,698 --> 01:07:21,567
Donggu. We were joking around.

1329
01:07:21,652 --> 01:07:22,567
You were joking around?

1330
01:07:22,652 --> 01:07:25,386
-Come in.
-This is nice. Nicely decorated.

1331
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,361
What's that smell?

1332
01:07:27,717 --> 01:07:28,903
Is it coming from his shoes?

1333
01:07:29,957 --> 01:07:32,120
Then that rotten feet smell is his?

1334
01:07:32,204 --> 01:07:33,728
We need to take his photos.

1335
01:07:33,813 --> 01:07:34,710
Two, three.

1336
01:07:35,311 --> 01:07:39,215
I told you that I don't want
to owe you anything.
