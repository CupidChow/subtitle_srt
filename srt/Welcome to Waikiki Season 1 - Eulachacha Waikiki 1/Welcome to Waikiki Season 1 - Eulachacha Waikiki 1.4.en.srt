1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,645
We're showing you this product live.

2
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:09,078
These are the Auto Hip-up
high elasticity pants.

3
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:12,112
As you can see,
the design is very sleek.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,531
Let's take a look.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,579
What do you think?

6
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,880
These hips are shooting up to the sky.

7
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:23,112
This is the power
of the Auto Hip-up design.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,346
-Plus, it's super stretchy.
-Ouch.

9
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:26,935
They're made of high elasticity material.

10
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:31,079
You won't feel uncomfortable
when you're exercising or hiking.

11
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,613
You don't believe me?

12
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:34,868
Then we'll show you a demonstration.

13
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:37,944
Look at this.

14
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:41,700
They're not feeling uncomfortable
even when they're stretching like this.

15
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:43,777
You still don't believe it?

16
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:45,735
One, two, three!

17
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:48,635
Oh my gosh.

18
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,402
Darn it.

19
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:59,734
Today, we've prepared the pants,

20
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:02,776
in blue, black, and sky blue.

21
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:06,259
These are the colours
we have available today.

22
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,143
Jesus, Buddha,
please let me get one interview.

23
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:13,279
I'll go to church and temple every week.

24
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:16,057
Namuamitabul Gwanseumbosal.

25
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:17,334
Amen.

26
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:20,146
Seojin, what are you doing?

27
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:21,068
I'm praying.

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,536
I just submitted job applications
to 25 companies.

29
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,087
Hope you get an interview.

30
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:29,112
Oh, it's him.

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,780
He's a great actor.

32
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:31,968
What was his name?

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,968
-Lee... Lee...
-Him?

34
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:35,232
Uncle Deokhwa?

35
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:36,653
Uncle Deokhwa?

36
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:37,613
You know him personally?

37
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:39,280
He's Jungi's father.

38
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:41,612
What? He's Jungi's father?

39
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:43,567
That's so cool.

40
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,306
I'll ask Jungi for his father's autograph.

41
00:01:46,395 --> 00:01:47,241
Don't.

42
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,011
Jungi doesn't like
talking about his father.

43
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,960
Why not?

44
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,212
The thing is...

45
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,231
-Uncle Deokhwa...
-Okay. Thanks.

46
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:57,508
What's going on?

47
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,082
What is this awkward air?

48
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,197
Is it just my imagination?

49
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,579
Seojin, you were badmouthing me,
weren't you?

50
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:05,678
What did you tell her?

51
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:06,767
You hairy beast!

52
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:07,820
I didn't say anything.

53
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:10,011
You better tell me
before I give you a good scolding.

54
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,880
Something amazing happened!

55
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:13,569
Why are you making a big fuss?

56
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,579
-Jungi, you are a star.
-What?

57
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:16,501
Look.

58
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:19,746
-What is it?
-Who is this home shopping model guy?

59
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,041
You are so weird.

60
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:22,401
Wow.

61
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,345
-Jungi...
-What's this?

62
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:26,545
This is so funny.

63
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:27,703
What the hell?!

64
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,945
-What is this?!
-Your face is all over the Internet.

65
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:32,845
You even have a nickname.
You want to know what it is?

66
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,888
'Pink Boy.' Hey, Pink Boy.

67
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,099
What boy?

68
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,068
-This is so...
-Don't look!

69
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:42,202
They photoshopped it so well...

70
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:45,332
Hello?

71
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:47,435
Yes.

72
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,047
Don't!

73
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:50,298
This is he.

74
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,535
What?

75
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:55,766
Okay. Thank you.

76
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:58,579
What is it? Who was it?

77
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,700
A movie production company.

78
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,842
They want to cast me.

79
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,044
They saw me and they were impressed.

80
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,578
They saw you?

81
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,246
-Where?
-On the home shopping channel.

82
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:08,439
Home shopping?

83
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,978
You mean they saw Pink Boy
and decided to hire you?

84
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:13,626
-No way.
-Stop calling me that.

85
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:15,840
"My Mother"
Here you go.

86
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,796
These are the scenario
and shooting schedule.

87
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:21,233
You're really casting me
without an audition?

88
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,945
Do you think I'm scamming you?

89
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:26,280
No, that's not what I meant.

90
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:29,702
What's my role?

91
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:32,479
This movie is
about a mother taking revenge,

92
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:34,567
after her daughter gets kidnapped.

93
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,112
You're one of the kidnappers.

94
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,646
Do I have lines?

95
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,267
Not a lot, but you do have some.

96
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:41,978
You have a fight scene
with the main character.

97
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:44,545
Who plays the main role?

98
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:45,468
The main actress?

99
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:48,412
Kim Heeja.

100
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:49,662
Kim Heeja?

101
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,580
Kim Heeja from 'The Desert'?

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,309
The greatest method actor in Korea.

103
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:55,346
-That Kim Heeja?
-Yes.

104
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:58,245
So you'd better practice
your acting skills.

105
00:03:58,334 --> 00:03:59,979
-Understand?
-Yes.

106
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,167
I'll do my best!

107
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:02,748
Thank you!

108
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:08,568
What do you think?

109
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:09,825
Does it taste good?

110
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:11,518
Yes...

111
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:13,343
It's delicious...

112
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:16,823
Yuna, can't we eat rice?

113
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:20,058
We've been eating bread
for the last few days, so...

114
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,694
Shut up and eat.

115
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,279
What if she starts rapping again?

116
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:25,878
Okay. I'll just eat.

117
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,269
I baked a lot. Help yourselves.

118
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:30,712
Guys!

119
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,340
Guys!

120
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:34,096
Something amazing happened!

121
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,910
I got a part in a movie!

122
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:38,578
Guess who plays the main role.

123
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,845
The greatest method actor in Korea.

124
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:42,349
It's none other than Kim Heeja!

125
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,345
Kim Heeja!

126
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:44,713
-Kim Hee...
-Kim Heeja? Really?

127
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:47,445
-What's your role?
-I get killed by her.

128
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,513
I thought so.
It's another small role, huh?

129
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:51,007
I have lines this time.

130
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:52,734
Anyway, that's great.

131
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,446
Shouldn't we have a party to celebrate?

132
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:56,197
How about some spicy stew
with some rice...

133
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:59,279
Sorry, but I have to study this scenario.

134
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,567
Let's have a party next time.

135
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,379
-Kim Heeja!
-Jungi!

136
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:03,767
I want to eat rice...

137
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:05,279
Look, he's so excited.

138
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:07,868
Dusik, you dropped yours. Have a new one.

139
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,028
Thank you.

140
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:20,614
Hello!

141
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:23,412
Geez. You made my character die!

142
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,153
Oh, sorry.

143
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,304
Did you practice?

144
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,595
I practiced day and night for a week.

145
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:33,433
-Where's Ms. Kim Heeja?
-She'll be here soon.

146
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,103
Here she is.

147
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:46,457
Hello, Ms. Kim.

148
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:54,124
Is she all right?

149
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:56,356
She's absorbed in her role.

150
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:58,846
She's playing the role of a mother
whose daughter got kidnapped.

151
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,345
So, she doesn't eat or sleep
during shooting.

152
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:03,525
She doesn't even go home.

153
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:05,748
She's trying to stay in character.

154
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:08,001
She's incredible.

155
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:15,575
Wow, she really is the greatest
method actor in Korea.

156
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,311
This scene is where the mother finds
one of the kidnappers.

157
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,512
She explodes in rage
as she finally faces the kidnapper.

158
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,746
And the kidnapper is struck with terror.

159
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:29,479
The enraged mother attacks the kidnapper.

160
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:32,112
She gets too emotional and kills him.

161
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,034
Got it?

162
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:35,145
Let's do a rehearsal.

163
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:36,204
Yes, sir.

164
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:47,507
Rehearsal, cue!

165
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:50,892
Who is it?

166
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,212
Who is it?

167
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,681
Who's banging on my...

168
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:57,317
How did you find me...?

169
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:05,868
Where's my daughter?

170
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,211
Where's my daughter, Sujin?

171
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,695
Tell me, you jerk!

172
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:10,613
It's only a rehearsal.

173
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:11,881
What? A rehearsal?

174
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:17,645
Tell me! Where's my Sujin?

175
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:19,212
Tell me!

176
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,507
Don't kill me.

177
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,098
My daughter!

178
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,432
Heeja, stop!

179
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:29,111
Jungi, are you all right? Wake up!

180
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:30,614
Wake up!

181
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:35,489
Are you okay?

182
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:41,201
A black shadow inside a white tunnel...

183
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:43,713
I thought we had to call an ambulance.

184
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:47,133
I'm sorry. I got too emotional...

185
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,902
Are you okay, Jungi?

186
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:54,270
Yes, I'm fine.

187
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:58,173
I'll try to calm down.

188
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,266
Who killed my daughter?

189
00:08:03,423 --> 00:08:04,887
I told her to go easy.

190
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:07,161
We can't have another one hospitalized.

191
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,733
-Hospitalized?
-Before you, there was another actor.

192
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:11,745
He was hospitalized.

193
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,001
After he got beaten up by Heeja.

194
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,145
Hospitalized for four weeks.

195
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,111
-What?
-Listen.

196
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,498
Try not to get hurt, okay?

197
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:22,749
Yes...

198
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:29,568
Jungi, are you ready?

199
00:08:30,268 --> 00:08:31,727
Yes... Yes.

200
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:34,543
Ready, action!

201
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:35,967
How...

202
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,402
How did you find me...?

203
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,292
Where's my daughter?

204
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,613
Where's my daughter?

205
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:49,829
Tell me!

206
00:08:51,735 --> 00:08:52,569
Blood...?

207
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:55,435
Oh no. No, no.
Stop. Stop!

208
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:58,494
Where is she?

209
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:03,436
Cut.

210
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,045
Stop!

211
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:08,716
No, no, no, no.

212
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:09,962
Stop! Stop! Stop!

213
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:15,988
Wow.

214
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:19,759
-You made this first-birthday party video?
-Yes.

215
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:22,656
Wow.

216
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:24,943
It's really nice.

217
00:09:25,555 --> 00:09:27,367
Look at that cute baby.

218
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:28,655
So cute.

219
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:30,470
They're not cute.

220
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:33,534
Since I began this job, I started
to believe in the Evil Nature Principle.

221
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:35,666
I'm certain that humans are born evil.

222
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:36,801
Gee...

223
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,124
How can you say that about babies?

224
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:40,300
You haven't seen them crying and yelling.

225
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:43,794
When the baby starts crying,
the mother wants me to make it laugh.

226
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,286
I'm not a comedian.
How can I make a crying baby laugh?

227
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:49,561
It's not that hard.

228
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,832
-It's not easy.
-It is easy.

229
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:52,755
Watch.

230
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:57,037
Abrubrubru fung!

231
00:09:58,202 --> 00:10:01,009
Abrubrubru fung!

232
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:02,736
Fung!

233
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:04,369
What?

234
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:05,869
She laughed!

235
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:08,581
Wait. What did you say to her?

236
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:11,513
-Aburu...?
-Abruboo hung.

237
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:13,092
Abruboo...

238
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:14,748
-Pung?
-Hung.

239
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:17,150
Not "pung." It's "fung."

240
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:18,780
-"Phung"?
-No.

241
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,480
Do, re, mi, fa, sol. In sol...

242
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:25,781
-Fung.
-Oh, "fung"!

243
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:28,013
Is there anything else?

244
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:28,935
Another one?

245
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:33,183
-Take Seol.
-Come here, Seol.

246
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:34,328
Watch.

247
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:37,205
Mommy's gone!

248
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:38,932
Where's Mommy?

249
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,440
Here she is!

250
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,146
Amazing.

251
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:45,125
Amazing!

252
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:46,835
Amazing!

253
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:49,381
"Mommy's gone"...

254
00:10:49,469 --> 00:10:51,013
"Here she is."

255
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:53,047
You have to say it in higher voice.

256
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:54,943
-It's in Si tone.
-In Si tone.

257
00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:55,747
Here she is!

258
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:57,513
-Here she is!
-That's it.

259
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,069
Here she is! In Si tone...

260
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:00,002
In Si tone...

261
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:03,027
I'm home.

262
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:03,950
Hey, Jungi...

263
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:06,532
-What happened to you?
-I was shooting a scene...

264
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:09,913
I got hurt a bit.

265
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,689
What kind of a scene was it?
You look awful.

266
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:16,370
Kim Heeja got too emotional.

267
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:19,481
But still,
she can't beat you up like that.

268
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,979
She's going to kill you next time.

269
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:23,168
I'm fine.

270
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:26,605
She was just acting. It's fine...

271
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:31,636
Jungi.

272
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:32,770
Jungi?

273
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,047
Did he just fall asleep?

274
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:38,569
-Is he breathing?
-Jeez...

275
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:41,634
Your life is so turbulent.

276
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:47,812
A black shadow... inside a white tunnel...

277
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:53,413
Is he... Is he talking in his sleep?

278
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:54,848
What's wrong with him?

279
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:56,614
-Are you okay?
-Please don't hit me!

280
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:58,729
Don't hit me!

281
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:07,380
This scene is linked
to the scene we shot yesterday.

282
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:11,796
She kills the kidnapper
and then wails like a crazy person.

283
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:14,979
You'll be dead, so don't move a muscle.
Got it?

284
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,169
-Yes, sir.
-Let's begin.

285
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:32,969
Ready.

286
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:34,236
Action!

287
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:42,862
Where's my daughter?

288
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:46,071
Where's my daughter, Sujin?

289
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,456
Where's my Sujin?

290
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,600
Tell me.

291
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,280
-I can't breathe...
-Tell me!

292
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:53,639
Can't breathe...

293
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:55,241
Where is she!

294
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:05,490
Where's my daughter?

295
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:08,321
You jerk.

296
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:10,146
Where is she?

297
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:11,069
Tell me.

298
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:15,003
Where is she?

299
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:30,777
Cut! Okay, that was great!

300
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:35,979
Heeja, that was great acting.

301
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:39,575
Wow, it gave me goosebumps.

302
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:41,495
Jungi, well done.

303
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:43,582
I thought I had to stop filming.

304
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:46,859
-But you got through it.
-Thank you.

305
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:49,116
I need to go to the bathroom.

306
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,146
What do you think about him?

307
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:55,979
-He's better than you expected, huh?
-Yes.

308
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,175
He can act pretty well, and...

309
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,224
...I love that he's serious
about his acting.

310
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:04,113
Where did you find him?

311
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:05,999
Oh, him?

312
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,618
Actually...

313
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:22,270
Disgusting!

314
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:25,398
Why did it have to fall into my mouth?

315
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:32,204
He liked my acting!

316
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:35,942
The world is finally recognizing
my talent!

317
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,647
-Hello.
-Congratulations.

318
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:41,302
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

319
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:47,580
He keeps crying.

320
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:49,722
He's in a bad mood this morning.

321
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,581
I'll take a photo of him before we begin.

322
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:56,513
But he's in a bad mood right now.
What should we do?

323
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:59,298
-Can you...
-You want me to make him laugh?

324
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:00,681
How did you know?

325
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,235
That's what people ask me
when they have that look in their eyes.

326
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,369
I'll give it a try.

327
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,236
Do, re, mi, fa, sol... Abruboo...

328
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:17,150
Abruboo fung!

329
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:19,159
Abruboo fung!

330
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:22,382
What are you doing?
You're making him cry more.

331
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:24,413
It's okay. I have another one.

332
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:25,487
Janggun!

333
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,143
I'm gone!

334
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,961
Where am I?

335
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:30,630
Here I am!

336
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:33,765
What are you doing?

337
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,168
You almost frightened him into fits.

338
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,247
It's okay, Janggun.

339
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:40,306
That's odd. When Yuna did it, it worked.

340
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:41,776
What do I do?

341
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,444
Abrubrubru fung!

342
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,653
Abrubrubru fung!

343
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:51,279
Where am I?

344
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,202
Here I am!

345
00:15:55,202 --> 00:15:57,247
He laughs so well.

346
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:59,880
This is why you asked me to come
right away?

347
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:03,296
How strange. He cried when I did it.

348
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:05,714
You're really good with babies.

349
00:16:05,802 --> 00:16:07,109
I feel relieved now.

350
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,828
-My stomach...
-Is it hurting again?

351
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:12,547
Let's go to the hospital.

352
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:14,050
What about Janggun?

353
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,739
Mother will be here soon.

354
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:18,711
I'll look after him. Go to the hospital.

355
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:20,475
Would you?

356
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:24,273
-Could you change him too?
-Sure.

357
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,247
Don't worry. I'll look after him.

358
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:28,629
Thank you so much.

359
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:30,135
Drive safely.

360
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:34,004
He's an odd baby.

361
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:35,748
I did exactly the same.

362
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:39,270
Babies can instinctively tell
who's good and who's evil.

363
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:41,746
Are you saying I'm evil?

364
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,380
-Of course not...
-Shut it.

365
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:45,381
I'm going to the bathroom. Watch him.

366
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:52,966
Gosh, this is so pretty.

367
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:55,615
I wonder how much it costs.

368
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:59,018
Oh, I have to change him.

369
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,220
Let's see.

370
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:05,755
Gosh, this is adorable!

371
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:08,446
It'll look so cute on Seol.

372
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:09,369
Right, Seol?

373
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:10,303
Look.

374
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,456
-Thank you.
-Oh dear.

375
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,946
This scene, I was...

376
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:19,912
-What was I supposed to say?
-Well, you can...

377
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,246
Great work today, sir.

378
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:22,755
Good job, Jungi.

379
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,714
Everyone did an excellent job today.
I'm buying dinner tonight!

380
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:31,964
You should come too.

381
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:34,482
Are you going, Ms. Kim?

382
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:37,489
Don't talk to me.

383
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:41,360
I'm tired. I'm going home.

384
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,798
Thank you.

385
00:17:46,035 --> 00:17:48,214
What's wrong?
Did I make a mistake?

386
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,330
No, no.

387
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,209
Heeja!

388
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:52,636
Heeja!

389
00:17:55,302 --> 00:17:56,946
Heeja! Heeja!

390
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:58,813
You can't just leave like this.

391
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:00,960
I'm not in the mood to have dinner.

392
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,480
-Is it because of what I told you?
-I...

393
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:06,205
I hate people who use
their connections to get jobs.

394
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:10,356
You know that Mr. Deokhwa helped me out
when I was struggling.

395
00:18:10,535 --> 00:18:13,680
He asked me to hire his son.
I can't refuse that!

396
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:15,027
What are you talking about?

397
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:19,732
Jungi.

398
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:21,011
Jungi, listen...

399
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,461
What did you just say?

400
00:18:27,502 --> 00:18:29,470
Seol, look over here.

401
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:31,814
Seol, you look adorable.

402
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,012
Look over here. Good girl.

403
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:35,013
Look over here.

404
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:37,132
-Yuna, what are you doing?
-Oh my gosh!

405
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:38,381
Why are you so startled?

406
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:40,213
Why are you taking photos of Janggun?

407
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:42,265
I thought he was Seol.

408
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:46,755
She is Seol!

409
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,481
-What's going on?
-Actually...

410
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,447
What if the guests see you?

411
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:56,068
-I'm sorry. Actually, I...
-Forget it. Change her now.

412
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,320
Janggun!

413
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,947
Janggun! Janggun!

414
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:08,914
I've missed you!

415
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:15,323
I haven't seen you since you were born
because I live in the US.

416
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:17,468
He's handsome.

417
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:22,150
He looks thin.

418
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:24,768
His cheeks were plump in the photos.

419
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:26,256
He's so thin.

420
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:28,078
I don't think so.

421
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,016
Who...are you?

422
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,494
We're filming the party.

423
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:37,595
Aren't you tired?

424
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:39,898
-I'll hold him.
-No, I'm fine.

425
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:44,071
I haven't held Janggun
in such a long time.

426
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:50,057
He's eighth generation
of the Gyeongju Lee clan.

427
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:52,848
His parents tried in-vitro fertilization
and whatnot...

428
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:54,793
...to conceive a boy.

429
00:19:54,882 --> 00:19:57,040
They had to go through a lot.

430
00:19:57,902 --> 00:19:59,712
You need to do an interview.

431
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:01,748
Say something to your grandson.

432
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:03,547
-Give him to her.
-All right.

433
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,079
No, I'll hold him.
I'll just do it while holding him.

434
00:20:06,168 --> 00:20:08,102
It'll look better on camera.

435
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:10,091
You can't do that...

436
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,065
This is unbelievable...

437
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:18,437
Janggun, did you poop?

438
00:20:18,535 --> 00:20:19,880
Wait just a moment.

439
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,646
I'll change your diaper.

440
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:24,603
No, we'll do it!

441
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:27,913
-Babies these days have smelly poop.
-I'll do it.

442
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:30,495
No, I'm going to change him.

443
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:34,299
Let me look at my baby's wienie.

444
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,187
You want to see... his wienie...?

445
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:38,518
Let's lie you down over here.

446
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:40,547
My baby.

447
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,847
Let's see your wienie.

448
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,303
Let's see.

449
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:51,595
What are you doing?

450
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:54,581
He's a baby
but you have to respect his privacy.

451
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:56,956
That's nonsense!

452
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:02,297
Why do you keep doing that!

453
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:03,403
Ma'am.

454
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:06,381
You have to respect his human rights.

455
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:07,647
This is a human rights abuse.

456
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:09,993
Human rights abuse?

457
00:21:14,602 --> 00:21:16,246
Why you...!

458
00:21:16,335 --> 00:21:18,580
Are you out of your mind?

459
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:20,314
I have a trauma.

460
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:23,636
When I was young, my grandmother
kept saying she wanted to eat my wienie.

461
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:26,434
That's why I can't eat
wieners to this day.

462
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:29,621
That is utter nonsense.

463
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,079
I can't let you do this.

464
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,091
Why you...

465
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:34,326
Get your hands off.

466
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:35,433
Hands off.

467
00:21:35,802 --> 00:21:37,781
Get your hands off. Right now!

468
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,735
-Get your hands off!
-No! Never!

469
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,667
Why you...!

470
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:45,225
How dare you!

471
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:46,768
Don't do it!

472
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:49,400
You should've stepped aside
when I asked you nicely.

473
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:51,777
No, Ma'am!

474
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:54,246
Let's look at your...

475
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:13,469
Goodness me...

476
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:16,132
Janggun...

477
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,146
Our eighth generation...

478
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:20,214
His wienie...

479
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:22,708
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am!

480
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:25,578
It's okay, Seol.

481
00:22:31,523 --> 00:22:32,393
Thanks.

482
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:40,225
What are you doing here?
Why didn't you call?

483
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:41,760
Why did you do that?

484
00:22:42,882 --> 00:22:44,316
You did it again!

485
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,214
What are you talking about?

486
00:22:46,302 --> 00:22:48,233
The director told me everything.

487
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,037
I told you not to do it anymore.

488
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:54,384
I'm trying me best to do this on my own.

489
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:57,179
-Why do you keep doing this?
-No...

490
00:22:57,268 --> 00:22:59,778
You're not doing well on your own.

491
00:23:00,602 --> 00:23:04,583
I enjoyed your performance
on the home shopping channel.

492
00:23:05,011 --> 00:23:08,342
It was disgraceful.

493
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:10,946
Yes, I asked him to cast you.

494
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:15,313
Because I hate seeing
my only son struggling.

495
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:17,262
Is that so bad?

496
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:20,347
-It's not right.
-Why not?

497
00:23:20,435 --> 00:23:21,834
Because I'm your son.

498
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:26,461
Because I'm the son of Actor Lee Deokhwa
who I admire the most.

499
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:33,212
That's why I want to succeed on my own.
Without your help.

500
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:37,831
That way I can stand proudly
in front of you.

501
00:23:38,976 --> 00:23:39,977
So, please...

502
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:43,489
...believe in me and watch me.

503
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:47,488
That's the only thing I want from you.

504
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:49,595
I understand what you're saying, but...

505
00:23:50,624 --> 00:23:51,458
Fine.

506
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,649
You can work as a home shopping model
or play small roles forever.

507
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:58,610
My goodness...

508
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,855
And also...

509
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:03,501
Why were you wearing a pink underwear?

510
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,789
-You're a man.
-It's sexy.

511
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,339
Goodness me...

512
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:09,210
All right.

513
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:13,030
Let's go inside and have dinner together.

514
00:24:13,683 --> 00:24:14,786
It's okay.

515
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:17,302
I have to be somewhere.

516
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:21,794
Jungi!

517
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,138
Yes, I've raised a good...

518
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:37,309
I'm sorry...

519
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:39,254
...for everything.

520
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:40,955
You didn't even know.

521
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:42,430
That doesn't matter.

522
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:44,205
It's all my fault.

523
00:24:44,477 --> 00:24:45,311
I'm sorry.

524
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:48,775
Thank you for dinner.

525
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:50,381
Good night.

526
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,488
Jungi!

527
00:24:52,835 --> 00:24:53,708
Jungi!

528
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,796
That kid...

529
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,064
"Waikiki"

530
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,577
Hello.

531
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,086
Is the lady all right?

532
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:03,817
Really?

533
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,045
That's a relief.

534
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:07,781
Sorry about what happened today.

535
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,086
I'll take responsibility.

536
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:12,223
I'm really sorry. Okay.

537
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,354
How did it go?

538
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:16,665
Is everything fine?

539
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:18,654
Yeah, sort of.

540
00:25:18,743 --> 00:25:21,071
What were you thinking?

541
00:25:21,742 --> 00:25:22,588
I'm sorry.

542
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:25,957
Why did you do that
at someone else's party?

543
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,260
Because I felt sorry.

544
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:31,395
I felt sorry for Seol.

545
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:39,616
I'm a terrible mother.

546
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:44,676
We couldn't celebrate her birth.

547
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:47,766
I've never bought her...

548
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,749
...pretty clothes or a toy.

549
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:56,121
That's why I wanted to take her picture
to celebrate her first birthday.

550
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,725
I'm so sorry.

551
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:14,322
Today's product is the Auto Bright-smile
smile corrector.

552
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:19,020
Invest just three minutes everyday
for that naturally beautiful smile.

553
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:20,895
How does it feel wearing it?

554
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,957
I can smile more easily.

555
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:27,043
You can smile more easily?

556
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:31,056
Can you describe it in more detail?

557
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,920
-In detail?
-In detail.

558
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:36,009
Make it more specific.

559
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:43,902
My lips are down-turned.

560
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,171
But the corrector is lifting
the corners of my mouth.

561
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:51,343
So, my smile looks more natural.

562
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:57,149
Jeez... What the hell.

563
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,486
Why did she make me talk so much?

564
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,468
My jaw hurts.

565
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,466
Wait. Are people going to capture this
and post it online?

566
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,162
Darn it.

567
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:15,333
Who is it now?

568
00:27:16,976 --> 00:27:17,903
Hello?

569
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,987
Yes, this is Lee Jungi.

570
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:23,377
What?

571
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,677
A meeting?

572
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:40,255
Excuse me.

573
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:42,116
-Just leave it there.
-Okay.

574
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,488
Actually, I'm...

575
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:47,074
I'm Lee Jungi. We spoke on the phone?

576
00:27:49,577 --> 00:27:51,589
Hello. Nice to meet you.

577
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,874
Why did you call me?

578
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:58,311
We're going to start
a morning TV drama series soon.

579
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,087
Someone recommended you.

580
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:01,213
Someone recommended me?

581
00:28:03,877 --> 00:28:04,711
Who was it?

582
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,626
Who recommended me?

583
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:07,839
I did.

584
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:09,155
There she is.

585
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:12,027
Ms. Kim.

586
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:13,188
Hello.

587
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:14,626
-Good to see you.
-Hello.

588
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,127
Hello.

589
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:18,021
You recommended me?

590
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:21,633
Director Choi was looking for
a handsome new actor who can act.

591
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,187
You're not that handsome,
but you're a pretty good actor.

592
00:28:24,276 --> 00:28:25,627
That's why I recommended you.

593
00:28:25,976 --> 00:28:28,178
-You don't like it?
-I appreciate it.

594
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:30,155
Thank you so much.

595
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:32,878
Now it's up to you to get the role.

596
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:34,055
Good luck.

597
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:34,980
Thank you.

598
00:28:35,243 --> 00:28:37,448
Heeja, here's a copy of the script...

599
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,456
-Thank you, Ms. Kim!
-I'll call you, Heeja.

600
00:28:50,543 --> 00:28:51,377
Yuna.

601
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:53,112
Come outside.

602
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:55,955
What is it?

603
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:57,887
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

604
00:28:57,976 --> 00:28:58,916
Ta-da.

605
00:29:01,477 --> 00:29:03,911
"Seol's 100th day celebration"

606
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,413
"Seol, happy 100th day"

607
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,451
"Seol, please grow up healthy and wise"

608
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,189
What's all this?

609
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:16,855
Isn't it obvious?

610
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:17,916
Yuna, come here.

611
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,367
It's Seol's 100th day party.

612
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:26,020
It's not a big party
but we made everything.

613
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:28,099
So, please keep that in mind
even if you don't like it.

614
00:29:28,343 --> 00:29:29,567
I love it.

615
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,970
It's so pretty.

616
00:29:32,643 --> 00:29:34,154
Thank you so much.

617
00:29:34,243 --> 00:29:35,455
Don't mention it.

618
00:29:35,543 --> 00:29:37,755
Thank Donggu instead of us.

619
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:39,722
This was Donggu's idea.

620
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,086
-Don't tell her that...
-Really?

621
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:44,215
Thank you, Donggu.

622
00:29:44,877 --> 00:29:47,552
I just didn't want you
to cause anymore trouble.

623
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:51,589
And stop crying over everything.

624
00:29:51,678 --> 00:29:54,392
Crying is like your habit.

625
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,808
I'm sorry.

626
00:29:56,944 --> 00:29:58,863
It's so pretty.

627
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:03,006
But... there's no cake?

628
00:30:03,777 --> 00:30:06,438
It would've been more perfect
with a cake.

629
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,439
Cake is here!

630
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:15,077
Of course we got a cake.

631
00:30:15,176 --> 00:30:17,149
We can't have a party without a cake.

632
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:21,488
-Thank you.
-You're crying again!

633
00:30:21,577 --> 00:30:24,088
Light the candles
before we bathe in tears.

634
00:30:24,176 --> 00:30:25,120
-Quickly.
-Okay.

635
00:30:26,477 --> 00:30:27,589
You got a bottle of champagne?

636
00:30:27,677 --> 00:30:29,455
Very nice.

637
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:31,321
I bought this to celebrate my thing.

638
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,521
What thing?

639
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,034
I got a part in a morning TV drama series.

640
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:39,228
I'm one of the main characters!

641
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:41,555
A main character? Really?

642
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:44,843
I'm the driver for the main character.

643
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:46,421
I thought so.

644
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,079
It's a small role again.

645
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:51,061
All right, let's talk about that later.

646
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:52,810
Let's take a photo first.

647
00:30:52,944 --> 00:30:54,378
-Let's take a photo.
-Go, go.

648
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,812
Yuna, come here.

649
00:30:56,098 --> 00:30:58,390
Let's move to that side.

650
00:30:59,477 --> 00:31:01,726
All right, stand close together.

651
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,883
Donggu, move faster.

652
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:05,654
-Smile.
-All right.

653
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:08,846
The timer's set to 10 seconds
so keep smiling.

654
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,463
Light the candles. Say kimchi!

655
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,946
-Kimchi!
-Kimchi!

656
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:15,954
Wait.

657
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:19,160
A baby ring is missing.

658
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:22,021
It would've been perfect with a ring.

659
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:23,689
-Gee...
-Yuna.

660
00:31:23,777 --> 00:31:25,554
Seojin, go and buy a ring.

661
00:31:25,643 --> 00:31:27,245
Why did we bother making these?

662
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,077
-Get rid of this.
-No, no.

663
00:31:31,176 --> 00:31:32,522
-We should've bought a ring!
-No, no.

664
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:40,298
Okay.

665
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,699
Let's begin.

666
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,209
I'll make a left turn.

667
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,414
I'll make a right turn.

668
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:51,202
Sure.

669
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:52,944
I'm backing up the car.

670
00:31:55,255 --> 00:31:56,409
There's this version.

671
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,845
I'll make a left turn.

672
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:03,221
I'll make a right turn.

673
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:04,910
Sure.

674
00:32:05,243 --> 00:32:06,362
I'm backing up that car.

675
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:10,421
This is another version. Which is better?

676
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,496
Be honest.

677
00:32:14,043 --> 00:32:15,588
What's... What's the difference?

678
00:32:15,677 --> 00:32:17,019
It's the same.

679
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,344
What?

680
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:20,221
Listen.

681
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,522
The first version is a driver
who works hard,

682
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,756
in everything he does
to make a position for himself.

683
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,756
The second version is a driver
who thinks this job is annoying

684
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:32,758
and only does things to please his boss.

685
00:32:34,944 --> 00:32:35,822
Really?

686
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,954
How are you going to become a director
when you can't see the details?

687
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:39,991
Sorry.

688
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:44,568
It's my first TV drama series.
I'm worried.

689
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:45,388
Me too.

690
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:48,522
Should I interview an actual driver?

691
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,806
You only have three lines.
Why would you need to interview someone?

692
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:53,511
You're overdoing it.

693
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:55,489
Just let him do whatever he wants.

694
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:57,142
You don't know acting!

695
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,696
Yuna, what's that?

696
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:02,676
Someone left this perfect oven
in the street.

697
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:03,789
So, I brought it home.

698
00:33:03,877 --> 00:33:05,655
An oven? Why do you need an oven?

699
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:08,319
You said that they were so good
I could sell them.

700
00:33:08,477 --> 00:33:10,722
So I decided to start a business.

701
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:13,355
A business? What about the guesthouse?

702
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:15,571
I'll bake after I've finished working
in the guesthouse.

703
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,809
Fine. As you wish.

704
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:21,188
But don't let it interfere
with your work here, okay?

705
00:33:21,276 --> 00:33:22,800
Yes, don't worry.

706
00:33:25,543 --> 00:33:26,504
Oh no!

707
00:33:28,677 --> 00:33:29,710
Sorry.

708
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,805
-I got one.
-Open it.

709
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:52,755
-Jungi.
-Yeah?

710
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:56,134
I'm too nervous.
Can you read it for me?

711
00:33:56,844 --> 00:33:57,678
Sure.

712
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:02,731
What does it say?

713
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,782
Oh dear...

714
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,215
...Seojin...

715
00:34:12,703 --> 00:34:13,592
They...

716
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:17,038
...want to interview you.

717
00:34:17,443 --> 00:34:19,457
You got an interview!

718
00:34:20,076 --> 00:34:21,426
Are you serious?

719
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,272
I swear! Look.

720
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:25,366
"Daeyeong Daily Interview
Congratulations on passing..."

721
00:34:27,643 --> 00:34:29,222
I got an interview!

722
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,856
You still have to pass the interview.

723
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,155
It's too early to cry.

724
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:35,577
I don't care. I really wanted to work
at this newspaper company.

725
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:37,877
-Congratulations.
-You'll get the job.

726
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:40,913
Stop that. You look ugly.

727
00:34:42,477 --> 00:34:43,872
I can smell something burning.

728
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:46,083
Is it coming from the kitchen?

729
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:47,592
What's this smell?

730
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,789
What the hell! There's so much smoke!

731
00:34:49,877 --> 00:34:51,088
-Why is it smoking?
-What the hell!

732
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,554
Why is it smoking?

733
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:54,789
Oh no! I think my bread is burning.

734
00:34:54,877 --> 00:34:56,699
-Turn it off!
-Yes.

735
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:00,765
Oh no! I can't turn it off!

736
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:03,895
Just unplug it.

737
00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:06,354
You almost burned down the house!

738
00:35:06,443 --> 00:35:09,055
-I'm sorry. The timer must be broken.
-Jeez...

739
00:35:09,143 --> 00:35:11,609
Why did they throw away a broken oven?

740
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:16,055
They threw it away because it was broken.

741
00:35:16,143 --> 00:35:17,716
-Ah...
-"Ah"?

742
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:21,721
It almost started a fire.
Why did you bring this home?

743
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,188
Let's get a drink to celebrate
Seojin getting an interview.

744
00:35:24,276 --> 00:35:25,689
-Stop.
-Jeez...!

745
00:35:25,777 --> 00:35:29,027
-Stop it.
-If it weren't for Seojin...!

746
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,444
Yuna.

747
00:35:33,987 --> 00:35:35,020
Let's go.

748
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:37,389
No, I'll stay and clean up.

749
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:38,617
Oh, okay.

750
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:40,653
Come upstairs when you're done, okay?

751
00:35:56,976 --> 00:35:59,910
-All right, here we go again.
-Spin it! Spin it!

752
00:36:00,014 --> 00:36:02,015
-Spin it!
-Yo!

753
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,396
-Okay! Jungi!
-Jungi!

754
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:06,663
It's me.

755
00:36:06,844 --> 00:36:08,622
Okay. Ask me anything.

756
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,188
I'll tell you everything.

757
00:36:10,276 --> 00:36:11,177
Who wants to go first?

758
00:36:11,276 --> 00:36:13,454
Me, me! Me! Me!

759
00:36:13,543 --> 00:36:14,494
Me first.

760
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:15,577
Go ahead.

761
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:19,122
When, where and with whom
did you have your first kiss?

762
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,914
I think it was....
when I was 11 years old...?

763
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:25,555
It was when I was 10.

764
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:29,654
It was in the school playground
with the girl next door.

765
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:35,059
I slid down the elephant slide
then we passionately...

766
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,654
-Her lips were so hot...
-Stop, stop.

767
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:42,021
-Oh my god!
-We don't want to hear it anymore.

768
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:44,455
-What happened next?
-You asked me first.

769
00:36:44,548 --> 00:36:45,499
Shut up!

770
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:47,044
-Then...
-You hurt my feelings.

771
00:36:47,143 --> 00:36:49,521
I brought some fruit.

772
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,975
Did you clean up the kitchen?

773
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,756
Yes, I did.

774
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:54,522
Is the smoke cleared?
How about the smell?

775
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,621
Stop scolding her.

776
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,522
-Yuna, sit here.
-No, I'm fine.

777
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,722
Join us. We're playing truth or dare.

778
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,122
-Join us.
-Yeah.

779
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,777
You always say no.

780
00:37:05,577 --> 00:37:07,789
-I guess I'll join you then.
-Yeah.

781
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:09,856
-Here we go!
-Okay!

782
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:11,722
Go, go, go!

783
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,388
-Okay!
-It's you, Yuna.

784
00:37:15,477 --> 00:37:17,789
What evil question should we ask her?

785
00:37:17,877 --> 00:37:19,555
-Oh, Yuna...
-Me! Me!

786
00:37:19,643 --> 00:37:20,655
Me! Me!

787
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:22,655
-I have a question!
-Are you a question machine?

788
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,688
I really wanted to ask her this.

789
00:37:24,777 --> 00:37:26,677
Yeah? What is it?

790
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:29,604
So, um...

791
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:33,585
What happened
between you and Seol's father?

792
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:41,378
You can't ask that.
It's making her uncomfortable.

793
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,455
What? You all want to know, right?

794
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:46,113
You're all looking for the right time
to ask, right?

795
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,752
It's all right. It's not a big secret.

796
00:37:51,276 --> 00:37:52,804
Where should I begin?

797
00:37:57,176 --> 00:37:59,610
So, what happened was...

798
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:06,342
That's what happened.

799
00:38:07,677 --> 00:38:14,492
So...you lost your parents in a fire
and you got sent to your relative's house.

800
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:19,020
But they took the insurance money
and dumped you in an orphanage?

801
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:19,948
After that...

802
00:38:20,452 --> 00:38:22,517
...you were abused
by the owner of that orphanage.

803
00:38:22,777 --> 00:38:25,777
You ran away and met Seol's father
at a part-time job?

804
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,391
But you broke up because his family
didn't approve your relationship.

805
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,025
On top of that, you found out
you were pregnant after you broke up?

806
00:38:36,129 --> 00:38:37,048
Hold on.

807
00:38:37,243 --> 00:38:41,202
Then, Seol's father knew you were pregnant
and still abandoned you?

808
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,714
No, he doesn't know about Seol.

809
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,703
Why not?

810
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:49,393
Actually...

811
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:54,298
Seol is awake. I'll go see her downstairs.

812
00:38:58,109 --> 00:39:00,071
Poor Yuna.

813
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,589
It must've been really hard for her.

814
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:03,596
Donggu.

815
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,611
Be nicer to Yuna. Stop scolding her.

816
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,847
-I never scolded her.
-Gee...

817
00:39:09,936 --> 00:39:12,321
You yelled at her for that oven thing.

818
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,454
That's...

819
00:39:13,637 --> 00:39:15,105
I was just telling her to be careful.

820
00:39:15,194 --> 00:39:16,954
-You be careful!
-You be careful!

821
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:18,813
-Come on. Cheers.
-Cheers.

822
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:27,638
Guys!

823
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:29,000
Ta-da!

824
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,456
How do I look?

825
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:34,287
Wow...!

826
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:36,350
It doesn't suit you at all!

827
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,887
It's hard to look that bad in that outfit.

828
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,555
I'm a fool for asking you guys.

829
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:43,054
We're kidding.

830
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:44,972
Why are you wearing a skirt suit?

831
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:46,622
Today's my interview.

832
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,520
Stop making a big fuss.
I have a bad feeling about this.

833
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:51,951
Don't you worry.

834
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:55,124
I'm going to put on make-up!

835
00:39:55,243 --> 00:39:56,727
Oh no!

836
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:00,488
Oh no!

837
00:40:00,577 --> 00:40:02,729
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

838
00:40:03,143 --> 00:40:05,221
I have to go to the interview soon!

839
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,562
Stop making a fuss.

840
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:08,188
Change into another shirt.

841
00:40:08,276 --> 00:40:11,287
No, this is a set.

842
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:12,921
The other shirts don't match this outfit.

843
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:14,987
Then wash and dry it. You still got time.

844
00:40:15,076 --> 00:40:16,389
Yes, I should.

845
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:23,381
Yuna, what are you doing?

846
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:26,391
Oh, you start selling
your muffins today, right?

847
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,311
-Yes.
-Can we help?

848
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,795
It's okay. I'm almost done.

849
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:33,643
All done.

850
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,135
Seol is awake.

851
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,111
She has to take care of her baby,
sell muffins...

852
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:46,133
She has to do so much.

853
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,044
Tell me about it.

854
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,588
Can't we help Yuna?

855
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:54,721
That'd be great,
but there's nothing we can help with.

856
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,021
It's not like we can get her a husband.

857
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,887
That's a good idea.

858
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:01,822
Why don't we look for Seol's father?

859
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,816
But we don't know who he is.

860
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:06,731
You're right.
There's no way we can find him.

861
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,221
Isn't this Yuna's phone?

862
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,321
Yeah, I think so.

863
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,154
His phone number must be in here.

864
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:18,222
How do we know which one is Seol's father?

865
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,644
Let's just take a look.

866
00:41:21,643 --> 00:41:22,484
Huh?

867
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:23,388
What is it?

868
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:27,394
There are only us, Kim Junseong
and a restaurant called "The Great Wall."

869
00:41:28,143 --> 00:41:30,055
Then Kim Junseong must be Seol's father.

870
00:41:30,143 --> 00:41:32,589
-That's nonsense.
-Well, her dad isn't The Great Wall!

871
00:41:32,677 --> 00:41:35,300
We can't be sure that he is the dad.

872
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:36,289
I see...

873
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,444
Then let's call this number.

874
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:39,954
-Call him.
-Are you crazy?

875
00:41:40,043 --> 00:41:42,921
-Are you insane?
-Let's just call him.

876
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:44,386
You're going to cause trouble.

877
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:46,193
You're unbelievable.

878
00:41:50,615 --> 00:41:51,495
Hello?

879
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:55,389
Is this Kim Junseong?

880
00:41:55,477 --> 00:41:56,876
-This is he.
-Stop.

881
00:41:57,085 --> 00:41:59,755
Do you know Han Yuna?

882
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:03,121
We were together for a while.
Who are you?

883
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,817
They dated. This is him!

884
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,454
This is the parcel service.

885
00:42:09,543 --> 00:42:12,722
Han Yuna sent a parcel for you.

886
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,955
What's your address?

887
00:42:15,043 --> 00:42:17,522
I can't see it
because it's soaked in rain.

888
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,903
It's really sunny today.

889
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,238
Okay. One moment.

890
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:24,375
Dongsan-gu, 35-Gil?

891
00:42:24,524 --> 00:42:26,804
Okay, I'll deliver it to you soon.

892
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:29,789
It was Seol's father!

893
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:31,322
Shall we go and see him?

894
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,184
This is not right...

895
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,144
Then I'll go by myself.

896
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:36,288
You're a bad friend.

897
00:42:36,376 --> 00:42:38,355
Fine! I'll go!

898
00:42:38,443 --> 00:42:39,689
Where are you two going?

899
00:42:39,778 --> 00:42:41,121
-None of your business!
-What?

900
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,622
-Friendship!
-What's wrong with you?

901
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,129
What trouble are they going
to cause this time?

902
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:48,844
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to sell my muffins.

903
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:50,278
Were you serious about that?

904
00:42:50,376 --> 00:42:52,355
Sales isn't for everybody.

905
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:54,057
I'm going to give it a try.

906
00:42:54,376 --> 00:42:55,466
Wait.

907
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,087
Shall I carry it for you?

908
00:42:57,176 --> 00:42:58,589
It's okay. I can do it by myself.

909
00:42:58,677 --> 00:42:59,679
See you later.

910
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,573
It'll be hard to do it on her own.

911
00:43:02,677 --> 00:43:06,154
She's even taking Seol with her.

912
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:08,853
Never mind. It doesn't concern me.

913
00:43:14,743 --> 00:43:17,488
Buy muffins! These are homemade.

914
00:43:17,577 --> 00:43:18,558
Muffins!

915
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:22,408
Buy muffins! These are homemade.

916
00:43:22,677 --> 00:43:26,103
Hello, these are homemade muffins.
Try one.

917
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,042
Gosh, it's cold.

918
00:43:36,143 --> 00:43:37,582
Hello.

919
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,303
Donggu?

920
00:43:39,543 --> 00:43:40,789
What are you doing here?

921
00:43:40,877 --> 00:43:42,759
I'm heading somewhere and I saw you.

922
00:43:44,009 --> 00:43:45,356
Did you sell any?

923
00:43:47,143 --> 00:43:49,037
I can tell from your face
that you haven't sold any.

924
00:43:49,443 --> 00:43:52,977
This is too tough for you and the baby.

925
00:43:53,076 --> 00:43:55,433
Sales isn't for everybody.

926
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:57,988
Also... These muffins...

927
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:01,315
People buy muffins at a bakery.
Who would buy it on the side of the road?

928
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:03,322
You don't have the competitive edge.

929
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,755
You even wrote the sign by hand.

930
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:08,478
'Dameunee' muffins. What a name...

931
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,857
That's a weird name.

932
00:44:10,946 --> 00:44:12,227
This is why I...

933
00:44:18,543 --> 00:44:19,955
Yuna, are you crying?

934
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:23,284
I'm upset because
the muffins aren't selling.

935
00:44:23,743 --> 00:44:27,677
And you scolding me is making me
even more upset.

936
00:44:28,213 --> 00:44:33,437
Why are you crying?
You're a grownup.

937
00:44:34,011 --> 00:44:34,855
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:34,944 --> 00:44:36,545
Gee...

939
00:44:43,577 --> 00:44:46,105
People are staring. Stop crying.

940
00:44:50,243 --> 00:44:53,021
I'll help you sell these.

941
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:54,740
I'll help you, okay?

942
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:57,887
-Really?
-Yeah, so stop crying.

943
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:00,311
Stop crying.

944
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,344
Okay.

945
00:45:07,043 --> 00:45:08,138
I think this is the place.

946
00:45:08,978 --> 00:45:09,907
Jungi.

947
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:11,855
I really think this is a bad idea.

948
00:45:11,944 --> 00:45:13,344
Let's go home.

949
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:15,187
You can go back by yourself.

950
00:45:15,276 --> 00:45:17,615
You're a bad friend.

951
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,654
Where's the boss...

952
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,921
Be careful.

953
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,118
-There's the boss.
-Wait.

954
00:45:26,276 --> 00:45:27,658
Excuse me.

955
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:31,843
-Yes?
-Is this Kim Junseong's house?

956
00:45:31,944 --> 00:45:33,417
-Yes.
-Ah...

957
00:45:33,506 --> 00:45:36,555
We want to speak to him.

958
00:45:36,643 --> 00:45:38,302
So annoying...

959
00:45:39,076 --> 00:45:41,521
Sir, someone came to see you.

960
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:42,950
-Me?
-Yes.

961
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:44,654
Who are you?

962
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:46,511
-Are you Kim Junseong?
-Yes.

963
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:48,807
My name is Lee Jungi.

964
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:52,155
We have something to tell you.

965
00:45:52,243 --> 00:45:53,578
Oh, okay.

966
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,088
-What is it?
-Did you...

967
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:57,322
Honey!

968
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:00,088
When will the house be finished?

969
00:46:00,176 --> 00:46:02,037
We don't have much time left.

970
00:46:02,376 --> 00:46:05,429
It'll be finished before our wedding.
Don't worry.

971
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,788
Who are they?

972
00:46:07,877 --> 00:46:10,954
They came to tell me something.

973
00:46:11,043 --> 00:46:12,554
What is it?

974
00:46:12,643 --> 00:46:15,077
Oh, actually...

975
00:46:17,196 --> 00:46:18,430
We came to work.

976
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:21,088
-Work?
-Work?

977
00:46:21,176 --> 00:46:23,651
We didn't hire any new workers.

978
00:46:24,054 --> 00:46:26,388
Oh, Mr. Choi sent you, huh?

979
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:29,553
I told him that we were
short of hands yesterday.

980
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:31,097
He sent us new workers.

981
00:46:31,376 --> 00:46:34,622
Y-Yes! Mr. Choi sent us...

982
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,389
You should've asked for me then.

983
00:46:37,482 --> 00:46:39,430
Why did you ask for Mr. Kim?

984
00:46:39,643 --> 00:46:40,634
Follow me.

985
00:46:41,944 --> 00:46:42,778
Oh, okay.

986
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,288
We have to work now?

987
00:46:46,376 --> 00:46:48,555
I couldn't ask him about Yuna
in front of his fiancee.

988
00:46:48,643 --> 00:46:49,910
This is why I didn't want to come here.

989
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:52,209
-Let's leave.
-That's a good idea.

990
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,108
Where are you going? You have to work.

991
00:47:00,176 --> 00:47:01,185
Oh...

992
00:47:02,777 --> 00:47:04,741
The truth is...

993
00:47:05,276 --> 00:47:06,322
We have a lot of work to do.

994
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,225
So, the truth is...

995
00:47:09,643 --> 00:47:10,477
So...

996
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:12,542
So...

997
00:47:14,343 --> 00:47:15,710
Why you...

998
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:18,002
-Follow me.
-Dusik!

999
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:19,186
Listen...

1000
00:47:19,276 --> 00:47:21,038
-Wait!
-Jungi!

1001
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:28,012
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

1002
00:47:28,647 --> 00:47:30,656
Why the hell are we doing this?
When can we go home?

1003
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:33,189
I don't know! He won't even listen to me!

1004
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,644
Look.

1005
00:47:38,677 --> 00:47:39,894
Move!

1006
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:43,794
Follow me.

1007
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,288
It's not drying quick enough.

1008
00:47:49,376 --> 00:47:51,043
I'm going to be late for the interview.

1009
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:53,335
Excuse me. Is anybody here?

1010
00:47:53,424 --> 00:47:54,622
Who is that?

1011
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,335
No one's home? Oh no!

1012
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:04,821
-What do you want?
-I'm sorry.

1013
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,751
-Can I get an extra towel?
-Jeez, I'm busy.

1014
00:48:08,076 --> 00:48:10,587
Where the hell is everybody?

1015
00:48:11,376 --> 00:48:13,791
Oh no, I'm late.

1016
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:16,489
Hey. I'm busy right now.

1017
00:48:16,577 --> 00:48:18,462
Towel's over there. Go find it yourself.

1018
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:20,222
-All right.
-And also,

1019
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,122
look after the guest house while I'm gone.

1020
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,756
-What?
-Do you understand?!

1021
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,370
Yeah. I got it.

1022
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,970
Buy some muffins.

1023
00:48:36,076 --> 00:48:37,214
They're delicious.

1024
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,553
You have to speak louder.

1025
00:48:41,443 --> 00:48:42,689
I am talking loudly.

1026
00:48:42,777 --> 00:48:44,278
Buy... Buy some bread.

1027
00:48:45,543 --> 00:48:47,422
Th-They're delicious.

1028
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,688
These are homemade muffins.

1029
00:48:49,777 --> 00:48:51,756
Yuna, let's call it a day.

1030
00:48:51,844 --> 00:48:53,155
No one is buying these muffins.

1031
00:48:53,243 --> 00:48:56,288
I have to sell these,
otherwise, I'll have to throw them away.

1032
00:48:56,376 --> 00:48:58,341
You're so stubborn...

1033
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:00,204
By the way...

1034
00:49:00,765 --> 00:49:01,603
...Yuna...

1035
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:03,708
Why do you live a hard life?

1036
00:49:04,009 --> 00:49:05,375
What do you mean?

1037
00:49:05,577 --> 00:49:06,806
Seol's father...

1038
00:49:07,376 --> 00:49:10,376
Haven't you thought about
telling him about her?

1039
00:49:10,477 --> 00:49:11,311
No.

1040
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:13,322
I've never thought of that.

1041
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,619
Isn't it hard raising her by yourself?

1042
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:18,354
It is hard.

1043
00:49:18,743 --> 00:49:21,841
But I don't want to drag him down
by telling him about Seol.

1044
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:24,666
Seol is my daughter.

1045
00:49:24,993 --> 00:49:26,511
She has nothing to do with him.

1046
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:31,136
Which is why I want
to raise her by myself.

1047
00:49:32,343 --> 00:49:34,705
That's why I started
selling these muffins.

1048
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,222
You can go home if you're tired.

1049
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,721
I'll stay here a bit longer.

1050
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,379
-Go on.
-No...

1051
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:46,228
The day is almost over anyway.

1052
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:48,952
Buy some muffins!

1053
00:49:49,257 --> 00:49:50,889
Buy some muffins! They're delicious.

1054
00:49:51,376 --> 00:49:52,712
Buy some muffins!

1055
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:53,890
They're delicious.

1056
00:49:54,176 --> 00:49:55,939
B-Buy some muffins!

1057
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,677
Please buy some muffins!

1058
00:49:57,777 --> 00:49:59,645
Buy some muffins! I tried some...

1059
00:49:59,777 --> 00:50:01,402
They're really good.
Why aren't they buying them?

1060
00:50:01,577 --> 00:50:03,511
They're really good... Buy some muffins!

1061
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:05,588
What are you doing here?

1062
00:50:05,677 --> 00:50:06,537
Sorry?

1063
00:50:07,143 --> 00:50:08,276
We're selling muffins.

1064
00:50:08,376 --> 00:50:09,888
Do you have a permit?

1065
00:50:09,977 --> 00:50:11,191
Of course.

1066
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,676
Donggu said I could do it.

1067
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,399
Yes, I did.

1068
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:15,979
What's the problem?

1069
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,418
Our company has
a unique interview process.

1070
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:25,467
Relax. We'll have a chat over dinner.

1071
00:50:26,043 --> 00:50:29,426
-You can take your jackets off.
-Okay.

1072
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:35,644
What the hell?

1073
00:50:36,276 --> 00:50:37,366
My shirt...

1074
00:50:38,176 --> 00:50:39,473
Where's my shirt?

1075
00:50:43,944 --> 00:50:46,344
Oh no! What do I do?

1076
00:50:47,276 --> 00:50:48,309
Ms. Kang, what are you doing?

1077
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,916
-Take your jacket off.
-I'm fine.

1078
00:50:51,706 --> 00:50:52,882
I'm feeling a bit cold.

1079
00:50:53,944 --> 00:50:54,756
You are?

1080
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,520
Do whatever's comfortable.

1081
00:50:58,643 --> 00:50:59,943
Here's the pork.

1082
00:51:07,443 --> 00:51:08,667
Oh no! I'm so sorry.

1083
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:11,061
Give me your jacket. I'll wash it for you.

1084
00:51:11,543 --> 00:51:13,555
It's fine. I'll do it.

1085
00:51:13,643 --> 00:51:16,417
-No, I'll wash it for you.
-No!

1086
00:51:16,877 --> 00:51:18,486
I said I'll do it.

1087
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:22,246
It's really okay, so please just go.

1088
00:51:22,443 --> 00:51:23,277
Please?

1089
00:51:26,143 --> 00:51:27,513
Hey, you two!

1090
00:51:28,577 --> 00:51:29,411
Come here.

1091
00:51:30,043 --> 00:51:31,355
Well done today.

1092
00:51:31,443 --> 00:51:33,389
Get home safely and come back tomorrow.

1093
00:51:33,477 --> 00:51:34,744
Thank you.

1094
00:51:40,877 --> 00:51:42,573
Dusik. Look at how much he gave us.

1095
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:46,488
He looks scary but he's generous, right?

1096
00:51:46,577 --> 00:51:47,920
Are you happy?

1097
00:51:48,009 --> 00:51:49,990
It's great that you earned
a lot of money...

1098
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,742
Let's go. I'm exhausted.

1099
00:51:52,343 --> 00:51:54,224
-Don't do that.
-All right.

1100
00:51:55,176 --> 00:51:57,667
I think his fiancee went home.

1101
00:51:58,009 --> 00:52:00,505
-Shall we ask him about Yuna?
-Are you insane?

1102
00:52:00,677 --> 00:52:03,254
That guy is getting married soon!

1103
00:52:03,343 --> 00:52:06,221
What do you think will happen
when he finds out Yuna had his baby?

1104
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,888
-They'll cancel their wedding!
-I guess you're right.

1105
00:52:08,976 --> 00:52:10,360
-What did you just say?
-What?

1106
00:52:13,741 --> 00:52:14,620
Yuna...

1107
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,193
...had my baby?

1108
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,334
Is that true?

1109
00:52:23,944 --> 00:52:26,176
Do you have a boyfriend?

1110
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,687
No, I don't.

1111
00:52:29,944 --> 00:52:31,589
I don't have one either.

1112
00:52:31,677 --> 00:52:32,916
Really?

1113
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:37,476
I think you'd be popular with men.

1114
00:52:37,643 --> 00:52:41,629
Men like glamorous women like you.

1115
00:52:41,877 --> 00:52:42,711
Pardon?

1116
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:46,038
Why are you looking at me like that?

1117
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:48,124
Was that sexual harassment?

1118
00:52:48,213 --> 00:52:50,111
Sorry. I was only joking.

1119
00:52:51,343 --> 00:52:54,505
I can't say anything
in front of women these days.

1120
00:52:57,003 --> 00:52:58,209
Excuse me.

1121
00:52:58,392 --> 00:53:00,338
I have to go to the bathroom.

1122
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:05,314
What's wrong with him?

1123
00:53:05,403 --> 00:53:07,017
I wish I could just...!

1124
00:53:09,844 --> 00:53:10,678
Don't...

1125
00:53:11,604 --> 00:53:13,388
Let it go, Seojin.

1126
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:14,825
This time...

1127
00:53:15,302 --> 00:53:16,748
...you need to get the job.

1128
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:33,577
Shall we have another drink
after the interview?

1129
00:53:34,447 --> 00:53:37,489
-I have an appointment.
-What appointment?

1130
00:53:37,577 --> 00:53:39,654
Is it more important
than passing this interview?

1131
00:53:39,743 --> 00:53:42,819
I guess you don't care
about this interview?

1132
00:53:44,143 --> 00:53:45,888
Just one more drink.

1133
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:48,513
I just want to buy you a drink
because you're like my younger sister.

1134
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:51,018
Don't you want this job?

1135
00:53:56,043 --> 00:53:57,622
She doesn't want to.

1136
00:53:57,711 --> 00:53:59,703
What did you say?

1137
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,077
Because she's like your younger sister?

1138
00:54:02,176 --> 00:54:06,110
If you want to drink that badly,
have a drink with your sister.

1139
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:07,910
What?

1140
00:54:08,643 --> 00:54:10,455
Are you crazy?

1141
00:54:10,543 --> 00:54:11,784
Take your hand off of me.

1142
00:54:12,243 --> 00:54:14,151
-I won't ask again nicely.
-What?

1143
00:54:14,557 --> 00:54:16,043
What are you going to do if I don't?

1144
00:54:16,132 --> 00:54:18,157
Are you going to hit me?

1145
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,213
Go on.

1146
00:54:20,302 --> 00:54:22,297
Hit me!

1147
00:54:23,174 --> 00:54:24,961
You can't do it?

1148
00:54:25,956 --> 00:54:27,721
Know your place.

1149
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:30,067
How dare you speak to me like that!

1150
00:54:38,212 --> 00:54:39,498
Why you...!

1151
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:41,610
What the hell are you doing?

1152
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:43,134
Call the police if you want.

1153
00:54:43,223 --> 00:54:45,684
I'm going to sue you
for sexual harassment.

1154
00:54:47,756 --> 00:54:49,934
Let's go. We don't need to sit
through this interview.

1155
00:54:50,022 --> 00:54:51,835
-Let go of me!
-What?

1156
00:54:51,923 --> 00:54:53,279
What's wrong with you?

1157
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:56,406
Are you going to take responsibility
if I fail this interview?

1158
00:54:56,604 --> 00:54:59,653
Why are you trying to ruin it for me?

1159
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,634
I'm so sorry.

1160
00:55:04,055 --> 00:55:06,036
Are you all right?

1161
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:09,106
Oh no... I'm sorry.

1162
00:55:09,422 --> 00:55:10,804
I'll do it for you.

1163
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,651
Oh no.

1164
00:55:19,356 --> 00:55:20,224
Jungi...

1165
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,641
...listen...

1166
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,553
Maybe we shouldn't have done that.

1167
00:55:25,507 --> 00:55:26,523
"We"?

1168
00:55:28,311 --> 00:55:30,727
You're the one who told him. You.

1169
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:32,301
What?

1170
00:55:32,656 --> 00:55:34,133
You jerk.

1171
00:55:34,222 --> 00:55:35,801
You're putting it all on me?

1172
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,657
I didn't do anything.

1173
00:55:37,756 --> 00:55:41,457
You told him. With that mouth of yours.
You. You. You.

1174
00:55:41,556 --> 00:55:42,893
Are you insane?

1175
00:55:43,055 --> 00:55:45,100
You're a human garbage!

1176
00:55:45,189 --> 00:55:46,701
"Human garbage"?!
You called me garbage?

1177
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:48,868
-You are!
-How dare you!

1178
00:55:48,956 --> 00:55:51,326
Again? You fight at every opportunity.

1179
00:55:51,897 --> 00:55:52,731
What the hell?

1180
00:55:53,268 --> 00:55:54,568
Take a shower.

1181
00:55:54,656 --> 00:55:56,901
-Take a shower.
-Hey.

1182
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,757
-Why are you coming in together?
-We ran into each other...

1183
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:02,496
Yuna, did you sell your muffins?

1184
00:56:03,089 --> 00:56:03,901
Actually...

1185
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,024
We were selling them.

1186
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:07,430
But then the officers came
and confiscated them.

1187
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:08,656
She didn't have a permit,

1188
00:56:08,756 --> 00:56:11,490
and has to pay a fine for violating
the food hygiene regulations.

1189
00:56:11,623 --> 00:56:12,457
Really?

1190
00:56:12,589 --> 00:56:15,423
It's all my fault.
I should've looked into it.

1191
00:56:16,356 --> 00:56:17,801
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

1192
00:56:17,894 --> 00:56:21,511
I'll put Seol on the bed
and start preparing dinner.

1193
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,102
-You're trash.
-How could you call me that?

1194
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:28,725
-How could you do this to me?
-Shut up.

1195
00:56:28,814 --> 00:56:30,493
-It was your idea.
-It was your idea.

1196
00:56:30,582 --> 00:56:31,632
Anyone here?

1197
00:56:32,451 --> 00:56:33,285
Welcome.

1198
00:56:33,374 --> 00:56:34,266
That voice...!

1199
00:56:43,783 --> 00:56:45,657
I came to see Han Yuna.

1200
00:56:45,746 --> 00:56:47,233
-You did this.
-It's all your fault.

1201
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:48,471
Yuna?

1202
00:56:49,523 --> 00:56:50,628
Who are you though?

1203
00:56:52,055 --> 00:56:52,893
Junseong?

1204
00:56:54,122 --> 00:56:54,956
Yuna.

1205
00:56:58,089 --> 00:56:59,500
How did you find me?

1206
00:56:59,589 --> 00:57:00,484
We need to talk.

1207
00:57:01,723 --> 00:57:03,723
What's happening?
What is happening...?

1208
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:05,904
-Who is he?
-He's um...

1209
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:08,191
He's Seol's father.

1210
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:10,857
What? He's Seol's father?

1211
00:57:11,707 --> 00:57:13,090
How did he know about this place?

1212
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,364
Actually, we...

1213
00:57:14,453 --> 00:57:15,730
We went to see him.

1214
00:57:16,155 --> 00:57:17,901
-To tell him about Seol.
-What?

1215
00:57:18,489 --> 00:57:20,946
-Why did you do that? Are you insane?
-Are you insane?

1216
00:57:21,035 --> 00:57:23,323
I didn't do anything.
He's the one who told him everything.

1217
00:57:23,412 --> 00:57:26,497
-You're so immature!
-You're a traitor!

1218
00:57:26,586 --> 00:57:27,920
-You're a human garbage!
-Human garbage?!

1219
00:57:28,322 --> 00:57:29,455
I told you not to do that!

1220
00:57:29,623 --> 00:57:31,234
That's not important!

1221
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,601
Hurry. Let's follow them.

1222
00:57:33,689 --> 00:57:35,802
What? It's their private life.

1223
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,591
-Don't go!
-Come on.

1224
00:57:42,338 --> 00:57:45,679
-What happened? How did you find me?
-Han Yuna.

1225
00:57:46,556 --> 00:57:48,192
Are you trying to ruin my life?

1226
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:49,132
What?

1227
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:51,199
-What are you taking...
-Listen carefully.

1228
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:52,823
I'm getting married soon.

1229
00:57:53,289 --> 00:57:54,133
So...

1230
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:55,817
Take this.

1231
00:57:56,356 --> 00:57:59,142
Take this and never contact me again.
Understand?

1232
00:57:59,422 --> 00:58:00,544
What's going on?

1233
00:58:01,155 --> 00:58:02,554
What's this?

1234
00:58:02,643 --> 00:58:03,501
It's not enough?

1235
00:58:03,589 --> 00:58:05,702
You wanted to use a baby to get money.

1236
00:58:05,844 --> 00:58:06,678
You want more?

1237
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:08,995
You should be grateful
that I'm even giving you this money.

1238
00:58:09,155 --> 00:58:12,184
Frankly, I don't know
if that baby is really mine.

1239
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:14,835
What the hell did he just say?

1240
00:58:14,923 --> 00:58:17,201
-I can't stand this.
-Donggu!

1241
00:58:17,289 --> 00:58:19,995
How can I be sure you're
not trying to scam me?

1242
00:58:20,155 --> 00:58:22,835
What on earth are you talking about?

1243
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:26,768
You jerk...

1244
00:58:26,856 --> 00:58:28,260
What did you just say?

1245
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,568
Do you even know what her life is like?

1246
00:58:31,656 --> 00:58:32,809
He lost his temper again.

1247
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:34,400
"Scam"?

1248
00:58:34,489 --> 00:58:35,985
Donggu, stop!

1249
00:58:36,074 --> 00:58:38,934
Let me go.
He's not qualified to be Seol's father.

1250
00:58:39,022 --> 00:58:40,827
-He's...
-Wait!

1251
00:58:42,589 --> 00:58:43,767
Seol's father?

1252
00:58:43,856 --> 00:58:45,685
What are you talking about?

1253
00:58:45,786 --> 00:58:47,276
He's not Seol's father.

1254
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:50,177
What?

1255
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:51,824
What?

1256
00:58:52,122 --> 00:58:53,467
He's not Seol's father?

1257
00:58:53,556 --> 00:58:54,668
Then who... Who is he?

1258
00:58:54,756 --> 00:58:57,701
We went on a blind date once.

1259
00:58:58,589 --> 00:59:01,423
Then why was his number saved
in your phone?

1260
00:59:01,523 --> 00:59:02,635
To block his calls.

1261
00:59:02,723 --> 00:59:05,424
He kept calling and coming
to see me whenever he got drunk.

1262
00:59:05,523 --> 00:59:07,297
Then why did you come here?

1263
00:59:07,386 --> 00:59:10,213
I blacked out after drinking
on our blind date.

1264
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:13,610
So I thought maybe something had happened.

1265
00:59:15,189 --> 00:59:16,269
This is so embarrassing.

1266
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:20,305
I'm the crazy one for believing these two.

1267
00:59:20,775 --> 00:59:23,066
Jeez... Unbelievable...

1268
00:59:24,224 --> 00:59:25,344
You can't just leave.

1269
00:59:25,433 --> 00:59:26,484
You hit me.

1270
00:59:26,723 --> 00:59:27,795
What?

1271
00:59:29,923 --> 00:59:31,497
Listen.

1272
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,742
I had an interview today.

1273
00:59:35,556 --> 00:59:37,723
I don't think I passed it.

1274
00:59:38,601 --> 00:59:39,688
I, actually...

1275
00:59:41,322 --> 00:59:46,756
I slapped the interviewer with pork.

1276
00:59:49,952 --> 00:59:53,153
He was a really bad guy.

1277
00:59:54,389 --> 00:59:55,691
But...

1278
00:59:57,122 --> 00:59:59,275
They said I was wrong.

1279
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:02,198
They said...

1280
01:00:03,394 --> 01:00:05,178
...I made a mistake.

1281
01:00:07,489 --> 01:00:08,878
I thought...

1282
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,877
...I was doing a good thing.

1283
01:00:16,451 --> 01:00:17,618
I don't know...

1284
01:00:19,263 --> 01:00:20,563
I really don't know...

1285
01:00:21,996 --> 01:00:24,187
I really don't know...

1286
01:00:32,279 --> 01:00:34,279
Sorry, I've been talking too much.

1287
01:00:34,656 --> 01:00:37,440
You seem troubled too.

1288
01:00:37,723 --> 01:00:41,337
Tell me. I'll listen to your story.

1289
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,956
Mister.

1290
01:00:52,256 --> 01:00:54,224
Are you not wearing pants?

1291
01:00:54,322 --> 01:00:58,601
Make sure you wear pants to an interview.

1292
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:00,817
Or you'll get in big trouble.

1293
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,722
Mister, don't stare ahead. Look at me.

1294
01:01:04,756 --> 01:01:06,856
I forgot my shirt...

1295
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:09,023
My shirt...

1296
01:01:19,489 --> 01:01:21,100
Ouch, my eye...

1297
01:01:21,189 --> 01:01:22,723
He's got a strong punch.

1298
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:27,804
I'm so embarrassed.

1299
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:31,221
I was out of my mind.
Those jerks are ruining my life.

1300
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:37,961
Here.

1301
01:01:49,762 --> 01:01:50,844
Does it hurt a lot?

1302
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:51,775
Yes.

1303
01:01:52,229 --> 01:01:53,996
You shouldn't have punched him.

1304
01:01:55,089 --> 01:01:57,839
The way he spoke pissed me off.

1305
01:01:59,614 --> 01:02:01,062
You did that because you care about me?

1306
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:04,418
No. What do you mean?

1307
01:02:04,531 --> 01:02:05,771
I don't.

1308
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,293
Never mind then.

1309
01:02:08,956 --> 01:02:10,871
Anyway, thanks, Donggu.

1310
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,186
For what?

1311
01:02:12,551 --> 01:02:14,470
For letting me stay here.

1312
01:02:17,489 --> 01:02:20,370
I had felt very lonely before I came here.

1313
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:24,573
But I don't feel lonely anymore.

1314
01:02:25,756 --> 01:02:28,066
Now I have people who worry about me.

1315
01:02:29,885 --> 01:02:33,121
I've never had a family,
so I'm not sure, but...

1316
01:02:33,689 --> 01:02:36,553
...I think this is what a family...

1317
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:38,207
...would feel like.

1318
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,997
Then do a better job around here.

1319
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:43,826
You're scolding me again.

1320
01:02:45,504 --> 01:02:46,239
Geez.

1321
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:48,634
Rubbing it like that won't get rid of it.

1322
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,190
-Give it to me, I'll do it.
-It's fine.

1323
01:02:51,322 --> 01:02:54,223
-I'll do it for you.
-It's fine.

1324
01:02:54,322 --> 01:02:55,909
-Trust me!
-It's okay.

1325
01:02:59,623 --> 01:03:00,501
Oh no!

1326
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:04,575
I said I don't need your help!

1327
01:03:04,664 --> 01:03:07,076
You can't do anything right!

1328
01:03:07,165 --> 01:03:08,541
I...

1329
01:03:08,996 --> 01:03:10,452
I didn't do it on purpose!

1330
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:11,375
What?

1331
01:03:12,017 --> 01:03:13,545
Now you're even talking back?

1332
01:03:13,879 --> 01:03:14,724
This...

1333
01:03:15,389 --> 01:03:17,957
This is outrageous!

1334
01:03:18,322 --> 01:03:20,301
It's your fault too.

1335
01:03:20,389 --> 01:03:21,634
You always pick on me.

1336
01:03:21,723 --> 01:03:23,201
I can shout too, you know!

1337
01:03:23,289 --> 01:03:25,684
How scary. What did I do wrong?

1338
01:03:25,773 --> 01:03:28,835
Let's see that temper of yours.
What are you going to do?

1339
01:03:28,923 --> 01:03:30,923
What are you going to do?

1340
01:03:31,256 --> 01:03:32,835
-I'm going to get mad.
-Go on.

1341
01:03:32,924 --> 01:03:36,091
-I've been holding back.
-Go on, get mad.

1342
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,559
You know what happens when I get angry.

1343
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:39,794
You'd be shocked when I get mad.

1344
01:03:39,923 --> 01:03:41,956
You'll be the one who gets shocked.

1345
01:03:42,045 --> 01:03:43,850
Why are you so strong?

1346
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:46,337
Why is your head like a rock, Yuna?

1347
01:03:46,426 --> 01:03:48,224
I'm really going to get mad!

1348
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,233
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1349
01:04:05,322 --> 01:04:06,134
Oh my god!

1350
01:04:06,222 --> 01:04:08,067
I want to give up on becoming
a journalist or getting a job.

1351
01:04:08,155 --> 01:04:11,601
What she needs is consolation.

1352
01:04:11,689 --> 01:04:13,869
If you overcome this harsh wind,

1353
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:16,233
you'll be able to bloom
into a beautiful flower.

1354
01:04:16,322 --> 01:04:17,954
Why are you at the police station?

1355
01:04:18,043 --> 01:04:20,756
Kang Seojin! You did nothing wrong?

1356
01:04:20,856 --> 01:04:22,684
So cheer up, all right?

1357
01:04:22,773 --> 01:04:25,635
I think I'm in love.

1358
01:04:25,723 --> 01:04:27,594
She seems interested in me.

1359
01:04:27,683 --> 01:04:28,934
Dusik. What are you doing?

1360
01:04:29,022 --> 01:04:30,635
I was watching a movie.

1361
01:04:30,723 --> 01:04:32,012
-Let's watch it together.
-No!

1362
01:04:32,591 --> 01:04:35,100
Why did it go to Seonwoo? Darn it!

1363
01:04:35,189 --> 01:04:36,568
Are you insane?

1364
01:04:36,656 --> 01:04:38,868
Do you have a girlfriend?
What do you think about me?

1365
01:04:38,957 --> 01:04:40,758
I think she's going out with someone else.

1366
01:04:40,847 --> 01:04:43,880
I'll find him and destroy him.

1367
01:04:44,055 --> 01:04:45,134
The swine flu?

1368
01:04:45,222 --> 01:04:48,535
This is for your mom.
I'm concerned about her.

1369
01:04:48,623 --> 01:04:50,802
Yuna, you're kind of a nuisance.

1370
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,591
I wanted to ask you out.

1371
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:54,201
-Isn't that Yuna?
-Who is that?

1372
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:56,856
-Either vacate this place or get married.
-What?

1373
01:04:57,013 --> 01:04:58,247
Get married?
