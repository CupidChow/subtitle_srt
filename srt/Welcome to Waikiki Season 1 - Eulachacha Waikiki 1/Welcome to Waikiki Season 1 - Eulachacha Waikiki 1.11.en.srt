1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,905
Donggu.

2
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:09,877
Yuna, I have something
to say to you.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,112
What is it?

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,581
I like you.

5
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,784
I really like you, Yuna.

6
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:28,917
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:30,622
I like you.

8
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:31,927
So, I want to say...

9
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,302
Will you be my girlfriend?

10
00:00:41,036 --> 00:00:42,342
No.

11
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:43,510
What?

12
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,412
But, why?

13
00:00:46,236 --> 00:00:49,216
Is it because of your situation?

14
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:54,739
I'm ready to take care of you and Seol.

15
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:59,126
When did I ask you to take
care of me and Seol?

16
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,135
-No, what I mean is...
-Then...

17
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:06,767
So, a single mother like me
has to say yes to a proposal?

18
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,969
Is that what you think?

19
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:11,483
No, that's not what I meant.

20
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,541
I'll just pretend I didn't hear that.

21
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,945
Yuna.

22
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,218
You left your phone in my car.

23
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,720
Thank you.

24
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,322
Drive safely.

25
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:30,123
Yes. See you.

26
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:48,008
-Are you all right?
-Sua.

27
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,711
-She turned me down, didn't she?
-Yes.

28
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,312
On top of that, in just five seconds.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,313
Five seconds?

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,982
Why?

31
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,017
Why?

32
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,419
Chewbacca.

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,301
-It's Saturday. What are you doing today?
-Trainees don't have weekends.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,591
I have to watch every show on TV
and write reviews.

35
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,424
They give these jobs to me
because I'm a trainee.

36
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:07,527
Oh, my.

37
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,529
Well, you wanted to
become a reporter.

38
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,431
But now you're complaining?

39
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,892
Gosh, my ears are so itchy.

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,270
Chewbacca.

41
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,201
-Can you clean my ears as a new reporter?
-What?

42
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:23,300
I think there's a big earwax.

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,511
Clean it for me.

44
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,713
Come on. Clean my ears.

45
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,132
What... What the hell are you doing?

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,334
You can just say that you don't want to.
You didn't have to push me.

47
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,723
When did I do that?

48
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,226
Darn it.

49
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,329
Yuna.

50
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,830
We need to talk.

51
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:47,249
Why don't you want to go out with me?
I need to at least know why you reject me.

52
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,935
What? What?

53
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,937
What? She turned you down?

54
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,240
-What does that mean?
-Stay out of this!

55
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:55,319
Tell me the reason.

56
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,245
I don't want to date you.

57
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,348
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Can I go?

58
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:04,933
What does this mean?

59
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:07,416
So, you like Yuna?

60
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,935
Donggu likes Yuna.

61
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,925
-But he got turn down in five seconds.
-What?

62
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,027
Wait! Five seconds?

63
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:16,430
Five seconds? Really?

64
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,434
Donggu! Where are you going?

65
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,808
Yuna, I have something to say to you.

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,309
I like you.

67
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,211
I really like you, Yuna.

68
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:43,924
No.

69
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:48,628
When did I ask you to take
care of me and Seol?

70
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,344
Darn it! So noisy!

71
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,451
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,553
Sua.

73
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,956
Do you think I'm
unattractive as a man?

74
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,867
Aren't I a good catch?

75
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,861
I'm pretty handsome and tall.

76
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:22,996
I'm tall.

77
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,100
I'm tall...

78
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,772
That's right.
But, aren't I a pretty good catch?

79
00:04:31,868 --> 00:04:36,476
Do you want the truth or the lie?

80
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,577
Forget it.

81
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,679
Never mind.

82
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,181
I'm going to use the bathroom.

83
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,159
"Brother"

84
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:53,960
My brother thinks I'm in the US.

85
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,567
Hello?

86
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,370
Subong! Hi!

87
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,971
Why did you call me?

88
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,274
Do I need a reason to call you?

89
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,476
I didn't even see you
when you flew off to the US.

90
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,468
I wanted to hear your voice.

91
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,663
I came back from
off-season training today.

92
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,349
Oh, right!
You have a game coming up, right?

93
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,250
I have to go to
Hong Kong, China in two days.

94
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,153
How's the life in the US?

95
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,922
It's very good.

96
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:23,423
So good. Very good.

97
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:25,058
That's a relief.

98
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:29,462
But I'm busy right now,
so I can't talk long.

99
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:33,567
But your voice sounds like
you're right next to me.

100
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,369
The technology is pretty good these days.

101
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,872
I'll call you later.

102
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:40,373
Okay.

103
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,676
-Bye.
-Take care.

104
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:44,277
Sua.

105
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,478
Subong.

106
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:48,582
How come you're here?
You're supposed to be in the US.

107
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:51,691
-Subong, I can explain.
-Sua...

108
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:53,086
Let's just go home and sleep.

109
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,487
I'm tired.

110
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,489
Donggu.

111
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,791
Subong.

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,493
Wait. Let's go home and sleep?

113
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:01,862
You guys live together?

114
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:04,051
-Didn't you guys break up?
-Well...

115
00:06:04,138 --> 00:06:06,466
I broke up with Yunseok
and got back together with Donggu.

116
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:09,741
I knew you'd worry if I'd told you
that I broke up with Yunseok.

117
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:12,138
-So I pretended to be in the US.
-Yeah?

118
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,341
But why do you live in Donggu's house?

119
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,243
-What about your place?
-What?

120
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:17,748
The thing is...

121
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:22,749
Donggu said we could live together
and save rent money for our wedding.

122
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,653
Wedding? You guys are getting married?

123
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,650
Wow, really?

124
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:30,957
It's cold. Let's talk at your place.

125
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,860
-Let's go.
-We'll be right behind you.

126
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,463
-What the hell are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

127
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,931
You know what my brother is like.

128
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:39,934
Donggu, please help me out this once.

129
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:43,036
If he finds out I was scammed,
he'll kill me.

130
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:44,838
All right. Fine.

131
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:45,639
Wait.

132
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,607
Isn't Jungi home right now?

133
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,510
Can't believe Donggu likes Yuna.

134
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,112
Can you believe it?

135
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,315
What's more amazing is
that he got turned down in five seconds.

136
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:59,019
From now on, Donggu's nickname
is "Five Seconds."

137
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:00,921
In short, "Fi-Se."

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,923
"Fi-Se."

139
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:05,525
-Fi-Se.
-Fi-Se.

140
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,328
Fi-Se.

141
00:07:08,818 --> 00:07:09,829
Who is calling me?

142
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,832
-It's Donggu.
-Fi-Se?

143
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,035
Hello, Fi-Se.

144
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,737
It's your nickname, Fi-Se.

145
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,241
What?

146
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,543
Subong?

147
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,046
Subong is coming?

148
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:28,148
To our place?

149
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,749
Darn it!

150
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,750
-What does that mean? Subong is coming?
-I don't know.

151
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,454
I'll hide. Call me when he leaves.

152
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,257
If he catches me today, he'll kill me.

153
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,527
It's been such a long time.

154
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,428
We're here!

155
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,029
We brought Subong!

156
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,131
Subong is here!

157
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,301
It's been ages.

158
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,038
-Dusik! Seojin!
-Hello.

159
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:53,640
It's been so long!

160
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,542
Gosh, these brats.

161
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,978
I missed you, cuties!

162
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,581
You're still very strong.

163
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:03,283
You guys are so cute.

164
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:07,204
Nice to see you again, Subong.

165
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,700
Hey, but I'm disappointed in you guys.

166
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:14,494
You should have told me
about these two getting back together.

167
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,864
What? They're back together?

168
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,967
I told him that we're back together.

169
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:25,372
Yes, Sua asked us to keep it a secret.

170
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,476
You guys are good friends.

171
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,578
Men live by loyalty.

172
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,280
-Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

173
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,281
Loyalty...

174
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,285
Wow, this place is the same.

175
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,360
What's this?

176
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,462
It's a photo of Jungi.

177
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,367
Why is it still here?

178
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,272
Why do you still have a photo
of a dead man?

179
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:04,277
Jungi...

180
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,983
I still can't believe that he's dead.

181
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,085
Jungi...

182
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,789
Jungi...

183
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,590
Jungi...

184
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:20,894
Yes, it was a shock to all of us.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,200
I mean, he got struck by lightening.

186
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:24,297
So sad.

187
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,966
He got punished.

188
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,770
How dare he steal his friend's girlfriend.
My girlfriend at that?

189
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,173
I don't want to speak ill of the dead,

190
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,475
but it was probably better
for him to die like that.

191
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:38,978
If I had caught
him back then,

192
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:45,151
he would've spent the rest of his life
in the hospital paralyzed.

193
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:50,396
Jungi, a mail came for you.

194
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,561
Where's Jungi?

195
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,731
What does that mean?

196
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,846
Yuna, you're doing it again.

197
00:10:00,957 --> 00:10:03,670
-Jungi is dead. Remember?
-What?

198
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,455
What are you talking about?

199
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:07,540
-He was here a few minutes ago.
-Yuna!

200
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,343
Have you taken your medication?
You have to take it on time.

201
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,437
-Follow me!
-What?

202
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,236
-This is trash!
-Wait.

203
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,347
-You're not stable.
-But Jungi...

204
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,749
-No, but Jungi...
-Jungi is not coming back anymore!

205
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:21,650
What was that about? Who's she?

206
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:24,157
She works here.

207
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,960
She hasn't overcome
the shock of Jungi's death.

208
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,263
-She still thinks he's alive.
-Really?

209
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,066
How sad.

210
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,071
Will she get better with medication?

211
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:40,140
What?

212
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:43,567
Jungi stole Sua's brother's girlfriend?

213
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:44,952
That's right.

214
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:48,548
Subong was going to kill Jungi.

215
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,567
So, you guys lied to him
that Jungi's dead?

216
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,354
We said no, but Jungi asked us to.

217
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,557
Subong is a UFC fighter.

218
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,758
A human weapon.

219
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,067
19 fights, 19 wins, 19 KOs.

220
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,263
But how could you lie that he's dead?

221
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:05,865
Where's Jungi right now?

222
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,245
Why is he here?

223
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:22,148
This is so uncomfortable.

224
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,950
He'll probably leave soon.

225
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:27,854
What was that noise?

226
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,989
It came from over there.

227
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,897
Sorry. I have a cold.

228
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,099
Really?

229
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,302
Seojin.

230
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,904
-Do you still grow facial hair?
-What?

231
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,175
Yes, it will probably grow
for the rest of my life.

232
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:50,877
I'm tired.

233
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:54,480
Subong, it's late. You should go now.

234
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,483
I need to get back to
the training center.

235
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,788
Hi, Coach.

236
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:03,890
Really?

237
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,391
Got it.

238
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,294
-This is a problem.
-What's wrong?

239
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,296
The boiler is broken.

240
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,998
What should I do?

241
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,402
I can just stay here.

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,906
Donggu. I'm leaving the country
in two days.

243
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,175
Can I stay here until then?

244
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,577
What?

245
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,280
Two days...

246
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:32,501
You need to stay in your best condition
for your game in two weeks.

247
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,787
It's too crowded and noisy here.

248
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,789
It's fine.

249
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:39,402
I live with lots of people all the time.

250
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:43,396
Oh, but all the rooms are taken.

251
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,901
I can sleep on the sofa.

252
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,001
We'll sleep on the sofa.
You can sleep in our room.

253
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,901
You know that I hate being a nuisance.

254
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,005
Subong, then let's have beer!

255
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,008
I can't eat anything because I have
to lose weight for the game.

256
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,525
And I want to watch some TV
that I missed out while I was training.

257
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,414
So, don't mind me and go to bed.

258
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,615
But still...

259
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,119
Okay. Good night.

260
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:07,887
Your hand-grip thing is scary.

261
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,089
-Enjoy the TV.
-Thanks.

262
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:11,090
Subong...

263
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,492
-Enjoy the drama.
-Alright.

264
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,200
That was amazing.

265
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,902
That was so amazing.

266
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,738
Kim Namju. Ji Jinhee.

267
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:28,708
Incredible.

268
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,510
What should I watch now?

269
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,013
Oh, yes. "Wife's Desires".

270
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,416
I heard there's a great twist.

271
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:39,519
It's so late. Why is he still watching TV?

272
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,521
I have to pee and my legs are numb.

273
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,690
Darn it.

274
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:45,692
I need to pee.

275
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:47,802
What do I do?

276
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,105
I didn't ask you
to take care of me and Seol.

277
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,007
I'll just pretend I didn't hear that.

278
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,810
I don't want to date you.

279
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,520
Donggu, I have to pee. Help me.

280
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:19,826
Dusik, I have to pee. Help me.

281
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:31,070
This is so tedious. There's no end to it.

282
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,340
I wonder if Jungi's okay.

283
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:35,842
What was that?

284
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:38,244
Why am I worried about him?

285
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:43,449
I must be going crazy.
Get it together.

286
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,151
What's this?

287
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:50,168
I really have to pee. Help me, Chewbacca.

288
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:52,058
He's an idiot. Then why do I...

289
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:56,963
Let's watch from episode eight.

290
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:01,868
This is going to be amazing.

291
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:05,071
Oh my!

292
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,074
-Seojin, why aren't you in bed?
-What?

293
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,377
I'm looking for something.

294
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,679
Where did I put it?

295
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,489
Why do you have an empty bottle?

296
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:17,583
What?

297
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,187
I just felt like holding something.

298
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,289
My hands feel so empty.

299
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:28,494
Thanks, Chewbacca.

300
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:38,604
What's that noise?

301
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,107
Is there a water leak?

302
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,800
What noise?

303
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,812
I can't hear anything.

304
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,981
-I heard something.
-I can't sleep. I'll watch TV with you.

305
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,484
I can't hear the TV.

306
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,186
That's too loud.

307
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:57,790
Well, I have a bad hearing.

308
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,199
Seojin, it's overflowing.

309
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,701
My pee is overflowing.

310
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,468
Hey, what are you doing so early?

311
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,070
What are you writing?

312
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:48,374
Hey, what...

313
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:52,678
What the heck?

314
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,081
You've been doing this all night?

315
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,552
I don't understand.

316
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,154
-Am I that unattractive?
-No!

317
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,657
You're a great catch.

318
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,860
Right? Then why did Yuna turn me down?

319
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,663
Shouldn't she take some time
to think about my proposal?

320
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:11,964
Yes, that's true.

321
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:14,448
What did you actually say to her?

322
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,868
I grabbed her arms
in front of the guest house.

323
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,954
I told her "I like you. Let's date",
like a man.

324
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:23,175
Wait.

325
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,145
You told her on the street?

326
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,148
-Without as much as a flower?
-That's right. So what?

327
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:30,950
That's not right.

328
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,834
I would turn you down if you'd proposed
to me on the street with no flowers.

329
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:35,054
Really?

330
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,057
-Is that why she said no?
-Yes.

331
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,641
Now I understand.

332
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,262
-Dusik!
-Even I don't make that mistake.

333
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,835
I thought I was being manly,
but I was wrong.

334
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,935
Hey, is Jungi still in the cabinet?

335
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,111
I must've dozed off.

336
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:00,513
What's this?

337
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:04,884
Is it morning?

338
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,688
I can't tell the time in here.

339
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:14,384
I've got pins and needles in my legs.

340
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:19,398
Is he still outside?

341
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,403
Wow.

342
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:26,105
Unbelievable.

343
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:30,676
Why does he watch so much TV?

344
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:35,081
Then, you're my father's daughter?

345
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:36,082
What?

346
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,284
The daughter-in-law
is actually his daughter?

347
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,885
Wow, amazing.

348
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,289
My gosh!

349
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:46,959
Subong, good morning.

350
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,762
Yes.

351
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,164
-Let's get some breakfast.
-No, thanks.

352
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,167
I have to watch this show,
so don't talk to me.

353
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:01,674
30 years ago, you abandoned
Yoo Geumran, remember?

354
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,776
How do you know that?

355
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:06,646
I'm her daughter.

356
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,247
What? What did you say?

357
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:09,348
-You're...
-Wow!

358
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:13,452
Wow, his wife is also his daughter?

359
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,556
Best TV drama ever.

360
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,060
This is so amazing!

361
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,070
Is he an athlete or a TV drama critic?

362
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,672
He's watching it nonstop.

363
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,574
He loves TV dramas.

364
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:39,178
He spends half of his fight money
on TV drama replays.

365
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,080
My goodness, poor Jungi.

366
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,950
Where's Yuna?

367
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,787
She made breakfast and
went to baking school to do something.

368
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,884
Since when did you like Yuna?

369
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:52,291
It's been a while.

370
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,167
I've thought long and hard about this.
So don't try to lecture me.

371
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:56,595
Fine.

372
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,965
I'm late. I'll just eat something
at the convenient store.

373
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,449
Wait.

374
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:05,864
-I'm coming with you.
-You can't leave.

375
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,473
What about Subong?

376
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:10,676
I have to catch Lee Yunseok
before Subong finds out.

377
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:12,378
He'll kill me if he finds out.

378
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,613
Donggu, take care of my brother.

379
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,915
Let's go.

380
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:17,333
You're so annoying.

381
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:19,201
I can't handle him by myself.

382
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,922
I have to get ready for work.
Look after Seol. Thanks.

383
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,523
Have fun, Seol.

384
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,325
Alright. See you.

385
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:32,698
Seol.

386
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:35,201
What does your mom like?

387
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,104
What can I do to make her say yes?

388
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,006
What did you say?

389
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,810
You said something. Say it again.

390
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:48,914
Stop cooing and gurgling
and tell me.

391
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,283
Tell me.

392
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,889
Why isn't he coming?

393
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,924
I need to catch him
before Subong finds out.

394
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,327
How should I write the fight scene?

395
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,828
Are you still writing that?

396
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:05,531
-Do you make money writing this?
-No.

397
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,717
Then why do you write it?

398
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:09,535
Because I like doing it.

399
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:13,539
Your life is pretty bad too.

400
00:21:13,734 --> 00:21:15,541
How should I write it?

401
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,344
Should he use the finger jab?

402
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,446
-What's a finger jab?
-Finger jab?

403
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:25,751
It's one of the jeet kune do skills
that Bruce Lee invented.

404
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:29,755
It's a terrifying skill where you jab
the opponent's eye and blind him.

405
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:30,656
Jab his eye?

406
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,258
That's fighting dirty.

407
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,674
Jeet kune do's philosophy is
to end the fight as fast as possible.

408
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,868
No idiot will just stand there
and get their eye jabbed.

409
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,765
You know nothing.

410
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,769
Finger jab is super fast.

411
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,269
-Want me to show you?
-Yes.

412
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,853
See? It's fast, what?

413
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:02,555
You can't even see my finger.
You can't avoid it.

414
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:03,956
I think I can.

415
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:05,157
Try it on me.

416
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,067
You should be terrified right now.

417
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,829
Don't regret this, okay?

418
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,932
Here we go.

419
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:18,971
It hurts!

420
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,873
My finger!

421
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,275
That's impossible.

422
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:27,313
My daughter-in-law and my wife
weren't my biological daughters.

423
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:31,116
-I was betrayed.
-No way.

424
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:33,619
I should leave this place.

425
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:36,188
Thunder.

426
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:50,169
I need to go back to my planet
Ppira-ddu-ddu-raddu.

427
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,268
Bye, planet earth.

428
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,073
Bye.

429
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,417
Bravo. Wow! Amazing! So amazing!

430
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:07,316
The dad was an alien.

431
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,201
The title is Wife's Desires
but it ended with the dad being an alien.

432
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,567
What an amazing twist.

433
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:14,059
This is the best TV drama ever.

434
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,861
I'll watch it again and again.

435
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,564
How did they come up with this?

436
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:22,768
I have to make everything perfect
for Yuna this time.

437
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:26,772
I can't do it with him in the house.

438
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,374
I have to watch it again.

439
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,976
This is nuts.

440
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,981
Yuna, you're here early.

441
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,583
Hello.

442
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,685
I came early.

443
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:43,889
By the way...

444
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,492
Who was that man yesterday?

445
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,001
He's the owner of the guest house.

446
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,197
Oh, I see.

447
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,501
-Why did you...
-Hyeonjun.

448
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,205
-I don't want to talk about it.
-Okay.

449
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:01,907
I'm sorry.

450
00:24:11,494 --> 00:24:13,485
I'm going to the bathroom.
Watch the counter.

451
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,787
Okay.

452
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,690
I'm so bored.

453
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,292
How long do I have to do this?

454
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:23,595
Excuse me.

455
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,498
-Is that ramyeon in today?
-What?

456
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,300
Which one?

457
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:33,005
Wait.

458
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,708
That voice...

459
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,016
Where is it?

460
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:51,223
Hey!

461
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,425
-You!
-Sua?

462
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:56,934
Stop!

463
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,330
You're dead!

464
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,935
-Wait.
-You can't run from me!

465
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:05,237
-Wait.
-Give me my money back!

466
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,039
Thai?

467
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:08,774
Get out of the way!

468
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:11,667
Dusik, catch him.

469
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,278
-He's the swindler!
-Move!

470
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:14,380
I said move.

471
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,216
-What are you doing?
-Get out of my way.

472
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,785
Put it down. You'll hurt someone.

473
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,588
Get out of the way
if you don't want to get hurt.

474
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,227
What do I do?

475
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,003
-What are you doing?
-What is he doing?

476
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,205
You'll get really hurt.

477
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:46,321
Finger. Finger.

478
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:47,212
This brat!

479
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:48,514
Jab!

480
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:53,185
Oh, my finger. It hurts! It hurts!

481
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,688
You scamming jerk!

482
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:57,990
Dusik, call the police!

483
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,691
You fight dirty. How can you stab my eye!

484
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,193
Finger jab.

485
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,498
I need to go back to my planet
Ppira-ddu-ddu-raddu.

486
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,700
Bye, planet earth.

487
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,570
Wow, it's even better the second time.

488
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:13,872
The writer is a genius.

489
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:22,081
My body feels tense
from watching all that TV.

490
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,184
I'll go out for a run.

491
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,499
Ow, my legs.

492
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,141
It's so cold.

493
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,217
Lee Jungi!

494
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,319
But you died.

495
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:01,920
How come you're here?

496
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,951
What? You lied to me?

497
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:06,335
Do you know my brother?

498
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,460
Brother? What are you talking about?

499
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:11,830
I think you mistook me for my brother.

500
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:16,468
I'm Jungi's twin brother Lee Jungu.

501
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:20,163
-What? A twin brother?
-Yes.

502
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:22,774
Jungi was a twin?

503
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:26,845
What's all that noise?

504
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:33,783
-Donggu.
-Yes.

505
00:27:33,868 --> 00:27:36,155
-Was Jungi a twin?
-What?

506
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,056
Donggu, it's been a while.

507
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,893
It's me Jungu. Lee Jungu.

508
00:27:41,062 --> 00:27:41,895
What?

509
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,868
Oh, right. Jungu.

510
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,965
How have you been?

511
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,561
Jungi really had a twin brother?

512
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,871
I had no idea.

513
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,141
I thought so.

514
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,334
He did it again.

515
00:27:57,434 --> 00:27:58,944
He was always like that.

516
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,446
He always ignored me.

517
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:04,134
We were born on the same day and time,

518
00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:06,518
but he treated me like I
didn't exist all my life.

519
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:07,920
Lee Jungi.

520
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,621
You're putting on a show, aren't you?

521
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:11,223
How could you say that?

522
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:13,125
Then who am I?

523
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,928
Don't I exist?

524
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,831
My parents only loved my brother,
so I've been alone my whole life.

525
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:22,534
I hated my brother.

526
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:24,603
I'm Lee Jungu.

527
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,105
I do exist!

528
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:37,382
You're really Jungi's twin brother?

529
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,819
Chin up, Jungu.

530
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,621
I had no idea.

531
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,023
I really didn't know.

532
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,427
It's okay. I'm used to it.

533
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:51,530
-Have a seat.
-No, I'm fine.

534
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,534
I can't stay because
my heart is breaking.

535
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,737
Excuse me. I'll go home now.

536
00:28:58,822 --> 00:28:59,605
Hold it.

537
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:03,508
What's wrong?

538
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:07,999
-Where's Jungi?
-What do you mean?

539
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:11,516
-He died.
-Where is he buried?

540
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:13,418
He was cremated.

541
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:14,834
Which charnel house is he in?

542
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:19,691
We were going to place his ashes there
but we scattered his ashes.

543
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:23,795
Then tell me where you
scattered his ashes.

544
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:27,601
Actually, can you take me there?

545
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,201
I'm too busy. Bye.

546
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,802
-Jungu!
-What?

547
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,372
I'm leaving the country tomorrow
for a game.

548
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,408
Let me say good bye to
my friend before I leave.

549
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:37,909
Can't I?

550
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,684
Travel safely.

551
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,799
Jungu.

552
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,402
Where are we going?

553
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:08,807
We're almost there.

554
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,677
It's right here.

555
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,578
Here?

556
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:14,780
Here?

557
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:16,682
Yes, right here.

558
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:18,150
Then...

559
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,952
Jungi's in there?

560
00:30:27,732 --> 00:30:28,999
Jungi.

561
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:37,402
Jungi, I'm here.

562
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,405
Jungi!

563
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,709
Jungi!

564
00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:53,151
Jungi!

565
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:55,320
Jungi!

566
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:57,856
You brat.

567
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,525
Are you crying?

568
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:06,231
Actually, Jungi and I were very close.

569
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,834
We were like brothers.

570
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:13,905
When he stole my girlfriend,
I was mad at him first.

571
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:16,007
But I soon forgave him.

572
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:19,044
I can't believe he died like that.

573
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,450
If he were alive,
I'd hug him for a long time.

574
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:29,068
It pains me that I can't do that.

575
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,357
Jungi!

576
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:34,259
I'm sorry.

577
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,362
I'm sorry, Jungi!

578
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,866
Rest in peace!

579
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:47,172
When I go to heaven,
please be my friend again.

580
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:50,075
Jungi!

581
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:52,377
Jungi!

582
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:56,081
Subong!

583
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,594
Why did you call me?

584
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,396
It's me.

585
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,799
I'm your friend Lee Jungi.

586
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:15,700
What are you talking about?

587
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,302
You said you were his brother.

588
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,205
I don't have a twin brother.

589
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,873
I'm an only child.

590
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,009
The fourth generation of only sons.

591
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,313
I lied to you because I didn't want to get
beaten up to death.

592
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,714
It's me.

593
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,405
It's me, Jungi! Lee Jungi!

594
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,424
Come.

595
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:40,826
Get in here.

596
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,631
What are you waiting for?

597
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,101
You said you wanted give me a long hug.

598
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,415
I'm actually Jungu...

599
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:04,816
You brat!

600
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,724
-I'm Lee Jungu.
-Hey!

601
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:09,921
You brat!

602
00:33:12,434 --> 00:33:13,892
Subong!

603
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,500
I'm Lee Jungu.

604
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,064
It'll be hard to get your money back.

605
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,066
It's almost impossible.

606
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:27,939
Dusik.

607
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:29,941
What do I do?

608
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,310
What do I do now?

609
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,513
I got all of my money scammed.

610
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,715
Everyone in the model
world think I'm a has-been.

611
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:38,717
You can start again.

612
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:41,820
Start what again?

613
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,723
I'm not good at anything
and I don't even have a college degree.

614
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:47,826
Forget it. I can't talk to you.

615
00:33:48,334 --> 00:33:50,228
You write a weird novel.

616
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,431
-What's wrong with that?
-It's not a good life, is it?

617
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,100
Aren't you embarrassed?

618
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,602
Why should I worry about
what other people think of me?

619
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,772
It may not seem that great to you,

620
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,675
but I'm happy doing what I love.

621
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,377
Sua.

622
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:07,879
Standards for happiness
are different for everyone.

623
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:13,285
You need to find what makes you happy.

624
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,587
I'm too old to start something new.

625
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:18,156
I'm 29 years old.

626
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:20,559
That's not old at all.

627
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,661
Do you know
what the average life expectancy is?

628
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,162
It's 80.

629
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:28,148
In baseball terms, you're only
in the bottom of the third inning.

630
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:31,036
Are you going to give up
because you're losing in the third inning?

631
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:33,238
You might get a two base hit
or a third base hit.

632
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:36,641
You won't know if you can hit a home run
unless you play until the very end.

633
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,709
Right?

634
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:41,513
-But, Dusik.
-Yes?

635
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,316
How many innings are in a baseball game?

636
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:58,296
Why is it so quiet?

637
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,898
Where is everyone?

638
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,036
"Donggu"

639
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:09,307
-Hello?
-Yuna, where are you?

640
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:13,044
-I just got back from the class.
-Really?

641
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,815
I'm cleaning on the third floor.
Can you help me?

642
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:19,217
I'll be right there.

643
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:47,946
Donggu.

644
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:54,019
Yuna.

645
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:56,788
I made a mistake yesterday.

646
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,090
I'll do it officially this time.

647
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,494
I like you.

648
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:04,195
I like you a lot.

649
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:07,065
-Will you...
-Why are you doing this?

650
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,267
I already told you no.

651
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:10,168
What?

652
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:15,173
You don't like this?

653
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:18,376
I worked on it for hours.

654
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,278
I'll go back downstairs.

655
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,181
Yuna.

656
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:24,683
Yuna!

657
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:27,986
Yuna.

658
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,487
Yuna, wait.

659
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,555
Yuna!

660
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:33,658
What's wrong, Yuna?
Do you want something else?

661
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:35,994
Oh, a ring?

662
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:38,263
I'll buy you a beautiful ring
when I make money later.

663
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:40,832
My answer is the same
no matter what you do.

664
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:44,669
I'm not going to date you.

665
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:47,739
Why not?

666
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,809
Do you hate me so much?

667
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:55,534
We can date and if you still
don't like me, you can dump me.

668
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:57,849
I can't afford to date anyone.

669
00:36:57,934 --> 00:37:00,624
My life is already complicated enough.

670
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:03,235
So please don't do this.

671
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:04,622
Then I'll wait.

672
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:07,425
I'll wait until you feel
like you can date again.

673
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,927
Please don't wait for me.

674
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:13,033
I said I'll wait. I want to wait!

675
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:14,432
But you're saying I can't do that either?

676
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:15,900
Am I not...

677
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,803
...even worth considering?

678
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:20,004
Is that it?

679
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:29,013
Okay.

680
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:31,916
I understand what you're saying.

681
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,018
I'll stop.

682
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:41,526
I'll stop liking you.

683
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:43,128
What does that mean?

684
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:47,732
You like her?

685
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,635
Why do you like her?

686
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:53,850
Explain right now!

687
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,549
Subong, what are you doing?

688
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,943
-Let's go.
-Subong, stop!

689
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:13,024
I heard the whole story.

690
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,434
You got scammed?

691
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,427
That's why you're staying here, right?

692
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,600
-Subong, wait...
-Shut up.

693
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:21,299
Go to Mom and Dad's house.

694
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,301
Stay there quietly and get married.

695
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,502
-Come on.
-No.

696
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:25,503
I'm not going.

697
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:28,577
Then, you're going to live off Donggu?

698
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,376
Subong.

699
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,479
-I want to start again.
-Start what again?

700
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:37,248
You wanted to become a model
but you've done nothing with your life.

701
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:39,651
You can't start anything now.

702
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:42,268
Do you even know how old you are?

703
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,671
What about my age?

704
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,557
I'm only 29.

705
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,558
What?

706
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:49,264
Do you know
what the average life expectancy is?

707
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:50,962
It's 80.

708
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,598
In terms of baseball, no...

709
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:58,503
In terms of a UFC fight, I'm in the
second round out of five rounds.

710
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:01,773
Do you give up in the second round
because you're losing?

711
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:04,959
My Arm Bar or Rear Naked Choke
might work in the third round.

712
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:08,847
I won't know if I can do a High Kick
to win the game unless I keep playing.

713
00:39:08,968 --> 00:39:09,848
Don't you think so?

714
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:14,052
I still have three rounds to go.

715
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,789
I still have plenty of time.

716
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,959
I want to start again.

717
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:24,162
Can't you trust me just this once?

718
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,364
Are you serious?

719
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:31,300
If you throw in the towel,

720
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:35,173
I'm going to kick you with a High Kick.
Do you understand?

721
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:36,975
Yes, okay.

722
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,077
Thanks.

723
00:39:40,868 --> 00:39:41,746
Don't cry.

724
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,728
Yuna.

725
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,330
-You're still here?
-Yes.

726
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,965
I want to practice more.

727
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,168
Did something happen? Why the long face?

728
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:07,739
Is it because of that guy?

729
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,947
I know you don't want to talk about it,
but it's been on my mind.

730
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,283
He seemed like a nice guy.

731
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,151
Why did you turn him down?

732
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:23,991
I know that he's a good person.

733
00:40:25,682 --> 00:40:30,795
I know better than anyone
that he's a good person.

734
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:33,965
But, the thing is...

735
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:38,235
I don't want to trust anyone again.

736
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:44,776
I don't want to get hurt again.

737
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:02,175
My answer is the same
no matter what you do.

738
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:05,363
I'm not going to date you.

739
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,764
Please don't wait for me.

740
00:41:30,815 --> 00:41:34,092
-How are the bruises that Subong gave you?
-It's okay.

741
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,394
I didn't die, so that's good.

742
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:38,763
You and Subong are friends again?

743
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:40,365
Of course.

744
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,967
We're going to be friends
even after we die.

745
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,471
Here you go.

746
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:47,872
Wow, kimchi-jjigae!

747
00:41:47,968 --> 00:41:48,873
It looks delicious.

748
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:50,174
Thank you.

749
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:56,280
Donggu. Eat breakfast.

750
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,082
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

751
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:01,586
Dusik, can you watch Seol today?

752
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:04,001
I have to go to Hyeonjun's bakery
and practice.

753
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,290
Sure. I'll look after her.

754
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:07,800
See you later.

755
00:42:12,478 --> 00:42:16,901
She goes to that guy's bakery quite often.

756
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,504
Maybe she likes him.

757
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:20,988
No way.

758
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,707
Donggu, don't worry.

759
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,308
I'm not worried.

760
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:27,712
I decided to stop liking Yuna
just so you know.

761
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:29,614
-Good.
-See you later.

762
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:30,581
Where are you going?

763
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:34,185
I told you I start working
for Director Kim today.

764
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,983
-You did? When?
-I told you!

765
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:41,492
I told you so many times!
Listen to me when I talk to you! Listen!

766
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,597
He always yells at me.

767
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:50,101
There's no need to be sad, Dusik.

768
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,607
What the hell are you talking about?
Just eat. He's such a jerk!

769
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,608
Where have you been?

770
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,111
-I just got off work.
-What?

771
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,714
I had to go to a premier, do interviews,
write a preview, run errands...

772
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:06,818
I ran around all night. I'm exhausted.

773
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,826
Are you documenting your bruises or what?

774
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:19,831
A cup of coffee after practicing acting.

775
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:23,334
Caffeine keeps me awake.

776
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:25,236
-What are you doing?
-What?

777
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,038
I'm on social media now.

778
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:28,039
Want to see?

779
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:29,841
You get the honor.

780
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,846
That's so cheesy.

781
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,547
Why did you start using social media?

782
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:39,851
A celebrity needs to communicate
with his fans.

783
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,049
You're not a celebrity.

784
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:43,533
How can you communicate
when you don't have any followers?

785
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,422
You're talking to yourself then.

786
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:46,124
I just made the account.

787
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:48,726
My followers will
increase like crazy soon.

788
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:53,197
Chewbacca, pretend to be my fan.
Let's a photo.

789
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,786
No way.

790
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:57,101
Gosh, come here.

791
00:43:58,405 --> 00:43:59,303
Okay.

792
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:04,208
Smile. Come on.

793
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,210
One, two, three.

794
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,311
I said no.

795
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,113
-You're so annoying.
-Chewbacca!

796
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:10,214
Hey!

797
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:14,719
-Why is she so cold to me these days?
-She always hated you.

798
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,220
Oh, right.

799
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:18,923
I'm going to the shooting.

800
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:21,425
-That children's show?
-Yes.

801
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:24,028
I have a fight scene with the Aquaman.

802
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:28,232
How do I look cool shooting
the octopus ink gun?

803
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,435
-Goodness!
-What the hell?

804
00:44:34,033 --> 00:44:35,339
See you later.

805
00:44:35,734 --> 00:44:37,542
-That's disgusting.
-Are you crazy?

806
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,544
Go and shoot lots of ink.

807
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:46,017
Why was I blushing?

808
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:49,921
Gosh, you're crazy! You're totally crazy!

809
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,493
Heart, don't beat so fast.

810
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,701
Are you okay?

811
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,804
Aquaman was beating you up pretty hard.

812
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:08,105
I'm fine.

813
00:45:10,901 --> 00:45:13,911
I don't know how much longer
I have to do this.

814
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:18,316
Are you okay?

815
00:45:21,434 --> 00:45:24,322
But we're better off than him.

816
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,924
Thank goodness I didn't get
the Hairtail Man role.

817
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,125
Oh, right.

818
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:29,927
Did you do the audition?

819
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:30,928
What audition?

820
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:34,131
Director Kim Jinho is
starting a new TV drama.

821
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:37,134
Director Kim Jinho?

822
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:41,239
The director of "Revenge of the Son"
that hit 40% ratings?

823
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:43,140
The director that makes...

824
00:45:43,225 --> 00:45:45,026
-...mega hit TV dramas?
-Yes.

825
00:45:45,234 --> 00:45:47,350
I auditioned for a part yesterday.

826
00:45:47,434 --> 00:45:49,146
-Really?
-Yes.

827
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:52,049
Can't believe I missed that.

828
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,552
Isn't there a way to get an audition?

829
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:10,768
Jaewoo!

830
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:12,169
Jaewoo!

831
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,071
Jaewoo!

832
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:17,541
It's so loud.

833
00:46:18,334 --> 00:46:19,343
Jaewoo!

834
00:46:20,434 --> 00:46:21,712
Jaewoo!

835
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:23,347
Hey, Jungi!

836
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:24,915
Long time no see!

837
00:46:25,133 --> 00:46:26,350
What's up?

838
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:31,122
You're Director Kim Jinho's
production assistant, right?

839
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:32,567
Can you get me an audition?

840
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:33,958
What!

841
00:46:34,534 --> 00:46:36,961
-Why are you shouting?
-What!

842
00:46:37,234 --> 00:46:38,735
I can't hear you!

843
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:40,331
Speak louder!

844
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,967
Why are you shouting?

845
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,669
Sorry!

846
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:49,957
I hurt my ears when I was
shooting an explosion scene!

847
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,342
Really?

848
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:53,644
-Is it serious!
-No!

849
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,348
It will get better soon with treatment!

850
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:01,152
Oh, what were you saying?

851
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:06,524
Can you get me an audition
for Director Kim Jinho's new TV drama?

852
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,759
The auditions are over!

853
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,262
That's why I'm asking you!

854
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:16,049
Can you ask him to let
me audition for a part?

855
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,536
He's too busy!

856
00:47:18,634 --> 00:47:20,137
He's talking louder and louder.

857
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:22,540
Kang Seojin.

858
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:24,709
Jungi.

859
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,312
-Are you here to do a story?
-Yes.

860
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:32,316
You look like a real reporter now.

861
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,424
What the hell are you doing?

862
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,429
What was that?

863
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:48,432
Does she hate me that much?

864
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:54,538
Please get me an audition!

865
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:57,942
-Okay! I'll ask him!
-Really?

866
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:02,046
-But I have a favor to ask you.
-Tell me!

867
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:03,748
Anything!

868
00:48:07,033 --> 00:48:10,454
I haven't washed in four days.

869
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:12,156
Hyeonjun...

870
00:48:12,567 --> 00:48:14,759
"Hyeonjun. Jerk. I'll kill him."

871
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:19,663
It's hard to find an Arab actor
who can act well and speak Korean.

872
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:22,299
This is a problem. It's an important role.

873
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,068
What is he doing?

874
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,303
Kang Donggu, Any ideas?

875
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,872
Hyeonjun!

876
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,607
What the hell!

877
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:30,775
Hyeonjun?

878
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,810
-Who's Hyeonjun?
-What?

879
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,979
Ah, Sin Hyeonjun?

880
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,517
So, we could dress him up as a Saudi spy.

881
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,187
He doesn't really look like an Arab.

882
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,488
It's funny.

883
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,301
That's thinking outside of the box.

884
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,693
-Call Shin Hyeonjun.
-Yes.

885
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,101
Kang Donggu. That was a great idea.

886
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,333
You've got great ideas. Good job.

887
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,434
Thank you.

888
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:57,617
Good for you.

889
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,525
I was also thinking of suggesting
Shin Hyeonjun.

890
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,137
What?

891
00:49:00,234 --> 00:49:02,606
-But you said it first.
-Sorry.

892
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:15,152
I wanted to buy you something
better than tteokbokki.

893
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,954
This is delicious.

894
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:19,557
It's even more delicious
because you're buying.

895
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:27,031
I wanted to treat you for teaching
me and letting me use your workroom.

896
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,533
Tteokbokki is good enough.

897
00:49:32,827 --> 00:49:36,807
-Are you sure that's enough?
-It was delicious.

898
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,217
-My back!
-Oh no!

899
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,018
Are you okay?

900
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:50,254
I'm sorry.

901
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,156
Stop!

902
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:53,846
-Try to get up.
-Okay.

903
00:49:57,834 --> 00:49:59,063
I'm so tired.

904
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:02,433
So tired from running around all day.

905
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,171
I need to sleep.

906
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,074
I need to sleep.

907
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,214
"Jungi"

908
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:20,284
-What is it?
-Seojin.

909
00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:22,467
-Are you free right now?
-Why?

910
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:25,089
I want to buy you a delicious meal.

911
00:50:25,267 --> 00:50:26,790
Come out.

912
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:30,594
Where are you? Okay.

913
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:36,267
He's so annoying.

914
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:44,642
So annoying.

915
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,512
Fine, I'll go.

916
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,114
So annoying.

917
00:51:11,745 --> 00:51:14,038
-I'm here.
-Hey.

918
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:17,641
Why did you call me here?

919
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,410
I worked all night. I'm tired.

920
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:23,597
I have a favor to ask.

921
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:25,482
What favor?

922
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,017
Actually...

923
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:28,919
Jaewoo.

924
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,193
Who is he?

925
00:51:37,501 --> 00:51:39,396
He's a producer that I know.

926
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,199
Let me introduce you.

927
00:51:42,304 --> 00:51:45,302
This is Kang Seojin,
my friend's little sister.

928
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,607
This is Kim Jaewoo, a producer at JBC.

929
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,209
Hello.

930
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,711
Hello!

931
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:55,401
I'm Kim Jaewoo!

932
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:57,114
Nice to meet you!

933
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,016
That startled me.

934
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:01,417
Why is he yelling?

935
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:03,921
He hurt his ears while shooting a scene.

936
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:06,323
But he'll recover soon. Don't worry.

937
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:08,926
Jaewoo!

938
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:11,228
You're too loud!

939
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,031
Bring it down!

940
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:16,533
Sorry. I apologize.

941
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:21,739
But why is he here?

942
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:25,743
He saw you yesterday
and wanted to meet you.

943
00:52:25,868 --> 00:52:27,645
It's a blind date.

944
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:29,513
A blind date?

945
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,217
Jungi, we need to talk.

946
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:38,022
What are you doing?

947
00:52:38,234 --> 00:52:40,135
You can't do this without asking me.

948
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:41,725
-I'm leaving.
-Wait.

949
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,927
You can't just leave.

950
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,932
The truth is... there's a TV drama
that I really want to audition for.

951
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:51,435
He's the production assistant.

952
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:56,206
He said he'd get me an audition
if I set you guys up.

953
00:52:56,707 --> 00:53:01,211
Don't you feel sad for me who has
to wear a stupid octopus costume?

954
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:05,015
Seojin, please do this for me.

955
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:08,318
Please.

956
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:11,822
Okay.

957
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,758
But I'm leaving after the meal.

958
00:53:14,933 --> 00:53:17,428
Thank you so much.

959
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,930
I'll go now. I'll leave it up to you.

960
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:21,131
Go, Seojin!

961
00:53:30,334 --> 00:53:33,444
Seojin! What would you like?!

962
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:39,450
Let's have a Gorgonzola pizza
and a carbonara.

963
00:53:39,534 --> 00:53:40,551
What?

964
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:45,656
I can't hear you!
Can you speak a bit louder?

965
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,859
A Gorgonzola pizza!

966
00:53:48,968 --> 00:53:51,028
And a carbonara!

967
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:55,132
Oh, a Gorgonzola pizza and a carbonara!

968
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:56,934
What about drinks?

969
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,836
Grapefruit Ade!

970
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,337
Grapefruit Ade!

971
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,239
Excuse me! We're ready to order!

972
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:06,844
I heard you already!
The chef is already making your order!

973
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:08,045
Okay!

974
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:09,947
This is so embarrassing.

975
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:12,549
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-What?

976
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,852
I'm going to the bathroom!

977
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:16,634
Oh, okay!

978
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,222
Go and relieve yourself!

979
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:22,626
I'm home.

980
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,829
Hey. How was it?

981
00:54:25,968 --> 00:54:27,731
Was it exciting working on a film again?

982
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:30,734
It was hectic.

983
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:31,969
What's that?

984
00:54:32,868 --> 00:54:34,238
What's that smell?

985
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:39,843
Socks.

986
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:43,547
I need to wash the director's socks
because he doesn't have time.

987
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:48,452
Where's Yuna?
Why are you taking care of Seol?

988
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:50,767
She went out this morning.

989
00:54:50,868 --> 00:54:52,456
What? She's still outside?

990
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:54,958
-It's so late.
-Why?

991
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:56,567
Is it bothering you?

992
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,562
You said you'll stop liking her.

993
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:00,831
I'm not worried about her.

994
00:55:01,734 --> 00:55:04,234
I was asking because I'm hungry.

995
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:06,036
It's Yuna.

996
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:08,238
Hi, Yuna.

997
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:10,240
I see.

998
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,542
Okay.

999
00:55:11,868 --> 00:55:13,944
Sure. Bye.

1000
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:16,547
Was that Yuna?

1001
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:19,016
-What did she say?
-That she'll be late.

1002
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:21,417
She's at that guy Son Hyeonjun's house.

1003
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:24,922
He got hurt and his kid is sick,
so she's looking after them.

1004
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:28,992
Then, they're alone in the same house?

1005
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,694
At this late hour?

1006
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:33,497
They might fall in love.

1007
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:36,400
-Is it bothering you, Donggu?
-Stop it.

1008
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,002
Are you kidding me?

1009
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,804
No, I'm not bothered.

1010
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:43,907
I'm going to bed.

1011
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:50,514
Hello, Director?

1012
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:52,115
Your socks?

1013
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,919
Okay, I'll be right there.

1014
00:55:56,701 --> 00:55:58,322
He's unbelievable.

1015
00:55:58,422 --> 00:55:59,923
What is it?

1016
00:56:00,701 --> 00:56:04,027
He has a pair of socks he wears
when he goes location hunting.

1017
00:56:04,133 --> 00:56:05,629
They're called 'Location hunting socks.'

1018
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:07,431
He wants me to bring them.

1019
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,733
At such a late hour...

1020
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,435
I'll be back.

1021
00:56:13,634 --> 00:56:15,539
Location hunting socks?

1022
00:56:15,868 --> 00:56:17,641
-Is there such a thing?
-Don't know.

1023
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,810
Do they help him find
good locations faster?

1024
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,112
Why aren't they answering the phone?

1025
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,915
Baking school, answer the phone!

1026
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:29,887
What's going on? Why are the lights off?

1027
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:31,588
Why is there no one here?

1028
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,190
What is going on?

1029
00:56:33,568 --> 00:56:35,792
Song Hyeonjun!

1030
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,662
-Yuna!
-Excuse me.

1031
00:56:40,267 --> 00:56:42,666
The classes are over. May I help you?

1032
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:46,670
Can I have Song Hyeonjun's home address?

1033
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,438
-Why do you want to know?
-What?

1034
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:51,341
The thing is...

1035
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,844
I'm delivering his parcel.

1036
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:56,079
This is for Mr. Song Hyeonjun.

1037
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,080
Let me see.

1038
00:56:57,269 --> 00:57:01,183
Sure. His name was here somewhere.

1039
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:03,453
One moment. His name was written
right here.

1040
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,857
The recipient's name
is written right here.

1041
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,427
Oh, it was on this side. Look. The name.

1042
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:12,229
Song Hyeonjun.

1043
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:16,366
His address is not written on the box?

1044
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:19,870
A lot of people don't write down
the address these days.

1045
00:57:19,968 --> 00:57:22,072
So, tell me his address.

1046
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,675
I can't tell you that
because it's private information.

1047
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,476
I'll take the box.

1048
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:29,146
-I'll give it to him tomorrow.
-No...

1049
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:31,068
This is a fast delivery.

1050
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:33,283
I have to deliver it to him now.

1051
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:36,086
I think this is food.

1052
00:57:36,367 --> 00:57:38,271
I think it's rotting.

1053
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:41,692
Look. It's starting to smell.

1054
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:43,794
I think this is really expensive.

1055
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,596
Whatever. You can take this.

1056
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:51,068
You can take responsibility
if it rots and becomes useless.

1057
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,871
Wait.

1058
00:57:58,167 --> 00:57:59,176
Yes? What is it?

1059
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,144
Who is it?

1060
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,584
Yuna!

1061
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:08,885
Donggu?

1062
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:11,388
What are you doing
at the director's house?

1063
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,689
The director's house?

1064
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,358
This is Hyeonjun's place.

1065
00:58:14,467 --> 00:58:16,560
That can't be.

1066
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:21,465
He asked me to bring something.

1067
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,700
Maybe he told me the wrong address.

1068
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:25,168
How did this happen?

1069
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:26,970
Who is it?

1070
00:58:27,367 --> 00:58:30,857
-Actually...
-Oh, hello!

1071
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:33,967
We saw each other for
a moment the other day.

1072
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,979
Oh, hello.

1073
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,481
So this is your place?

1074
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:41,151
It's not polite of me to just leave.

1075
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,554
You'd feel better
if I stayed for a cup of coffee, right?

1076
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,791
Donggu, don't you have
to deliver this box?

1077
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:50,660
Yes.

1078
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,398
Hello, Director.

1079
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,400
What?

1080
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:59,269
You don't need
these location hunting socks anymore?

1081
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,570
I see.

1082
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:02,072
Okay.

1083
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:05,175
He changes his minds all the time.

1084
00:59:05,267 --> 00:59:07,978
I came all this way,
but he doesn't need this anymore.

1085
00:59:08,167 --> 00:59:11,748
I'll take that coffee now.

1086
00:59:12,033 --> 00:59:14,251
Oh, sure.

1087
00:59:15,234 --> 00:59:16,420
Hello, Dusik.

1088
00:59:16,534 --> 00:59:17,354
What?

1089
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:20,457
Okay, I'll be right there.

1090
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:21,458
Bye.

1091
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:24,761
Donggu, Seol wouldn't stop crying.

1092
00:59:24,868 --> 00:59:26,563
I need to go.

1093
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:29,466
Can you stay here for a while?

1094
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:30,267
What?

1095
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:31,635
Me?

1096
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,938
Hoon is sick and Hyeonjun hurt his back.

1097
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,373
Do it for me, please.

1098
00:59:36,467 --> 00:59:40,177
Yuna. Yuna...

1099
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,076
What do you mean?

1100
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,001
Why is Donggu at his house?

1101
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,881
I guess the director and Hyeonjun live
in the same building.

1102
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:22,385
Donggu thought
it was the director's house.

1103
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:23,286
Really?

1104
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:27,390
That is an amazing coincidence.

1105
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:31,194
It must be super awkward
to be alone with a stranger.

1106
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,396
Stop worrying. Stop!

1107
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:34,798
He'll be fine.

1108
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,402
Why are you looking at your posts?
You're not even getting any comments.

1109
01:00:39,534 --> 01:00:41,805
What? I'm getting comments.

1110
01:00:41,901 --> 01:00:43,807
My super fan is writing comments for me.

1111
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,410
Okay. You can read it.

1112
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:54,918
"Jungi, you can do this."
"Jungi, you're a great actor."

1113
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,987
It's for real?

1114
01:00:57,287 --> 01:01:00,190
Her ID is 'Jungi Love'?

1115
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:04,261
The world is big and...

1116
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,963
-...there are plenty of crazy people.
-What?

1117
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:08,765
You're just jealous. Give it back.

1118
01:01:08,868 --> 01:01:11,268
I don't want to talk to someone
who doesn't have a fan.

1119
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,771
You've reached your destination.

1120
01:01:14,868 --> 01:01:16,473
-What the hell?
-What was that?

1121
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:18,775
Who listens to the navigation system
at maximum volume?

1122
01:01:18,868 --> 01:01:21,578
Seojin! I had fun today!

1123
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:22,662
Go in!

1124
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:25,048
-Thanks for the ride!
-What's that?

1125
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:28,051
-Get home safely!
-Isn't that Seojin?

1126
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:29,853
Why is she shouting?

1127
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,221
The thing is...

1128
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:32,722
It's a long story.

1129
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:35,625
Welcome home, Seojin.

1130
01:01:39,567 --> 01:01:42,032
Seojin. Hey.

1131
01:01:46,968 --> 01:01:49,072
Seojin. What's wrong?

1132
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,474
Did something happen?

1133
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:53,562
My eardrums almost split because of him.

1134
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:55,045
Just bear with him.

1135
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:56,546
He's getting treatment.

1136
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,549
-He'll get better soon.
-Whatever.

1137
01:01:59,868 --> 01:02:01,551
I did the blind date. That's it, right?

1138
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:03,353
Seojin.

1139
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:05,755
The audition is in a few days.

1140
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:07,591
Can't you see him for a few more days?

1141
01:02:07,676 --> 01:02:08,792
No way.

1142
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:10,860
Really?

1143
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:13,563
Okay then.

1144
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:16,700
I won't get to do the audition.

1145
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,268
If that TV drama becomes a hit,

1146
01:02:18,378 --> 01:02:20,770
I'll just cry blood in regret
for the rest of my life.

1147
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:28,478
I guess I'll have to wear the octopus
costume for the rest of my career.

1148
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,580
Fine!

1149
01:02:31,244 --> 01:02:34,851
But just until you do the audition.

1150
01:02:36,963 --> 01:02:39,756
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1151
01:02:40,567 --> 01:02:41,558
Let go of my hand.

1152
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:44,060
Get some rest. Good night.

1153
01:02:51,586 --> 01:02:53,003
That mean jerk.

1154
01:03:04,306 --> 01:03:05,915
It's so awkward.

1155
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:09,719
I have to stay here all night?

1156
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:16,493
I'm fine because I have you guys.

1157
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,702
Excuse me.

1158
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,129
Donggu.

1159
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:20,196
Donggu.

1160
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,199
What? Why is he calling me?

1161
01:03:32,394 --> 01:03:34,878
-What is it?
-I'm sorry, but...

1162
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:38,114
Can you come in and help me?

1163
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:43,620
What's the matter?

1164
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,890
What are you doing?!

1165
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,667
Why do you have your pants down?

1166
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:54,564
I somehow managed to sit
down and relieve myself.

1167
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,167
But I can't get up by myself.

1168
01:03:58,834 --> 01:04:01,638
And? Why did you call me?

1169
01:04:03,234 --> 01:04:07,177
Can you help me up?

1170
01:04:08,252 --> 01:04:10,447
What? Help you up?

1171
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:12,782
When you have your pants down?

1172
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:15,752
I can't get up by myself.

1173
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:19,055
Fine.

1174
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,926
Stretch out your hand. Just your hand.

1175
01:04:23,634 --> 01:04:26,129
-I'm stretching out my hand.
-Slowly.

1176
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,131
This hand too.

1177
01:04:28,734 --> 01:04:30,300
Don't let it touch me.

1178
01:04:34,214 --> 01:04:35,405
-Let go of my hands!
-Yes.

1179
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:36,706
God darn it.

1180
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:37,967
Thank you.

1181
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,175
Don't mention it.

1182
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,378
Wait, Donggu.

1183
01:04:41,501 --> 01:04:43,279
What is it this time?

1184
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,281
I'm so sorry, but...

1185
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:50,987
Can you pull up my underwear and my pants?

1186
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,757
I can't bend down.

1187
01:04:55,734 --> 01:04:57,127
Fine.

1188
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,331
This is unbelievable.

1189
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:03,433
-Goodness.
-I'm sorry.

1190
01:05:03,534 --> 01:05:05,435
-Hold still.
-I'm sorry.

1191
01:05:06,143 --> 01:05:07,537
I'm really sorry.

1192
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:12,342
Oh my god! I saw it...

1193
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,278
Cover yourself up with a towel!

1194
01:05:18,868 --> 01:05:19,649
What happened?

1195
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,050
I saw it again!

1196
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:23,968
Why did you fall down? I just got you up!

1197
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:25,889
Why are you doing this to me?

1198
01:05:32,868 --> 01:05:34,764
I wonder if Donggu is doing okay.

1199
01:05:34,968 --> 01:05:36,366
Maybe I should call him.

1200
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,370
I'm home.

1201
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:45,175
Donggu, you're home?

1202
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,277
Is Hoon all right?

1203
01:05:47,367 --> 01:05:49,612
-Yes.
-What a relief.

1204
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,482
It was awkward staying with Hyeonjun,
wasn't it?

1205
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:56,085
Did something happen?

1206
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,188
What?

1207
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:02,192
No, nothing happened.

1208
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:03,493
Yuna.

1209
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:06,496
I'm mentally exhausted.

1210
01:06:06,934 --> 01:06:08,097
I'm going to bed.

1211
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:16,606
What's up with him?

1212
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:18,908
Did they fight?

1213
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:22,428
No! This is not right!

1214
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:24,814
This is not right!

1215
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,094
It's so salty!

1216
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:41,598
-You still can't make ramyeon properly?
-Then don't eat it!

1217
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:44,116
It's delicious. Thank you.

1218
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,001
Shut up and just eat.

1219
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:48,104
-You've reached your destination.
-What the hell?

1220
01:06:48,801 --> 01:06:49,906
Seojin is here.

1221
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:53,443
We're going to lose our hearing
because of him.

1222
01:06:55,934 --> 01:06:57,013
Chewbacca.

1223
01:06:57,634 --> 01:06:59,315
What are those flowers?

1224
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:03,453
Seojin! Hey!

1225
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:05,855
Ask her.

1226
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:07,657
Chewbacca!

1227
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,462
What are those?

1228
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,030
Are they from Jaewoo?

1229
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:16,232
I guess things are going well for you two?

1230
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:18,968
-He asked me to be his girlfriend.
-He did?

1231
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,370
What should I do?

1232
01:07:21,467 --> 01:07:23,339
Should I be his girlfriend?

1233
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:26,442
-You can if you want to, if you don't...
-Jungi.

1234
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:29,479
-Can I ask you something?
-What?

1235
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:31,948
Do you...

1236
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:34,651
...see me as a woman?

1237
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:37,687
What are you talking about?

1238
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,268
I see you as a man.

1239
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,258
What should I do?

1240
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:45,828
Of course I'm a man, not a woman.

1241
01:07:45,934 --> 01:07:47,363
That's not what I meant.

1242
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:49,032
I think...

1243
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:52,936
...I like you.

1244
01:07:56,534 --> 01:07:57,307
What?

1245
01:07:57,934 --> 01:07:59,309
I like you.

1246
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:25,702
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1247
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:27,650
I don't need him.

1248
01:08:27,734 --> 01:08:29,154
Is everything okay with Seojin?

1249
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:30,956
She's been feeling down these days.

1250
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,842
Let's send a message. What's this?

1251
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,444
Kang Seojin. What is this?

1252
01:08:34,534 --> 01:08:36,362
-Why did you do this?
-What do you think?

1253
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,147
I'm going out on a date with Seojin!

1254
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:40,468
You can't meet Seojin today.

1255
01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:42,452
Seojin, we need to talk.

1256
01:08:42,567 --> 01:08:44,854
-I wanted to study fashion design.
-I'll help you.

1257
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,056
Which crown prince died a tragic death
ordered by Yeongjo?

1258
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:48,057
Yu Ain.

1259
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,360
Let's start studying English first.

1260
01:08:50,467 --> 01:08:52,261
-Hi, 'Ja-neh.'
-'Jane.'

1261
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:54,167
-My 'misty.'
-'Mistake.'

1262
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,366
Don't worry. It's been a while
since you studied English.

1263
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,368
Why did you try so hard to beat Hyeonjun?

1264
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:01,304
He keeps hanging around Yuna.

1265
01:09:02,667 --> 01:09:04,667
Hyeonjun, you're really good at gongi.

1266
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:07,259
Hello. Teach me how to be good at gongi.

1267
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:09,445
I want to be really good at it.

1268
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:10,446
Please.

1269
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:12,148
Song Hyeonjun.

1270
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:14,652
Would you like to play a game of gongi?
