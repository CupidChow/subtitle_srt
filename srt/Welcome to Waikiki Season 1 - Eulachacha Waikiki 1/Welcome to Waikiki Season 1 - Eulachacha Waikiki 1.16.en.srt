1
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:23,957
When did it start?

2
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:27,516
So you two have been
deceiving me all this time?

3
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,393
We didn't intend to.

4
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:31,976
We couldn't tell you because
we knew you'd react like this.

5
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:34,610
Then you shouldn't have started
in the first place.

6
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:35,528
Donggu.

7
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,138
We really like each other.

8
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,188
Really.

9
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,825
-So...
-Quiet!

10
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:45,526
I will never approve.

11
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:46,775
I made myself clear.

12
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:48,355
Why not?

13
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,230
What's the reason?

14
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:53,673
I just can't allow it,
so end it right here.

15
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:54,590
No.

16
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:57,166
Who are you to disapprove?

17
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:58,964
I'm an adult now.

18
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:01,348
I don't need your permission
to date a guy.

19
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:02,353
Yes, Donggu.

20
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,575
I can't give up on Seojin.

21
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,300
So you guys will continue dating?

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,053
Fine.

23
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:10,760
Seojin.

24
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:12,639
You're not my sister anymore.

25
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:14,448
And you too, Junggi.

26
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,536
You don't exist to me anymore.

27
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:17,454
Understand?

28
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:20,202
Hey, stop it. They like each other.

29
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:21,450
Are you taking their side?

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,230
Then you're out too.

31
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:24,979
What is wrong with you?
You're being childish.

32
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:26,679
Yes, I'm childish. So what?

33
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:28,882
So whose side are you on? Theirs?

34
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:31,003
Yuna, are you on their side too?

35
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:33,262
What? Well, I'm...

36
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:35,308
I'll take that as a yes.

37
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:36,722
Fine.

38
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:41,894
None of you exist to me.
So don't ever talk to me again, alright?

39
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,299
It's been a long time
since I've seen this movie.

40
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:15,372
That scene is so romantic
no matter how many times I watch.

41
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:16,407
You're right.

42
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,199
When will I get to be
in a relationship like that?

43
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:23,747
What are you cleaning?

44
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,661
It's the shoes sent by Malgeum.

45
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:29,358
Aren't you so romantic.

46
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,797
You like it that much?

47
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:31,715
Yeah.

48
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:34,291
I like it so much
that I can't even wear it.

49
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:35,639
Goodness.

50
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:41,013
You're going to cough up
moths from your mouths.

51
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:43,920
Since when did you two start dating?

52
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:46,933
It's been a while.

53
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:49,033
Sorry for not telling you guys.

54
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:50,024
It's fine.

55
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:51,791
We know how Donggu is like.

56
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:53,373
I would have done the same.

57
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:54,807
I understand, Junggi.

58
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:56,076
Thank you, Dusik.

59
00:02:56,537 --> 00:02:57,632
You're the best.

60
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:05,352
Yes, Mullae-dong Scoundrel.

61
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,895
I can't play today.

62
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,407
Just for today.

63
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:13,286
Yes. I'm sorry.

64
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,169
Who's Mullae-dong Scoundrel?

65
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:18,399
Oh, he's a member of my gaming guild.

66
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:21,947
Today is game day and they need me.

67
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,407
He's making a fuss.

68
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:25,948
What? They can't play without you?

69
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:27,618
You're that important?

70
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,967
Obviously, you have no idea.

71
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:33,311
Junggi may be useless in the real world...

72
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:35,354
...but he's a god in the gaming world.

73
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,850
Some people offered to pay
a fortune for his character.

74
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,179
Really? Then why don't you sell it?

75
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,791
Don't be ridiculous.

76
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:43,698
I'll never sell my character
even if they pay billions.

77
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:45,344
-What?
-When I die...

78
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:48,398
...I'll save my character
in a USB to be buried with me.

79
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:52,436
-Of course.
-Really, I can't understand you.

80
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,005
Yuna, how's Donggu?

81
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,568
He doesn't want to eat.

82
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,662
He's curled up in his blanket
and refuses to come out.

83
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:02,726
Kang Donggu, he is so stubborn.

84
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:04,385
That does it.

85
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:06,449
Where are you going, Seojin?

86
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:08,141
What are you going to do? Hey!

87
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:13,482
Donggu, we need to talk.

88
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:15,558
Huh? The blanket just moved by itself.

89
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:16,588
Is it ghost?

90
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:22,533
Really, Donggu?

91
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,195
Huh? The blanket moved by itself again.

92
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,800
What in the world.

93
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:32,315
Oh, is that how you want to play it?

94
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,866
I have a plan too.

95
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:36,473
What? What are you going to do?

96
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:38,456
Listen to me.

97
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,956
Until you approve
my relationship with Junggi...

98
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,628
...I will not shave
my beard, understand?

99
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:46,807
What?

100
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:54,995
You don't like it?
It drives you crazy, right?

101
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,916
Fine. Let's see who wins in the end.

102
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:02,135
Hey, Seojin. Kang Seojin!

103
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:03,559
Hey, hey!

104
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:09,204
How dare she use shaving to threaten me?

105
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,411
Hey, Seojin.

106
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:14,775
What is this about?
Why would you stop shaving?

107
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:17,484
An eye for an eye!
A tooth for a tooth!

108
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:19,871
I have to stand up against him and fight.

109
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:23,478
Okay, fight all you want.
But why would you stop shaving?

110
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:27,390
He hates it when I don't shave.

111
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:30,543
It's the most visually
striking way to protest.

112
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,676
How will you go to work?

113
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:34,853
I can take some time off.

114
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,414
I will make him surrender.

115
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:40,740
You just need to trust me.

116
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:43,089
Seojin, Seojin!

117
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:46,540
Taking a leave from work to grow a beard?

118
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,702
Why?

119
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,861
Hey, don't you think that's too much?

120
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:54,732
Hey, she is Kang Seojin.
Kang Donggu's sister!

121
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:57,060
They're related by blood.

122
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:58,857
Why don't you just break up with her?

123
00:05:58,942 --> 00:05:59,775
Shut up!

124
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:03,037
Really, why?

125
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:05,832
Both of them are messed up.

126
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:09,574
This is making me crazy.

127
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:13,705
Philip? His name is Philip?

128
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:17,340
But his model fee is really expensive.

129
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,250
We don't even have the money.
Do we really need him?

130
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:25,006
He's known as Park Bogum
of the modeling world.

131
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:27,990
Whatever he wears gets sold out.
You get it?

132
00:06:28,074 --> 00:06:29,289
Park Bogum?

133
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:31,836
He can't be that handsome.

134
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:36,565
Oh! Mr. Philip! Here!

135
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:42,705
Sorry I'm late.

136
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:44,794
I was in a photo shoot since morning.

137
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:45,939
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:49,751
No, it's fine. We came too early.

139
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:55,415
Hello, I'm Min Sua,
CEO of Soorgio Armani.

140
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:00,053
Here, have some coffee.
It smells wonderful.

141
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:06,593
I'm sorry, I have rhinitis
so I can't smell very well.

142
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:09,395
Oh, you do?

143
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,907
Bad rhinitis!

144
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:15,173
You are very funny.

145
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:18,272
Oh, excuse me.

146
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:21,712
There's chili powder
stuck between your teeth.

147
00:07:24,174 --> 00:07:25,007
Pardon?

148
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:34,588
Miss.

149
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:38,224
Did you have to be so blunt?

150
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:42,450
Do you get a kick out
of embarrassing people?

151
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:44,006
-Well, um…
-Pardon?

152
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,559
I was just...

153
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:46,699
Forget it.

154
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:50,451
I don't feel like shooting today.

155
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:54,086
Wait! I'm sorry she offended you.

156
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:56,427
Our CEO is a bit insensitive.

157
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,578
What are you doing? Apologize!

158
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,399
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:06,929
Please forgive us. I will make sure
she never does that again.

160
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:07,846
Okay.

161
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,721
I will let this one slide...

162
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:12,996
...for the sake of Mr. Bong.

163
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:15,559
Thank you.

164
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:27,107
Come in. This is our guesthouse.
We will shoot here.

165
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,641
Oh, I see.

166
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:31,872
It's so pretty here.
The interior is nice too.

167
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:32,895
Glad you like it.

168
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:34,867
You can wait upstairs.

169
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:35,784
Sure.

170
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,715
Hey, what is this smell?

171
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,430
Did you fart?
Or is something rotting in here?

172
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,979
That's what I want to know.
Where is this smell coming from?

173
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:02,559
Why? Why?

174
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,511
-I think it's coming from there.
-What?

175
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:10,653
Wait. Aren't those Philip's shoes?

176
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,136
Is this rotting smell coming
from Philip's feet?

177
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,265
I think so.

178
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,136
How could he have such bad foot odor
when he looks totally fine?

179
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,337
Doesn't he know?

180
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:24,241
He said he has rhinitis
so he can't smell well.

181
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:25,353
I know that.

182
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:28,168
But this is as if he doesn't have
a nose or something.

183
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,258
Dusik, do I have to shoot with him?

184
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:33,441
Of course.

185
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,721
You know that we need to upload
new product photos by today.

186
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:39,838
Anyway, you need to bear the smell
in front of Mr. Philip. Alright?

187
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:43,072
Hey, it's too much.
I can't stand the smell.

188
00:09:43,156 --> 00:09:46,226
Didn't you see? He was furious
when you told him about the chili.

189
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:48,264
The shooting will be over
if you tell him about the smell.

190
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:50,513
You need to bear it. Okay?

191
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:51,914
Fine.

192
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:53,352
Two, three.

193
00:10:02,188 --> 00:10:04,872
Why is she growing her beard?

194
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:07,307
She is so stubborn.

195
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:10,694
Wow.

196
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:12,701
Are we having cheonggukjang for lunch?

197
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:14,519
Yummy!

198
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:18,734
Donggu, are we having
cheonggukjang for lunch?

199
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:19,654
I don't know...

200
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,091
Donggu, we should talk.

201
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:29,229
Donggu! That jerk.

202
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:32,581
What the heck? This is not
the smell of cheonggukjang.

203
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:34,836
It smells like shit.

204
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:43,811
How dare he talk to me like that.

205
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:49,669
I will never ever talk to him
until they break up.

206
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:55,181
Real man's will!

207
00:10:57,749 --> 00:10:59,292
I will show him.

208
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:05,371
No toilet paper?

209
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,405
Hey, Junggi...

210
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,373
Oh, right.

211
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,140
I shouldn't talk to him.

212
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,949
My mistake.

213
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:19,040
I almost called for him.

214
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,549
What should I do?

215
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,252
I don't have any socks or towels.

216
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:30,857
Donggu, I want to have a word.

217
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:33,045
Where is your T-shirt?

218
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:34,459
You were wearing one just now.

219
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:36,930
What? What is this?

220
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:39,132
Hey, hey! Donggu!

221
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:43,277
That's strange.

222
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:45,972
He was wearing a T-shirt when he went in.

223
00:11:49,254 --> 00:11:52,673
Oh my, the smell. It's all over the house.

224
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:56,452
Stop it. What if he finds out?

225
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,152
He's coming. Just smile.

226
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:04,123
Sorry. Did you wait long?

227
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,986
Shall we start shooting?

228
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:08,598
Where should we do it?

229
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:10,865
Hm... where?

230
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,834
Oh, right. There.

231
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:15,052
Over there? Okay.

232
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:19,318
How should I pose...?

233
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:22,096
Is this good?

234
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,453
Yes, that's good.

235
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:28,995
Oh, you didn't roll up the legs.

236
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,245
Oh, should I? How high?

237
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:32,812
We will do it for you.

238
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:35,098
What are you doing?
Go cuff his pants.

239
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,517
-What? Me?
-Of course. You are the stylist.

240
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,927
Is that really necessary?
Can't you just take the picture?

241
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,682
Those pants need to be rolled up.

242
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,566
Go cuff his pants. There is no time.

243
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:46,985
Fine.

244
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,202
She will do it.

245
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:56,059
A little higher. A little more.

246
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:57,877
The other side too. Yes.

247
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:07,123
Thank you.

248
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,156
Okay. Good.

249
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:14,199
Great pose. Yes, good.

250
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:15,843
Don't move your feet. Leave it.

251
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,478
Moving them will make it look active.

252
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:19,085
No, no. It's perfect now.

253
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:20,355
The rolled up leg is the point, right?

254
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:21,571
Please don't move.

255
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:23,239
Stay like that. Good.

256
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:25,665
Your feet will be cut from the photo.
Don't move.

257
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:35,786
Gosh, what on earth is
going on upstairs? It stinks.

258
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,463
Tissues are not helping here.

259
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:41,301
Hey, Seol.

260
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:44,837
Can you believe Junggi
and Seojin are dating?

261
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:45,681
Huh?

262
00:13:45,986 --> 00:13:48,049
Don't you think that's wrong?

263
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:50,196
What do you think? Huh?

264
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:52,432
It is wrong, isn't it?

265
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:55,892
That's why I'm so angry.

266
00:13:55,976 --> 00:13:59,557
It makes me so angry.
I should crush those jerks!

267
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:01,808
Huh, what?

268
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,805
My goodness.

269
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:06,901
Hold on.

270
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:12,677
That ball!

271
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:13,729
I need to get out...

272
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:16,779
What? What's wrong with this thing?

273
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:18,998
Oh, man.

274
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:20,693
Gosh.

275
00:14:21,537 --> 00:14:24,330
What in the world is this smell?

276
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,447
What?

277
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:27,910
What are you doing there?

278
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,002
Are you stuck?

279
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,493
Do you need help?

280
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:38,416
God, you're so stubborn.

281
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:41,300
Then just stay like this.

282
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:42,315
Oh my gosh!

283
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,302
Seo... Seojin.

284
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:47,987
Donggu.

285
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:50,489
Are you still not going to approve?

286
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:51,515
Are you sure?

287
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:54,861
Oh, okay.

288
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,199
You sure you can't
accept our relationship?

289
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:58,537
Alright, fine.

290
00:14:58,622 --> 00:15:02,402
Let's play this game
until we have the winner.

291
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,876
Seojin, Seojin!

292
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,718
What's her problem?

293
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,571
Donggu, how long are you
going to keep this up?

294
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,047
Do you really hate the idea
of me dating her?

295
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:18,217
Fine. So be it!

296
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:21,395
I'll pretend that you don't exist.

297
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:25,880
Whatever!

298
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:28,060
Do you think that will change my mind?

299
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:31,523
Why won't this budge?

300
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:35,368
I need to go to work. This sucks.

301
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,438
This is embarrassing.

302
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:49,644
Yes, director.

303
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:53,727
Yes, I'm going to the agency
to meet the actors.

304
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:54,704
Yes.

305
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:58,612
How can I meet with the actors
with this around my neck?

306
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,683
What should I do?

307
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:05,634
Oh!

308
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:09,302
Excuse me.

309
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:10,982
Yes? Darn it!

310
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:13,896
What the... Who are you?

311
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:16,242
I'm sorry to ask this but...

312
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:19,612
...can you cut this for me?

313
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:24,037
This scenario was written
for you, Mr. Jinwoo.

314
00:16:24,122 --> 00:16:26,205
Wow, really?

315
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:31,166
Then I can't say no to your offer.

316
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:36,118
-Oh.
-No, it's fine.

317
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:40,264
Sir! We'll just have to cast Seo Jinwoo.

318
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,643
All the other actors including Gong Yoo,
Hyun Bin and Won Bin refused to do it.

319
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:46,020
Hey, what are you talking about?

320
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,550
But Jinwoo's not much of an actor
and he's not good looking either.

321
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:51,318
I even heard he has temper.

322
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:54,191
What do you mean he's not like that?

323
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:57,016
I heard he's a total diva.

324
00:17:00,482 --> 00:17:02,009
Oh, Mr. Seo Jinwoo!

325
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:04,763
Mr. Jinwoo, let me explain...

326
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:07,222
No, no. It's fine.

327
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:11,163
This diva will see himself out.

328
00:17:11,913 --> 00:17:12,799
Take care.

329
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:14,089
-Jinwoo?
-I didn't mean...

330
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:15,856
-I heard a rumor.
-Jinwoo, wait...

331
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:17,737
-There was a rumor.
-Jinwoo, I...

332
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,101
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

333
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:23,798
-I'm sorry, I didn't know he was here.
-Quiet!

334
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:25,806
-Get Seo Jinwoo right now!
-What?

335
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:27,414
Don't think about coming back without him.

336
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,992
No, no, no. Just quit.

337
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:30,682
Hey, just quit!

338
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,446
Okay, looking good.

339
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:35,677
Good. Very good. One more.

340
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:37,162
That was great, Philip!

341
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:38,259
Shall we take a break?

342
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:40,660
Already? Sure.

343
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,309
-I'll take a break.
-Sure.

344
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:43,881
Yes. go ahead.

345
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:45,818
You can take a break downstairs.

346
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:51,862
Dusik, I can't hold it anymore.
I'm dying here.

347
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,520
You're not the only one suffering.
My nose is being tortured too.

348
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:55,622
Just hold on a bit.

349
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:57,650
I can't stand the smell anymore.

350
00:17:58,153 --> 00:17:59,399
Shall we open the window?

351
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:02,100
He might realize what's going on
if we suddenly open the window.

352
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:04,753
Please just stay still.

353
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:08,386
Then what if we make him wash his feet?

354
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:09,755
Make him wash his feet?

355
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,374
How?

356
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:18,304
Here you go. Have some.

357
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,032
-Oh, thank you.
-Sure.

358
00:18:21,224 --> 00:18:22,356
What the!

359
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,403
My, gosh! I'm so sorry.

360
00:18:25,907 --> 00:18:28,908
Oh, my. You're all wet.

361
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:32,502
It must be sticky.
You should wash your feet.

362
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:35,748
No, it's fine. I'm running tight
on my schedule.

363
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,416
Let's just get this over with. Come on.

364
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:43,306
What? Wait! It must be sticky.

365
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:44,995
It'll be uncomfortable.

366
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,425
Is it?

367
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:48,294
Then...

368
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:50,078
...I'll take off my socks.

369
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,836
We don't have much time.

370
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,197
So let's do this!

371
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:05,869
Everyone! With all our energy!

372
00:19:07,474 --> 00:19:08,766
Let's go!

373
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:10,889
Let's go! Go, go!

374
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,710
Here we go!

375
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:19,166
Why did you do that?

376
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:20,825
It stinks even more.

377
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,383
It's not like I knew this would happen.

378
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,857
God, it's making me crazy.

379
00:19:27,196 --> 00:19:31,399
Why was Seo Jinwoo even there,
for crying out loud!

380
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:32,790
Why was he...

381
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:41,190
Here, here.

382
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:45,277
-Junggi?
-Let's play just one game together.

383
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:47,567
- Please?
- I can't.

384
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:49,487
I have a shooting tomorrow.
I should get going.

385
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:53,839
Hey, don't turn me down like this.
You're the guild leader.

386
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,654
Excuse me.

387
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:57,662
Donggu?

388
00:19:58,389 --> 00:19:59,484
What are you doing here?

389
00:19:59,728 --> 00:20:00,561
What?

390
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,110
Junggi, do you know him?

391
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:03,252
Yes?

392
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,738
Well, I used to know him.

393
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:08,040
But now I don't.

394
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:10,123
What's that supposed to mean?

395
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:13,856
Anyway. I have nothing
to discuss with you.

396
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:15,727
Don't waste your breath. Just go.

397
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,216
Wait.

398
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,727
Could you please spare a moment?

399
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,459
Just 10 minutes. No, one minute!

400
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:22,912
I already said no.

401
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:24,356
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Sure.

402
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:25,731
Hey, Mr. Seo Jinwoo!

403
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:28,394
Junggi, let's go in.

404
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:33,836
Mr. Seo Jinwoo, please just read
the script once. Please!

405
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:34,934
Mr. Seo Jinwoo!

406
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:39,638
God, what should I do?

407
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,946
How does Junggi know Seo Jinwoo...?

408
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,166
Oh, Yuna, you were here?

409
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:53,281
Hello, Hyeonjun.
Did you enjoy your trip?

410
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:54,199
Yes.

411
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,618
But why did you leave so early?

412
00:20:57,703 --> 00:20:59,655
Well, something came up.

413
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:02,513
Hyeonjun, I should get going.

414
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:03,900
Already?

415
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:07,452
Yes. Donggu hasn't eaten
anything since then.

416
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:10,436
So I want to go quickly
to cook something he likes.

417
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:14,391
You care about him that much?
He's not a child.

418
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:15,876
He's like a child, actually.

419
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:20,701
Hey, Yuna. Can I ask you something?

420
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:22,116
Yes, sure.

421
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:23,933
Before you said...

422
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:26,145
...that you don't want to trust anyone.

423
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,001
Because you don't want to get hurt.

424
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,326
Well... Yes.

425
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:36,746
But if there is someone you can trust,
someone who will never hurt you....

426
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,119
...what will you do?

427
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:40,499
Well, that would be great but…

428
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:42,868
...will that person ever show up?

429
00:21:43,247 --> 00:21:44,603
Why are you asking?

430
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:46,391
It's nothing.

431
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:49,008
I will get going then.

432
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:11,426
God, it still stinks.
His feet is like a chemical weapon.

433
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,087
Quiet. What if he hears you?

434
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:16,207
I really can't stand it anymore.

435
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:18,882
Dusik, let's just get this over with.

436
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:19,936
Get it over with?

437
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:21,466
Min Sua!

438
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:22,775
Is that all you can say?

439
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:24,548
Wh... why!

440
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:25,700
What did I do?

441
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:27,599
You said you will do your best.

442
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:29,156
You said it's your last hope.

443
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:30,683
I did, but...

444
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,688
...the smell is killing me,

445
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:33,652
Min Sua!

446
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:36,622
Is this the best you can do?

447
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:39,720
You will face more hardships
as you do business.

448
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:43,929
If you can't even stand this smell,
just give it up!

449
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:47,663
Min Sua. I'm really disappointed in you.

450
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:49,000
Very disappointed.

451
00:22:49,823 --> 00:22:51,737
Dusik, I'm sorry.

452
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:54,006
I did not think that through.

453
00:22:54,793 --> 00:22:56,775
-So please, don't be mad.
-It's fine.

454
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:59,786
You just stay here. I'll finish the work.

455
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:16,659
-Oh, hey.
-Sorry, it took so long.

456
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:19,540
-What are you doing?
-Oh, there was a basketball.

457
00:23:19,704 --> 00:23:22,531
I was a basketball player
when I was young.

458
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:23,868
Oh, really?

459
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,483
I was a shooter.

460
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:28,941
And hell of a sharp one, too.

461
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,144
The posture is most important
when it comes to shooting the ball.

462
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:33,355
Would you like to see?

463
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:34,331
Sure.

464
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:50,704
Did you see?
Would you like to see again?

465
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:53,073
Hold...on.

466
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:54,685
But...

467
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:58,083
...where did you get those shoes?

468
00:23:58,953 --> 00:23:59,995
Oh, there?

469
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:02,004
They were over there so I tried them on.

470
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:05,937
The cushions are really good.

471
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:07,313
Jump!

472
00:24:11,112 --> 00:24:13,551
Is something wrong? You don't look good.

473
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:26,899
You crazy jerk!

474
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,000
What?

475
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:30,890
How dare you wear that
with your rotten feet!

476
00:24:30,974 --> 00:24:32,728
You stinky feet monster!

477
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:37,155
What's wrong? "Stinky feet monster"?

478
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:39,658
-Me?
-Yes, of course you. You think it's me?

479
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:41,239
You stupid tall jerk!

480
00:24:41,324 --> 00:24:43,801
You brass-necked jerk! God darn you!

481
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:46,125
Do you know how bad your foot odor is?

482
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,753
Your feet are rotten!
You jerk! Do you know?

483
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:52,089
Your feet smells like sewage!
No, it's stinkier than stinky tofu!

484
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:53,275
You know that? You jerk!

485
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,585
How dare you wear my precious shoes
given to me by my first love? You jerk!

486
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,822
I will cut your feet off!

487
00:24:59,907 --> 00:25:01,406
Take those off you son of a bitch!

488
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:04,268
I'll poke my nails through your eyes,
you freaking jackass!

489
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:08,746
What the hell are you looking at?!
You're killing my nose!

490
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:11,859
You didn't meet Seo Jinwoo?
What were you doing until now?

491
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,800
I will take care of it.

492
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,884
Sir? Sir...

493
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:20,147
God, I'm in trouble. Really.

494
00:25:20,317 --> 00:25:24,730
Okay. I will log in now.

495
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,666
This guy is a top star,
doesn't he have any schedule?

496
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,768
Should I ask Junggi a favor?
But I'm not supposed to talk to him.

497
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,268
What should I do then?

498
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,552
Oh, yeah.

499
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:44,977
Why? What! Do you have something to say?

500
00:25:47,868 --> 00:25:49,052
What are you doing?

501
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:56,449
Let me meet Seo Jinwoo.

502
00:25:57,747 --> 00:25:58,724
What are you doing?

503
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:03,209
You said you are not talking to me.
You said I don't exist to you.

504
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:08,233
I said I won't talk to you.
I didn't say I won't text.

505
00:26:08,322 --> 00:26:09,999
Will you make it happen or not?

506
00:26:14,443 --> 00:26:16,041
You are so stubborn. Really.

507
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:21,139
Fine.

508
00:26:21,658 --> 00:26:22,916
I will make you two meet.

509
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:24,252
But!

510
00:26:24,665 --> 00:26:27,854
You have to accept
my relationship with Seojin.

511
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,626
What was that?

512
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:38,871
Darn it.

513
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:43,480
Forget it, petty jerk!
Die, die, die, die,die...

514
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,004
He's really crazy.

515
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:49,863
Hey! What will you do now! Huh?

516
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:53,459
He got his feelings hurt.
He said he will never shoot for us.

517
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:57,508
I'm sorry. He was wearing the shoes
Malgeum gave me.

518
00:26:57,593 --> 00:26:58,786
In his bare feet.

519
00:26:59,111 --> 00:27:01,088
-He even jumped!
-Quiet!

520
00:27:01,611 --> 00:27:03,864
You scolded me
for complaining about the smell.

521
00:27:03,949 --> 00:27:05,824
You go out there and swear?

522
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:10,602
Huh? His feet smells like stinky tofu?
Sewage is his friend?

523
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:12,632
-I'm sorry.
-Forget it!

524
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:13,718
God.

525
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:16,942
We need to upload the new product
photos by today. What can we do?

526
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,367
Where can we get a model at this hour?

527
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:21,141
Dusik can do it.

528
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:22,299
-What?
-What?

529
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:23,782
Dusik?

530
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:26,536
I'm not going to sabotage
my own business.

531
00:27:26,621 --> 00:27:27,548
He can't be a model.

532
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:30,602
Why? I think he's handsome.

533
00:27:31,612 --> 00:27:35,154
Yuna, you have really low standard.

534
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,545
How is this handsome?

535
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,631
But you need to upload by today.

536
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,038
God, I'm going crazy.

537
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:51,503
Man, the smell won't go away.

538
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:53,505
Should I clean with chlorine bleach?

539
00:27:57,198 --> 00:27:58,734
-Sua.
-Yes?

540
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,097
What do you think? I just tried it on.

541
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:17,901
Shall we start? Where should I stand?

542
00:28:19,462 --> 00:28:20,566
Stand over there, please.

543
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:23,632
What? Why are you being so polite?

544
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:24,550
Pardon?

545
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,140
Oh, no. Just go stand there. Now!

546
00:28:28,504 --> 00:28:29,337
Okay.

547
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:37,596
Well, should I stand like this?

548
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:39,845
Yes, I will start shooting.

549
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:52,370
-Sir. I'm here.
-Alright.

550
00:28:54,178 --> 00:28:57,269
Oh, Mr. Seo Jinwoo?

551
00:28:57,606 --> 00:29:00,406
He finally decided to be in our movie.

552
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:03,549
What? Really? Thank you.

553
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:04,645
Thank you so much.

554
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,379
You should thank Junggi.

555
00:29:07,782 --> 00:29:11,398
I only read the script
because he begged me to.

556
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:12,790
Junggi?

557
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,888
Junggi seems to care about you a lot.

558
00:29:15,973 --> 00:29:20,427
He even gave me his game character
that I always asked him to sell.

559
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,401
And I became the new guild leader.

560
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,611
You're here?

561
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:56,372
I heard.

562
00:29:56,522 --> 00:29:59,668
Did you ask Seo Jinwoo?
Why did you do that?

563
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:02,234
Even if you did that,
I won't accept you two.

564
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:07,973
I didn't expect you to.

565
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:11,708
I helped you because you were struggling
right after you got back to work.

566
00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:13,565
Don't bother.

567
00:30:18,465 --> 00:30:20,919
This is annoying! Junggi, let's talk.

568
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:24,212
Why? You said you won't talk to me.

569
00:30:24,297 --> 00:30:25,991
Don't tackle me!

570
00:30:26,502 --> 00:30:27,335
Junggi.

571
00:30:29,006 --> 00:30:30,676
You really want to be with Seojin?

572
00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:37,789
Donggu.

573
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:41,852
I'm sorry. But even if you say
you won't see me anymore...

574
00:30:43,106 --> 00:30:44,664
...I can't give up on Seojin.

575
00:30:45,674 --> 00:30:46,978
You really want that?

576
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:50,249
I really like Seojin. I'm serious.

577
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:54,138
Why do you hate me so much?

578
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,087
That's not it.

579
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,374
Then what is it?

580
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,907
To be honest, you're my favorite brother.

581
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:04,504
And if you're going out
with my sister, why not?

582
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:05,914
But just what if...

583
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,699
...you two break up?

584
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:09,800
Then what?

585
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:13,851
Then, I can't see you anymore.

586
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:17,269
-You know that.
-Is that it?

587
00:31:17,354 --> 00:31:18,454
Of course.

588
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:21,216
We can't predict the future.
Aren't you worried?

589
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,604
Don't worry. I won't break up with her.

590
00:31:25,771 --> 00:31:29,575
I will never make Seojin cry.
I will cry instead of her.

591
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:33,049
So, trust me, dude.

592
00:31:33,763 --> 00:31:35,170
What did you say just now?

593
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:36,404
What?

594
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:39,503
Why? What?

595
00:31:39,728 --> 00:31:41,899
Did you say "dude" to your brother in law?

596
00:31:42,352 --> 00:31:44,128
I am now your superior.

597
00:31:44,223 --> 00:31:46,861
Superior? What are you talking about?

598
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:50,110
Wait, what?

599
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:51,998
Then...

600
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:53,391
Are you...

601
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:55,556
Are you giving your approval?

602
00:31:57,154 --> 00:32:00,614
I was about to
but you don't seem to respect me.

603
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:01,766
Forget about it.

604
00:32:02,235 --> 00:32:07,030
Sir, sir! Thank you. Thank you my brother!

605
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:10,873
Stop it, it's gross.

606
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:12,196
Hey!

607
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:19,497
Seojin! Get up, Seojin!

608
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:22,221
Why?

609
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:27,106
Wow, how can woman's beard grow so fast?

610
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:31,414
Is it? Good. Wait here.
I will show my brother.

611
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:32,464
Seojin.

612
00:32:33,866 --> 00:32:35,100
You don't have to.

613
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:36,903
He agreed.

614
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:40,192
What? Really? He did? Really?

615
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:45,532
Wow, that's a relief.
It's so hard to be with you.

616
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:48,777
Now we can go on a date anytime...

617
00:32:48,862 --> 00:32:51,748
...and tell everyone
that you're my boyfriend?

618
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:54,406
Of course.
You can even talk about it on the news.

619
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:56,205
This is so great.

620
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,176
Ouch, that stings!

621
00:32:59,174 --> 00:33:00,007
Sorry, sorry.

622
00:33:00,302 --> 00:33:02,450
Hold on. I need to shave first.

623
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:03,616
Seojin.

624
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,380
Yes? Why?

625
00:33:05,513 --> 00:33:10,026
I always wanted to do this for you.

626
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:11,319
What is it?

627
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:38,637
I love you.

628
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:49,105
What are they doing inside the room?

629
00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:51,550
Leave them. They like each other so much.

630
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:53,644
You should have let them be
from the start.

631
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:55,567
Well, I guess so.

632
00:33:56,132 --> 00:33:58,180
I was really worried at first.

633
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,084
But I saw Junggi and knew it.

634
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:07,781
I felt that he will
never make my sister cry.

635
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:09,246
I had that kind of trust.

636
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,926
Nothing. Not even one.

637
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:13,259
I said I'm sorry. Sorry.

638
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,978
Sorry isn't enough.
I said I will do it myself.

639
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:16,471
Why did you say you want to do it?

640
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,276
-What if it scars?
-I didn't do that on purpose.

641
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:21,493
How can woman's beard be so stiff?

642
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:23,218
It's like animal whiskers!

643
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:24,756
What? Animal whiskers?

644
00:34:24,841 --> 00:34:26,147
Are you done? You jerk!

645
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:30,768
Jerk? You're calling me jerk?
You are so rude.

646
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:32,638
Yes, I am rude. Why?

647
00:34:32,723 --> 00:34:34,481
Do you regret going out
with a rude girl like me?

648
00:34:34,565 --> 00:34:36,884
Yes! I regret it. Regret it!
What will you do?

649
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,214
Is that so? Then let's break up. Break up!

650
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:43,391
Alright, fine! Let's break up!
Donggu, it's over. We're breaking up.

651
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:46,790
Oh, really?

652
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:55,198
Donggu, calm down.

653
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:56,836
We were joking.

654
00:34:57,141 --> 00:35:00,782
-Joking?
-Yes, yes. It's just lover's quarrel.

655
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:04,647
- Yes, yes.
- Lover's quarrel, my ass.

656
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:07,908
You both come here! Come here!

657
00:35:09,664 --> 00:35:10,497
Come here!

658
00:35:16,522 --> 00:35:17,489
Yes, sir.

659
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:18,510
Yes.

660
00:35:19,966 --> 00:35:20,912
Yes.

661
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,027
Yes. I get it.

662
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:27,154
I will find something good. Yes.

663
00:35:28,684 --> 00:35:30,802
God, what should I do?

664
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,209
Why? What is it?

665
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:34,901
It's my work.

666
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:37,379
My supervisor wants me to quit
if I don't fine any exclusive news.

667
00:35:37,464 --> 00:35:38,803
What should I do?

668
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:43,757
Oh, did you hear anything interesting
from the broadcasting station?

669
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,043
Any love story?

670
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,318
It's not a love story
but I did hear something.

671
00:35:51,403 --> 00:35:52,286
What? What?

672
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:59,954
-Do you know the top star, Han Minjoo?
-Yes.

673
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:02,463
Well, I heard there is
a secret baby between her...

674
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:04,556
...and Park Jincheol,
CEO of Songjin Group.

675
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:07,239
What? Is that affair?

676
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:10,784
Han Minjoo with that grandpa?

677
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:14,373
Yeah, I heard it from
my trustworthy source.

678
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:15,661
From who?

679
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:17,634
You know our station?

680
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:20,030
There is VIP entrance.

681
00:36:20,115 --> 00:36:21,900
Only high authorities
and top stars like...

682
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:24,125
...Gong Yoo or Won Bin
can use that entrance.

683
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,828
So, you heard the news from that place?

684
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:28,534
No, from the security at the entrance.

685
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,753
We drink coffee together.
We're coffee buddies!

686
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:33,962
What? Security? Are you kidding me?

687
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,304
You don't understand.

688
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,624
Top secret information
actually come from people like them.

689
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:39,649
Really?

690
00:36:40,293 --> 00:36:42,801
Then where can I meet him?

691
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,079
Oh, you two are here together?

692
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,964
Oh, Donggu. What are you doing here?

693
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,490
I have some business with Hyeonjun.

694
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:53,408
Business?

695
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:56,074
Well, that big size bread
you made before.

696
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,187
Can you make 30 more of those?
And more bigger.

697
00:36:59,271 --> 00:37:01,368
-Sure.
-Are you two going somewhere?

698
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:06,005
Yes. Yuna has to celebrate,
so we are going out for a drink.

699
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:06,923
Drink?

700
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:10,359
Today, I got an order for my muffins.

701
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:12,820
Oh, really?

702
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:18,114
I should join the celebration.
The more the merrier. Isn't it?

703
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:19,066
Isn't it?

704
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:23,216
Well, I have something to tell Yuna.

705
00:37:24,062 --> 00:37:26,527
Do it in front of me. Why?

706
00:37:26,984 --> 00:37:28,759
Is it something
that I shouldn't hear about?

707
00:37:34,744 --> 00:37:35,833
Congratulations, Yuna.

708
00:37:36,966 --> 00:37:39,105
Oh, thank you.

709
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:42,535
Isn't this place very expensive?

710
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:45,031
It's a good day.
We should eat something nice.

711
00:37:45,116 --> 00:37:47,213
Don't think too much about it.
Just enjoy.

712
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,725
Alright. Thank you.

713
00:37:52,454 --> 00:37:54,536
Excuse me, I need to take this call.

714
00:37:56,088 --> 00:37:57,903
Here you go, Donggu.

715
00:37:57,988 --> 00:37:59,750
No, it's fine.

716
00:37:59,835 --> 00:38:01,506
I will order mine myself.

717
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:04,562
That wine is not my taste.

718
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:08,282
Also I don't want to drink
something you buy.

719
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:09,993
Sure. Do whatever you want.

720
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:13,261
Waitress, menu please.

721
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:19,049
Let me see.
Is my favorite wine on the menu?

722
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,737
What? The cheapest glass
of wine is 12,000 won?

723
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:24,824
For one glass?

724
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:35,771
Anything for you?

725
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:36,704
Huh?

726
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:38,234
Oh.

727
00:38:39,024 --> 00:38:40,828
I'd like this one.

728
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:46,646
But can you remove
about 200 won worth of wine?

729
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:50,254
-Pardon?
-I have a lot of work to do tonight.

730
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:53,820
But if I drink this whole thing,
I won't be able to work properly.

731
00:38:53,905 --> 00:38:56,886
Could you pour about 200 won less, please?

732
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:10,478
Oh, so good.

733
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:14,605
Oh, right. You said you wanted to
tell me something.

734
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:15,544
Yes, I did.

735
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:21,520
But I will tell you next time.
It's late. Shall we go now?

736
00:39:21,816 --> 00:39:22,649
Sure.

737
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:36,116
We should not throw away food.

738
00:39:36,201 --> 00:39:38,509
You have to eat it all in the afterlife.
Don't you know that?

739
00:39:39,383 --> 00:39:40,585
Excuse me, how much?

740
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,147
I already paid it. You can just go.

741
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:46,087
Hyeonjun, thank you so much.

742
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,843
Hey, excuse me. Let's talk.

743
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:51,806
Then I'll wait for you guys outside.

744
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:55,876
Hey, I told you.

745
00:39:56,204 --> 00:39:58,304
I don't want to owe you anything.

746
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:01,499
Here is mine. 11,800 won.

747
00:40:07,884 --> 00:40:09,254
Hold on, please.

748
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:14,178
I really enjoyed it, Hyeonjun.
Have a safe trip.

749
00:40:14,482 --> 00:40:16,614
Yes, sure.
See you at the academy, Yuna.

750
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:19,106
Good night, Donggu.

751
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:20,238
Hold on!

752
00:40:20,908 --> 00:40:22,563
Don't go. Just wait.

753
00:40:22,772 --> 00:40:23,622
What? Why?

754
00:40:23,807 --> 00:40:28,066
Just wait a bit. Let's go, Yuna.

755
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:29,258
Okay.

756
00:40:37,286 --> 00:40:39,025
-Here.
-What is this?

757
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,612
This is Yuna and my taxi fare.
What do you think?

758
00:40:41,697 --> 00:40:44,456
It's divided exactly.
That's for me and Yuna.

759
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,650
Check it before you tackle me
with this later.

760
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:48,556
Do you really need to this?

761
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:53,141
I told you. I don't want
to owe you anything.

762
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:58,046
Hey, 100 won went up
while we were talking.

763
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:00,525
Here! 100 cents.

764
00:41:01,523 --> 00:41:03,166
You should give me change of 33 won.

765
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:05,827
-What?
-It's fine. Just have it.

766
00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:13,438
Also, you keep asking my staff
to go for a drink or meal.

767
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:18,076
Please don't.
It bothers our business.

768
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,695
I think you are the one
who bothered us today.

769
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,924
What did you say?

770
00:41:22,663 --> 00:41:23,666
What do you mean?

771
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:24,682
Nothing.

772
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:26,551
I'll get going.

773
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:35,302
What is he talking about?

774
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:37,958
I really don't like that guy.

775
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:47,968
Well, excuse me.

776
00:41:48,511 --> 00:41:51,506
Oh! Are you Kim Yongsik?

777
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:54,203
Yes. But who are you?

778
00:41:54,357 --> 00:41:55,190
I'm...

779
00:41:56,378 --> 00:41:58,741
...Kang Seojin from Joyeong News.

780
00:41:58,826 --> 00:42:00,737
Why are you looking for me?

781
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:03,761
I heard that Han Minjoo had
a child with...

782
00:42:03,846 --> 00:42:05,581
...Park Jincheol, CEO of Songjin Group.

783
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:06,758
Is that true?

784
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:10,860
Who said that? I didn't say that.

785
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,182
I've already heard it from Lee Junggi,
the star of JBC's "News Room."

786
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:15,939
Oh, that guy. Really!

787
00:42:16,024 --> 00:42:18,629
I told him to keep it to himself only.
I'm in trouble.

788
00:42:18,893 --> 00:42:21,773
I will protect your identity. So tell me.

789
00:42:22,034 --> 00:42:23,191
Did you see it for yourself?

790
00:42:24,736 --> 00:42:27,406
No, I didn't see it for myself.

791
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,705
But I heard it from trustworthy source.

792
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:31,700
Who is that trustworthy source?

793
00:42:32,832 --> 00:42:34,707
Do you know the Elegance shop
in Cheongdam-dong?

794
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:37,307
-Yes.
-Han Minjoo goes to that shop often.

795
00:42:37,392 --> 00:42:39,592
There is a director
by the name of Won Kyunghee.

796
00:42:39,677 --> 00:42:40,578
Won Kyunghee.

797
00:42:40,662 --> 00:42:42,989
-Oh, so you heard it from the director?
-No.

798
00:42:43,431 --> 00:42:47,672
Won Kyunghee's favorite designer is
called Lee Jeongmin.

799
00:42:47,756 --> 00:42:50,537
-Oh, from that Lee Jeongmin designer?
-No.

800
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:55,841
Lee Jeongmin has her assistance,
Kim Inna, she washes customer's hair.

801
00:42:56,835 --> 00:43:00,543
My brother in law!
I told him not to told anyone.

802
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:04,938
It will be anonymous. Don't worry.
Just tell me. Please?

803
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:08,040
You should never reveal my name.

804
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,624
Oh, don't worry.

805
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:12,873
Did you see it for yourself?

806
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:17,904
I didn't see it. But I heard it
from a 100% trustworthy source.

807
00:43:18,092 --> 00:43:19,199
Oh, alright.

808
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,535
Do you know YS Entertainment?
Han Minjoo's agency.

809
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,816
Oh, did you hear it from someone
in YS Entertainment?

810
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:31,387
No, there is Chef Lee Choongbok
in the staff cafeteria.

811
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:33,239
Oh, did you hear it from Lee Choongbok?

812
00:43:33,323 --> 00:43:36,134
No. He loves jjamppong.

813
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:39,333
So he always orders it.
The restaurant is called "Yonghogak."

814
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:41,159
Their soup is really nice.

815
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:44,216
Excuse me, continue with your story.

816
00:43:44,305 --> 00:43:48,198
Right, there is delivery man
called Eom Jiyong.

817
00:43:48,547 --> 00:43:52,087
His nick name is "Eom G-dragon."

818
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,310
I heard from him.

819
00:43:54,462 --> 00:43:55,833
Where is Yonghogak?

820
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,508
It's a relief to hear
that my muffin is popular.

821
00:44:06,356 --> 00:44:11,022
Oh, I think it was here somewhere.
Where is it?

822
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,863
"Eom G-Dragon"

823
00:44:26,074 --> 00:44:30,608
I told her to keep it to herself.

824
00:44:31,081 --> 00:44:33,462
God, she has a cheap mouth.

825
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:37,224
I will not reveal your name.
Don't worry. Just tell me.

826
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:38,567
Did you see it?

827
00:44:38,652 --> 00:44:40,545
I didn't.

828
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:43,376
But it was from a 100% trustworthy source.

829
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,293
What?

830
00:44:44,992 --> 00:44:47,152
Do you know famous designer Andy Kim?

831
00:44:47,237 --> 00:44:50,568
I know. Did you hear from Andy Kim?

832
00:44:50,652 --> 00:44:51,789
No.

833
00:44:52,753 --> 00:44:57,903
There is a top model Han Hyejin.
She frequently models for Andy Kim.

834
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:00,350
Oh, you heard from model Han Hyejin?

835
00:45:00,434 --> 00:45:03,805
No. Please, just listen till the end.

836
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:05,691
Oh, I'm sorry.

837
00:45:05,776 --> 00:45:11,186
These days, Miss Han Hyejin teaches
in a model academy.

838
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:15,217
I heard from one of the students.

839
00:45:15,302 --> 00:45:19,974
The student is a member
of G-dragon's fan club in Gangseo-Gu.

840
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:23,575
I'm the leader. I don't think
anyone can lie to a leader.

841
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:25,792
Where can I meet that student?

842
00:45:25,877 --> 00:45:30,861
Recently, she planned to go overseas
but got conned by her boyfriend.

843
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:32,339
-Oh.
-So now I heard that...

844
00:45:32,423 --> 00:45:34,842
...she lives with her ex-boyfriend.

845
00:45:34,926 --> 00:45:35,759
What?

846
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,256
Well, what is her name?

847
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,493
Oh, it was you?

848
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:47,225
The one who said Han Minjoo had
Songjin Group CEO's child?

849
00:45:47,334 --> 00:45:48,167
What?

850
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:50,949
What? I didn't say that. Who said that?

851
00:45:51,034 --> 00:45:52,730
A restaurant with super
tasty jjamppong called...

852
00:45:52,815 --> 00:45:55,377
...Yonghogak's delivery man
who's called Eom Jiyong...

853
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,916
...also known as Eom G-dragon told me!

854
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,572
God, I can't believe our leader.

855
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,059
God, we went to
so many fan meetings together.

856
00:46:03,144 --> 00:46:04,860
How can he betray me?

857
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:08,069
Don't be like that. Tell me honestly.

858
00:46:08,153 --> 00:46:11,802
Did you see Han Minjoo giving birth
to Songjin Group CEO's child?

859
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:17,194
I didn't see it. But I heard it
from a 100% trustworthy source.

860
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,976
You also heard about it?

861
00:46:19,656 --> 00:46:22,808
Nobody saw it but heard it. Is this true?

862
00:46:22,893 --> 00:46:25,116
It's 100% true.

863
00:46:25,442 --> 00:46:29,574
I heard from a nurse from the hospital
where Han Minjoo gave birth!

864
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:32,116
She delivered the baby herself.

865
00:46:32,351 --> 00:46:35,675
Really? She delivered Han Minjoo's baby?

866
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:36,878
Yes, she did.

867
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:41,162
Oh my god! This is huge..
Thank you so much!

868
00:46:41,709 --> 00:46:43,734
Oh, my leg. My leg.

869
00:46:44,305 --> 00:46:46,811
You should drive safely. What is this?

870
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:48,704
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

871
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:51,685
Doctor, is he hurt badly?

872
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,477
He suffered a severe fracture in his leg.

873
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:55,085
-What?
-It's compound fracture.

874
00:46:55,169 --> 00:46:58,150
He needs surgery
and aftereffect will be serious.

875
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:00,800
What? That's crazy!

876
00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:02,570
Miss, what are you going to do?

877
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:05,963
What should I do now?
I need to go to work tomorrow.

878
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:10,557
I'm sorry. I will take
full responsibility. I'm really sorry.

879
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:17,368
Oh, wow.

880
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:19,570
Oh, it goes in.

881
00:47:19,885 --> 00:47:20,989
It goes in!

882
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:25,902
It's in! In!

883
00:47:25,986 --> 00:47:28,979
Can't believe this is possible.

884
00:47:32,209 --> 00:47:33,417
Oh, Yuna. Are you back?

885
00:47:36,462 --> 00:47:37,735
What's wrong?

886
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:39,190
Is there something wrong?

887
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:41,052
What?

888
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,286
Oh, no.

889
00:47:43,792 --> 00:47:46,464
I'm just a bit tired.
I'm going inside to take a rest.

890
00:47:48,388 --> 00:47:49,482
What's wrong with her?

891
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:06,270
Nurse Yoon Jiwoo?

892
00:48:06,355 --> 00:48:07,734
Yes, who are you?

893
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:11,801
I called you before. I'm Kang Seojin
from Joyeong News.

894
00:48:11,886 --> 00:48:13,029
Do you know Min Sua?

895
00:48:13,114 --> 00:48:17,443
Oh, that friend I met in Dongdaemun
when I went for clothes shopping?

896
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:19,413
-What?
-She was so funny so...

897
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:23,334
...I had a drink with her
and got close. But why?

898
00:48:23,419 --> 00:48:27,104
Oh, did you,
by any chance told Min Sua...

899
00:48:27,543 --> 00:48:30,755
...that you helped
Han Minjoo deliver her baby?

900
00:48:31,811 --> 00:48:33,245
-Is it true?
-What?

901
00:48:33,942 --> 00:48:36,402
Oh, yes, I did.

902
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,033
Really? That's big.

903
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:42,501
I helped Han Minjoo deliver her child…

904
00:48:43,207 --> 00:48:44,569
…in my dream.

905
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:46,790
-Dream?
-Yes.

906
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:49,906
There's a woman who looks
just like Han Minjoo in my hospital.

907
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:53,570
She is so pretty
but her husband looks really old.

908
00:48:53,654 --> 00:48:56,312
Like in his 60s or something.

909
00:48:56,397 --> 00:48:59,203
And that came out in my dream.

910
00:49:03,368 --> 00:49:04,919
Min Sua...!

911
00:49:05,846 --> 00:49:08,124
Oh, that was about her dream?

912
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,715
I was drunk so I guess I misunderstood.

913
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,853
I'm sorry.

914
00:49:13,469 --> 00:49:15,990
Sorry? That's it?

915
00:49:16,074 --> 00:49:18,327
Do you know how much
I had to suffer because of you?

916
00:49:18,495 --> 00:49:20,363
I was drunk.
I just made a mistake!

917
00:49:20,513 --> 00:49:21,745
That is a mistake?

918
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:23,803
Because of you,
Han Minjoo had an affair...

919
00:49:23,887 --> 00:49:26,303
...and has child with a grandpa
who is over 70 years old.

920
00:49:26,387 --> 00:49:28,432
There is a whole rumor around the nation.

921
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:30,281
-Really?
-Yes.

922
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,705
I have that much influence? I didn't know.

923
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:37,633
Are you proud? Proud?

924
00:49:38,452 --> 00:49:39,646
-No, I'm not.
-Wow.

925
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,116
Is this how rumors are spread?

926
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,678
I didn't know at all that the one
who spreads the rumor is right here.

927
00:49:47,302 --> 00:49:50,187
God, how can I go to work tomorrow
to meet my supervisor?

928
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:53,924
You be responsible for it!
What should I do? What should I do!

929
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:00,130
Then, do you want me to tell you
a real big news?

930
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:02,900
This is 100% fact. Fact!

931
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:05,877
Big news?

932
00:50:07,195 --> 00:50:08,028
What is it?

933
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:11,452
Come closer.

934
00:50:20,252 --> 00:50:21,085
What?

935
00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:23,046
Kang Dongwon is an alien?

936
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,970
Yes, he is.

937
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,745
Kang Dongwon's appearance is just
out of this world.

938
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,734
If Kang Dongwon uses his ears to send
a telepathy, a spaceship will come.

939
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:32,830
Shut up!

940
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,766
I am going crazy because of you!

941
00:50:36,513 --> 00:50:38,213
Then another one. Another news. Another!

942
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,126
Park Bogum has wings on his back.

943
00:50:40,211 --> 00:50:41,819
He's an angel. An Angel!

944
00:50:50,197 --> 00:50:52,850
That's Yuna's phone.
Did she forget to take it?

945
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,652
Yes, this is Han Yuna's phone.

946
00:50:58,302 --> 00:51:01,058
Yes, Miss Han Yuna left her phone.

947
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:02,359
Who is this?

948
00:51:04,734 --> 00:51:05,567
What?

949
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:07,313
Come again?

950
00:51:12,424 --> 00:51:13,599
30 million won?

951
00:51:13,684 --> 00:51:16,638
I took pity in her.

952
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:19,443
So I decided to settle with her
instead of going to the police.

953
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,490
I can't even go to work
because of my leg and arm.

954
00:51:21,574 --> 00:51:23,307
I'm losing a lot here.

955
00:51:23,392 --> 00:51:25,384
But, 30 million won is...

956
00:51:25,754 --> 00:51:27,467
We can't get that much money right now.

957
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,418
If you don't like it,
then let's go to the police.

958
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:32,465
-I will sue her!
-No, no. We'll get the money.

959
00:51:34,072 --> 00:51:37,027
I will prepare the money.

960
00:51:37,893 --> 00:51:39,175
Could you wait?

961
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,433
Yuna!

962
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:45,666
Yuna!

963
00:51:47,902 --> 00:51:49,542
Yuna, let's talk.

964
00:51:50,012 --> 00:51:51,795
Yes? What is it Donggu?

965
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,178
I heard you had an accident.

966
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:57,461
You should have told me about it.

967
00:51:57,546 --> 00:52:00,682
I'm sorry. I didn't want to worry you.

968
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:02,836
Why, what's wrong? What happened?

969
00:52:09,779 --> 00:52:11,846
What? 30 million won?

970
00:52:12,895 --> 00:52:13,998
I'm sorry.

971
00:52:14,513 --> 00:52:16,634
I just couldn't tell you.

972
00:52:17,165 --> 00:52:19,397
It's fine. We can talk about it later.

973
00:52:19,482 --> 00:52:21,062
Everyone, can you get some money?

974
00:52:21,146 --> 00:52:22,620
I'll look for it too.

975
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:24,141
-Alright.
-You can count on me.

976
00:52:24,338 --> 00:52:25,242
Alright.

977
00:52:25,872 --> 00:52:26,794
We can do it.

978
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,480
Yuna, don't worry.

979
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:31,439
We will work this out.

980
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:32,443
Alright?

981
00:52:41,282 --> 00:52:44,301
Hi, Seongryong. Long time no see.

982
00:52:44,385 --> 00:52:47,087
Well, can I borrow some money?

983
00:52:47,267 --> 00:52:48,100
Marriage?

984
00:52:48,257 --> 00:52:49,292
Oh, you are getting married.

985
00:52:49,505 --> 00:52:51,201
Hey, Hyewon. It's Donggu.

986
00:52:51,285 --> 00:52:53,094
Hey, Dongho. How are you?

987
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:55,125
Can you lend me some money?

988
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,749
Director, can you please?

989
00:52:58,311 --> 00:53:01,278
I'm sorry, Donggu. I'm tight as well.

990
00:53:19,514 --> 00:53:20,347
Yes, bro.

991
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:26,229
Well, I can't get loan from the bank
as I already got it.

992
00:53:27,714 --> 00:53:29,302
Did you get any?

993
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,647
Oh, is it?

994
00:53:34,995 --> 00:53:35,971
Alright.

995
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,335
What are you doing here, Donggu?

996
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:03,289
Well...

997
00:54:05,288 --> 00:54:06,777
I need a favor.

998
00:54:07,297 --> 00:54:08,545
A favor?

999
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:10,385
You have a favor to ask?

1000
00:54:10,759 --> 00:54:11,630
Hyeonjun.

1001
00:54:15,846 --> 00:54:17,287
Can you lend me some money?

1002
00:54:17,814 --> 00:54:18,855
30 million won.

1003
00:54:19,313 --> 00:54:20,551
30 million won?

1004
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,225
For what?

1005
00:54:25,689 --> 00:54:29,219
I need to know why you need
the money for.

1006
00:54:32,128 --> 00:54:35,072
I can't lend it to you
if you don't tell me.

1007
00:54:37,804 --> 00:54:39,549
Yuna was in an accident.

1008
00:54:41,086 --> 00:54:42,972
Yuna? Why?

1009
00:54:43,305 --> 00:54:44,683
Did something happen to Yuna?

1010
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:47,848
She caused the accident
and she needs settlement money.

1011
00:54:48,472 --> 00:54:50,154
I'm searching for a way out...

1012
00:54:50,392 --> 00:54:52,556
Let's go. I will solve this.

1013
00:54:57,572 --> 00:54:59,096
What are you doing? Come.

1014
00:55:05,012 --> 00:55:06,350
I'm really sorry.

1015
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:08,772
But, sir...

1016
00:55:09,253 --> 00:55:11,441
I really don't have the money now.

1017
00:55:11,539 --> 00:55:13,979
So can you give me some more time?

1018
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:16,089
I will surely give you the money.

1019
00:55:16,173 --> 00:55:18,687
No, it's fine. Just call the police.

1020
00:55:18,772 --> 00:55:21,746
I have nothing to tell you anymore.
Just call the police.

1021
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:23,026
Call the police!

1022
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:25,322
-Sir, I didn't mean...
-Call the police!

1023
00:55:26,194 --> 00:55:27,599
What? You really came?

1024
00:55:27,683 --> 00:55:29,388
Our police system got better now.

1025
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,329
-Are you Seo Taeho?
-Yes, that's me.

1026
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:35,697
You are under arrest for racketeering
by self harming and insurance fraud.

1027
00:55:35,782 --> 00:55:37,427
-What?
-Arrest him.

1028
00:55:37,527 --> 00:55:40,085
What are you doing? I am a patient.

1029
00:55:45,144 --> 00:55:48,512
You are lucky.
You were about to be ripped off.

1030
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:51,983
He is a real dirty fraud.

1031
00:55:52,068 --> 00:55:56,186
He even plans it with the doctor
so a lot of people were ripped off.

1032
00:55:57,845 --> 00:55:59,061
Thank you so much.

1033
00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:00,120
Well, then.

1034
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:02,871
I don't need to pay
the settlement money, is it?

1035
00:56:02,986 --> 00:56:04,862
Yes. Don't worry.

1036
00:56:05,017 --> 00:56:06,311
Guys, take him.

1037
00:56:07,866 --> 00:56:09,039
Walk straight!

1038
00:56:12,486 --> 00:56:13,972
Thank you so much.

1039
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,174
-Yuna!
-Huh?

1040
00:56:17,947 --> 00:56:19,421
Donggu? Hyeonjun?

1041
00:56:19,506 --> 00:56:21,639
I heard you had an accident.
What happened?

1042
00:56:21,724 --> 00:56:23,647
Oh, well.

1043
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,487
It's all solved.

1044
00:56:25,572 --> 00:56:27,712
I don't need the money any more.

1045
00:56:27,797 --> 00:56:30,299
He racketeers by self harming.

1046
00:56:30,608 --> 00:56:32,609
I was so scared and worried.

1047
00:56:32,694 --> 00:56:33,615
That jerk.

1048
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,984
Oh, really?

1049
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:37,549
That's a relief. I was worried so much.

1050
00:56:37,903 --> 00:56:39,045
I'm sorry.

1051
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:42,231
However, you will need to come
to the station with us.

1052
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,221
I need to?

1053
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:46,795
-Why?
-For witness interview.

1054
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,285
Yuna. Don't worry.

1055
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:53,273
I'll ask a lawyer I know to go with you.

1056
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:54,770
Don't be scared.

1057
00:56:55,138 --> 00:56:56,581
Thank you, Hyeonjun.

1058
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,115
Thank you so much.

1059
00:57:05,906 --> 00:57:08,261
What happened? Is it solved?

1060
00:57:08,346 --> 00:57:12,906
Yes. Hyeonjun introduced
a lawyer, so it was fine.

1061
00:57:13,718 --> 00:57:14,617
I'm sorry.

1062
00:57:14,701 --> 00:57:16,018
I made all of you to worry.

1063
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:17,215
It's nothing.

1064
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,312
It's good to hear that it's solved well.

1065
00:57:20,451 --> 00:57:23,985
Well, I'm a bit tired.
So, I better get in and take a rest.

1066
00:57:44,009 --> 00:57:44,842
What are you doing?

1067
00:57:45,911 --> 00:57:47,064
Nothing.

1068
00:57:47,379 --> 00:57:49,512
Yuna is okay now. What's wrong?

1069
00:57:49,718 --> 00:57:50,801
Something happened?

1070
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:52,062
It's just...

1071
00:57:53,176 --> 00:57:54,478
...I feel like I'm pathetic.

1072
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:55,874
Pathetic?

1073
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:57,360
What do you mean?

1074
00:57:57,684 --> 00:58:00,417
I ran all around the town
searching for money for Yuna.

1075
00:58:00,502 --> 00:58:01,700
And I couldn't get any.

1076
00:58:03,256 --> 00:58:06,492
Hyeonjun solved the problem
in a second when he heard about it.

1077
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,252
He even knows a lawyer.

1078
00:58:09,951 --> 00:58:12,914
Well, Hyeonjun is older than you.

1079
00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:15,473
Also, he is famous pastry chef.
It's obvious.

1080
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,767
I guess so.

1081
00:58:17,518 --> 00:58:18,737
It's obvious, right?

1082
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:22,432
But that obviousness...

1083
00:58:23,793 --> 00:58:26,203
...I feel like I can't
accept that obviousness.

1084
00:58:36,257 --> 00:58:38,634
It's a relief that accident issue
was put to an end.

1085
00:58:38,718 --> 00:58:40,459
It was all because of you.

1086
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:43,620
-Thank you.
-It's fine. I didn't do a lot.

1087
00:58:45,029 --> 00:58:47,491
Hyeonjun,
what is it that you want to tell me?

1088
00:58:47,795 --> 00:58:48,628
Oh.

1089
00:58:49,503 --> 00:58:51,061
Let's finish our meals first.

1090
00:58:51,676 --> 00:58:53,996
-Would you like some more wine?
-Oh, yes.

1091
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:02,617
Oh, my!

1092
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:06,193
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

1093
00:59:07,279 --> 00:59:09,679
Hyeonjun,
I need to go to the ladies' room.

1094
00:59:09,764 --> 00:59:10,597
Sure.

1095
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:26,964
-Did you enjoy the meal?
-Yes, it was really delicious.

1096
00:59:27,752 --> 00:59:30,567
But Hyeonjun,
what is it that you want to tell me?

1097
00:59:32,976 --> 00:59:33,809
Yuna.

1098
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:36,399
-Actually, I...
-Hold on.

1099
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:38,735
Oh, where is it?

1100
00:59:40,806 --> 00:59:42,567
Why? Is something gone?

1101
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:45,215
Yes, my hairpin is gone.

1102
00:59:45,618 --> 00:59:47,448
It was here just now.

1103
00:59:48,072 --> 00:59:50,910
Where is it? Oh my.

1104
00:59:50,994 --> 00:59:52,924
Oh, where is it? Where could it be?

1105
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:56,163
Where is it? Where could it be?

1106
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:58,728
You can buy a new hairpin.

1107
00:59:59,032 --> 01:00:00,831
I will buy you a new pretty hairpin.

1108
01:00:01,107 --> 01:00:04,415
No, I can't. It was
a gift from Donggu.

1109
01:00:04,794 --> 01:00:06,858
It was the first gift I got from Donggu.

1110
01:00:07,294 --> 01:00:08,162
Gosh.

1111
01:00:11,428 --> 01:00:14,344
Oh. Maybe I lost it
when I went to the toilet.

1112
01:00:14,551 --> 01:00:16,880
I'll go to the ladies' room, Hyeonjun.

1113
01:00:29,038 --> 01:00:31,567
Yuna, smile.

1114
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:33,842
Oh, I'm sorry.

1115
01:00:34,287 --> 01:00:37,016
I made you feel bad too.

1116
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:39,310
No, it's fine.

1117
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:41,602
Oh?

1118
01:00:43,124 --> 01:00:44,100
Hold on.

1119
01:00:44,668 --> 01:00:45,501
Why?

1120
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:50,744
Is this it?

1121
01:00:51,165 --> 01:00:53,043
Is this the pin you lost just now?

1122
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:56,186
It is! It is.

1123
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:58,561
What a relief.

1124
01:01:00,684 --> 01:01:01,882
Finally, you're smiling.

1125
01:01:02,043 --> 01:01:03,408
Are you happy that you found it?

1126
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,995
Yes, I do. I really thought I lost it.

1127
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,370
I was really worried.

1128
01:01:10,183 --> 01:01:11,436
Shall we go now?

1129
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,197
Yuna.

1130
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,874
-I have something to tell you.
-Oh, you are right. You did.

1131
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,265
What is it? Tell me.

1132
01:01:20,731 --> 01:01:21,978
Yuna, you said...

1133
01:01:22,547 --> 01:01:26,616
...that you don't want to trust anyone
as you don't want to be hurt again.

1134
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:28,250
Well...

1135
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:30,265
- Yes, I did.
- But I think...

1136
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:34,340
...you shouldn't be afraid of
falling in love just because...

1137
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:37,527
...you are scared that
you will get hurt again.

1138
01:01:38,855 --> 01:01:40,764
-What?
-So I mean...

1139
01:01:41,209 --> 01:01:44,720
...don't let go of that person you like.

1140
01:01:45,698 --> 01:01:47,342
What are you talking about?

1141
01:01:47,427 --> 01:01:48,772
I'm talking about Donggu.

1142
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:50,756
Yuna.

1143
01:01:52,598 --> 01:01:53,977
I know you like Donggu.

1144
01:01:56,117 --> 01:01:57,931
-What?
-But...

1145
01:01:58,285 --> 01:02:02,180
You're afraid that you'll get hurt
so you are pushing him away.

1146
01:02:02,975 --> 01:02:03,808
Am I wrong?

1147
01:02:06,284 --> 01:02:10,401
But if you push him away like that
and lose someone you like...

1148
01:02:11,056 --> 01:02:12,579
...don't you think that will be painful?

1149
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:15,652
Don't you think that will be more painful?

1150
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:20,997
Well, then...

1151
01:02:21,584 --> 01:02:23,055
...shall we say bye from here?

1152
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:24,743
Sure.

1153
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:26,957
Goodbye.

1154
01:02:33,728 --> 01:02:34,561
Oh.

1155
01:02:35,245 --> 01:02:36,653
About Donggu.

1156
01:02:37,313 --> 01:02:40,397
He never wants to owe me anything.
Even a taxi fare.

1157
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:42,454
But...

1158
01:02:42,995 --> 01:02:45,208
...he came to me when you had an accident.

1159
01:02:45,745 --> 01:02:47,150
Asking me for help.

1160
01:02:48,052 --> 01:02:49,915
It must have been a torture
for him to visit me.

1161
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,584
Maybe that's how much he likes you.

1162
01:02:55,347 --> 01:02:56,850
Or maybe I'm thinking too much?

1163
01:02:58,653 --> 01:02:59,486
Well, then.

1164
01:03:00,317 --> 01:03:01,411
I'll get going.

1165
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:32,120
I will, I will...

1166
01:03:32,204 --> 01:03:34,407
I'll sell all these. I'll help you.

1167
01:03:34,492 --> 01:03:35,383
Buy some bread.

1168
01:03:35,659 --> 01:03:37,325
Buy some bread. It's delicious.

1169
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,919
Do you even know how she's living?

1170
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,121
Move!

1171
01:03:42,205 --> 01:03:44,033
Yuna! Yuna!

1172
01:03:45,017 --> 01:03:46,642
Are you hurt?

1173
01:03:46,726 --> 01:03:48,314
Are you alright?

1174
01:03:49,662 --> 01:03:51,303
You think he came to Seoul
from far away...

1175
01:03:51,388 --> 01:03:53,363
...to eat Soondae and give up
on partying?

1176
01:03:53,687 --> 01:03:56,333
I like you Yuna. I really like you.

1177
01:04:55,602 --> 01:04:57,105
What are you doing here alone?

1178
01:04:58,275 --> 01:04:59,312
Just sitting.

1179
01:05:00,881 --> 01:05:02,198
Where have you been?

1180
01:05:02,576 --> 01:05:04,167
I met with Hyeonjun.

1181
01:05:05,517 --> 01:05:07,737
Oh, is it?

1182
01:05:10,316 --> 01:05:13,610
I think Song Hyeonjun
is actually a very nice guy.

1183
01:05:14,317 --> 01:05:16,763
He earns good. Personality is good.

1184
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:18,827
I can say he's kind of handsome.

1185
01:05:20,703 --> 01:05:22,202
He's good to you.

1186
01:05:22,584 --> 01:05:23,653
Wait.

1187
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:26,756
Why are you telling me this?

1188
01:05:26,841 --> 01:05:28,833
Well, I'm just saying.

1189
01:05:28,918 --> 01:05:31,031
Donggu, you are such a fool.

1190
01:05:31,981 --> 01:05:34,130
You really don't know anything.

1191
01:05:34,383 --> 01:05:35,503
What did I do?

1192
01:05:35,587 --> 01:05:36,711
Forget it.

1193
01:05:37,881 --> 01:05:40,036
I'm going inside, I'm tired.

1194
01:05:44,252 --> 01:05:45,730
Why is she angry at me?

1195
01:05:49,224 --> 01:05:50,246
What is it?

1196
01:05:52,547 --> 01:05:53,703
You like him that much?

1197
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:54,992
Yes.

1198
01:05:55,077 --> 01:05:57,454
Then, say I like you.

1199
01:05:57,648 --> 01:06:00,542
Donggu, I like you.

1200
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:01,391
Make it more cute.

1201
01:06:01,475 --> 01:06:03,022
I like you.

1202
01:06:03,107 --> 01:06:04,039
More lovely.

1203
01:06:04,124 --> 01:06:05,600
I like you.

1204
01:06:05,684 --> 01:06:06,629
More cute.

1205
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,699
I really like you.

1206
01:06:08,784 --> 01:06:09,885
More brave!

1207
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,901
I like you!

1208
01:06:22,384 --> 01:06:23,847
What is this?

1209
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:37,538
I like you.

1210
01:06:38,052 --> 01:06:39,762
I really do, Donggu.

1211
01:06:44,185 --> 01:06:45,117
Shall we...

1212
01:06:46,214 --> 01:06:47,934
...see each other, seriously?

1213
01:06:50,261 --> 01:06:51,161
Yuna?

1214
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:42,849
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1215
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,163
-You're up early. Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

1216
01:07:45,248 --> 01:07:46,951
What's with you two?
Are you guys really dating?

1217
01:07:47,036 --> 01:07:49,108
Does that mean we're not
officially dating yet?

1218
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:50,112
Open your mouth.

1219
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:52,039
-I'll eat myself.
-Geez.

1220
01:07:52,123 --> 01:07:52,836
I'm ruined.

1221
01:07:52,925 --> 01:07:54,065
Shall we go on the Viking ride?

1222
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,337
Sir, let me get off.

1223
01:07:55,421 --> 01:07:56,466
Oh my god.

1224
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:58,310
-It's Al over.
-Donggu.

1225
01:07:58,399 --> 01:07:59,332
Are you crying?

1226
01:07:59,453 --> 01:08:00,648
It's still winter for me.

1227
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:02,019
There's another lonely
person next to you.

1228
01:08:02,103 --> 01:08:03,482
Don't say such a thing again.

1229
01:08:03,566 --> 01:08:05,114
I hate the idea too.

1230
01:08:05,198 --> 01:08:07,502
I think I'm in love.

1231
01:08:07,587 --> 01:08:08,975
Angela, will you date me?

1232
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,394
Are you sure, Angela?

1233
01:08:10,508 --> 01:08:11,565
-Ouch!
-Ouch!

1234
01:08:11,649 --> 01:08:13,436
-I'll have to cut your hair off.
-What?

1235
01:08:13,525 --> 01:08:14,147
Ouch hey.

1236
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:15,064
Duck!

1237
01:08:16,883 --> 01:08:18,144
Hey! Who are you?!

1238
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:19,276
I'm going to the culture center!

1239
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,943
Are you Seol's uncles?

1240
01:08:21,027 --> 01:08:23,750
I thought we were the only men here.
There's another person.

1241
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:24,782
Bye!

1242
01:08:24,866 --> 01:08:26,469
Let's change your diaper. What?

1243
01:08:28,169 --> 01:08:29,115
This isn't Seol.

1244
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:30,732
Go and get Seol now.

1245
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:31,941
Seol!

1246
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:38,014
"Welcome to Waikiki"
