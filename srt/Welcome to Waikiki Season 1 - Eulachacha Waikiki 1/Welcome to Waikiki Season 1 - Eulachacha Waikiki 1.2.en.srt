1
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:20,085
Ouch. My butt hurts.

2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,259
You're a happy baby!

3
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:25,662
Good morning, Seol.

4
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,767
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

5
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:29,889
-You got up early today.
-Good morning, Yuna.

6
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:31,373
Morning, did you sleep...

7
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:34,535
Don't be surprised.
He does that every morning.

8
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:36,162
What are those guys called...?

9
00:00:36,473 --> 00:00:38,275
-It was 'Groo' something.
-'Grooming guys.'

10
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:39,621
We're grooming guys.

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,917
Men also have to groom
themselves nowadays.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,422
Oh, Yuna.

13
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,971
I'm actually an actor.

14
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:48,275
-An actor.
-Wow, an actor?

15
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:49,862
That's so cool.

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,804
Actor, my foot.

17
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:55,146
You never get any lines
and all you do is stand in the background.

18
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:59,238
Writer Bong, you are so sweet...

19
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:00,524
Dusik, are you a writer?

20
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:02,373
What do you write?

21
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:06,536
Well, I write novels
and I regularly publish web novels.

22
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:08,623
But my goal is to become a screenwriter.

23
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,235
Screenwriter, as if.

24
00:01:10,324 --> 00:01:13,327
You ghostwrite cover letters
for job seekers.

25
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,201
One time, he got paid with a bag of chips,

26
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:20,074
to write a speech
for an elementary student president.

27
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,837
He's not a professional writer.
But an amateur.

28
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:25,146
-What did you say?!
-An amateur writer.

29
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:26,843
That's enough.

30
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:29,890
You two are both losers.
What are you so proud of?

31
00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:31,922
You're a bigger loser than us.

32
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:33,505
He wants to be a film director
but he got kicked out,

33
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,596
for setting fire on the film set
trying to grill sweet potatoes.

34
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:39,032
Why are you bringing that up?

35
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:41,529
-It was potatoes, not sweet potatoes.
-Hey.

36
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:43,369
That doesn't change the fact
that you started a fire.

37
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:44,734
But that's an important detail!

38
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:47,655
Sweet potato has two words in it
and potato is just one word!

39
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:49,944
Why are you counting the words?
We're talking about the fire!

40
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:51,225
Sweet potato and potato are different!

41
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:53,246
Why did you pick a fight with Jungi
in the first place?

42
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:56,475
Stop. Calm down everyone.

43
00:01:57,512 --> 00:01:58,925
Why do you tell that story
to everyone you meet?

44
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:00,253
I'm on your side!

45
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,262
Shut up!

46
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:04,746
You guys are so immature.

47
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:05,804
Hope you understand.

48
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,660
Men in this house are all weird.

49
00:02:09,432 --> 00:02:11,079
What? We're weird?

50
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:14,203
You're the weirdest one of all of us.
Chewbacca.

51
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,144
Chewbacca?

52
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:18,788
-What does that mean?
-You know the hairball in Star Wars.

53
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:19,906
Hold on.

54
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,308
Here it is.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,988
Chewbacca.

56
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,292
I see. But why did you call her Chewbacca?

57
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,697
Chewbacca and Seojin are...

58
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:31,290
I told you not to speak of it.

59
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:33,053
I won't tell her!

60
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,656
A-choo-Bacca!

61
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:38,016
-A-choo-Bacca!
-I'll kill you.

62
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:39,660
Come here!

63
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:42,877
I'm older than you!

64
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,666
Why you little...!

65
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:46,636
You two siblings have bad tempers.

66
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:48,768
They are so weird.

67
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:53,152
Was it a good decision
to stay in this house?

68
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:57,741
Seol, are you hungry?

69
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,579
Let's eat.

70
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:01,385
Let's eat breakfast.

71
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,210
Seol is hungry.

72
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:05,483
Breakfast?

73
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:07,187
Oh my god.

74
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:09,581
-She's the weirdest one.
-I agree.

75
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:11,173
Why does she keep doing that?

76
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:18,919
Guys.

77
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,499
Shall we start cleaning?

78
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:25,120
Yeah. Seojin said she'll check later.

79
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,345
We should clean if we don't want
to get scolded by her.

80
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:31,840
But do we all have to clean up?

81
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,980
Speaking of which...

82
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:36,583
Do you want to play a game?

83
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:38,096
What game?

84
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:45,859
So...you're going to put on pants
without using your hands?

85
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:48,059
It's not possible.

86
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:50,411
-You have to use your hands.
-Exactly.

87
00:03:51,402 --> 00:03:55,589
If I fail, I'll clean up all by myself.

88
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:58,808
But if I succeed, I won't have to clean.

89
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:00,419
How about it? Deal?

90
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,873
-Deal.
-Deal.

91
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:14,123
-Let's do this!
-You have 30 seconds.

92
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:20,649
It's not possible.

93
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:25,189
What the hell?

94
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:27,290
-What the hell?
-Huh?

95
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,113
What the hell?

96
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,320
-What the hell?
-How is that possible?

97
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,135
No, no!

98
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:37,353
What the hell?

99
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:38,583
What are you doing?

100
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:42,672
I told you to clean up,
not play a stupid game!

101
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,351
-I was about to start cleaning.
-Me too.

102
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,646
Where are you going?

103
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:48,205
I succeeded, right?

104
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:49,629
I don't have to clean, right?

105
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:51,729
-Yes!
-You have to clean.

106
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:53,769
-Follow me.
-But I won the game!

107
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:55,416
I succeeded! I don't have to clean!

108
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:56,454
Come on!

109
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,871
I'm exhausted.

110
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,586
There's a lot to do
since we suddenly have a lot of guests.

111
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:08,114
We haven't been cleaning for long.
Stop whining.

112
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:10,063
Hurry up.

113
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:12,745
-It's almost check-in time.
-All right.

114
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,594
Aren't you going to the library today?

115
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:16,916
-So you can stop cleaning when I'm gone?
-That's not what I meant.

116
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,189
You're graduating soon.

117
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,354
How's the job hunting going?

118
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:21,475
Job hunting...

119
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,081
I want to get a job.

120
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,763
I really want one, but it's not easy.

121
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:27,885
It's really hard to find a job these days.

122
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,544
Cheer up.

123
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:31,764
I feel better when I think of you.

124
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:33,542
Really?

125
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,264
I know that if I don't work hard,
I'll end up like you.

126
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:38,108
That thought keeps me awake at night.

127
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:39,085
Thanks.

128
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:43,261
Why you...

129
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:47,912
What are you doing?

130
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:49,997
Are you going to do this all day?

131
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:52,852
Wash the bed sheets
and clean the rooftop.

132
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,854
And get rid of the tree
in the living room.

133
00:05:54,943 --> 00:05:58,519
-It's months after Christmas...
-Okay. Stop nagging.

134
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:00,440
I feel distraught as is.

135
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,990
Why?

136
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,289
-Sua and I broke up.
-I know.

137
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:05,982
She dumped you because you're incompetent,

138
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:07,760
and you got caught trying
to sell your ring, right?

139
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,506
And you're still hung up on her?

140
00:06:10,594 --> 00:06:11,949
-Who said that?
-Jungi.

141
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,650
What a blabbermouth.

142
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,668
When a woman wants to break up,
that's the end.

143
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:18,460
-Just forget her.
-We were together for four years.

144
00:06:18,548 --> 00:06:19,885
We can't just break up one day.

145
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:20,971
I can't accept that.

146
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:23,682
-Then go and see her.
-She won't see me!

147
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,100
She's ignoring my calls and texts.

148
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:26,603
Even when I go to see her, she avoids me.

149
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:28,815
I guess her mind is set.

150
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:30,350
Sua is being too harsh, don't you think?

151
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:33,705
Do you also think I'm incompetent,

152
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:35,995
-and that I don't have a future?
-What?

153
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:38,939
-Look at the time.
-What about it?

154
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:41,059
I have to go to the library. Bye.

155
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,171
That brat...

156
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,456
Even my younger sister is ignoring me.

157
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:51,416
I'm so tired.

158
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:53,808
I'm going to die of exhaustion
from cleaning.

159
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:56,814
Well done. Would you like a drink?

160
00:06:56,902 --> 00:06:58,309
-Yes.
-I'm fine.

161
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:00,385
Stop rubbing it on your face.

162
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:05,395
The T-zone gets oily very easily,
so I have to keep reapplying make-up.

163
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:08,311
And I'm taking extra care
because I'm shooting a scene today.

164
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,399
What movie?

165
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:10,636
You know X-men, right?

166
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:13,157
This is a Korean version of X-men.

167
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:15,749
It's a movie about a battle
between mutants and humans.

168
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:17,036
Who plays the main character?

169
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:20,153
-Jo Insung.
-Wow.

170
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:22,917
It'll be a mega hit.

171
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:26,451
If the movie becomes a mega hit,
I will become a movie star.

172
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,000
And if I become a movie star,

173
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:32,171
I won't have to look at your sad faces.

174
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,385
This movie star has to go to work.

175
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:36,220
Good luck.

176
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,524
See you later!

177
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:41,344
Oh no!

178
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:43,600
Yuna, are you okay?
Are you hurt?

179
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,263
I'm all right.

180
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,996
Be more careful.

181
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:49,369
Sorry.

182
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:53,353
Excuse me.

183
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:56,776
I haven't agreed to you staying here.

184
00:07:57,148 --> 00:08:01,212
I'm going to watch you work.
If I don't like it, you'll have to leave.

185
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:03,983
Sure. Don't worry, I'll do well.

186
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,869
Go to her. I'll clean up here.

187
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:21,102
Sorry.

188
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,295
Give those rubber gloves.

189
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:24,715
-Oh, right.
-Yeah.

190
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:31,477
Oh no!

191
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:33,179
Oh no...

192
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:35,550
I'm so sorry!

193
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:37,450
-Did it hurt a lot?
-Foam!

194
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:40,328
Come on!

195
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:42,230
-Jeez...!
-Sorry.

196
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:45,594
Stop saying sorry and just go.

197
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:46,960
I'm so sor...

198
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:50,494
I... I apologize.

199
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:57,088
I really don't like her. I don't like her.

200
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:59,502
She was distracted by her baby.

201
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:01,789
You've become grumpier recently.

202
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:03,847
Is it because of Sua?

203
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,783
-No, it's not.
-Of course it is.

204
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:10,328
-It's written on your face.
-It's not!

205
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,441
I told you it's not because of her!

206
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,110
Why do you keep saying it is
when I told you it isn't!

207
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:15,321
That's so annoying!

208
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:16,599
You clean this up!

209
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:19,875
I'm pissed off.

210
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,416
Why does he always yell at me?

211
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:23,763
I can hear you!

212
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:28,134
Yes, sir.

213
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:31,169
-Are you ready for the shoot?
-Yes, I'm almost ready.

214
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:34,642
Radiation mutant!

215
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:46,686
Where are you?

216
00:09:49,945 --> 00:09:51,666
-Hello, sir.
-Yeah, hi.

217
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:55,018
It looks real.
They did a good job.

218
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:57,279
We'll start shooting soon
as soon as Insung arrives.

219
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,689
-So stand by.
-Yes, sir.

220
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,421
Where's the gene mutant?

221
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:03,236
Gene mutant!

222
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:04,745
Hello?

223
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:07,059
What? What happened?

224
00:10:08,432 --> 00:10:09,673
This is bad.

225
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,791
All right.

226
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,496
Unbelievable.

227
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:13,312
What happened?

228
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:15,988
Insung was in a minor collision
on the way here.

229
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:17,150
He's in the hospital.

230
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:20,517
-What do we do about the shoot?
-What else can we do?

231
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:22,504
The main star isn't here.
Let's call it a day.

232
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:26,090
Sir, what should I do?

233
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:28,765
You can wash everything off
and come back tomorrow...

234
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:29,877
What are you talking about?

235
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:32,270
He can't wash it off. It's expensive.

236
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:36,095
Go home like this
and come back tomorrow.

237
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:39,374
-Got it?
-Like this?

238
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:43,400
If you ruin your make-up,
I'll remove your character from the movie.

239
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:44,321
Got it?

240
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:46,679
-But...
-Darn it.

241
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:48,429
But, I...

242
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:51,229
We'll wrap up.

243
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,307
Wait. Where's everyone going?

244
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:54,739
Go home like this?

245
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:56,588
How am I supposed to go home like this?

246
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:57,510
Wait...

247
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:05,857
Welcome...

248
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:13,544
What is that?

249
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:15,542
What is that?

250
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,324
This is so embarrassing.

251
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,411
Why are there so many people here?

252
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,696
I shouldn't ruin the prosthetic.

253
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:38,494
What is that?

254
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:04,473
Sorry.

255
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:07,055
Be careful!

256
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,167
-Hi.
-Hi.

257
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,740
I told her to wash the towels
and she dropped them here.

258
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:23,610
She can't do anything right.

259
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:26,818
-Donggu.
-What?

260
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:27,947
What the hell!

261
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:29,619
What the hell! Who are you!

262
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,559
It's me.

263
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:33,027
Jungi?

264
00:12:33,115 --> 00:12:34,225
Why do you look like that?

265
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:37,178
The main star was in an accident
so the shooting got postponed.

266
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:39,176
The director told him to stay
in this make-up,

267
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:41,694
because it's expensive to do it again.

268
00:12:41,992 --> 00:12:45,108
You lead such a difficult life.

269
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:46,792
That's enough.

270
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:49,168
This is already embarrassing as hell.

271
00:12:57,963 --> 00:13:00,346
Dusik, hold the phone against my ear.

272
00:13:02,664 --> 00:13:03,638
Hello?

273
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,090
Yes, I'm Lee Jungi.

274
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:07,835
What? The police station?

275
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:09,585
We caught a pickpocket.

276
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:11,484
And we found your wallet.

277
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:12,697
My wallet?

278
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:13,849
One moment, please.

279
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:15,740
Huh?

280
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:17,691
Darn it! My wallet.

281
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:21,734
Yes, I'll be right there. Thank you.

282
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:23,551
-Hang up.
-Wait.

283
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:25,525
-You're going like that?
-I have no choice.

284
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:27,138
My ID, credit card and cash...

285
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:28,541
Oh, there's no cash in there.

286
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:32,045
That jerk... I'll kill him.

287
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:36,082
There are no normal people in this house.

288
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:39,118
What's this?

289
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,693
Who left the fridge door open?

290
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:47,124
All the food could've gone bad.

291
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:51,697
It was her again, huh?

292
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:53,966
Yuna! Yuna!

293
00:13:56,326 --> 00:13:58,136
Yes? Did you call me?

294
00:13:58,248 --> 00:13:59,081
Look.

295
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:00,957
You did this, didn't you?

296
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:03,676
I was cleaning the fridge
and Seol started crying.

297
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:05,945
-I'll clean up now.
-It's fine.

298
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:07,467
Calm Seol down first.

299
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:10,420
What's this?

300
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:12,483
Mushrooms grew on mushrooms?

301
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:14,987
-Throw this away.
-Okay.

302
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:18,391
-You had your meal. Let's take a nap.
-Listen.

303
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:20,634
-Do your job properly.
-Sorry.

304
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:24,207
Then don't do things to apologize for.

305
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:26,283
What is it this time?

306
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:28,434
This is all your fault!

307
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:30,249
-You and Jungi!
-Why are you blaming...

308
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:31,420
Jeez...!

309
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,234
I'm always the bad guy!

310
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:35,053
Why are you yelling at me?

311
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:36,314
Sorry.

312
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:38,511
-It's my fault.
-No, it's fine.

313
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,178
Yuna, I'll take Seol.

314
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,760
I'll look after Seol while you clean up.

315
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:46,986
-I don't want to trouble you.
-It's fine.

316
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:49,154
I have nothing to do
until I have to go to work.

317
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:53,025
Plus, Seol loves me.

318
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:54,861
Right, Seol?

319
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:04,203
That's how much you love me?

320
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:18,750
Why don't you just let me go?

321
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:22,007
Shut up or I'll hit you in the head.

322
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:24,734
-Excuse me.
-How can I help...

323
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,840
Oh my god!

324
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,482
Who... Who are you?

325
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,035
You called me. I'm Lee Jungi.

326
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:34,657
My wallet is here.

327
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:35,878
Can you not point the gun at me?

328
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:39,597
Oh, you're the victim I spoke to earlier.

329
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,646
-Yes, yes.
-You scared me.

330
00:15:41,735 --> 00:15:43,329
Why do you look like that?

331
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:48,368
I'm starring in a movie
but the shooting got postponed.

332
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:50,958
You said my wallet was here.

333
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:52,683
-Here it is.
-Wait.

334
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:54,662
We have to identify you.

335
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,835
Lee Jungi.

336
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:02,036
Are you really Lee Jungi?

337
00:16:02,124 --> 00:16:04,119
Yes, I'm Lee Jungi as you can see.

338
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:07,800
You kind of look like him...

339
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:09,686
Look. That's me.

340
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:10,710
I look exactly like the photo.

341
00:16:10,798 --> 00:16:13,014
I can't check because of
that thing on your face.

342
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:14,521
-Can't you wash it off?
-No, I can't.

343
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,542
I'll get fired if I ruin this make-up.

344
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:18,499
We'll use your fingerprint.

345
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:19,759
Give me your finger.

346
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:25,692
Can I pluck these hair?

347
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,268
No! I'll get fired.

348
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:30,031
What am I supposed to do then?

349
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:31,650
You can do a DNA test.

350
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:32,787
I can give you my blood.

351
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,806
DNA test for a simple identification?

352
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:39,358
-We'll send hair and blood to NISI.
-It's too much, huh?

353
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:42,902
But I really am Lee Jungi.
Give me my wallet.

354
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:45,620
I can't give it to you
until I can identify you.

355
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,521
Don't detectives have sharp eyes?
It's obviously me.

356
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:51,911
So, you didn't get your wallet back?

357
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:54,591
They wouldn't give it to me
because they can't identify me.

358
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,416
He needs sharper eyes
to do his job better.

359
00:16:57,527 --> 00:17:01,923
Even this make-up can't cover up
this gorgeous face.

360
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:03,144
I'm home.

361
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:05,192
Chewbacca, you're back from the library?

362
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,937
I told you not to call me by that...

363
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:07,859
Oh my goodness!

364
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,891
-What is that?
-There's only one person who can do this.

365
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:12,033
Jungi?

366
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:14,277
-Why do you look like this?
-I don't know!

367
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:16,797
-Don't use violence! Use words!
-Sorry.

368
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:18,590
I didn't know it was you.

369
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,805
If you had known, you would've hit me
with the pointy part.

370
00:17:21,894 --> 00:17:24,677
Thanks for hitting me with the flat part.

371
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,113
-Let's eat.
-Here you go.

372
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:30,362
It's a mushroom stew.

373
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:31,698
It looks delicious.

374
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:35,604
Dusik, give me Seol and go eat.

375
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:39,191
-Aren't you eating?
-I had some bread earlier. I'm full.

376
00:17:39,744 --> 00:17:41,197
Go to your mommy.

377
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,621
Darn it.

378
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:53,581
Wow, the broth is really good.

379
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:54,988
Right, Donggu?

380
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,764
Yeah, it's not bad.

381
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:58,274
That's a relief.

382
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:00,546
I was worried
it might not suit your palate.

383
00:18:03,487 --> 00:18:04,872
-Jungi.
-Yes?

384
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:07,068
-Try some.
-Sure.

385
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:13,191
Come on.

386
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,208
What are you doing? Are you an animal?

387
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:20,197
Yuna, can I ask for a favor?

388
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:21,564
What is it?

389
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,944
-Do you have to eat like that?
-Yes.

390
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:37,505
If my make-up gets ruined,
I'll get fired.

391
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:38,756
Have some broth too.

392
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,691
It's spicy. It's really good, Yuna.

393
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,092
Help yourselves.

394
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:55,308
Hello?

395
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:57,436
Sua, can we meet, please?

396
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:59,622
I just need one minute.

397
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,193
I'll explain everything.

398
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:03,237
We can't break up like this...

399
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,193
Hello?

400
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:05,819
She hung up again.

401
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:06,740
I'll call her again.

402
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:10,500
My stomach...

403
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:11,909
Why does it hurt all of a sudden?

404
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:19,600
What the hell!

405
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:20,517
What are you guys doing?

406
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:21,927
Don't talk to me.

407
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,823
Chewbacca, hurry up!

408
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:27,340
I'm dying!

409
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:28,933
I'm dying too!

410
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:31,137
At least you can talk. I can't...

411
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,634
You have an upset stomach too?

412
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:38,386
-Dusik, you too?
-Yes...

413
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:40,973
My stomach started hurting after lunch.

414
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:42,648
I can't hold it in!

415
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,243
What's going on?

416
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:49,437
What did we eat? Wait...

417
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:50,703
What did we eat for lunch?

418
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,620
Mushroom stew, kimchi, and...

419
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:54,835
Mushroom stew?

420
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:57,065
No way.

421
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:03,582
What's wrong?

422
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:08,210
Did you...

423
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,687
....by any chance...

424
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:11,777
...put these mushrooms in the stew?

425
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,679
Yes. Why do you ask?

426
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:14,965
"Why"?

427
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,523
I told you to throw these away
because they've gone bad!

428
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:20,002
What?

429
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:20,891
I'm sorry.

430
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:23,143
I guess I didn't hear you
because I was distracted by Seol earlier.

431
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:24,915
Is that all you have to say?

432
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:26,546
Everyone has an upset stomach...!

433
00:20:28,373 --> 00:20:29,926
Oh no! I'm sorry.

434
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:31,330
I'm so sorry!

435
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:32,935
Forget it.

436
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:35,934
I can't stand this anymore.

437
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,885
Pack your things and leave now.

438
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,208
Donggu!

439
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:25,651
"Out of order. Do not use this toilet!"

440
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:35,857
Watch where you are going!

441
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:37,709
I'm... I'm sorry.

442
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:40,402
Sua.

443
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,801
Wait!

444
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:45,319
-We need to talk.
-I have nothing to say to you.

445
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:46,843
Wait! Please!

446
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,436
Give me just one minute.

447
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:50,909
Okay, just one minute.

448
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:52,011
What did you want to tell me?

449
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,579
Yes, so...

450
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,834
Sua...

451
00:21:57,923 --> 00:21:58,818
I...

452
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:03,967
I'm sorry, but can we talk in a bit?
I need to go somewhere.

453
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,035
-No.
-I'll tell you now!

454
00:22:06,123 --> 00:22:08,370
Why did I have to run into you now...?

455
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,262
-Unbelievable...
-What?

456
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,221
Nothing! I'll tell you.

457
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:15,410
Sua.

458
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,551
It's all my fault.

459
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:19,608
-I'm so sorry.
-What are you sorry about?

460
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:22,427
-For everything.
-What's everything?

461
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:23,530
Tell me in detail.

462
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:24,741
In detail?

463
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,945
Okay...

464
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,313
So...

465
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:34,813
So... Right!

466
00:22:34,902 --> 00:22:37,124
-Selling our couple ring?
-What else?

467
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,623
-I lack responsibility.
-And?

468
00:22:39,711 --> 00:22:40,993
Another one?

469
00:22:41,504 --> 00:22:42,337
Sure...

470
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:45,464
So... What else...

471
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,340
Did you just fart?

472
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:56,650
In this situation!?

473
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:57,977
No, I didn't.

474
00:22:58,484 --> 00:22:59,759
It was this noise.

475
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:02,049
You're joking even at this moment.

476
00:23:02,377 --> 00:23:05,252
-Forget it.
-No, Sua. Wait...!

477
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:15,552
You're not even running after me?

478
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:17,713
-I really want to, but...
-Forget it.

479
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,051
It's really over. Got it?

480
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,070
Wait, Sua...!

481
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,251
Sua...

482
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,609
I'm sorry.

483
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:47,494
Toilet.

484
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:48,660
Toilet!

485
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,659
"Public Toilet for Sale"

486
00:24:03,748 --> 00:24:05,937
You can have a look and decide.

487
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:09,988
This is the most popular model these days.

488
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:11,383
-Would you like to have a look?
-Yes.

489
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,041
Why is it locked?

490
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:17,346
Occupied.

491
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,450
Excuse me, who's in there?

492
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:22,315
Do I have to tell you that?

493
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:23,854
What are you doing in there?

494
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:26,298
Wait just a moment. I'm almost done.

495
00:24:26,403 --> 00:24:27,816
Done? Done with what?

496
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,324
Are you stupid?

497
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,826
I'm in a toilet.
Obviously I'm taking a dump.

498
00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:33,194
You're doing what?

499
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:34,302
Are you crazy?

500
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,774
Get out now!

501
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,327
Get out!

502
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,961
-Get out right now!
-What?

503
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,996
I'm almost done. Wait till I get out!

504
00:24:42,085 --> 00:24:46,418
What the hell do you think you're doing?

505
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:47,723
I'm sorry.

506
00:24:47,812 --> 00:24:50,762
I thought it was a public toilet.
I was in a rush.

507
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,404
I don't care how rushed you were.
This is a new product!

508
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,511
How can you take a dump in it?!

509
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,455
What am I going to do?

510
00:24:58,668 --> 00:24:59,913
It's disgusting.

511
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:01,658
I can't sell this now.

512
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:04,202
I'm sorry. I'll take responsibility.

513
00:25:04,823 --> 00:25:05,836
Donggu?

514
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:09,057
Yuna.

515
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:10,937
Why are you here?

516
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:13,842
I bought some medicine for your stomach.

517
00:25:14,782 --> 00:25:18,183
Did you really poop in there?

518
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,541
-Well...
-It's unbelievable.

519
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:23,489
He took a huge dump.

520
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:37,750
Donggu.

521
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:40,422
That's too much.

522
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:43,705
Yeah.

523
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,120
Why did you buy this
when we have a perfectly good toilet.

524
00:25:46,226 --> 00:25:47,079
You're wrong.

525
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:51,075
I learned from today's incident
that we need more toilets.

526
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:52,866
Then put more toilets in the bathroom.

527
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:54,920
You didn't have to buy that thing.

528
00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:04,221
Oh no!

529
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:11,803
I'm sorry.

530
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:14,005
You need to be careful.

531
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,408
That's the only award
Donggu has ever received.

532
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:20,645
I'm sorry.

533
00:26:21,937 --> 00:26:22,914
It's okay.

534
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,911
You didn't break it on purpose.

535
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,450
People make mistakes.

536
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:30,118
-Don't worry about it.
-What the hell?

537
00:26:30,207 --> 00:26:31,718
You told her to pack her things before.

538
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:33,428
It was a shock treatment.

539
00:26:33,597 --> 00:26:35,887
It was my way to encourage her.

540
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:37,928
Yuna.

541
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:40,567
Let's forget about everything
that's happened so far.

542
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:42,734
Let's be friends.

543
00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:43,605
What?

544
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:44,629
Okay?

545
00:26:45,425 --> 00:26:46,846
Oh...okay.

546
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:54,379
But promise to take
what happened today to the grave.

547
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:57,048
Don't worry.

548
00:26:59,288 --> 00:27:00,218
Thank you.

549
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:09,458
Welcome...

550
00:27:12,906 --> 00:27:14,107
Hello.

551
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:24,744
It's fine.

552
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,862
I'll pick them up. Go and sit down.

553
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:28,847
Sorry.

554
00:27:32,787 --> 00:27:34,292
Sorry.

555
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:39,110
This is so embarrassing.

556
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,395
I better get a leading role
to avoid this humiliation.

557
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:51,102
Gene mutant?

558
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:44,197
Seojin.

559
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:46,199
Yuna...

560
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,313
How did it happen?

561
00:29:08,402 --> 00:29:10,588
I saw my dad and my brother shave
and it looked fun.

562
00:29:10,676 --> 00:29:11,783
So I copied them.

563
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:15,424
Then my mustache hair grew
thicker and thicker.

564
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,666
It's all right.
Just need to shave once in a while, right?

565
00:29:20,755 --> 00:29:22,056
Not once in a while.

566
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:25,230
If I don't shave again in the afternoon...

567
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,445
...I grow a full mustache.

568
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:30,187
Goodness...
Hey you brat.

569
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:32,838
Why did you to copy them shaving?

570
00:29:32,927 --> 00:29:35,240
I didn't know this would happen.

571
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:36,999
That's why your nickname is Chewbacca?

572
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,009
It's not only Chewbacca.

573
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,669
Big Foot, Zhang Fei, Im Kkeokjeong,
Jang Seungeop...

574
00:29:42,758 --> 00:29:45,250
-Anyone that's hairy...
-Stop it!

575
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,539
It's all right. It's just hair.

576
00:29:48,628 --> 00:29:50,940
-Don't worry.
-Thanks.

577
00:29:53,283 --> 00:29:54,340
Hello?

578
00:29:54,548 --> 00:29:55,698
Hi, Yujin. What's up?

579
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,296
What? Taehyeon is coming?

580
00:29:58,706 --> 00:30:00,632
Okay. I'll be right there.

581
00:30:00,954 --> 00:30:01,921
Taehyeon...

582
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:04,187
Is he the guy you've had a crush on
since first year of college?

583
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:06,351
-I don't have a crush on him.
-yeah, right.

584
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,186
You have time to date?
Aren't you busy with job hunting?

585
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:12,662
I'll take care of my business
and you take care of your own.

586
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:13,598
Whatever.

587
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,133
I have to get ready!

588
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,848
Look at her go.

589
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,848
What's the point?
She can't even tell him how she feels.

590
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:23,960
Seojin knows nothing about boys.

591
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:27,166
Are you qualified to do that?
You've never had a girlfriend.

592
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:29,151
Yuna?

593
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:30,532
Mr. Grumpy is here.

594
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,476
We're out of bread and eggs.
How did that happen?

595
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,499
Oh no!

596
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,322
I must've forgotten. Sorry.

597
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,327
How could you forget it?

598
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:41,786
I told you to buy them in advance
for customers' breakfast.

599
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:43,658
Sorry. I'll go out and buy them.

600
00:30:43,747 --> 00:30:44,580
Go now.

601
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:48,579
She can't do anything right.

602
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:50,080
Stop scolding her.

603
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:51,584
She's trying her best.

604
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:53,269
No, she's not.

605
00:30:53,358 --> 00:30:56,200
I'm certain she'll cause
a huge problem one day.

606
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,296
She'll get better in time.

607
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:00,191
Trust her and give her time.

608
00:31:01,898 --> 00:31:02,994
Why did you come back in?

609
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:04,637
I forgot my shopping trolley.

610
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:06,006
See you later.

611
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,940
See that? How can I trust her?

612
00:31:10,028 --> 00:31:11,670
She just forgot.

613
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,620
-What is it this time?
-I forgot my wallet.

614
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,476
See you later.

615
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,459
What?

616
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:26,908
What did you forget this time?

617
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,857
Where's the supermarket?

618
00:31:43,951 --> 00:31:47,410
We've been here several times.
How can you not know the way?

619
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:49,236
I'm sorry.

620
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,076
I have a bad sense of direction.

621
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:53,316
But now I definitely know the way.

622
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:57,457
You speaking with such certainty
is making me nervous.

623
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:02,089
I'm getting tired of nagging,
so please just do your job properly.

624
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:03,071
Okay?

625
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:04,666
I said...

626
00:32:08,715 --> 00:32:10,137
What are you doing over there?

627
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,330
These toys are on sale.

628
00:32:12,434 --> 00:32:15,538
I've never bought a toy for Seol.

629
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:19,023
But these are expensive
even when they're on sale.

630
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:21,681
-Let's just go.
-Wait.

631
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:23,471
Pick one.

632
00:32:23,987 --> 00:32:24,878
Really?

633
00:32:25,114 --> 00:32:26,677
Just one.

634
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:28,379
Thank you.

635
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,051
Thank you so much!

636
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:34,853
Is she shameless or naive?

637
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:40,358
Sorry.

638
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:41,604
It's all right.

639
00:32:41,857 --> 00:32:42,690
Sua.

640
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:44,839
Who is that?

641
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:46,288
Do you know him?

642
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,500
He's a friend.

643
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:50,827
Friend?

644
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,470
Min Sua.

645
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:54,167
Who is this guy?

646
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:55,740
Who is he?

647
00:32:57,121 --> 00:32:58,140
Hello.

648
00:32:58,229 --> 00:33:01,117
I'm Lee Yunseok. Sua's boyfriend.

649
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:02,356
Boyfriend?

650
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:07,385
I run a Thai restaurant nearby.

651
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:09,854
Drop by and I'll serve you a meal.

652
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:11,937
Donggu!

653
00:33:12,026 --> 00:33:14,243
I picked one. Buy this one for me.

654
00:33:14,552 --> 00:33:15,385
Who is she?

655
00:33:16,983 --> 00:33:17,816
What?

656
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:22,213
My girlfriend.

657
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:24,273
Girlfriend?

658
00:33:24,532 --> 00:33:25,978
You seeing someone else already?

659
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:27,903
You have a boyfriend,
so why can't I have a girlfriend?

660
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:30,733
Well, you can...

661
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,518
What does she do?

662
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:34,446
What?

663
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,082
"Doctor's bag".

664
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:40,037
She's a doctor. A neurosurgeon.

665
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,655
She always chooses toys like this
because she's a doctor.

666
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:46,865
Donggu, what's going...

667
00:33:46,953 --> 00:33:49,475
You are such a workaholic.

668
00:33:50,122 --> 00:33:52,239
Donggu, what are you doing?

669
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:54,299
Sua.

670
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:57,905
Shall we have some coffee with them?

671
00:33:58,346 --> 00:34:00,872
No, it's fine. We are not that close.

672
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,711
Still, he's your friend.

673
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,367
When you get off work tonight,
come to my restaurant for dinner.

674
00:34:06,456 --> 00:34:09,231
Oh, Dr. Han has a lot of work.

675
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:10,779
So, we're not sure
if we can make the time.

676
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:12,535
But we'll be there if we can.

677
00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:13,785
Let's go, Yuna.

678
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:16,388
-Excuse us.
-Sure.

679
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,656
Beep, beep, honk, honk.

680
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,297
Donggu, what just happened?

681
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:24,119
-Be quiet.
-Okay.

682
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:27,777
-That's Sua? She's really pretty.
-Be quiet.

683
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,715
-Please be quiet.
-Okay.

684
00:34:30,555 --> 00:34:33,815
-Are you going to buy this for me?
-Yes, I'll buy you everything.

685
00:34:33,904 --> 00:34:36,123
So, please be quiet.

686
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:41,671
What?

687
00:34:41,966 --> 00:34:44,182
Sua already has a new boyfriend?

688
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:46,564
What does he do?

689
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:49,354
I don't know. He runs a Thai restaurant.

690
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:52,435
He asked us to come to his restaurant.

691
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,825
He's an arrogant jerk.

692
00:34:54,568 --> 00:34:57,250
But why did you tell them
Yuna was your girlfriend?

693
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:59,034
On top of that she's a doctor?

694
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:01,601
Seeing Sua with another guy made me angry.

695
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:03,520
-It just came out.
-Jeez...

696
00:35:03,608 --> 00:35:05,719
So, it's completely over with Sua, huh?

697
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:06,871
It's over.

698
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:08,876
No, it's not.

699
00:35:09,264 --> 00:35:10,749
This could be a chance.

700
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:12,048
Your last chance.

701
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:13,743
A chance? What are you talking about?

702
00:35:13,832 --> 00:35:17,766
I guarantee that you'll get a call
from Sua very soon.

703
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:20,018
No way...

704
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,743
What?

705
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:23,842
You're right.

706
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:26,624
See?
What did I tell you?

707
00:35:26,748 --> 00:35:28,509
What tone is this text in?

708
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:32,313
"It was great seeing you.
Your girlfriend is pretty."

709
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:34,564
No, that's not it!

710
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,900
"It was great seeing you."

711
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:37,389
"Your girlfriend is pretty."

712
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:39,017
This is the tone.

713
00:35:39,106 --> 00:35:40,754
Do, re, mi, fa, sol. It's in sol.

714
00:35:40,843 --> 00:35:43,134
The tone that says
she's absolutely bothered by this.

715
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:44,842
No way.

716
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,283
You amateurs...

717
00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:49,211
-Kang Donggu.
-Yeah?

718
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:50,169
Yeah, you.

719
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:55,125
She dumped you because you're incompetent
and super immature.

720
00:35:55,315 --> 00:36:00,096
But then she finds out that beautiful
and successful Yuna is your girlfriend.

721
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:01,529
How do you think Sua feels?

722
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,407
-"Poor girl"?
-No!

723
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:06,702
Sua is very confused right now.

724
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,697
She has a lot in my mind.

725
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:10,493
"But why? Why?"

726
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:12,151
"Why would a woman like her
go out with Donggu?"

727
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,511
"Maybe Donggu was a great guy after all."

728
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,391
"Maybe Donggu has something special
that I didn't know of."

729
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,237
It's eating her up.

730
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:21,026
She's wondering why.

731
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:22,552
Oh, that sounds plausible.

732
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,791
-And?
-So?

733
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:26,447
So, if you seize this chance,

734
00:36:26,536 --> 00:36:29,619
you could get back together with Sua.

735
00:36:29,707 --> 00:36:30,540
Really?

736
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:32,752
Then, Jungi, what should I do?

737
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,058
It's obvious.

738
00:36:34,365 --> 00:36:35,973
That guy invited you
to his restaurant, right?

739
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:37,467
Go.

740
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:39,894
With Yuna. As a sweet couple.

741
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:41,574
And then?

742
00:36:41,728 --> 00:36:44,498
Show her how great you are.

743
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:46,411
Make her regret dumping you.

744
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,443
-How?
-That's Yuna...

745
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:51,702
...Dr. Han's job.

746
00:36:53,093 --> 00:36:55,171
What? What am I supposed to do?

747
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:57,988
Yuna. Could you help me out?

748
00:36:58,056 --> 00:36:59,755
-Please?
-I want to help...

749
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,030
...but I don't know if I can do it.

750
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,330
Come on!

751
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:05,925
If you help me out, I'll forget
about everything that's happened.

752
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:08,304
So, please help me.

753
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,386
Okay...

754
00:37:11,474 --> 00:37:13,231
Thank you, Yuna.

755
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:15,167
What should we do now?

756
00:37:15,256 --> 00:37:16,367
Dr. Han.

757
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,570
Let's give her a makeover.

758
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,889
Let's make her look elegant and gorgeous.

759
00:37:33,873 --> 00:37:35,738
Gosh, my bag...

760
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,792
What are you doing at school?

761
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,563
I, actually...

762
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:45,512
I came for the job center,
so I might as well meet you guys.

763
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,797
What time is...Taehyeon coming?

764
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:51,143
You came to see him, huh?

765
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:53,210
No, I came to see you guys.

766
00:37:53,298 --> 00:37:54,579
I don't believe you.

767
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:56,504
Taehyeon called earlier.

768
00:37:56,592 --> 00:37:58,377
The interview is taking longer,
so he'll be late.

769
00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:00,284
I have to go.

770
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:03,507
Okay. I'm going to leave soon!

771
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:04,849
I'm really going to leave soon!

772
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:22,943
You look pretty good.

773
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:25,136
Normally, you look like a beggar.

774
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,280
It's only because I don't dress up.

775
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:29,605
But when I do, I look as good as Gong Yoo.

776
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:31,489
Gong Yoo, my ass.

777
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:32,616
You're not that handsome.

778
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:33,961
Can I really trust you?

779
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:36,933
Just do as I say and it'll all work out.

780
00:38:37,021 --> 00:38:39,231
Your plan never works out.

781
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,770
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.

782
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,331
Trust me!

783
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,477
You only have bad qualities
but the worst one is not trusting people.

784
00:38:45,565 --> 00:38:46,398
Shut up.

785
00:38:46,486 --> 00:38:48,059
Why is Yuna taking so long?

786
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:13,400
How do I look?

787
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:16,445
I haven't put makeup on in a long time,
so it felt awkward.

788
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:17,920
Does it look bad?

789
00:39:19,521 --> 00:39:20,505
No.

790
00:39:21,188 --> 00:39:22,021
You look pretty.

791
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:23,224
Really pretty.

792
00:39:23,546 --> 00:39:24,379
Right?

793
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:26,422
Yeah.

794
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,562
She looks like a different person.

795
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:31,936
-Right, Donggu?
-Huh?

796
00:39:32,644 --> 00:39:33,477
Yeah.

797
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:36,166
You don't look that bad.

798
00:39:36,338 --> 00:39:37,775
Let's go. It's time.

799
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:38,814
Okay.

800
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:41,616
I don't know if I should leave Seol here.

801
00:39:41,705 --> 00:39:43,325
Don't worry.

802
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,550
-We'll take good care of her.
-Thanks.

803
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:47,365
See you later then.

804
00:39:49,027 --> 00:39:51,158
Hope you succeed, Donggu!

805
00:39:51,895 --> 00:39:52,985
Seol, wish them luck.

806
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:55,049
Good luck, Mommy!

807
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:58,453
That's an odd way to wish them luck.

808
00:39:58,783 --> 00:39:59,799
Good girl.

809
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:01,436
Hold her.

810
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:03,018
I'm going to wish them luck.

811
00:40:03,106 --> 00:40:05,018
What? Jungi!

812
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,950
"Hanguk University Times"

813
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:18,545
Why is it so empty here?

814
00:40:22,566 --> 00:40:23,413
Seojin.

815
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,557
-Kang Seojin!
-Yes? What?

816
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:31,588
Taehyeon...

817
00:40:31,742 --> 00:40:32,951
Long time no see.

818
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:36,384
Yes, it's great seeing you.

819
00:40:36,473 --> 00:40:38,131
My work finished too late.

820
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:40,177
I though everyone had left.

821
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:42,387
Thank you for waiting for me.

822
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:44,691
I wasn't... I wasn't waiting for you.

823
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:47,107
I didn't even know you were coming.
That's the truth!

824
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,901
Okay. I got it.

825
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:49,938
Calm down.

826
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:52,749
Oh, we renovated the archives room.

827
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:54,085
Would you like to see?

828
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:06,242
Wow, it's so clean.

829
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,001
We used to have spiders and mice in here.

830
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:12,313
It was like a haunted house.

831
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:17,230
-This is still here?
-What is it?

832
00:41:17,348 --> 00:41:18,379
This.

833
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:19,679
Look.

834
00:41:20,217 --> 00:41:22,646
The very first article
by Reporter Kang Seojin.

835
00:41:24,437 --> 00:41:26,325
How's the job hunting going?

836
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:28,992
I'm working hard on it.

837
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:30,492
Come to our newspaper company.

838
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:31,718
It'd be fun to work together.

839
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:33,558
I did apply at your company.

840
00:41:34,114 --> 00:41:35,337
But I failed the interview.

841
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,184
It's all right.

842
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:39,442
I failed twice before I got the job.

843
00:41:39,577 --> 00:41:41,237
You'll get the job next time.

844
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:42,246
Cheer up.

845
00:41:57,294 --> 00:41:58,838
I'm hungry. Shall we go eat?

846
00:41:58,926 --> 00:42:00,118
R-Really?

847
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:02,908
Let's get something delicious.

848
00:42:04,914 --> 00:42:07,221
-Huh?
-Is it stuck?

849
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:10,457
Oh no.

850
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,030
Why isn't it opening?

851
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,676
Give me your phone.

852
00:42:16,512 --> 00:42:18,447
I left it in the other room.

853
00:42:18,952 --> 00:42:20,505
I left mine in my bag.

854
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,809
-What do we do now?
-The door won't open.

855
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,275
"Thai Beast"

856
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:33,605
Yuna, let's practice one last time.

857
00:42:33,694 --> 00:42:36,316
-What's your job?
-The best neurosurgeon in Korea.

858
00:42:36,404 --> 00:42:37,263
Your parents' jobs?

859
00:42:37,351 --> 00:42:38,796
My father is the director of a hospital
and my mother is a painter.

860
00:42:38,885 --> 00:42:40,020
Where did we first meet?

861
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:42,296
At the third table
inside the hospital cafeteria.

862
00:42:42,384 --> 00:42:43,673
Okay. Are you ready?

863
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,696
Yes. I'll do my best.

864
00:42:46,418 --> 00:42:48,200
Good. Let's go.

865
00:43:02,802 --> 00:43:04,517
I didn't think
you were really going to come.

866
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:05,896
-I'm surprised.
-Yes.

867
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,647
Dr. Han got off work early.

868
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:09,827
So we thought we'd drop by.

869
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:14,105
I thought it'd be bigger than this.

870
00:43:14,907 --> 00:43:15,822
It's quite small.

871
00:43:16,366 --> 00:43:17,199
Is it?

872
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,923
But I guarantee the food will taste great.

873
00:43:20,456 --> 00:43:22,858
-Let's order first.
-Oh...

874
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:24,101
We'll leave it to you.

875
00:43:26,425 --> 00:43:27,258
Waiter.

876
00:43:27,785 --> 00:43:29,256
Take our order please.

877
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:30,504
Let's go with...

878
00:43:38,144 --> 00:43:40,261
One of each, and...

879
00:43:44,557 --> 00:43:45,524
That's all.

880
00:43:45,613 --> 00:43:46,657
Yes, sir.

881
00:43:47,985 --> 00:43:50,964
Those dishes sounded like
Muay Thai boxer names.

882
00:43:51,053 --> 00:43:53,385
Very aggressive.

883
00:43:53,988 --> 00:43:55,189
What would you like to drink?

884
00:43:55,278 --> 00:43:57,750
I'm fine. I'm breastfeeding...

885
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,160
What? Breastfeeding?

886
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,222
No, actually, I mean...

887
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:07,068
She meant to say surgery,
not breast feeding.

888
00:44:07,157 --> 00:44:09,757
Dr. Han has an important surgery
tomorrow morning.

889
00:44:10,394 --> 00:44:11,516
Oh, surgery...

890
00:44:14,096 --> 00:44:16,067
-What kind of surgery?
-What?

891
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:18,074
Well... It's...

892
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:20,346
It's a...

893
00:44:20,688 --> 00:44:22,831
Duodenum... surgery?

894
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:23,907
What?

895
00:44:25,212 --> 00:44:28,084
Do neurosurgeons do duodenum surgery?

896
00:44:28,477 --> 00:44:29,310
Well...

897
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:30,883
Well...

898
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:35,406
She is a neurosurgeon...

899
00:44:35,517 --> 00:44:37,465
...but she specializes in multiple areas.

900
00:44:37,554 --> 00:44:39,455
Neurosurgery, internal medicine,
and gynecology.

901
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:41,213
She's got all sorts of specializations.

902
00:44:42,507 --> 00:44:44,685
But why would a woman like Yuna
go out with you?

903
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,455
Donggu might appear as an ordinary guy
to other people.

904
00:44:52,747 --> 00:44:54,531
They're not seeing the real him.

905
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,238
But I saw it.

906
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:58,829
Donggu has amazing potential.

907
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:01,917
No, I don't...

908
00:45:02,309 --> 00:45:04,309
No, I'm certain of it.

909
00:45:04,398 --> 00:45:08,275
You will become the greatest film director
in the world.

910
00:45:08,933 --> 00:45:11,347
My intuition is always right.

911
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:12,916
You can trust me.

912
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,372
I can't stop her.

913
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:19,828
But...

914
00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:23,237
He still hasn't opened his heart to me...

915
00:45:24,004 --> 00:45:25,317
...which is agonizing.

916
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:27,958
I told you.

917
00:45:28,405 --> 00:45:30,612
My wound hasn't healed yet.

918
00:45:30,883 --> 00:45:32,275
It's okay.

919
00:45:32,364 --> 00:45:36,424
I'm just happy to be by your side.

920
00:45:39,185 --> 00:45:40,271
I'm sorry.

921
00:45:40,941 --> 00:45:42,687
I don't deserve you.

922
00:45:52,162 --> 00:45:53,651
We're locked in.

923
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:57,588
We'll have to wait for someone
to open the door tomorrow.

924
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,558
But it's not that bad...

925
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:03,673
...being in here with you.

926
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:07,088
What do you mean...?

927
00:46:07,986 --> 00:46:09,092
Seojin.

928
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:12,102
I...have something...

929
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:14,282
...I want to say to you.

930
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,583
What is it?

931
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:22,112
Actually, for a long time...

932
00:46:25,423 --> 00:46:26,256
...I've...

933
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:30,751
Keep going.

934
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,074
What is it?

935
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:34,056
Seojin...

936
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:36,843
On your lip...

937
00:46:36,932 --> 00:46:39,089
What?
Do I have something there?

938
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:41,092
One moment.

939
00:46:46,623 --> 00:46:47,456
Darn it.

940
00:46:47,616 --> 00:46:49,824
Mustache is growing.

941
00:46:49,913 --> 00:46:51,676
The razor is in my bag. What do I do?

942
00:46:53,404 --> 00:46:54,663
Is everything all right?

943
00:46:57,571 --> 00:46:59,048
It's nothing.

944
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:00,478
Seems like I got dust on it.

945
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,689
I see.

946
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:05,112
So, what I wanted to tell you was...

947
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:06,081
Don't come closer.

948
00:47:06,169 --> 00:47:07,681
-Don't come closer.
-What's wrong?

949
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:09,903
I said don't come closer.

950
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,462
I have to get out of here.

951
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:15,012
If he sees my mustache, it's over.

952
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:20,633
Help! We're locked in here!

953
00:47:20,722 --> 00:47:21,611
Help us!

954
00:47:21,718 --> 00:47:22,851
Help us!

955
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,021
Help us!

956
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,740
Seojin, what's wrong?

957
00:47:25,828 --> 00:47:27,477
Don't come closer.

958
00:47:28,943 --> 00:47:30,066
Help!

959
00:47:30,355 --> 00:47:31,852
Hello! Anyone there?

960
00:47:31,941 --> 00:47:33,723
We're locked in here!

961
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:35,755
-Kang Seojin, calm down!
-Help!

962
00:47:36,016 --> 00:47:37,788
Help me!

963
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:42,230
Hope you liked the food.

964
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,206
Well... it was not bad.

965
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:47,968
It wasn't as good as
the traditional dishes we had in Thailand.

966
00:47:48,258 --> 00:47:49,210
Is that so?

967
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:52,003
It'd been nicer if you could stay
for one more drink.

968
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:53,700
I'd like to.

969
00:47:54,078 --> 00:47:57,608
But Dr. Han has surgery in the morning.
So we can't stay.

970
00:47:57,956 --> 00:47:59,401
We'll buy you dinner next time.

971
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:01,211
-Take care.
-Okay.

972
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:02,184
That sounds good.

973
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,985
It was great meeting you, Yuna.

974
00:48:05,073 --> 00:48:06,213
Same here.

975
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:08,384
-Let's go, Donggu.
-Sure.

976
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,623
Yuna, come closer.

977
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,633
Like this?

978
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:16,103
Donggu, did I do well?

979
00:48:16,192 --> 00:48:18,632
You did well. You're a great actress.

980
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:19,863
You were incredible.

981
00:48:19,952 --> 00:48:21,051
Thanks.

982
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:26,770
Why is my mom...with your...father...?

983
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:29,494
No way...

984
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,586
-No way...
-No way.

985
00:48:31,674 --> 00:48:33,010
It can't be true.

986
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:35,781
You're...my father's...

987
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,727
...daughter?

988
00:48:36,816 --> 00:48:37,649
Daughter?!

989
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,664
-Sorry.
-Oh my god.

990
00:48:39,907 --> 00:48:41,688
You're my step sister?

991
00:48:41,777 --> 00:48:43,717
-She's his sister.
-Sister?

992
00:48:43,935 --> 00:48:44,946
It can't be true!

993
00:48:45,086 --> 00:48:45,946
It can't be true!

994
00:48:46,035 --> 00:48:47,483
What is she doing?

995
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:48,841
What? What?

996
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:50,761
Of course it's true.

997
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:54,237
-"Of course it's true."
-Anything is possible in this world.

998
00:48:54,353 --> 00:48:56,100
People always want to hide...

999
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:59,302
...their dirty ugly desires.

1000
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,124
Honey, what are you talking about?

1001
00:49:01,213 --> 00:49:02,385
30 years ago...

1002
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:06,463
-...you abandoned Yoo Geumran, remember?
-I know Yoo Geumran.

1003
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:07,915
How do you know her?

1004
00:49:08,003 --> 00:49:09,142
I'm...

1005
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:11,328
...her daughter.

1006
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:12,921
What...did you say?

1007
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:13,843
What?

1008
00:49:14,937 --> 00:49:16,383
You're also my daughter?

1009
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:17,549
Daughter?!

1010
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:19,016
-Two daughters!
-Unbelievable.

1011
00:49:19,105 --> 00:49:22,659
I swore I'd take revenge on you.

1012
00:49:23,615 --> 00:49:24,934
What did you say?

1013
00:49:25,378 --> 00:49:26,190
You're a devil.

1014
00:49:26,278 --> 00:49:28,337
-Devil.
-D-Devil...

1015
00:49:28,426 --> 00:49:29,781
You're a devil!

1016
00:49:36,175 --> 00:49:37,448
Bravo!

1017
00:49:37,537 --> 00:49:39,721
Bravo! Bravo!

1018
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:44,257
Wow, I can't help but applaud
that writer's imagination.

1019
00:49:44,345 --> 00:49:47,214
I never imagined his wife
was his another daughter.

1020
00:49:47,302 --> 00:49:48,417
Me neither.

1021
00:49:48,732 --> 00:49:50,774
How are we going to wait till tomorrow?

1022
00:49:50,932 --> 00:49:53,196
I'm dying of curiosity right now.

1023
00:49:53,718 --> 00:49:54,551
What are you doing?

1024
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:56,733
-You're back.
-Hey.

1025
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:58,766
How did it go?

1026
00:49:58,854 --> 00:50:00,664
It was a bit rocky in the beginning.

1027
00:50:00,752 --> 00:50:02,968
But Yuna did a great job.

1028
00:50:03,057 --> 00:50:05,173
-Yeah?
-Well done, Yuna.

1029
00:50:05,262 --> 00:50:06,979
I just tried my best.

1030
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:10,020
It'll work out like you said, right?

1031
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:11,433
Of course.

1032
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:14,421
I bet Sua has hundreds of things
in her head.

1033
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:15,945
"Why did I dump this great guy?"

1034
00:50:16,034 --> 00:50:17,407
"Did I make a mistake?"

1035
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:18,331
Like this.

1036
00:50:18,608 --> 00:50:21,552
I really hope it works out like you said.

1037
00:50:21,975 --> 00:50:24,053
Thanks for taking care of Seol.

1038
00:50:24,184 --> 00:50:26,588
It was fine. She just threw up five times,
and pooped seven times...

1039
00:50:26,676 --> 00:50:28,983
Also, she peed about nine times.

1040
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:31,056
Oh, she's doing something again.

1041
00:50:31,145 --> 00:50:32,157
I'll take her.

1042
00:50:32,245 --> 00:50:33,985
-I'll take care of her.
-You should've asked sooner.

1043
00:50:34,086 --> 00:50:35,567
Seol!

1044
00:50:35,655 --> 00:50:36,544
Ouch, my arms.

1045
00:50:36,632 --> 00:50:38,602
-I'm hungry. I'm getting something to eat.
-Go ahead.

1046
00:50:39,064 --> 00:50:40,677
-I'm going to play a game.
-Go on.

1047
00:50:40,766 --> 00:50:43,536
Seol, you've been giving
the uncles hard time.

1048
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,662
Seol, did you miss Mommy?

1049
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:48,182
I missed you too.

1050
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,024
-Good girl.
-"Mommy"?

1051
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:51,982
What does that mean?

1052
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,431
Sua. How come you're here?

1053
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:58,288
Yuna forgot her bag.

1054
00:50:59,662 --> 00:51:00,925
I did?

1055
00:51:01,364 --> 00:51:02,371
Thank you.

1056
00:51:02,753 --> 00:51:04,707
She's a mom?

1057
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:06,402
You guys had a baby?

1058
00:51:06,723 --> 00:51:07,870
Since when...

1059
00:51:08,728 --> 00:51:11,135
Were you seeing her
when we were going out?

1060
00:51:11,223 --> 00:51:12,174
Of course not.

1061
00:51:12,263 --> 00:51:14,116
I didn't do such a heinous thing.

1062
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:17,141
-Then what happened?
-Well... Actually...

1063
00:51:17,598 --> 00:51:19,629
Yuna loves babies.

1064
00:51:19,717 --> 00:51:21,914
So, she calls herself mommy
in front of babies. It's a habit.

1065
00:51:22,003 --> 00:51:22,814
Right, Yuna?

1066
00:51:22,902 --> 00:51:25,834
That's right.
I don't have a baby at my age.

1067
00:51:25,923 --> 00:51:28,196
-So pretty.
-Then whose baby is that?

1068
00:51:28,776 --> 00:51:29,609
Wait.

1069
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,217
Actually...

1070
00:51:31,687 --> 00:51:34,269
-Is that the baby some guest abandoned?
-Huh?

1071
00:51:34,702 --> 00:51:36,048
Oh, actually...

1072
00:51:37,185 --> 00:51:39,633
-We decided to raise her.
-Why?

1073
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:41,832
Why are you raising someone else's baby?

1074
00:51:44,343 --> 00:51:45,370
Actually...

1075
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:48,426
She's Jungi's.

1076
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:53,910
What? She's Jungi's baby?

1077
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:58,335
Then his girlfriend left their baby here?

1078
00:51:58,424 --> 00:52:00,235
Yeah, you know how he lives recklessly.

1079
00:52:00,323 --> 00:52:01,642
The universe is punishing him.

1080
00:52:02,255 --> 00:52:03,313
Is it true, Jungi?

1081
00:52:10,197 --> 00:52:11,009
Yeah.

1082
00:52:11,097 --> 00:52:13,229
You know that I live recklessly.

1083
00:52:13,317 --> 00:52:16,066
Yeah, you're more than capable of that.

1084
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,653
Thanks for bringing her bag.

1085
00:52:18,742 --> 00:52:19,869
It's late. You should get going.

1086
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:21,289
Thanks for the bag.

1087
00:52:21,734 --> 00:52:23,674
We can't just leave.

1088
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,849
Give us a tour of the guesthouse.

1089
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:26,977
Let's have some beer too.

1090
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,920
Sure, sure.

1091
00:52:29,008 --> 00:52:31,558
Yuna, take them to the third floor.

1092
00:52:31,646 --> 00:52:33,610
I'll bring the beers.

1093
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:34,906
Okay.

1094
00:52:34,995 --> 00:52:36,663
Seol, go to Daddy.

1095
00:52:36,752 --> 00:52:37,888
There's your daddy.

1096
00:52:37,977 --> 00:52:40,407
Daddy! Daddy.

1097
00:52:40,496 --> 00:52:41,855
Daddy...

1098
00:52:42,682 --> 00:52:44,781
Oh, you're my daughter!

1099
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:45,938
What a surprise, huh?

1100
00:52:46,026 --> 00:52:47,058
This way.

1101
00:52:47,882 --> 00:52:50,868
Go upstairs. I'll bring the beers.

1102
00:52:53,202 --> 00:52:54,738
What are you doing? Are you insane?

1103
00:52:54,827 --> 00:52:56,873
I was cornered. It just came out.

1104
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:00,744
Fine.

1105
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:02,709
We'll ignore that.

1106
00:53:02,974 --> 00:53:04,674
Don't mind the guy who lives recklessly.

1107
00:53:04,979 --> 00:53:05,812
Go upstairs.

1108
00:53:05,918 --> 00:53:07,445
-Sorry.
-Don't touch me.

1109
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:08,366
Sorry.

1110
00:53:15,837 --> 00:53:16,670
Daughter?

1111
00:53:30,661 --> 00:53:32,612
Oh no, it's growing thicker.

1112
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,954
If he sees this mustache,
it's over between us.

1113
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:36,413
What am I going to do?

1114
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,352
I'm sleepy.

1115
00:53:43,269 --> 00:53:45,061
I'm so sleepy.

1116
00:53:46,944 --> 00:53:48,027
No.

1117
00:53:48,815 --> 00:53:49,892
I can't fall asleep.

1118
00:53:50,288 --> 00:53:51,862
Don't fall asleep.

1119
00:54:01,173 --> 00:54:02,806
I must've dozed off.

1120
00:54:16,185 --> 00:54:17,271
What?

1121
00:54:17,846 --> 00:54:18,692
What are you doing?

1122
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,973
No, I thought you might be cold, so...

1123
00:54:22,061 --> 00:54:23,381
Stay away from me!

1124
00:54:26,248 --> 00:54:27,081
Taehyeon.

1125
00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:28,318
Taehyeon!

1126
00:54:28,406 --> 00:54:29,694
Wake up.

1127
00:54:29,782 --> 00:54:32,286
Taehyeon, I'm sorry!

1128
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:34,171
Please open your eyes.

1129
00:54:35,183 --> 00:54:36,306
Are you okay?

1130
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:37,820
Can you hear me?

1131
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:39,276
My head...

1132
00:54:40,034 --> 00:54:40,989
My head hurts.

1133
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:49,518
Seojin...!

1134
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:51,474
A musta...

1135
00:54:56,204 --> 00:54:59,293
I'm so sorry!

1136
00:55:00,442 --> 00:55:02,766
I'm sorry.

1137
00:55:07,452 --> 00:55:10,225
The guest house is nice. It's very cozy.

1138
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:15,923
Dr. Han wants me to close it down
and focus on making movies.

1139
00:55:16,033 --> 00:55:18,315
But I don't like that idea.

1140
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:23,687
I want to succeed without her help.

1141
00:55:24,077 --> 00:55:25,612
Oh, I see.

1142
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:26,905
Yuna, I'm sorry.

1143
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:29,793
I'm too selfish.

1144
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:31,413
Don't be sorry.

1145
00:55:35,605 --> 00:55:37,394
Emergency!
Seol is hungry and crying really hard.

1146
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:39,447
I urgently request that you come down now.

1147
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,874
Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.

1148
00:55:47,534 --> 00:55:48,367
All right.

1149
00:55:49,256 --> 00:55:50,980
I propose a toast to your dream.

1150
00:55:51,069 --> 00:55:51,974
Yes.

1151
00:55:53,868 --> 00:55:55,185
We're out of beer.

1152
00:55:55,274 --> 00:55:57,567
I'll bring some more
and stop by the bathroom.

1153
00:56:12,138 --> 00:56:13,555
Are you hungry?

1154
00:56:13,644 --> 00:56:16,064
You want some milk?

1155
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:17,507
My gosh.

1156
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:19,266
My baby.

1157
00:56:19,437 --> 00:56:21,559
Good girl. Good girl.

1158
00:56:21,991 --> 00:56:22,824
Good girl.

1159
00:56:23,142 --> 00:56:24,848
Here you go. Good girl.

1160
00:56:28,455 --> 00:56:29,324
Jungi...

1161
00:56:30,814 --> 00:56:31,777
Yuna.

1162
00:56:32,815 --> 00:56:33,754
What...

1163
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:36,459
...are you doing?!

1164
00:56:37,575 --> 00:56:38,387
Sua.

1165
00:56:38,476 --> 00:56:40,359
Why are you...

1166
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:44,581
...breastfeeding Jungi's baby?

1167
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,991
No, it's not what it looks like.

1168
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,259
Yuna, I got diapers!
Sua, you're here...

1169
00:56:50,347 --> 00:56:51,180
Sua...

1170
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:52,264
Jungi.

1171
00:56:52,366 --> 00:56:54,544
Why is Yuna breastfeeding your baby?

1172
00:56:55,966 --> 00:56:57,486
So, actually...

1173
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:02,604
I asked her to breastfeed her
because it's good for her immune system.

1174
00:57:02,706 --> 00:57:05,589
What? You asked Donggu's girlfriend
to breastfeed her?

1175
00:57:05,704 --> 00:57:06,537
Wait.

1176
00:57:06,865 --> 00:57:08,529
How can she be lactating
when she's never had a baby?

1177
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:10,869
Yeah, she's never had a baby.

1178
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:15,383
But whenever she feels good,
she can squeeze...

1179
00:57:15,471 --> 00:57:16,304
Stop talking nonsense!

1180
00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:18,430
Yuna, tell me the truth.

1181
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,632
What is going on?

1182
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,105
Well... The thing is...

1183
00:57:22,785 --> 00:57:23,858
The truth is...

1184
00:57:24,025 --> 00:57:25,394
...Seol is my daughter.

1185
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,355
What? She's your daughter?

1186
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:28,495
You said she was yours.

1187
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:30,417
Yes, she was... I mean she is.

1188
00:57:30,505 --> 00:57:32,825
-My daughter...
-You said your ex left her here.

1189
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:34,563
Then how can she be Yuna's daughter?

1190
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:36,715
Are you saying Yuna is your ex-girlfriend?

1191
00:57:36,803 --> 00:57:37,854
It doesn't make any sense!

1192
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:45,795
Of course it's true.

1193
00:57:46,756 --> 00:57:48,808
Anything can be possible in this world.

1194
00:57:49,097 --> 00:57:51,730
People always want to hide
their dirty ugly desires.

1195
00:57:51,942 --> 00:57:53,731
What are you talking about?

1196
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:56,570
Then, Yuna is your ex-girlfriend?

1197
00:57:56,659 --> 00:57:59,109
And you guys are the baby's parents?

1198
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,842
I wanted to keep that a secret.

1199
00:58:02,315 --> 00:58:03,756
Donggu doesn't know this?

1200
00:58:03,844 --> 00:58:05,889
I tried to tell him to truth at first.

1201
00:58:05,978 --> 00:58:07,970
But he was heart broken
after you guys broke up.

1202
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,753
So, I couldn't tell him.

1203
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:12,446
Yuna, is this true?

1204
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:14,470
No, actually...

1205
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:15,827
Shut up, Han Yuna!

1206
00:58:15,961 --> 00:58:17,961
You have no right to say anything!

1207
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:21,920
Sua, this woman does anything
to get what she wants.

1208
00:58:22,009 --> 00:58:24,970
You're the only one who can rescue Donggu
from this evil woman.

1209
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:28,038
Please, get back with Donggu.

1210
00:58:31,947 --> 00:58:32,780
Please...

1211
00:58:34,589 --> 00:58:35,608
-Jungi.
-Huh?

1212
00:58:35,697 --> 00:58:37,261
-You planned this with Donggu, didn't you?
-No.

1213
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:39,362
You know what happens
when you get caught lying, right?

1214
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:41,718
Look me in the eye and tell me.

1215
00:58:41,842 --> 00:58:43,353
You two planned this together, didn't you?

1216
00:58:43,693 --> 00:58:45,388
I...don't think so.

1217
00:58:45,708 --> 00:58:47,294
You're still lying?!

1218
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,327
-Tell me the truth!
-Okay, I'll tell you.

1219
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:51,339
-I'll tell you! I'll tell you!
-What's the truth?

1220
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:55,379
Small droplets gathered
to make a huge river...

1221
00:58:55,467 --> 00:58:57,024
-What are you talking about?
-Wait...

1222
00:58:57,113 --> 00:59:01,884
I can't forget the night sky we watched
in her summer house in Malibu.

1223
00:59:02,054 --> 00:59:03,379
It was as if...

1224
00:59:03,984 --> 00:59:06,510
...someone had sprinkled
gold dust across the sky.

1225
00:59:08,196 --> 00:59:10,909
You and Sua should come with us some day.

1226
00:59:10,998 --> 00:59:12,721
I'd love that.

1227
00:59:14,857 --> 00:59:16,018
Hey, you're back.

1228
00:59:16,249 --> 00:59:19,058
Sua, I just told Yunseok,

1229
00:59:19,146 --> 00:59:21,800
that you guys should visit
our summerhouse in Malibu someday.

1230
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:23,049
Is that cool with you?

1231
00:59:24,888 --> 00:59:26,527
Why are you looking at me like that?

1232
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,229
Is there something on my face?

1233
00:59:28,562 --> 00:59:30,054
No, it's on the back of your head.

1234
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,284
I'll get it off for you.

1235
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:42,381
Sua.

1236
00:59:42,529 --> 00:59:43,847
Sua. Sua!

1237
00:59:43,936 --> 00:59:45,665
I'm so sorry.

1238
00:59:45,754 --> 00:59:48,084
Let go of me or I'll hit you again.

1239
00:59:48,256 --> 00:59:49,561
Wait, Sua.

1240
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,512
I was desperate.

1241
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:54,656
I really love you.
I don't want to break up.

1242
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:55,671
Really?

1243
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:56,990
But you know what?

1244
00:59:57,085 --> 00:59:59,829
Even the tiniest sliver of affection
I had for you is completely gone.

1245
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:02,870
I never want to see you again.

1246
01:00:02,995 --> 01:00:05,301
Don't ever show your face to me again.

1247
01:00:07,116 --> 01:00:08,546
Sua... Sua!

1248
01:00:10,409 --> 01:00:11,242
Sua!

1249
01:00:30,528 --> 01:00:32,916
Donggu, stop drinking.

1250
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:35,982
Stop. You've had enough.

1251
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:37,373
Leave me alone!

1252
01:00:37,462 --> 01:00:40,904
I'm going to drink until I die!
Don't stop me!

1253
01:00:41,284 --> 01:00:43,909
Your plans always end up badly.

1254
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:46,242
I didn't know it'd end up like this.

1255
01:00:46,989 --> 01:00:48,123
This is bad...

1256
01:01:03,549 --> 01:01:06,724
You siblings sure know
how to put on a show.

1257
01:01:09,892 --> 01:01:10,873
Be quiet!

1258
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:12,723
Taehyeon...

1259
01:01:12,811 --> 01:01:14,766
Sua!

1260
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:17,830
I'm tired.

1261
01:01:17,918 --> 01:01:19,576
Taehyeon...

1262
01:01:19,664 --> 01:01:21,824
Sua!

1263
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,547
Come down from there.

1264
01:01:24,636 --> 01:01:25,918
You're so annoying.

1265
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,395
Sua!

1266
01:01:33,145 --> 01:01:35,125
Stop drinking. Stop it.

1267
01:01:36,909 --> 01:01:39,863
Leave me alone! Don't stop me!

1268
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:56,780
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1269
01:01:56,869 --> 01:01:58,647
How long are you going to be like this?

1270
01:01:58,736 --> 01:02:00,428
You forget a woman with a woman.

1271
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:02,057
You'll meet a good person.

1272
01:02:02,145 --> 01:02:02,879
Cheer up.

1273
01:02:02,968 --> 01:02:03,776
Kim Heeja?

1274
01:02:03,865 --> 01:02:06,093
The best method actor in Korea?
That Kim Heeja?

1275
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:08,057
I'll do anything!

1276
01:02:08,146 --> 01:02:09,693
It's a movie about swimmers.

1277
01:02:09,781 --> 01:02:11,178
Swimmers are not hairy!

1278
01:02:11,266 --> 01:02:14,330
Hello. I'll be waxing you today.

1279
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,602
Is this the end of Lee Jungi?!

1280
01:02:18,775 --> 01:02:21,058
Seojin! Would you like to go out with me?

1281
01:02:21,146 --> 01:02:23,814
Are you shooting a movie?

1282
01:02:24,204 --> 01:02:26,382
He picks his nose all the time.

1283
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:30,063
He eats gimbap with those fingers
and he pinches my cheeks!

1284
01:02:30,151 --> 01:02:31,009
It's driving me crazy.

1285
01:02:31,097 --> 01:02:32,348
That guy is getting married soon!

1286
01:02:32,436 --> 01:02:34,843
What do you think will happen
when he finds out Yuna had his baby?

1287
01:02:34,931 --> 01:02:35,832
What are you talking about?

1288
01:02:35,921 --> 01:02:36,892
She had my baby?

1289
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,311
Are you trying to ruin my life??

1290
01:02:38,399 --> 01:02:40,348
You should be grateful
that I'm giving you this money.

1291
01:02:40,437 --> 01:02:42,794
How do I know you're not messing with me?

1292
01:02:42,883 --> 01:02:43,853
Wait!
