1
00:00:00,897 --> 00:00:03,904
Yuna! Yuna! Yuna!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,205
You can't come any further.
It's dangerous.

3
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,207
My friend is in there.

4
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:09,901
-It's dangerous.
-I don't care! Move!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,912
Yuna! Yuna!

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,180
Yuna!

7
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,215
Donggu!

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,490
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,892
Is something wrong?

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,403
Donggu, what's wrong?

11
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,605
Are you hurt?

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,608
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,413
Donggu, can you let go of my arms?

14
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:51,919
Donggu.

15
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,121
Did you come because you
were worried about me?

16
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:55,822
What?

17
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:57,591
No. Well...

18
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:01,795
I was worried about our neighbors
and found you here.

19
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,431
Why did you hug me?

20
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,532
That's...

21
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:10,704
I hug people when I'm worried.

22
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,040
Ma'am!

23
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:16,243
Are you okay?

24
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,145
Mr. Kang, what's wrong?

25
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,815
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

26
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,702
Mr. Policeman, I'm sorry
for interrupting your work.

27
00:01:26,814 --> 00:01:28,402
Mr. Fireman!

28
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:32,693
Thank you for your service!

29
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,790
Jeez.

30
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:40,400
You thought your heart was beating
fast and all but what? Destiny?

31
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:42,102
That's enough.

32
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:44,137
I'm worried as it is.

33
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,640
Sua, what's the matter?

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,042
I broke a plate and hurt myself a bit.

35
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,944
You should be more careful.

36
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,446
Where's Donggu?

37
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:55,949
He ran out of here like a madman.
Maybe something happened.

38
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,251
Oh, do you know that the supermarket
is on fire?

39
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,553
-What?
-What?

40
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,622
-The supermarket we go to?
-Yeah.

41
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,525
Yuna went there a while ago.
I hope she's okay.

42
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,827
Yuna's there?

43
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,229
Call her.
Hurry, hurry.

44
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,697
We're home.

45
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,600
Yuna, are you okay?
I heard the supermarket was on fire?

46
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,801
I'm fine.

47
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,605
The fire must have happened when I
stopped by the fried chicken place.

48
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:19,873
Really?

49
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:21,475
That's a relief.

50
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,978
Donggu, Sua told us you ran out
like a madman.

51
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,680
You were running to Yuna?

52
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:28,982
No.

53
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:32,285
I saw our neighbors on TV
and got worried.

54
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,288
I'm best friends with the president
of the tenants' association.

55
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:36,690
-Since when?
-What?

56
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:39,159
Since a long time ago.

57
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,865
I was worried something might
have happened to my best friend!

58
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:54,908
You're totally out of your mind!

59
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:57,277
I must really like her.

60
00:02:57,398 --> 00:02:59,691
You're crazy! You're out of your mind!

61
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:01,581
Just why did you act like that?!

62
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,419
Donggu, have some fried chicken.

63
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,320
No, thanks.

64
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,489
I don't feel like eating fried chicken.

65
00:03:09,586 --> 00:03:10,791
Come on now.

66
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,827
Come out and have some.

67
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:17,831
I said I don't want it.

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,302
Then I'll leave some for you.

69
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,704
You can have it later, okay?

70
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:35,716
No! No!

71
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,918
I've completely gone insane.

72
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:40,236
Darn it. Why did she grab me?

73
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:42,322
Are you crazy?

74
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:44,925
Oh no...

75
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,995
-I was going to eat that.
-It's mine.

76
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,263
Gosh seriously!

77
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:51,865
Where's Donggu?

78
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,073
He doesn't want to eat.

79
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,363
I wonder if something's going on.

80
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:57,259
-He's under the blankets.
-What?

81
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,972
He has the covers over his head?

82
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,374
He's sulking.

83
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:04,978
He does that for days when he's sulking.
Don't worry.

84
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,081
Seol must be awake.

85
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,283
You guys eat first.

86
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,387
What are you doing, Sua?

87
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,491
You already had a drumstick.
You can't have another one.

88
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:20,193
I don't like dry meat.

89
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,596
You can't eat two drumsticks.

90
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,165
Have you got no shame?

91
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,566
Don't yell! It's just drumsticks.

92
00:04:26,778 --> 00:04:28,168
Forget it! I don't want it now.

93
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,770
-Don't eat it then.
-I'll have it.

94
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,775
Look at her taking that drumstick
to her room.

95
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,278
She's on another level of shamelessness.

96
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:39,780
Right, Seojin.

97
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,477
I need to pay my credit card bill.
Can you lend me money?

98
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,584
I don't have any money.

99
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,487
You must be so proud. Goodness.

100
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,289
What are you watching since just now?

101
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:52,292
Isn't that mukbang?

102
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,295
-Why are you watching that crap?
-It's fun.

103
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,496
Fun?

104
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:58,598
I don't understand people
who shoot mukbang.

105
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:01,067
Why do they show people
what they're eating?

106
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:02,769
It's pathetic.

107
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,272
Pathetic?

108
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,376
Do you know how much these BJs make?

109
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,870
The popular ones make
up to 100 million per year.

110
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:14,080
100 million?

111
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,273
They just eat and make 100 million?

112
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,584
Yes, 100 million.

113
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,292
100 million. 100 million.

114
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,395
Where's Dusik's laptop?

115
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:36,570
Hey, Dusik. Where's your laptop?
Your laptop...

116
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:38,672
What happened to you?

117
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:44,110
-Some dudes were bothering Malgeum.
-What?

118
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,112
So, what?

119
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:49,115
You got in a fight? You?

120
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:52,819
I got so mad when I saw Malgeum cry.

121
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,322
I don't know why I did that.

122
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,959
It's obvious. You did it
because you like her.

123
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,728
-You think so?
-Of course.

124
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,531
No man would get himself beaten up
for a woman he doesn't even like.

125
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,568
You should confess how you feel.

126
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,662
Confess?

127
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,539
-I can't do that. It's too early.
-Dusik.

128
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:14,541
Love is all about timing.

129
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,944
You can miss each other in one second.

130
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,514
What if someone steals her
while you're hesitating?

131
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,149
-What are you going to do then?
-What?

132
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,718
That can't happen.

133
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,354
Jungi, how do I confess to her?

134
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,922
It's easy.

135
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:30,933
Tell her straightforward and be assertive.

136
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,360
-Got it?
-Straightforward and assertive?

137
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:34,828
Tell me how in more detail.

138
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:36,830
You're such an amateur.

139
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,625
Watch carefully.

140
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,737
There once was a man called Lee Jungi.

141
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,233
This was his style.

142
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,729
When he finds someone he likes,
he just walks forward.

143
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:50,110
He just kept walking forward.
Just keep walking.

144
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,408
You'll meet her one day
because the earth is round.

145
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:54,430
Just keep walking,
then stand in front of her like this.

146
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,548
Then, what do you do?

147
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:56,850
Be manly.

148
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,551
Grab her wrist.

149
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,520
Push her against the wall.

150
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,157
Then confess to her.

151
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,959
How? Like this.

152
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:08,528
Because it was a good day...

153
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:10,764
Because it was a bad day...

154
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:12,966
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,267
I love you.

156
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,337
Do I like you?

157
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,571
What are you doing?

158
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,473
Are you two dating?

159
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,742
No, of course not.

160
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,546
Don't be ridiculous.

161
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,950
Keep doing what you were doing.

162
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,752
You can date or get married...

163
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,188
My goodness.

164
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,590
What was this...

165
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:40,293
What the hell are you talking about?

166
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:43,296
Keep walking forward.

167
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:47,500
When will they grow up?

168
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,003
I've got enough problems as is.

169
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,572
Donggu, you're awake?

170
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:55,108
Why are you so surprised?

171
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,711
When did I?

172
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,313
You're hungry, right?

173
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,983
I'll heat up some fried chicken. Hold on.

174
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,127
I like her?

175
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,328
Why?

176
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:18,531
She can't do anything right.
She's not pretty either.

177
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:20,033
She's not cute...

178
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,642
She's cute.

179
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:31,344
So cute.

180
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:34,347
Has she always been this cute?

181
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,350
Why are you staring at me?

182
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:41,554
I wasn't.

183
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:42,856
Don't be ridiculous.

184
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:47,560
Why do you keep yelling at me?

185
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,562
Are you mad at me about something?

186
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:51,068
No.

187
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,266
Then what's the matter?

188
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,370
Is it...

189
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,078
Is it because of the smudge
on your camera bag?

190
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,347
How do you know about that?

191
00:09:09,786 --> 00:09:11,804
It was you?

192
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:14,592
I dropped some sauce on it
while I was cooking.

193
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:16,489
It's fine. It's not because of that.

194
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,691
Then is it because
the lens lid got broken?

195
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,193
How do you know...

196
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:23,096
You did that too?

197
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:27,500
I stepped on it while I
was wiping off the sauce.

198
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,504
I'm sorry, Donggu.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,908
Forgive me. Please?

200
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,709
Please. Please!

201
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,216
Forgive me.

202
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,613
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:43,316
-I'm sorry.
-I told you I'm not mad at you.

204
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,119
Donggu!

205
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,690
He must be really angry.

206
00:09:58,267 --> 00:09:59,265
She's cute.

207
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,568
She's so cute.

208
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,472
I almost forgave her for
things she didn't even do.

209
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,275
How can she look so cute
even when she's apologizing?

210
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:14,948
You scared me.

211
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:17,559
Donggu, what are you doing here?

212
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,453
Nothing.

213
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,422
Let's start cleaning.

214
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,492
What's going on with him?

215
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,994
Why is his face so red?

216
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:38,371
Jungi.

217
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,174
-Can I use your razor?
-Jeez...

218
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:45,879
-You always use my razor.
-Mine is broken.

219
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:46,779
It's over there.

220
00:10:47,277 --> 00:10:48,081
What are you doing?

221
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,850
I'm shooting a mukbang.
I have to pay my credit card bill.

222
00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:53,052
You want to earn money with mukbang?

223
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,156
My goodness.
Not anyone can do it, you know.

224
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,458
Don't you worry.

225
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,660
I can eat a lot.

226
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,964
Why isn't anyone coming in?
I'm getting anxious.

227
00:11:06,572 --> 00:11:08,968
Someone came in!

228
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,672
Hello, 'Kangnam Parvenu.'

229
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:17,677
I'm the most handsome BJ
in the mukbang scene.

230
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,579
I'm BJ Jun!

231
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,882
Shut up and just eat.

232
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,684
Oh, okay.

233
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:28,488
You're quick-tempered.

234
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,593
Who the hell does he think he is?

235
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:40,900
Okay, Gangnam Parvenu.
I'll start eating this fried chicken now.

236
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,508
So nice.

237
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:52,598
It's so crispy.

238
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:54,614
You suck at this.

239
00:11:57,193 --> 00:12:00,620
It's my first time shooting a mukbang.

240
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:07,126
I'll try to make it look more appetizing.

241
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,035
Oh, delicious.

242
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:24,911
Donggu, how was work?

243
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,013
Donggu? Donggu!

244
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:28,815
What was that about?

245
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:34,811
-I think he's mad at me.
-what?

246
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:37,724
I spilled sauce on his camera bag

247
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,126
-and I broke the lens lid.
-What?

248
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,729
You should be more careful.

249
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:46,414
He values his came the most.

250
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:47,523
Really?

251
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:49,338
What do I do?

252
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:53,306
Is there a way to make him less mad at me?

253
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,707
I don't know.

254
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,310
Oh, right. There's a way.

255
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:59,112
-What is it?
-Act cute.

256
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,915
He seems tough but he melts
when girls act cute around him.

257
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,317
Act cute?

258
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:15,728
I can't even look at her anymore.

259
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,898
She's cuter the more I look at her.

260
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,301
Donggu.

261
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,803
Donggu.

262
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,105
Yuna is sorry.

263
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:28,308
Please forgive me.

264
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,920
What is this?

265
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,122
What's up with him?

266
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:46,017
It's obviously because you are not cute.

267
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,128
He's easy to please.

268
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:51,444
You're terrible at acting cute.

269
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:52,432
Really?

270
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:55,034
I was trying my best.

271
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,036
Maybe I wasn't cute enough.

272
00:13:57,821 --> 00:14:00,128
She's cute. She's so cute.

273
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,924
Even her baby talk is cute.

274
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,545
My heart almost stopped
when she shook her shoulders.

275
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,948
That startled me!

276
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:11,451
What are you doing?

277
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,686
No, well...

278
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,189
Do you have something to say?

279
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,092
No, I don't.

280
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,598
What's the matter with him?

281
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:28,401
How do you feel?

282
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:30,803
Look at your lip.

283
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,506
It's all cracked.

284
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,507
Those jerks...

285
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:36,409
I'm fine.

286
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,511
I'm totally fine. Don't worry.

287
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:40,906
We start shooting the movie tomorrow.

288
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:42,715
You're going to be busy, what?

289
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,016
Yes, probably.

290
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,222
I think I overdid it at the gym.

291
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,143
Gym?

292
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:51,324
Which gym do you go to?

293
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:52,827
It's called Krav Maga.

294
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,423
It's so much fun.

295
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:56,340
Krav...

296
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,497
I see.

297
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,604
I have to confess how I feel,
but I can't muster up my courage.

298
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,907
Be straightforward and assertive.

299
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,909
Just do it.

300
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:11,411
Malgeum!

301
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,416
Yes?

302
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,625
I'm sorry!

303
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,126
Dusik, are you okay?

304
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,831
Yes, I'm f-fine.

305
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:32,832
But...

306
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,634
What was that?

307
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,035
How did you do that?

308
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,550
That was Krav Maga.

309
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:38,938
It's practical martial arts.

310
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:40,433
Won Bin did it in his movie.

311
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,634
Krav Maga is martial arts?
Not something like Pilates?

312
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,746
You shouldn't grab my arm like that.

313
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,448
My body automatically reacts to it.

314
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,317
Oh, okay.

315
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:58,624
Hello.

316
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:02,128
Yes, I'll be there soon.

317
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:03,229
Okay.

318
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:07,233
I have to go to a fan meeting.

319
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:09,235
-I'm sorry.
-A fan meeting?

320
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,837
You do fan meetings?

321
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:13,039
Can I come too?

322
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:13,840
What?

323
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,441
It's a bit...

324
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,243
I really have to tell you something.

325
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:23,916
-Cherry!
-Cherry!

326
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,585
This is it.

327
00:16:25,673 --> 00:16:27,086
Oh, o-okay.

328
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:28,888
Have fun at your fan meeting.

329
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,690
I'll wait in the cafe.

330
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,391
Mr. Bong?

331
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:34,393
Oh, hello, sir.

332
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,496
What brings you here?

333
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,906
-You're here for Cherry's fan meeting?
-What?

334
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,268
-No, I...
-Welcome.

335
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,169
Let's go inside.

336
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,873
-I'll give you the best seat.
-No, I actually...

337
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:01,687
We'll begin Cherry's fan meeting.

338
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,390
Please welcome Cherry
with a loud cheer!

339
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,399
Cherry! Cherry!

340
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:11,969
Cherry! Cherry!

341
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:12,983
Cherry!

342
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,002
Cherry! Cherry!

343
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,504
Cherry! Cherry!

344
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:20,052
Cherry! Cherry!

345
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,648
Cherry! Cherry!

346
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,378
Cherry! Cherry!

347
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,155
Cherry! Cherry!

348
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:39,091
Do you see the bone?

349
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,594
One chicken clear.

350
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,202
One chicken clear.

351
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,698
Next.

352
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:49,669
Before I eat this second fried chicken,

353
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,839
if anyone wants to shoot me
some star-candies, go ahead.

354
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,042
Star-candy time!

355
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,148
Okay, no star-candies. It's fine.

356
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:06,768
I'll start eating
the second fried chicken.

357
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,755
Wait. Why are you throwing those away?

358
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,093
These?

359
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:18,898
These are chicken bones that I can't eat.

360
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:22,702
Eat the bones too. If you do,
I'll shoot you 100 star-candies.

361
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,273
If I eat the bones,

362
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:29,675
you're going to give me 100 star-candies?

363
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:36,082
Hey, I'm broadcasting.

364
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,385
Why are you thinking about this?

365
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:42,154
-You're really going to eat the bones?
-Of course!

366
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,657
100 star-candies is 10,000 won.

367
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,859
But you can't eat chicken bones.

368
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,294
I have to pay my credit card bill.

369
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:52,465
I'll eat chicken feathers
to not become a credit delinquent.

370
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,901
-You could die!
-Let go of me.

371
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,105
Sorry to keep you waiting.

372
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,407
A hairy person was bothering me.

373
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:07,013
BJ Jun will start eating
chicken bones now.

374
00:19:08,386 --> 00:19:11,391
The smell of calcium and magnesium.
I feel healthier already.

375
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,419
Very good. Here I go.

376
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:17,823
For real?

377
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:31,303
Wow. He really ate a chicken bone.

378
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,905
How can he eat a chicken bone?

379
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,907
He's an adult. Isn't he embarrassed?

380
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,811
Guys, let's study hard
to not become like him.

381
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,314
-Look.

382
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:45,518
I swallowed it.

383
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,221
Gangnam Parvenu, give me star-candies.

384
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,024
Okay.

385
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:57,830
100! 100 star candies!

386
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,232
Thank you.

387
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,726
Mr. Gangnam Parvenu, thank you, sir!

388
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:06,238
I love you!

389
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,755
He's going to get in some serious trouble.

390
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:24,640
What's this?

391
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,592
What are you doing?

392
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:29,395
Actually...

393
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,900
What's going on? He's still mad at you?

394
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,201
Did you do the thing I taught you?

395
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,804
No, not yet.

396
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:40,606
Why not? It always works.

397
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:44,477
-It makes everyone smile.
-Really?

398
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:48,180
-Okay, I'll send it to him.
-Good.

399
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,053
I can't eat because of Yuna.

400
00:20:57,654 --> 00:20:59,992
It's from Yuna. What's this?

401
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:02,995
-You really want him to forgive you?
-Yes.

402
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,400
Say 'Please forgive me.'

403
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:07,099
Donggu, please forgive me.

404
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,802
-Say it cuter.
-Forgive me.

405
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,901
-Say it adorably.
-Please forgive me.

406
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,908
-Even cuter.
-Please forgive me.

407
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,477
-Say it bravely.
-Forgive me!

408
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:23,368
Why? Is he angry?

409
00:21:23,968 --> 00:21:24,802
What is he doing?

410
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:32,469
I have to keep broadcasting.

411
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:36,395
Are you eating ramyeon?
You cooked it well.

412
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,498
Donggu, that's my medicine!

413
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,101
That's for my heart condition.

414
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,101
-Donggu!
-What was that?

415
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:45,901
I think he's still mad.

416
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,506
Just give up.

417
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,310
You suck at acting cute.

418
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,114
Am I really that bad?

419
00:22:00,234 --> 00:22:02,202
She's so cute, so very cute.

420
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,689
Is she a human or a doll?

421
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:08,894
I could've died of a heart attack
if I didn't have the heart medicine.

422
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,396
Kang Donggu.

423
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:12,464
You've been doing this since yesterday.

424
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:13,766
If you have something to say,
just say it.

425
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:16,669
I have nothing to say.

426
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:21,373
What is up with him?

427
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,276
Wait.

428
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,780
Does he...

429
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,395
...still like me?

430
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:34,486
The highlight of today's event.
It's raffle time.

431
00:22:35,265 --> 00:22:38,390
Let me show you the special prize.

432
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:40,893
-It is...
-What is it?

433
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:46,198
It is the item that Cherry wore
in her hit movie 'Bikini Patrol 3.'

434
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,813
It's her bikini!

435
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:57,509
Everyone, calm down.

436
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,413
Please raise your number cards
that you received on your way in.

437
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,684
Cherry will pick out a number herself.

438
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,646
"Bikini Patrol 3 Cherry Fan meeting"

439
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:23,769
The lucky winner of Cherry's bikini is...

440
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,371
Number 38!

441
00:23:28,853 --> 00:23:30,976
Who has number 38?

442
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,781
No number 38?

443
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:36,982
-No.
-There's no 38.

444
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,584
-Number 38?
-No.

445
00:23:46,443 --> 00:23:47,860
Do it again.

446
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,529
Do it again. Do it again.

447
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:54,033
He has number 38!

448
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,636
Oh, there he is.

449
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,705
-Come up to the stage.
-38! 38!

450
00:23:59,797 --> 00:24:03,108
-Congratulation. Give him a big hand.
-38! 38!

451
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,526
Hello.

452
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:23,128
I'm BJ Jun.

453
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,932
I'm going to eat all kinds
of bone on this mukbang.

454
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,036
I prepared various bones today.

455
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:32,538
I'll start from here.

456
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,240
This is a chicken bone.

457
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:38,344
Pork back-bone.

458
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,447
Beef back ribs.

459
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:43,949
Rockfish bone.

460
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,552
Hairtail bone.

461
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,153
These are the bones I'll be eating today.

462
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:50,356
And the special.

463
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,895
Pigs' feet!

464
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:58,713
I'll put these aside for now.

465
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,685
Okay, let's begin.

466
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:06,005
I'm going to eat this tough
and sharp rockfish bone.

467
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:07,006
Here we go!

468
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:15,881
He's crazy. So crazy. That punk is...

469
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,306
Donggu! Donggu!

470
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,346
Give it to me. I'll do it.

471
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,249
I'll do it. Go back inside.

472
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,151
I can do it myself.

473
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,153
Donggu.

474
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,755
Are you still mad at me?

475
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:00,359
I told you I'm not mad at you.

476
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,861
Then what is this about?

477
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:03,862
Tell me.

478
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,936
See? You can't say it.

479
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,038
You're mad at me because of your camera.

480
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,540
Fine, I am!

481
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,042
I'm mad at you because of my camera.

482
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:18,844
But I'm over it now.

483
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,747
So, you don't have to worry about it.
Okay?

484
00:26:21,836 --> 00:26:22,669
Really?

485
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,217
What a relief.

486
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,201
I've been worried about this for days.

487
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,723
I will never make a mistake again, so...

488
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:39,934
-Gee...
-I'm sorry.

489
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:45,337
-I have a cold coming on.
-It's fine.

490
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:50,442
You're not wearing warm enough.
No wonder you have a cold.

491
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,845
This is the warmest coat I have.

492
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:55,047
It's pretty warm.

493
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:58,333
I forgot. I left the stove on.

494
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:00,752
I'll go back in.

495
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:17,569
Gangnam Parvenu, thank you, sir.

496
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,274
'Lee Gyein Venus,' thank you, ma'am.

497
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,986
So much star-candies
for mere rockfish bones.

498
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,581
You're too kind.

499
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,083
Thank you.

500
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,387
Thank you for the star-candies and now...

501
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,990
It's toughest bone on the earth...

502
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,595
I'm going to eat pigs' feet.

503
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:56,241
I'm fine.

504
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,778
Let's begin.

505
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,447
Ow, my belly.

506
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:05,083
I'm...

507
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,852
I'm fine.

508
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:12,558
What do I do?

509
00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:22,301
Why did I have to win the bikini?

510
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:24,469
I can't even throw it out.

511
00:28:29,764 --> 00:28:31,543
Sorry to keep you waiting.

512
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:32,744
It's okay.

513
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,846
It's cold, isn't it? Drink this.

514
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:38,383
Thanks.

515
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,892
It was embarrassing today, wasn't it?

516
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:50,684
Sorry. This is my life.

517
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:52,698
No need to be sorry.

518
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:57,597
The truth is I didn't want to set out
to do this job at first.

519
00:28:58,276 --> 00:29:02,074
I used to shoot TV dramas and movies.

520
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:06,178
But things didn't work out
and I needed the money.

521
00:29:06,347 --> 00:29:09,448
I was going to do only one
but I ended up here.

522
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:11,950
What's bad about that?

523
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,219
But this isn't my dream.

524
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,024
I want to shoot TV dramas and movies
like I used to.

525
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:24,451
Now people only see me as a porn star,
so no one wants to cast me.

526
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:27,664
Why don't you quit now?

527
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:31,870
I signed a contract,
so there's nothing I can do.

528
00:29:34,277 --> 00:29:36,975
I don't know what to do either.

529
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:41,947
I'm sorry.

530
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,950
I cry too much these days. What a fool.

531
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,954
Didn't you say you had something
to tell me?

532
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,624
No, I'll tell you some other time.

533
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,126
Drink up.

534
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:04,942
I bought it but how do I give it to her?

535
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,675
Yuna... No, no!

536
00:30:09,962 --> 00:30:11,076
It was on the street
so I picked it up for you.

537
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:13,378
No! That sounds stupid!

538
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,782
What was I thinking buying this?

539
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,952
What if she notices that I like
her when I give this to her?

540
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:27,025
Goodness, be careful.

541
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,428
What's wrong?

542
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:30,529
What's going on?

543
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,866
I took him to the emergency
room because he was sick.

544
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:36,944
The emergency room?
How is he sick?

545
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,133
-Don't tell her.
-Actually...

546
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,640
He ate some rockfish bones.

547
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:43,575
What? Rockfish bones?

548
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,145
-Were you doing your bone mukbang again?
-No...

549
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:52,551
I'll go upstairs and clean up your room.

550
00:30:53,842 --> 00:30:55,320
Why did I buy this?

551
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,727
-Donggu, you were at home?
-What?

552
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:03,061
Yes.

553
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,630
What are you hiding?

554
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,833
Well, the thing is...

555
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,477
Yuna, here.

556
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,357
Gee, you're so heavy.

557
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,477
-Why is it so crowded in here?
-What are you doing?

558
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:21,380
Did you buy that for Yuna?

559
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:26,151
I was going to ask her to give it to Sua,
but I can do it myself.

560
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:27,285
Sua, here.

561
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,089
What's this?

562
00:31:32,982 --> 00:31:34,092
A coat?

563
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:35,394
Why are you giving this to me?

564
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,462
I thought it was pretty.

565
00:31:37,838 --> 00:31:40,565
Guys, I'm in pain.

566
00:31:40,853 --> 00:31:43,860
Can you put me on the bed first
and do the gift thing later?

567
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:45,337
Sorry.

568
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:46,720
Come on.

569
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,541
You're so heavy.

570
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,544
I forgot to turn off the laptop.

571
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,622
What's this?

572
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:00,419
He's back. Looks like he went
to the hospital.

573
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,921
-The 'Mustache Girl' is back.
-What's this?

574
00:32:03,026 --> 00:32:05,023
What is it? Why are you surprised?

575
00:32:05,617 --> 00:32:07,993
Look at this! Look!

576
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,196
-What is it?
-There are so many viewers.

577
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:14,533
What's this? 23,400 star-candies?

578
00:32:14,618 --> 00:32:17,202
-Twenty thousand...
-One star-candy is 100 won.

579
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:19,504
It's over two million won.

580
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:23,275
When I left, there was only 200.

581
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,609
How did this happen?

582
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,680
Seojin.

583
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:31,544
-Isn't this you?
-What?

584
00:32:31,665 --> 00:32:32,884
Why would I be...

585
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,654
Where's the razor?

586
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,292
Here is it.

587
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,695
-Is she shaving?
-Is her beard real?

588
00:32:43,802 --> 00:32:46,698
-This is legendary stuff.
-This broadcast is insane.

589
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,168
-This is super funny.
-From mukbang to shaving broadcast?

590
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:51,970
What the hell?!

591
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,440
Me shaving was being broadcasted live?

592
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,051
Thanks, Chewbacca.

593
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:59,945
I won't become a credit delinquent
thanks to you.

594
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,565
That's not the problem!

595
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,449
The whole country saw me shaving.

596
00:33:04,653 --> 00:33:07,886
Hey! How are you going to fix this?!
How are you going to fix this?!

597
00:33:08,284 --> 00:33:10,088
I didn't do it on purpose.

598
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,657
You shouldn't have shaved at the desk.

599
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:15,160
Someone's coming in.

600
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:20,886
I bought it but how do I give it to her?

601
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:22,868
Yuna... No, no!

602
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:23,969
This is...

603
00:33:24,197 --> 00:33:25,292
It was on the street
so I picked it up for you.

604
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:27,606
No! That sounds stupid!

605
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:31,276
What if she notices that I like her
when I give this to her?

606
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:36,314
What? Why?

607
00:33:45,832 --> 00:33:46,925
Hold on.

608
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:48,316
What did you mean by

609
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,595
'What if she notices that I like her'?

610
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:51,730
Well...

611
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,732
Donggu, do you...

612
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:57,035
-It's not that...
-Do you still like Sua?

613
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:57,936
What?

614
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,038
No, no...

615
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:02,645
There's proof that you do like her.

616
00:34:02,737 --> 00:34:05,443
-No, actually...
-Donggu.

617
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,245
Can we talk?

618
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,152
Oh, okay.

619
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:24,362
He's such a loser.

620
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,069
-You know that we're over, right?
-What?

621
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,372
I do know.
I know it very well.

622
00:34:34,484 --> 00:34:36,174
-But...
-Then why are you doing this?

623
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:38,677
Donggu, are you still hung up on me?

624
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,278
No, I am over you.

625
00:34:40,396 --> 00:34:43,682
I'll forget about you right now.
I'm so over you.

626
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:45,183
I've erased you.

627
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,085
So, just forget about it. Bye.

628
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:52,190
Donggu, what am I going to do with you?

629
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:01,299
It is pretty.

630
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:11,710
He likes me but he doesn't know my size.

631
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,817
Donggu, what am I going to do with you?

632
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:17,502
What am I going to do with you?

633
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,017
What should I going to do?

634
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,151
Sua.

635
00:35:20,376 --> 00:35:23,154
Is this why you're staying here?
To get back together with my brother?

636
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,656
No.

637
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,257
I have a conscience.

638
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,027
I won't let you get back together.

639
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:33,131
Do whatever you have to do
to turn him down.

640
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:34,833
Okay.

641
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:44,743
Sua.

642
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:47,832
Why did you want to see me outside?

643
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:49,014
Actually...

644
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:52,050
I thought about it.

645
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:54,919
But I can't get back together with you.

646
00:35:55,632 --> 00:35:56,855
Are you still on that?

647
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,824
I'm fine. Don't mind me.

648
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,826
How can I not?

649
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:03,928
You should have kept
your feelings secret.

650
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,032
I prepared something for you.

651
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:08,939
What do you mean?

652
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:10,035
A blind date.

653
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,836
What?

654
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:13,338
Blind date?

655
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,242
You set up a blind date for me?

656
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,444
Here she is. Yerin! Over here.

657
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,918
This is Lee Yerin.

658
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,320
This is Kang Donggu,
a friend of mine I told you about.

659
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,556
Hello, Sua told me so much about you.

660
00:36:31,654 --> 00:36:33,124
Hello.

661
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,226
I wonder what she told you about me...

662
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,428
Donggu.

663
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,929
-Good luck.
-With what?

664
00:36:38,048 --> 00:36:39,330
I'll get going.

665
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,332
Sua, where are you going?

666
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,435
Sua.

667
00:36:58,913 --> 00:37:00,318
I'm home.

668
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,419
Hey.

669
00:37:01,826 --> 00:37:03,121
Why are you home so early?

670
00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:05,223
-What about Yerin?
-Oh...

671
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,292
We ended the date a bit early.

672
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,694
So? How did it go?

673
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,696
-Did you ask her out for a second date?
-What?

674
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,267
-No.
-Why not?

675
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,570
I saw her picture. She's so your type.

676
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,775
Her physical appearance was my style.

677
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,243
But, how can I say this...

678
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,745
I like intelligent women.

679
00:37:26,855 --> 00:37:28,146
She's an intellect.

680
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,849
She graduated from Seoul National
University and went to Harvard.

681
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,451
-She's a member of Mensa.
-Really?

682
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,654
She was beautiful and intelligent,

683
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,557
but she wasn't funny.

684
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,849
She's a comedian.

685
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,962
She's a professional comedian.
She's hilarious.

686
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,463
Really?

687
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:48,566
But, you know...

688
00:37:48,656 --> 00:37:51,870
I didn't get the vibe
that she was the one for me.

689
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,071
Shut up.

690
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,873
It's because of Sua, isn't it?

691
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:58,076
-You're still hung up on her, aren't you?
-No, I'm not!

692
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,745
Then, why didn't you ask her out
for a second date?

693
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:02,547
-The thing is...
-Donggu.

694
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,650
Why are you doing this?
Why are you making me suffer?

695
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:07,652
That's not what I'm doing.

696
00:38:16,222 --> 00:38:18,830
Fine, I'll ask her out again.

697
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,933
-Do it here so we can see.
-What?

698
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:25,837
Fine.

699
00:38:26,128 --> 00:38:28,439
I'll do it.

700
00:38:29,477 --> 00:38:30,241
I'm doing it.

701
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,846
I asked her to help us clean.
Where is she?

702
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:36,714
Sua, why aren't you coming down...

703
00:38:39,231 --> 00:38:41,719
I was organizing clothes
that I don't wear anymore.

704
00:38:42,313 --> 00:38:44,622
This isn't organizing. This is a mess.

705
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,927
-Donggu bought that coat for you, what?
-Yes.

706
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:50,428
But it's a bit small.

707
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,530
I can't throw it out though.

708
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,332
Do you want to try?

709
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:55,834
Really?

710
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,538
Let's try it on.

711
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,175
It's small for me too.

712
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:07,178
Yuna, do you want to try it on?

713
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,196
No, thanks.

714
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,682
Come on, try it on.

715
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,983
Come on.

716
00:39:17,892 --> 00:39:19,591
It fits your perfectly.

717
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:20,592
It does.

718
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,104
You can have it.

719
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:25,096
No, Donggu gave this to you.

720
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,498
-I'm fine.
-That's true...

721
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:29,200
I don't know.

722
00:39:29,424 --> 00:39:32,003
Why do you have so much stuff?

723
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,174
Isn't that 'Moore Moosh'?

724
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:44,349
It is Moore Moosh.

725
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,851
Moore Moosh? What's that?

726
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,453
Don't you know?

727
00:39:48,544 --> 00:39:50,154
It's a luxury brand.

728
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:54,359
This Moore Moosh 2017 F/W
vintage collection...

729
00:39:54,456 --> 00:39:57,781
...was worn by every celebrity including
Song Hyegyo, Jun Jihyeon, Kim Taehee.

730
00:39:57,886 --> 00:39:59,664
It's the hottest collection of the season.

731
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:02,367
Why don't you wear it?

732
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:04,669
It's not really my style.

733
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:05,870
Do you want it?

734
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:09,040
Really? Thank you.

735
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,341
Thank you so much.

736
00:40:10,436 --> 00:40:12,744
You don't have to clean. Just rest.

737
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,947
I'll do all the cleaning. I love you.

738
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,153
-Can I take all the Moore Moosh?
-Sure.

739
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,228
Director, why are you doing this?

740
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,900
Why did you add this scene
without even speaking to me?

741
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,603
Turn on the lights.

742
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:40,912
Is this your first shoot?

743
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,823
Why are you being so difficult?

744
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,610
If you keep doing this,
I can't do this movie.

745
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,811
Are you refusing to shoot this scene?

746
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,113
-Then pay the penalty fees.
-What?

747
00:40:49,223 --> 00:40:52,183
If you can't pay for for breach
of contract, shut up and do the scene.

748
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,485
So, are you doing to do the scene or not?

749
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,384
I need some fresh air.

750
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,790
Gosh, that brat.

751
00:41:13,867 --> 00:41:14,839
Stand up.

752
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,442
-Dusik.
-Stand up.

753
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:19,711
What are you doing?

754
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,914
Where are we going?
What are you doing?

755
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:27,485
You said you don't want to do this
anymore.

756
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:28,820
Then don't do it.

757
00:41:29,334 --> 00:41:31,016
Don't force yourself to do something
you don't want to do.

758
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,024
Do things that you want to do.

759
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:35,126
I can't do that.

760
00:41:35,234 --> 00:41:38,529
-I signed a contract...
-I'll take care of that.

761
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:40,031
Go home.

762
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,534
I'll take care of everything
and call you later.

763
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:48,239
Dusik!

764
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:56,647
Mr. Bong. What did you just say?

765
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,551
What? Cherry can't do the movie?

766
00:42:00,748 --> 00:42:03,755
That's right. So, don't call Cherry...

767
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,958
...I mean, Malgeum ever again.

768
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,630
She can't do that.

769
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,848
Are you going to pay the
compensation for breach of contract...

770
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:15,867
...and the down payment for our agency?

771
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:18,336
Yes, I'll pay them.

772
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,470
How much is it?

773
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:27,645
40 million won!

774
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:31,149
Oh my god. This is crazy.
I'm such an idiot.

775
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:36,233
Ta-da!

776
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:38,456
What do you think?

777
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:42,360
Wow, you look like a beggar.

778
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,072
Have you given up on finding a job
and decided to beg for a living?

779
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:46,264
What? A beggar?!

780
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:48,066
These are from a luxury brand.

781
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:51,135
Moore Moosh 17 F/W vintage collection.

782
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,737
Moore what?

783
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:56,841
Forget it. You know nothing about fashion.
Forget it. I'm going to the library.

784
00:42:56,936 --> 00:42:58,409
Yes, wear warm clothes.

785
00:42:59,312 --> 00:43:00,707
-Hey, Dusik.
-Hey.

786
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:02,905
You look like beggar who's dressed warmly.

787
00:43:03,224 --> 00:43:05,116
Why are you wearing an onion net?

788
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,717
This is not an onion net.

789
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:10,221
-This is Moore Moosh 2017...
-Moore what?

790
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:14,025
Forget it. I can't talk to you two.

791
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,081
You know nothing about fashion.

792
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,795
You look like a beggar.

793
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:19,899
Where did she get those ugly clothes?

794
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:23,101
-With an empty can and she's a beggar.
-Totally

795
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:27,105
That beggar isn't the important thing
right now. I made a huge mistake.

796
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,907
Mistake? What kind of mistake?

797
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:33,411
You have to pay penalty fees for Malgeum?

798
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,587
Yes. I felt sorry for her,
so it just happened.

799
00:43:36,692 --> 00:43:39,285
But still, you shouldn't have done that!

800
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:41,419
I didn't know the fees were that big.

801
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,621
What should I do? Should I call a lender?

802
00:43:43,714 --> 00:43:45,223
They don't give out loans to everyone.

803
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:47,325
Especially not to a guy like you
who doesn't have a job.

804
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:50,128
Then, what am I going to do?
This is crazy.

805
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,333
There may be a way.

806
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:59,137
Is there a way? What is it?

807
00:44:09,517 --> 00:44:11,015
This place is the same.

808
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,008
What's this?

809
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:15,119
Is this bicycle racing?

810
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:16,220
Isn't this illegal?

811
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:17,588
What are you talking about?

812
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:19,824
This place is licensed.

813
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:24,295
This is the only way
to make big money fast.

814
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,096
Really?

815
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,429
But there is no guarantee
that we'll win money.

816
00:44:27,513 --> 00:44:29,133
I have a way.

817
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,819
Have you heard of "God of Bicycles"?

818
00:44:32,922 --> 00:44:33,837
"God of Bicycles"?

819
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:39,110
He always managed to guess the winner.
That's why he's the "God of Bicycles".

820
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:44,315
Where is he today? Did he come?

821
00:44:47,816 --> 00:44:48,719
Over there.

822
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:51,122
That's him.

823
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:58,629
So, if we just follow him,
we'll easily win money.

824
00:44:58,728 --> 00:45:01,931
How do we find out what he's picking?

825
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,434
I have a way.

826
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:04,936
-Follow me.
-what?

827
00:45:06,614 --> 00:45:08,515
-What are you doing?
-Just stand over here.

828
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,141
-Why?
-Be quiet.

829
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,411
Go away!

830
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:18,516
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry, sir.

831
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,418
My friend is drunk.

832
00:45:20,538 --> 00:45:23,221
You can't drink before you come in here.

833
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,613
Here you go.

834
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,126
I'm sorry.

835
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:31,495
Why did you push me?

836
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:34,098
I saw what he picked.

837
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,600
Really? Which ones did he pick?

838
00:45:40,755 --> 00:45:42,473
Bet everything you got on this one.

839
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:44,875
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-Why?

840
00:45:44,978 --> 00:45:48,093
After I got sick from eating fish bones,
my stomach gets upset all the time.

841
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,081
I'll be quick. Bet everything on this one.

842
00:45:50,368 --> 00:45:51,422
Hurry.

843
00:45:58,123 --> 00:45:59,709
Donggu, are you going to your date?

844
00:46:00,265 --> 00:46:01,065
Yes.

845
00:46:01,773 --> 00:46:02,961
Have fun.

846
00:46:03,045 --> 00:46:04,859
Buy a delicious meal for Yerin.

847
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,353
Sua, can I not go to this date?

848
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,446
Why? Is it...

849
00:46:17,782 --> 00:46:19,575
Is it because of me?

850
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:23,584
No. It's just that because
there aren't any guests...

851
00:46:23,691 --> 00:46:25,183
Date expenses are a lot too.

852
00:46:25,273 --> 00:46:28,911
And I don't think I should be dating
in my situation.

853
00:46:29,718 --> 00:46:31,631
-I think...
-I'm here.

854
00:46:33,798 --> 00:46:34,805
Yerin.

855
00:46:35,218 --> 00:46:36,634
How come you're here?

856
00:46:36,725 --> 00:46:38,949
It costs a lot to have a date outside.

857
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:42,341
So, I thought we could just make
something delicious at home.

858
00:46:42,456 --> 00:46:44,355
I'll make you something nice.

859
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:45,820
Where's the kitchen?

860
00:46:46,334 --> 00:46:47,730
No...

861
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:49,643
It's this way. Follow me.

862
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:55,636
See?

863
00:46:55,832 --> 00:46:57,631
She's so considerate.

864
00:46:57,747 --> 00:47:01,658
So, don't worry about money
and date her. Okay?

865
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:03,312
Okay.

866
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:06,406
She's so considerate.

867
00:47:06,694 --> 00:47:08,185
I feel smothered.

868
00:47:14,674 --> 00:47:16,292
What took you so long? It already started.

869
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:19,105
Sorry. I have an upset stomach.

870
00:47:19,277 --> 00:47:20,604
You bought the tickets, right?

871
00:47:20,793 --> 00:47:21,588
Yes, here.

872
00:47:21,704 --> 00:47:23,009
Which screen do I look at?

873
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:24,799
That one.

874
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:27,203
"Number six and one"

875
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:28,329
Dusik.

876
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:32,215
I told you to bet on number one and nine,
not one and six.

877
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:33,510
What are you talking about?

878
00:47:33,594 --> 00:47:35,696
-You wrote down number six and one.
-What?

879
00:47:36,704 --> 00:47:37,595
Dusik!

880
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,622
You were holding it upside down.

881
00:47:39,812 --> 00:47:41,998
This is the right side up.

882
00:47:42,091 --> 00:47:43,275
Like this, you idiot!

883
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:46,810
-Then you should have told me before.
-You ruined it for us!

884
00:47:46,895 --> 00:47:48,687
This is unbelievable.

885
00:47:48,787 --> 00:47:50,602
Then what do we do?

886
00:47:50,908 --> 00:47:52,506
I need this money.

887
00:48:12,049 --> 00:48:12,950
What is it?

888
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,648
What happened? Why are you screaming?

889
00:48:14,742 --> 00:48:16,946
Your pick was the right one.

890
00:48:17,046 --> 00:48:18,435
We hit the jackpot!

891
00:48:18,535 --> 00:48:21,426
-We won?
-Yes!

892
00:48:24,013 --> 00:48:25,036
Amazing!

893
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,528
Look at all this money.

894
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:35,425
I can pay some of the penalty fees
with this.

895
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,434
Let's go.

896
00:48:37,108 --> 00:48:38,115
Wait, Dusik.

897
00:48:38,503 --> 00:48:40,155
It's a shame to stop here.

898
00:48:40,643 --> 00:48:45,043
You bet only 4,800 won but it
blew up in just a few minutes.

899
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:48,041
What if you had bet this much money?

900
00:48:48,155 --> 00:48:49,315
We'd have won tons of money.

901
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,006
-Why do you ask?
-It's obvious, isn't it?

902
00:48:51,316 --> 00:48:55,131
If we win again, not only can you
pay the penalty fees for Malgeum,

903
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,521
but we can make a movie
like we've always dreamed of.

904
00:48:58,191 --> 00:48:59,111
Dusik.

905
00:48:59,613 --> 00:49:00,512
Let's go!

906
00:49:00,597 --> 00:49:01,904
Let's do this!

907
00:49:03,397 --> 00:49:04,320
A movie?

908
00:49:08,221 --> 00:49:10,727
Wow, Yerin is a great cook.

909
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:11,925
Right, Donggu?

910
00:49:12,629 --> 00:49:13,740
Yes.

911
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,023
Donggu, would you like some kimbap?

912
00:49:15,129 --> 00:49:17,568
-I'll feed you. Open up.
-No.

913
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:19,262
No, thanks. I'll eat it myself.

914
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:21,164
I want to feed you.

915
00:49:21,264 --> 00:49:23,467
-Open up.
-I said no thanks.

916
00:49:24,202 --> 00:49:25,322
I'm sorry.

917
00:49:25,406 --> 00:49:27,828
I just wanted to feed you...

918
00:49:30,796 --> 00:49:32,311
Can I talk to you?

919
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:33,788
Why?

920
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:36,284
Why all of a sudden...

921
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:37,696
Why?

922
00:49:39,692 --> 00:49:41,889
Kang Donggu, what are you doing?

923
00:49:41,973 --> 00:49:42,884
What did I do?

924
00:49:42,992 --> 00:49:45,492
Why didn't you let Yerin feed you?

925
00:49:45,576 --> 00:49:47,197
Why didn't you open your mouth?

926
00:49:47,598 --> 00:49:51,023
-I just wanted to eat it myself.
-Don't lie.

927
00:49:51,124 --> 00:49:52,433
It's because of me.

928
00:49:52,533 --> 00:49:56,451
-That's why you didn't let her feed you.
-No.

929
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:59,336
-It's not like that.
-Then why didn't you open your mouth?

930
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,338
Why didn't you let her feed
you that delicious kimbap?

931
00:50:02,427 --> 00:50:04,335
Fine, I'll let her feed me.

932
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,852
I'll let her.

933
00:50:14,516 --> 00:50:16,118
What do you think? Is it good?

934
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:18,491
Yes, it's delicious.

935
00:50:19,628 --> 00:50:21,699
Then, would you like another one?

936
00:50:21,783 --> 00:50:23,494
No, I just ate one...

937
00:50:33,302 --> 00:50:34,727
My goodness.

938
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:47,957
They can't take their eyes off of me.

939
00:50:48,065 --> 00:50:50,071
People appreciate fine clothes.

940
00:50:51,656 --> 00:50:55,306
Moore Moosh is the best.

941
00:50:55,813 --> 00:50:57,599
Moore Moosh.

942
00:50:59,314 --> 00:51:00,610
Oh, tteokbokki.

943
00:51:03,011 --> 00:51:04,135
It looks good.

944
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,711
Tteokbokki for one, please.

945
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:08,544
Miss.

946
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:10,709
Do you have money?

947
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:12,803
I do. Why do you ask?

948
00:51:12,908 --> 00:51:17,314
-Actually, you have to pay first.
-I see.

949
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,103
Oh, then I'll pay now.

950
00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:24,511
-Can I get one bag of onions?
-Which one?

951
00:51:24,634 --> 00:51:26,225
-This one.
-This one?

952
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:27,720
Oh my.

953
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:29,975
I ran out of plastic bags.

954
00:51:30,164 --> 00:51:32,568
Here's an onion net.

955
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:35,169
I'll put them in here. How nice.

956
00:51:40,133 --> 00:51:42,523
My bag. Where is it?

957
00:51:44,014 --> 00:51:45,135
My bag.

958
00:51:45,514 --> 00:51:48,418
What do you think you're doing?

959
00:51:48,813 --> 00:51:52,435
-What?
-Why are you putting onions in my bag?

960
00:51:52,534 --> 00:51:54,619
This is a bag?
I thought it was an onion net.

961
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,150
It's not an onion net.

962
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:00,650
This is from Moore Moosh
2017 F/W vintage collection...

963
00:52:01,048 --> 00:52:03,344
Never mind. Move aside.

964
00:52:03,715 --> 00:52:05,266
Wait.

965
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,057
It smells like onions.

966
00:52:09,144 --> 00:52:11,075
-I apologize.
-It's my bag!

967
00:52:19,626 --> 00:52:20,614
Hi, Hyewon.

968
00:52:21,029 --> 00:52:22,843
What? A blind date?

969
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:26,782
No, thanks. I'm busy job hunting.

970
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:29,573
What? He looks like Kang Daniel?

971
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,965
Where is it?

972
00:52:38,562 --> 00:52:40,362
Hyewon. I'm here.

973
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:43,164
Hey...Seojin...

974
00:52:47,756 --> 00:52:49,857
Sorry I'm late.

975
00:52:50,843 --> 00:52:53,093
Seojin, what's that smell?

976
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:55,106
It smells like onions.

977
00:52:55,781 --> 00:52:58,382
Sorry. Something outrageous happened.

978
00:53:02,032 --> 00:53:04,235
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

979
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:05,449
It's fine.

980
00:53:06,824 --> 00:53:09,039
I'm Kang Seojin.

981
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:12,066
Did you like the food, Donggu?

982
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:14,437
Yes, it was great.

983
00:53:14,752 --> 00:53:16,636
Would you like a gum?

984
00:53:19,549 --> 00:53:20,444
No.

985
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:22,065
It's okay, I'll...

986
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:31,702
What is it? Are you okay?

987
00:53:31,802 --> 00:53:35,175
-My neck hurts from stress.
-Really?

988
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:36,799
A foot massage will relieve your stress.

989
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,518
-I can give you a foot massage.
-What?

990
00:53:38,621 --> 00:53:41,418
-Give my your foot.
-No, no!

991
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,110
No, why would you give me one? I'm fine.

992
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:48,792
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to help relieve your stress.

993
00:53:49,783 --> 00:53:51,996
It's fine. A foot massage
is a bit too much...

994
00:53:52,081 --> 00:53:54,690
Donggu, can I speak to you?

995
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,584
Why?

996
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:01,887
What are you doing?

997
00:54:02,058 --> 00:54:03,136
What did I do this time?

998
00:54:03,256 --> 00:54:04,655
Why did you refuse that foot massage?

999
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:07,348
Why didn't you let her give you
a foot massage?

1000
00:54:07,448 --> 00:54:11,144
I met her yesterday.
I can't let her massage my foot.

1001
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,288
There you go again.

1002
00:54:12,578 --> 00:54:16,096
Don't you think that I don't know that you
refused the foot massage because of me.

1003
00:54:16,203 --> 00:54:17,394
That's not true.

1004
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:22,143
-It wasn't because of you.
-Then why did you refuse her?

1005
00:54:22,249 --> 00:54:25,363
One minute of a foot massage will relieve
all of your stress.

1006
00:54:25,463 --> 00:54:28,266
-Why did you refuse it?
-Fine, I'll let her do it.

1007
00:54:28,548 --> 00:54:30,278
I'll let her massage my foot.

1008
00:54:44,957 --> 00:54:46,663
Where is he?

1009
00:54:46,967 --> 00:54:48,982
Did he go to the bathroom?

1010
00:54:51,683 --> 00:54:53,273
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1011
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:56,698
The guy that was sitting here.
Where did he go?

1012
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:58,598
He paid the bill and left.

1013
00:54:58,695 --> 00:54:59,981
He left?

1014
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:03,999
But we're on a blind date.

1015
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:12,868
Hi, Hyewon.

1016
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:17,969
Daeyoung left without a word
while I was in the bathroom.

1017
00:55:18,084 --> 00:55:19,085
What's up with him?

1018
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:21,782
Why did you wear that outfit
to a blind date?

1019
00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:23,555
And that weird onion net.

1020
00:55:23,655 --> 00:55:26,943
It's not an onion net. It's a net bag!

1021
00:55:27,034 --> 00:55:31,438
These clothes are from Moore Moosh,
the luxury brand.

1022
00:55:34,286 --> 00:55:37,777
He ran away because of my outfit?

1023
00:55:38,604 --> 00:55:41,857
He did. I'm hanging up.

1024
00:55:44,346 --> 00:55:45,635
Unbelievable.

1025
00:55:45,854 --> 00:55:48,960
They know nothing about fashion.

1026
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:51,682
He didn't even look like Kang Daniel.

1027
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,152
How is this possible.

1028
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,074
How could we pick the wrong one
every time?

1029
00:56:05,176 --> 00:56:06,852
I don't know.

1030
00:56:06,952 --> 00:56:09,849
You made me lose all of my money.

1031
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:13,073
I said we should go.

1032
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:14,873
What am I going to do?

1033
00:56:17,787 --> 00:56:20,581
Dusik, I'm sorry.

1034
00:56:20,695 --> 00:56:22,089
Dusik.

1035
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:23,801
I'm sorry.

1036
00:56:23,885 --> 00:56:24,799
Dusik!

1037
00:56:24,899 --> 00:56:26,330
Dusik, I'm sorry.

1038
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,729
Dusik, I'm sorry.

1039
00:56:29,814 --> 00:56:31,505
Forget it. Now what are we going to do?

1040
00:56:31,634 --> 00:56:34,702
-We don't even have bus fare to go home!
-This is nuts.

1041
00:56:35,002 --> 00:56:36,901
We can't walk home.

1042
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:40,129
Looks like you lost everything.

1043
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:41,335
Hello.

1044
00:56:41,834 --> 00:56:43,793
Greed brings misfortune.

1045
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,574
Take this.

1046
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,634
But you have to promise never
to return to this place.

1047
00:56:52,733 --> 00:56:54,950
Yes, of course.
I will never come here again.

1048
00:56:57,136 --> 00:57:00,360
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it. Good bye.

1049
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:02,301
You can never quit.

1050
00:57:03,408 --> 00:57:04,409
Thank you.

1051
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:07,210
Thank goodness.

1052
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,325
Now we can go home, right?

1053
00:57:12,234 --> 00:57:14,033
The bus is coming.

1054
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:15,436
Wait, Dusik.

1055
00:57:15,646 --> 00:57:16,731
What is it now?

1056
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:18,544
It's a shame to leave like this.

1057
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:22,530
-Let's do one last bet.
-What?

1058
00:57:22,614 --> 00:57:23,949
We don't have any money...

1059
00:57:24,617 --> 00:57:27,044
What? You want to bet this money?

1060
00:57:27,128 --> 00:57:28,945
What are you going to tell Malgeum?

1061
00:57:29,037 --> 00:57:31,433
She's depending on you.

1062
00:57:31,557 --> 00:57:34,363
We just need one win. Then you can
pay the penalty fees for Malgeum,

1063
00:57:34,453 --> 00:57:36,440
and we can make a movie.

1064
00:57:37,605 --> 00:57:39,718
And maybe you could even marry Malgeum.

1065
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,415
Dusik.

1066
00:57:41,713 --> 00:57:42,740
Let's go!

1067
00:57:42,914 --> 00:57:44,609
Let's do this!

1068
00:57:45,687 --> 00:57:46,606
Marry her?

1069
00:57:59,703 --> 00:58:02,853
I shouldn't have listened to you.

1070
00:58:04,352 --> 00:58:06,352
I had a good feeling about this time.

1071
00:58:06,456 --> 00:58:07,836
Shut up and keep walking.

1072
00:58:07,959 --> 00:58:09,658
It's freezing.
How are we going to get home?

1073
00:58:09,758 --> 00:58:10,541
Keep walking.

1074
00:58:11,274 --> 00:58:12,261
Dusik.

1075
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,475
Look at this.

1076
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:18,065
It's 500 won.

1077
00:58:18,176 --> 00:58:20,294
So what?!

1078
00:58:20,385 --> 00:58:21,179
Wait.

1079
00:58:21,462 --> 00:58:23,387
You want to bet again? Are you crazy?

1080
00:58:23,487 --> 00:58:25,678
We just need one win. Then you can
pay the penalty fees for Malgeum,

1081
00:58:25,778 --> 00:58:26,674
and we can make a movie.

1082
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:29,356
And maybe you could even marry Malgeum.

1083
00:58:30,488 --> 00:58:32,157
Plus you can raise your children rich.

1084
00:58:32,889 --> 00:58:34,889
Dusik. Let's go.

1085
00:58:35,154 --> 00:58:36,481
Let's do this!

1086
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:38,881
Rich children?

1087
00:58:47,995 --> 00:58:50,682
I shouldn't have listened to you.

1088
00:58:50,766 --> 00:58:52,279
I'm such an idiot!

1089
00:58:53,068 --> 00:58:55,173
I really thought we'd win this time.

1090
00:58:57,305 --> 00:58:58,190
Dusik.

1091
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:01,482
Look, a beer bottle.

1092
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:04,594
-What about it?!
-You brat!

1093
00:59:04,695 --> 00:59:06,882
One bottle costs 130 won.

1094
00:59:06,966 --> 00:59:10,189
We can make some seed money
if we sell a few of these.

1095
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:11,888
If we win,

1096
00:59:11,972 --> 00:59:15,352
we get the penalty fees and our movie. You
can get married and raise your kids rich.

1097
00:59:15,442 --> 00:59:16,264
What do you think?

1098
00:59:16,556 --> 00:59:18,637
Dusik. Let's go!

1099
00:59:18,737 --> 00:59:21,343
-Let's do this!
-You're insane.

1100
00:59:21,443 --> 00:59:23,809
Who sells beer bottles to make bets?

1101
00:59:23,911 --> 00:59:25,596
We just need to find a few more.

1102
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,393
Be more ambitious, Dusik.

1103
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:28,792
Let's go!

1104
00:59:28,905 --> 00:59:30,897
Let's go home!

1105
00:59:30,998 --> 00:59:32,344
Come on, you crazy man!

1106
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:34,358
-Jeez!
-Wait.

1107
00:59:34,834 --> 00:59:39,450
We're doing a promotion on chocolates
for White Day. Come and have a look.

1108
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,976
The top prize is return tickets
to Jeju Island.

1109
00:59:42,067 --> 00:59:43,988
Come and participate.

1110
00:59:44,161 --> 00:59:46,269
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1111
00:59:46,467 --> 00:59:48,375
Can I have a go?

1112
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:51,599
Sure, of course.

1113
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:05,535
Fourth prize!

1114
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:09,209
What's the prize?

1115
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,490
-Here you go.
-Wow.

1116
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,084
Awesome.

1117
01:00:13,496 --> 01:00:14,514
Awesome.

1118
01:00:15,701 --> 01:00:17,150
Thank you.

1119
01:00:21,456 --> 01:00:23,359
Thank you.

1120
01:00:46,697 --> 01:00:48,990
These candies are really good.

1121
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:14,404
We could've made another bet
if we had collected more beer bottles.

1122
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,802
I saw five bottles on the way.

1123
01:01:16,981 --> 01:01:19,243
You lack ambition.

1124
01:01:19,432 --> 01:01:22,350
Shut up, you loser!
Shut up!

1125
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:23,868
Hey Dusik.

1126
01:01:24,352 --> 01:01:25,249
Wait.

1127
01:01:25,951 --> 01:01:28,658
-I know that face.
-What are you talking about?

1128
01:01:29,464 --> 01:01:30,250
What the heck?

1129
01:01:30,765 --> 01:01:32,067
Isn't that Seojin?

1130
01:01:32,163 --> 01:01:33,351
I think so.

1131
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:36,181
It is her.

1132
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:37,535
Hey, Seojin.

1133
01:01:38,251 --> 01:01:39,550
Wake up.

1134
01:01:39,634 --> 01:01:41,251
Leave me be!

1135
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:44,164
You know nothing about fashion.

1136
01:01:44,264 --> 01:01:45,395
She stinks of booze.

1137
01:01:45,515 --> 01:01:48,302
She drank this much during daytime?

1138
01:01:49,187 --> 01:01:52,015
Look at that.
She found a empty can...

1139
01:01:55,968 --> 01:01:57,908
-Dusik.
-What is it now?

1140
01:01:58,893 --> 01:01:59,891
Look.

1141
01:02:00,376 --> 01:02:01,492
It's money.

1142
01:02:01,596 --> 01:02:02,392
What?

1143
01:02:02,578 --> 01:02:04,015
Why does she have money in the can?

1144
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,605
We can make one more bet
before they close.

1145
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,300
-What do you think?
-What?

1146
01:02:08,622 --> 01:02:10,127
You want to bet again with this money?

1147
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:13,774
-Are you insane?
-God won't turn us down this time.

1148
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:14,981
Dusik.

1149
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:16,588
Let's go.

1150
01:02:16,782 --> 01:02:18,998
-Let's do this!
-Shut up!

1151
01:02:19,087 --> 01:02:20,604
You're insane.

1152
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:25,281
Fine, forget it.

1153
01:02:25,482 --> 01:02:28,989
You won't be able to pay the penalty
fees for Malgeum, or get married.

1154
01:02:29,077 --> 01:02:32,463
You'll die as a pathetic loner.

1155
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,573
Forget about it.

1156
01:02:34,355 --> 01:02:36,577
-I don't want that.
-Dusik.

1157
01:02:36,977 --> 01:02:38,873
Let's make one more bet.

1158
01:02:39,657 --> 01:02:40,577
Dusik.

1159
01:02:40,968 --> 01:02:43,544
Let's go. Let's do this!

1160
01:02:43,947 --> 01:02:47,156
Yes, I can't die a loner.

1161
01:02:47,344 --> 01:02:48,440
Let's go.

1162
01:02:48,534 --> 01:02:49,863
Let's do this!

1163
01:02:53,223 --> 01:02:54,217
Let's go!

1164
01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:55,336
Run!

1165
01:03:02,892 --> 01:03:04,297
I'll get going.

1166
01:03:04,397 --> 01:03:06,001
Get home safely, Yerin.

1167
01:03:06,102 --> 01:03:08,917
Donggu, I really like you.

1168
01:03:09,017 --> 01:03:10,941
Would you like to date me exclusively?

1169
01:03:15,726 --> 01:03:18,450
But Yerin...

1170
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:20,865
I have to tell you something.

1171
01:03:21,357 --> 01:03:26,656
You are pretty, intelligent,
funny, considerate...

1172
01:03:26,756 --> 01:03:30,117
...and you're a great cook and
you give great foot massages.

1173
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:33,255
You can even clean clears so well.
You're perfect, but...

1174
01:03:35,138 --> 01:03:38,632
I think I'm not good enough for you.

1175
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,221
-Also...
-Wait.

1176
01:03:41,042 --> 01:03:42,632
You're turning me down, right?

1177
01:03:42,732 --> 01:03:44,538
-No, actually...
-Why?

1178
01:03:44,638 --> 01:03:47,031
Do you like someone else?

1179
01:03:47,622 --> 01:03:48,339
What?

1180
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,030
-No, but...
-My hunch was right.

1181
01:03:53,103 --> 01:03:55,595
I have no idea what you mean...

1182
01:03:56,997 --> 01:03:59,195
You mean, Sua and me?

1183
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:01,677
She and I are just friends.

1184
01:04:01,798 --> 01:04:04,267
-We're nothing more than friends...
-I'm not talking about Sua.

1185
01:04:04,368 --> 01:04:06,352
-I'm talking about Yuna.
-What?

1186
01:04:06,769 --> 01:04:08,456
You do like her.

1187
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,859
How did you...

1188
01:04:09,943 --> 01:04:12,060
-How did you know...
-I can read these things.

1189
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:13,810
Don't try to lie.

1190
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:16,300
I'm sorry, Yerin.

1191
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:19,594
-Can you keep this a secret?
-Sure.

1192
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,785
I'll get going now.

1193
01:04:20,885 --> 01:04:22,398
Thank you.

1194
01:04:22,707 --> 01:04:24,691
-Take care.
-Bye.

1195
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,393
Bye.

1196
01:04:31,915 --> 01:04:37,209
Even Yerin who seemed
perfect had a flaw.

1197
01:04:38,187 --> 01:04:39,021
What?

1198
01:04:40,389 --> 01:04:43,678
-Donggu likes Yuna?
-Yes.

1199
01:04:43,773 --> 01:04:46,700
I asked him to be my boyfriend
but he turned me down.

1200
01:04:46,901 --> 01:04:49,078
I got a gut feeling right then.

1201
01:04:49,178 --> 01:04:50,985
So, I asked him and he told me.

1202
01:04:51,209 --> 01:04:53,385
Donggu told you this?

1203
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:56,560
Okay, bye.

1204
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:02,778
Donggu likes Yuna?

1205
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:05,409
Wait...

1206
01:05:05,907 --> 01:05:08,116
What if she notices that I like her
when I give this to her?

1207
01:05:08,202 --> 01:05:10,416
I was going to ask her to give it to Sua,
but I can do it myself.

1208
01:05:10,501 --> 01:05:11,702
Sua, here.

1209
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,603
Wow, it suits you.

1210
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,439
Didn't Yuna say she was going
to the supermarket?

1211
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:21,611
Where are you going?

1212
01:05:23,899 --> 01:05:27,410
My goodness, let's start cleaning.

1213
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:30,822
Donggu... You..

1214
01:05:31,323 --> 01:05:32,218
You...!

1215
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:33,432
What?

1216
01:05:33,734 --> 01:05:35,016
-What is it?
-Darn it.

1217
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:39,398
That's why you ran out to the supermarket
and the coat...

1218
01:05:39,965 --> 01:05:43,766
The person you like is not me, but...

1219
01:05:43,866 --> 01:05:45,065
...Yuna?

1220
01:05:46,267 --> 01:05:46,993
What?

1221
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:50,691
What are you talking about?

1222
01:05:50,968 --> 01:05:52,883
Don't pretend like that.
Yerin told me everything.

1223
01:05:52,968 --> 01:05:54,071
What?

1224
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:57,536
She promised to keep it a secret.
She told you already?

1225
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,525
Donggu, did you see Yerin off?

1226
01:06:05,037 --> 01:06:05,857
What?

1227
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,070
This is unbelievable.

1228
01:06:14,267 --> 01:06:16,385
Wow, this is incredible.

1229
01:06:18,264 --> 01:06:19,271
Sua, what's wrong?

1230
01:06:19,371 --> 01:06:20,590
Did something happen?

1231
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,463
Donggu doesn't like me but...

1232
01:06:44,025 --> 01:06:47,113
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1233
01:06:47,231 --> 01:06:48,633
Yuna, take this.

1234
01:06:48,734 --> 01:06:50,640
Sua and I are just friends.

1235
01:06:50,767 --> 01:06:53,459
Yes, Donggu likes someone else.

1236
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,262
Seol, stop crying.

1237
01:06:55,362 --> 01:06:56,450
What's wrong?

1238
01:06:56,534 --> 01:06:58,258
Excuse me, can I help?

1239
01:06:58,367 --> 01:06:59,335
That's amazing.

1240
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:00,534
You saved me.

1241
01:07:00,634 --> 01:07:04,524
A new teacher is here today.
Let me introduce him.

1242
01:07:04,624 --> 01:07:07,244
He's Song Hyeonjun.
A star patissier.

1243
01:07:07,331 --> 01:07:09,474
She's your first love, right?

1244
01:07:09,574 --> 01:07:11,344
These photos are bringing back memories.

1245
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:13,372
You and I were inseparable.

1246
01:07:13,479 --> 01:07:16,763
-Since when did you like me?
-What are you talking about?

1247
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,446
-Am I your first love?
-What?

1248
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:21,539
You don't have a job
but you're taking a nap.

1249
01:07:21,634 --> 01:07:23,541
-You're so laid back.
-This jerk.

1250
01:07:23,641 --> 01:07:25,916
-I'll kill you.
-Stop it, you two.

1251
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,508
They'll fall in love soon.

1252
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:28,996
What? Fall in love?

1253
01:07:29,096 --> 01:07:33,305
Even if we get stranded on an island,
nothing will happen between us.
