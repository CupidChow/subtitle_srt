1
00:00:01,016 --> 00:00:03,015
You did great today. See you tomorrow.

2
00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:04,404
-Thank you, sir.
-Seongbin!

3
00:00:18,115 --> 00:00:19,219
Excuse me.

4
00:00:20,427 --> 00:00:22,632
-Yes?
-Well...

5
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,442
-Yes.
-Could you take a photo of Seongbin?

6
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:31,046
Sure.

7
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:35,860
Here we go.

8
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:39,850
One, two, three.

9
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:43,445
Thank you.

10
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,642
Jungi, let's watch movie this weekend.

11
00:00:57,866 --> 00:00:59,555
New movie I want to see is out.

12
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:01,864
We haven't been on a date for a while.

13
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:03,055
Sure.

14
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:05,672
What's wrong?

15
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:06,969
Did something happen?

16
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,271
Well...

17
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:11,663
I thought if the drama is aired,

18
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:14,655
people would recognize
me and have some fans.

19
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:16,951
But nothing changed.

20
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:20,054
Hey, soon you will have some fans.

21
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:21,956
Will that day even come?

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,071
We're here.

23
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:25,646
Did you go for grocery shopping?

24
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:26,646
Yes.

25
00:01:27,557 --> 00:01:30,253
Wow, you two look like newlyweds.

26
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:33,768
Newlyweds? That's too much.

27
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:36,463
You're right. That's too much.

28
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:39,375
God, you like it so much.

29
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:43,280
Hold on. Then, Donggu is Seol's father?

30
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,881
Seol's father.

31
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,263
SeolFa.

32
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:51,464
Hey, what do you mean Seol's father.
You went too far.

33
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,946
You're right. Jungi, stop it.

34
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,057
God, that's hard to see.

35
00:01:57,255 --> 00:01:58,942
Yuna, what's that?

36
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:03,746
Right. It's for Jungi,
but there's no sender name.

37
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:04,835
Really?

38
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:06,629
Who sent it?

39
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:15,794
What is this?

40
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:17,690
"Jungi, I love you. Forever"

41
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:19,000
What is it?

42
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,190
Oh my god!

43
00:02:20,498 --> 00:02:22,453
What is that? Is that blood?

44
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:23,780
"I love you, Jungi"

45
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:24,548
Yes.

46
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:26,357
I think so.

47
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:31,762
-Yes, hello?
-Jungi.

48
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:35,559
Did you get my present?

49
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,337
Present?

50
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:41,828
Is it...

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,622
Wait...

52
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:45,304
Who are you?

53
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:47,633
It's me. Jinju.

54
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:48,730
Jungi.

55
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:50,530
Don't you know me?

56
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:51,619
Jinju?

57
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,413
I've never heard of it.

58
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,524
What?

59
00:02:56,234 --> 00:03:00,413
How could you not know me? How?

60
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,513
I spend all day thinking about you.
I look at you everyday.

61
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:07,398
You are really bad!

62
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:15,199
-What the...
-Why, why? Who is it?

63
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:17,279
I think she sent me this.

64
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:18,699
-What?
-What?

65
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:20,781
She even knows your number?

66
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:23,178
Is she a stalker?

67
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,276
You know, fans sometimes
get obsessed too much.

68
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,880
You mean, I have a fan?

69
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:29,723
It's not the time for that.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,025
Jungi, let's report to the police
before something happens.

71
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:36,009
We don't need to report for this. Don't.

72
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:38,939
She's my fan. She loves me.

73
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:41,836
-It's fine.
-Hello? Is this a police station?

74
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:49,438
Look at your drive. You really can't drive.

75
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:54,053
How could you do that to me! I'm a beginner!
How could you throw banana to me?

76
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:55,750
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,258
Let's go! I win!

78
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:01,660
How can you talk to me and play?

79
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:03,953
Hey, hey. Losers don't talk.

80
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:06,652
Anyway, you lose.
Go and cook instant noodle.

81
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:08,644
You sneaky cheater.

82
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:12,237
-You wanna fight?
-Do you want eggs? No, I'll just cook.

83
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:15,130
-Seojin, tell me if you want too.
-Alright.

84
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,931
Make it delicious.

85
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:19,535
Why do you bully him all the time?

86
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,991
I don't know.
Making fun of Dusik is really fun.

87
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:27,616
Hello?

88
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,670
Yes, sure. Alright.

89
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,994
Why? What was that?

90
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:33,700
You know that stalker. She's caught.

91
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:39,854
We caught her in nearby
cyber PC room by tracing her number.

92
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,148
I'm sorry, Jungi.

93
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:47,155
I really like you, that's why.

94
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:50,248
You are really cool.

95
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,768
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

96
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:58,363
It's true.

97
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:01,664
What will you do?
Do you want her to be punished?

98
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,079
You.

99
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:19,545
You promised that you won't do it,
so I'm letting you go this time.

100
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:20,536
Alright?

101
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:21,544
Yes.

102
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:22,758
But, do you...

103
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,655
...like me that much?

104
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:28,136
Yes. I like you so much.

105
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:31,144
I became your fan right away,
when I saw you.

106
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:33,734
You were gangster's henchman
from "Cold Blood",

107
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:37,946
radiation mutant from "Mutant City",
kidnapper from "My Mom",

108
00:05:38,043 --> 00:05:43,093
driver from "Korean Harp in My Heart",
and Octopus Man from "Super Aquaman".

109
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:45,206
I saw all the movies.

110
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,482
Really? You saw all that?

111
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,388
Of course.

112
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:53,585
I have all your movies in DVD.

113
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:58,117
What? I don't even have them.
You are really awesome.

114
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,117
Did you say you are Jinju?

115
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:04,707
Jinju, if you want to see me,
just call me and come to my house.

116
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:07,038
-My address is...
-Seoul, Yong San District,

117
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:11,031
Huam Dong Street 31,
Waikiki Guesthouse,

118
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:13,463
...first floor next to restroom.

119
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,352
How did you know that?

120
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:16,336
That's...

121
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,439
...not important right now.

122
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:20,249
What?

123
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:24,263
Alright. Aren't you hungry?

124
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:25,747
Do you want spicy rice cakes?

125
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:27,747
Yes, Jungi!

126
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:29,041
Let's go.

127
00:06:29,244 --> 00:06:31,439
I'm really happy now.

128
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:41,500
-Okay, it's good, Ahyoung.
-Yes.

129
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:44,714
You must be busy with work. Thank you
for helping me with the shooting.

130
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,326
No, it's fine.
I can earn some extra money too.

131
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,014
-Sua, I need to use the restroom.
-Sure, give me.

132
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:51,713
-Thank you, sis.
-Sure.

133
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:57,080
What? What's this sound?

134
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:02,900
Hey, Bong Dusik.
Is this sound coming from your heart?

135
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:03,806
What?

136
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,795
No, no. It's not. No.

137
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,287
What no?

138
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:09,882
Are you into Ahyoung?

139
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:12,406
If you like her, ask her out.

140
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:14,414
What, no. No. What date...

141
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,017
Really...

142
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:20,526
Ahyoung, Dusik wants to watch
a movie with you.

143
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:22,446
-Hey! What's with you!
-What?

144
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:26,468
With Dusik? I like movies. What movie?

145
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,253
Well...

146
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:30,468
Anything you want to watch.

147
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:32,857
When should we watch, Dusik?

148
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,925
Mom...

149
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:48,322
Mom...

150
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:50,632
Oh my god!

151
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:53,929
Jinju.

152
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:56,222
What are you doing here?

153
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:59,207
You said I can come anytime I want.

154
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,120
The way you sleep was really beautiful,

155
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,025
so I was watching you.

156
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,907
Since when?

157
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:07,796
Around yesterday midnight?

158
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,312
Midnight?

159
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,011
I see...

160
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:14,927
I did not know that.

161
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:20,635
What? What's all these?

162
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:25,125
Well, I didn't want
other people next to your photo.

163
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,400
So I changed it to my photo.

164
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,324
Why?

165
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:36,816
Don't you like it?

166
00:08:38,011 --> 00:08:43,028
Well... No, no. I like it. It's good.

167
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:44,624
That's a relief.

168
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:47,917
God, why is it so noisy?

169
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,425
What? Who are you?

170
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:51,490
Why do you want to know?

171
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:53,593
Jungi and I are talking here.
Can't you see?

172
00:08:53,894 --> 00:08:54,601
What?

173
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,723
Jungi!

174
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:11,516
Let's eat breakfast together!

175
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:14,310
I prepared breakfast for you.

176
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:16,725
Breakfast for me?

177
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:19,413
Sure. I'll be out.

178
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,610
Come quick.

179
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,816
Sure.

180
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:29,617
What? Who's she? Who's that scary woman?

181
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:35,004
That's what I mean! I was so scared.
I pretended to sleep. Who's she?

182
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,360
My fan. The one who sent me the photos.

183
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,061
What? Is she that stalker?

184
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:46,148
No, she's not stalker. She's my fan.

185
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:48,354
She likes me too much, that's why.

186
00:09:49,444 --> 00:09:51,916
Well, I'm going to eat
breakfast with my fan.

187
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:56,264
-That's a stalker.
-No, fan.

188
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
-That's a stalker.
-Don't eat!

189
00:09:57,455 --> 00:10:00,058
God, he might face some troubles.

190
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,132
Dusik!

191
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:10,838
Yes, here.

192
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:15,774
Wow, Ahyoung. You're really pretty today.

193
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:18,584
Is it? I've paid a little
attention as I was meeting you.

194
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:20,974
-Is it nice?
-Yes. It's pretty.

195
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,387
Really pretty.

196
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:23,569
Thanks.

197
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:25,680
You look handsome too.

198
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:28,283
But, do you enjoy
wearing sweat suit a lot?

199
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:30,774
Yes, I do. It's comfortable so I enjoy.

200
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:32,560
I see.

201
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,068
You bought popcorn and coke too?

202
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:36,362
You are witty.

203
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,774
Really?

204
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:39,468
Shall we go in?

205
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:43,676
Movie was really good, right?

206
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,478
Shall we go eat something nice?

207
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:48,561
-It's fine. I want to go home.
-What?

208
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:49,762
Why?

209
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:51,379
Don't you know?

210
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:53,246
You are really frustrating me!

211
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,040
What? What did I do?

212
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:59,334
What's wrong all of a sudden? Ahyoung!

213
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:00,635
Ahyoung!

214
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,109
Seol. Shall we learn some Korean?

215
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,827
The first word you need to learn is...

216
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:09,119
Dad!
It's dad.

217
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:10,723
Okay? Now.

218
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:13,215
Say Dad.

219
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:14,223
Da...

220
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:18,798
Seol. You should concentrate,
when you're learning. Alright?

221
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:20,100
Now, again.

222
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,279
Dad.

223
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,358
Dad.

224
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:26,175
Please say dad once.

225
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:37,134
What is it? You were so excited
to go out on a date. What's wrong?

226
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:39,022
Well...

227
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:45,025
What? She was suddenly angry
after the movies and went home?

228
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,225
Yes. She did.

229
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:49,424
Think harder. She must be angry
because you did something wrong.

230
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:51,130
I didn't make any mistake.

231
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:53,334
I arrived 30 minutes early.

232
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:54,633
I reserved tickets for the movie
she wanted to watch.

233
00:11:54,728 --> 00:11:57,617
I bought popcorn and Coke in advance.
The movie was fun too.

234
00:11:57,729 --> 00:12:00,388
-But she was angry at me and went home.
-What was wrong...

235
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:03,286
-Maybe, popcorn was not tasty?
-No.

236
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:04,988
She ate the whole thing.

237
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:07,079
Is it? Then what?

238
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:10,981
Maybe you bought regular Coke
instead of Diet Coke?

239
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:13,584
No, she asked me to give my coke too.
She drank two cups.

240
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:14,766
Really?

241
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:19,473
Right! Maybe she just
didn't like how you look.

242
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:23,275
When I look at your face, I feel offended.

243
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:25,842
-That's nonsense!
-No, it's not.

244
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:28,247
What did I do wrong?

245
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:31,049
Dusik. Let's play game
and bet instant noodle.

246
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:33,282
What's wrong?

247
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:34,762
What happened?

248
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,857
Well...

249
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:42,667
God... Ahyoung must be angry.

250
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,183
What? Why?

251
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:45,758
What did I do wrong?

252
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:47,869
Don't you know?

253
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:51,461
Look. You two aren't going
out, but still it's a date.

254
00:12:51,558 --> 00:12:53,667
How can you wear sweat suit?

255
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,078
Sweat suit? Why?

256
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,873
Hey, Ahyoung must have paid a lot of
attention on her appearance to meet you.

257
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:02,153
How could you just
simply wear sweat suit?

258
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:03,560
Of course, it makes her angry.

259
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:06,652
Well, I wore one of my best sweat suit.

260
00:13:07,357 --> 00:13:08,264
Look here.

261
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:10,466
It's a frog.

262
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:11,651
But this can make her angry?

263
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:14,868
Yes, this sweat suit is nice.
It's really cute.

264
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:16,455
-Right?
-God...

265
00:13:16,558 --> 00:13:20,057
How could you not know women this much?

266
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:24,551
Anyway, Ahyoung is very sensitive
in fashion so you pay attention to it.

267
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:26,862
Okay.

268
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:44,082
Jungi!

269
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:47,516
"Skin bright like milk, Lee Jungi"

270
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:51,827
Skin bright like milk, Lee Jungi!

271
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:54,670
I love you, Lee Jungi!

272
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:00,577
Jungi, great effort today!

273
00:14:00,662 --> 00:14:02,784
Jungi, have this drink.

274
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:05,979
This is vitamin to prevent fatigue.

275
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:09,757
This is candy for your sugar level.

276
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:13,249
Is this...

277
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,352
...all for me?

278
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:17,938
You shouldn't have.

279
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:19,550
Thank you.

280
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:22,748
Director, she's my fan.

281
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:24,240
You're popular now.

282
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:26,853
Seongbin!

283
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:28,853
She's my fan!

284
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:32,353
Mr. Security Guard! She's my fan.

285
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,821
Why did you ask me out again?

286
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,711
Ahyoung, I'm sorry for yesterday.

287
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,203
What's sorry?

288
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:47,785
I simply wore sweat suit, yesterday.

289
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:48,889
I'm sorry.

290
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:55,570
Well, you do know.

291
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:58,775
I'm sorry. I didn't think that through.

292
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:00,950
I will treat you with delicious food.

293
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:03,664
There's really tasty cake shop nearby,
shall we go?

294
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:06,186
Wow, cake is really delicious.

295
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,292
I was getting lot of stress from work.
I wanted something sweet.

296
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:11,090
Why? Did something happen?

297
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,101
Well, something annoying
happened in my company.

298
00:15:14,186 --> 00:15:17,783
Senior makes me do all the
work, while she takes a rest.

299
00:15:17,868 --> 00:15:19,267
Oh, really?

300
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:22,687
I was also really annoyed
by one of our shopping mall customers.

301
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,516
The cloth was torn and it was his fault,
but he wanted refund.

302
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:28,206
-It was really nonsense.
-What kind of person is that?

303
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,517
You must had a hard day too.

304
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,715
Well, it always happens.

305
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,103
You finished your coffee?

306
00:15:34,193 --> 00:15:36,888
-I will get a refill.
-No, it's fine. I'm going.

307
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:38,586
What?

308
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:42,167
Suddenly? What's wrong?
Did I do something?

309
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:43,985
Don't you know?

310
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,580
You're really frustrating!

311
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:49,858
What? What did I... Ahyoung!

312
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,255
What's wrong this time?

313
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,354
-Ahyoung must be angry at you.
-Really?

314
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:58,362
What did I do wrong?

315
00:15:58,455 --> 00:16:01,259
Ahyoung talked about
how much she was annoyed from work.

316
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:03,166
Why did you talk about
what you are experiencing?

317
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:05,761
What's wrong with that?
Is that something to be angry?

318
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:06,761
Why?

319
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:12,178
Ahyoung wanted you to listen to her,
be on her side and empathize with her.

320
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:16,873
So you should have sided with her,
comforted her or even just listened to her.

321
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:20,581
But you talked about your hardship.
That's why she was angry.

322
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,777
Really?

323
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:25,785
That's the reason why.

324
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,882
Great job.

325
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:29,189
Thank you.

326
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:30,935
Thank you. Thank you.

327
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,229
Safe trip.

328
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:38,721
What do I do? What if I cry today?

329
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:41,025
It's Jinju.

330
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:43,414
God, she must be here to see me again.

331
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,533
She likes me so much.

332
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:49,705
"Be mine, ASTAR"

333
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:50,705
Jinju.

334
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:51,999
Hey, Jungi!

335
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:56,104
You are here again? Let's go.
I will treat you with hot co...

336
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,922
What's all this?

337
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:05,800
This is ASTAR fan club T-shirt.
This is light stick A-bar.

338
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:08,798
I'm ASTAR's fan.

339
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:10,205
ASTAR...

340
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,507
You had other stars you like except me?

341
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:17,102
Among actors, you. Among singers,

342
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:18,813
ASTAR!

343
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:21,400
I see...

344
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,306
We're supposed to watch
my drama together.

345
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,393
I know. I'll be there right
after ASTAR's concert.

346
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,331
You're handsome.

347
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:42,504
You're handsome.

348
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:46,068
"Waikiki Guest House"

349
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:51,749
It's done. Good. This must be enough.

350
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:56,145
But, it's almost time.
Why isn't Jinju here?

351
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:59,240
What are all these? It looks tasty.

352
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,256
-Hey.
-It hurts!

353
00:18:00,321 --> 00:18:01,434
Don't you dare touch.

354
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:04,535
I'm gonna eat these with Jinju,
while watching my drama.

355
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:07,821
You prepared snacks for that stalker?

356
00:18:07,944 --> 00:18:09,035
What stalker?

357
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:11,630
She's my fan! Fan! My fan!

358
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,328
God, why isn't she here?

359
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,431
Jungi...

360
00:18:27,888 --> 00:18:29,295
Did something happen to her?

361
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,896
Drama is over. Why isn't she here?

362
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:33,689
She's not picking her phone.

363
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:35,793
Did something happen?

364
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:43,712
What?

365
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:46,501
I dialed her number just now.

366
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:48,218
Why is her phone turned off?

367
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:50,112
Is she...

368
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:52,973
...avoiding my call?

369
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:54,782
No, it won't.

370
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:56,465
It won't.

371
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:58,973
No, she won't. She won't.

372
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,873
She won't...

373
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:16,490
Jungi, what are you doing here?

374
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:20,086
Well... We were supposed to watch
my drama together.

375
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:24,923
But you didn't come or answer my call.
I thought something happened to you.

376
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:29,826
-Well... How did you know my house?
-What?

377
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:35,335
That's not important now.

378
00:19:35,828 --> 00:19:37,128
Why didn't you come yesterday?

379
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:40,914
ASTAR's concert finished late...

380
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:42,910
Is that so?

381
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:46,918
Then, did you watch my drama?

382
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:51,170
No... I was too tired, I slept right away.

383
00:19:51,268 --> 00:19:52,368
I see...

384
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:54,971
That can happen.

385
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,418
Right. I downloaded my drama.
Do you want to see it together later?

386
00:19:59,722 --> 00:20:01,013
Sure.

387
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,711
I'll go to your house.

388
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:07,724
Really? Sure. I'll wait for you at home.

389
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,033
Alright.

390
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,219
Ahyoung, I'm sorry for yesterday.

391
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:18,719
What for?

392
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:22,409
You told me about your
work and what's annoying,

393
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:25,103
but I didn't listen to you,
and talked about my story only.

394
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:29,314
You do know. I was really disappointed.

395
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:32,023
I'm sorry. I really didn't know.

396
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:33,531
I won't do that from now on.

397
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:34,817
Alright.

398
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:37,031
So you are okay?

399
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,420
What should we do?

400
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:39,431
What do you want to do?

401
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:40,723
Forget it! I'm going.

402
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:42,421
You are frustrating.

403
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:45,939
Why? Why? What did I do wrong?

404
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:50,034
Don't you know?
How could you not think about what to do?

405
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,645
You should have planned it
before meeting me. It's manner.

406
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,447
What?

407
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,233
I'm sorry. Sorry.

408
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:58,154
I didn't think that through.

409
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:00,844
Then, the weather is really nice.

410
00:21:00,946 --> 00:21:02,305
Shall we go to the park and walk?

411
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,206
-Cherry blossoms are really pretty now.
-Forget it. I'm going.

412
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:06,995
You're really frustrating.

413
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:09,414
Why! Why! Why! Why!

414
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:11,815
What did I do so wrong?

415
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:14,307
Can't you see I'm wearing heels?

416
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:15,902
Go to park?

417
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,303
Do you want to see me suffering?

418
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:20,811
Sorry, sorry.

419
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:22,923
I really didn't think that through.

420
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:25,621
Then, shall we go to have some coffee?

421
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:27,328
Well, fine.

422
00:21:27,434 --> 00:21:28,518
Sure, sure.

423
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:30,203
Let's go.

424
00:21:30,307 --> 00:21:31,607
"Shiny ASTAR. I love you ASTAR."

425
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:40,872
Jinju, where are you?
Why aren't you here?

426
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:43,075
We are supposed to watch drama together.

427
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:45,369
God, it's him again.

428
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:47,162
What's wrong with him?

429
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:50,474
Where are you? Are you on your way?

430
00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:53,069
Jinju, why aren't you answering?

431
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:54,553
You read but you're not answering me.

432
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:57,994
God, he's really persistent.

433
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:01,684
Let's just forget about it.

434
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:06,367
Why aren't you picking it up?

435
00:22:07,277 --> 00:22:08,074
Jungi.

436
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:09,555
How did you come here?

437
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:12,650
That's not important right now.

438
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:14,642
What are you doing here?

439
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:17,261
Are you here to see ASTAR?

440
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:18,249
Then...

441
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,145
Did you break our
promise because of ASTAR?

442
00:22:22,348 --> 00:22:23,455
No...

443
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,242
I just forgot. Forgot.

444
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:28,750
I was just about to go.

445
00:22:29,053 --> 00:22:30,353
Really?

446
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,639
That's the reason, right?

447
00:22:33,138 --> 00:22:34,853
Then, shall we go?

448
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:41,762
I have a gift for you.

449
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:44,851
Tada!

450
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:46,149
What's this?

451
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:49,260
This is...

452
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:51,363
Jun's T-shirt.

453
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:57,959
And this is my light stick, Jun-bar.

454
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:05,983
Why?

455
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:07,769
Don't you like it?

456
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,388
No.

457
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:13,483
I love it. Wow.

458
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:14,777
Wow.

459
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:17,979
Wow.

460
00:23:19,384 --> 00:23:20,784
Jun-bar.

461
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:23,104
Wow.

462
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:28,215
Are you a true reporter?

463
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:30,754
Hey! It's me! Me! It's me.

464
00:23:33,763 --> 00:23:34,547
Jinju.

465
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:36,841
What are you doing?

466
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,960
Yes?

467
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,658
Why?

468
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,873
I'm on TV, why aren't you
cheering with Jun-bar?

469
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,055
You cheered so well for ASTAR.

470
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,539
I was going to. Wow!

471
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:54,853
What?

472
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:57,036
Did you just yawn?

473
00:23:58,133 --> 00:23:59,133
Are you sleepy already?

474
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,251
You cheered for ASTAR until late night.

475
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:06,561
I didn't yawn...

476
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:10,155
I was so surprised to see you act on TV.

477
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,287
Right?

478
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:16,287
That's me again!

479
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,573
Wow!

480
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:27,897
Ahyoung! Come, what are
you doing back there?

481
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:30,389
-Dusik.
-Be easy on me, Dusik.

482
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:32,905
Hey, there's no such thing in game.

483
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:35,913
Okay. I'm going!

484
00:24:36,904 --> 00:24:41,940
I'm first! I arrived first! First! First!

485
00:24:43,627 --> 00:24:44,829
I'm going.

486
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,631
-You are frustrating!
-Alright.

487
00:24:47,928 --> 00:24:49,020
I'm sorry.

488
00:24:49,516 --> 00:24:51,128
I made a mistake again.

489
00:24:51,535 --> 00:24:52,525
I'm sorry.

490
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,620
Then, I will cook instant noodle for you.

491
00:24:55,818 --> 00:24:57,038
Let's go.

492
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,465
Alright.

493
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:00,433
Let's go.

494
00:25:02,632 --> 00:25:04,489
Hey, Sua.

495
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,997
When did you come?

496
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,902
What? Just now.

497
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:10,196
-What's that?
-What?

498
00:25:10,694 --> 00:25:12,492
It's game.

499
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,500
It's new. I bought it to play with you.

500
00:25:16,284 --> 00:25:19,198
Let's play later. I need to eat
instant noodle with Ahyoung now.

501
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:20,508
Yes, sure.

502
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:22,447
Enjoy.

503
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:27,439
I can play game alone.

504
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:39,072
Playing with someone is
more fun than playing alone.

505
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:40,659
Sua!

506
00:25:40,965 --> 00:25:42,469
Sua! Sua!

507
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:43,261
Yes?

508
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,749
-Dusik. Let's play game with me.
-Hold on, hold on.

509
00:25:47,057 --> 00:25:50,660
Let's play game later.
I need to ask you something.

510
00:25:50,745 --> 00:25:52,469
To me? What is it?

511
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:54,285
Well...

512
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:57,277
I'm going to confess to Ahyoung.

513
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:58,785
How should I do it?

514
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:00,277
What?

515
00:26:00,877 --> 00:26:01,672
Confess?

516
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:04,087
Yes. I may make a mistake,
if I do it in my way.

517
00:26:04,172 --> 00:26:07,165
So, what kind of confession do women like?

518
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,070
-How do I know that!
-Hey, hey.

519
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:12,879
Don't be like that. Tell me. Please, Sua.

520
00:26:12,964 --> 00:26:14,369
I don't know!

521
00:26:16,777 --> 00:26:17,701
Right!

522
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:22,090
There is one way to confess
that is wanted by everyone.

523
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:26,927
What would you like to eat for lunch?
Spaghetti? Chinese food? It's been long.

524
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,141
Ahyoung.

525
00:26:29,828 --> 00:26:32,530
Dusik! What are you doing here?

526
00:26:32,622 --> 00:26:35,063
What are you wearing?

527
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:44,878
I have something to tell you.

528
00:26:45,076 --> 00:26:46,481
What is it?

529
00:27:10,293 --> 00:27:12,006
Dusik, what are you doing?

530
00:27:47,492 --> 00:27:48,294
Ahyoung.

531
00:27:49,492 --> 00:27:51,397
Would you be my girlfriend?

532
00:27:56,702 --> 00:27:59,615
Dusik, what are you...

533
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,909
Why?

534
00:28:02,003 --> 00:28:03,607
Are you really touched?

535
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,899
Then, is today our first...

536
00:28:13,543 --> 00:28:15,958
Ahyoung! Ahyoung! What's wrong?

537
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:17,649
Did I do something wrong?

538
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:31,082
Where are you?

539
00:28:31,189 --> 00:28:32,566
Why is it so hard to contact you?

540
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:35,367
Did you go out to see ASTAR again? Right?

541
00:28:36,074 --> 00:28:37,899
What is wrong with him, really.

542
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,399
He's like a stalker. Stalker.

543
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:51,246
Jun...Jungi.

544
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:52,658
My Jinju,

545
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:54,238
are you here now?

546
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:57,820
How... How did you come in?

547
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,531
What?

548
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:03,205
That's not important right now.

549
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:06,468
Right.

550
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:09,761
You didn't pick up your phone these days.

551
00:29:10,157 --> 00:29:11,579
I came as I was worried.

552
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:13,693
I can see...

553
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:15,979
...that you're fine.

554
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:19,513
I was busy these days.

555
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:22,917
Is it? Then you must have missed my drama.

556
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:24,314
Shall we...

557
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,806
...watch it again?

558
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,094
-Now?
-Why?

559
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:33,503
"Look at me only"

560
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:34,702
You don't want?

561
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:36,813
What?

562
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:39,515
Stalker?

563
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,209
I did not stalk her.

564
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:45,014
Jinju was my first fan,
so I couldn't help myself.

565
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,221
I didn't mean any harm. Really.

566
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,808
Jinju.

567
00:29:50,304 --> 00:29:51,860
You know how I feel about you.

568
00:29:51,945 --> 00:29:54,447
Do you want him to be punished?

569
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:56,463
-Yes.
-Yes. Puni... What?

570
00:29:57,553 --> 00:29:58,963
Jinju!

571
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:04,467
God, you didn't have anyone to
stalk, but your stalker...

572
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,971
...and get restraining order?

573
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:08,853
I didn't stalk her!
It was my love for my fan.

574
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:12,970
You made such a fuss about it.

575
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:16,271
You had one fan and now she's gone.

576
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:22,168
-God!
-What?

577
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:24,073
He's upset. Upset.

578
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,858
God, look at his temper.

579
00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:32,032
What?

580
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,230
Where were you in that clothes?

581
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:36,539
Min Sua!

582
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:39,952
What is this?

583
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:43,154
What? What happened?

584
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:53,938
What? You confessed in front of
everyone, while tap dancing?

585
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:57,240
Even in front of her coworkers?

586
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:58,862
Are you crazy?

587
00:30:58,946 --> 00:31:01,951
Women hate it when men
confess in front of everyone.

588
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:04,142
Really?

589
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:05,898
Hey, Min Sua!

590
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:07,501
You said it will work!

591
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:10,303
You said every women loves it!

592
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:13,501
Well, that's weird.

593
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:15,943
I love when guy confesses to me
in front of everyone.

594
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:18,344
Guess others don't.

595
00:31:18,437 --> 00:31:20,843
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

596
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:22,238
Is that it?

597
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:24,007
What will you do now!

598
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,102
You do something about it! You do it!

599
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:28,118
I said I'm sorry.

600
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,610
I'm tired, so bye...

601
00:31:33,187 --> 00:31:36,887
Where are you going? Come here!

602
00:31:36,994 --> 00:31:38,990
Hey! Come here!

603
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:47,003
-Yuna!
-God!

604
00:31:48,383 --> 00:31:49,698
Oh, my. Donggu! Are you alright?

605
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,095
I'm sorry. I was really surprised.

606
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,102
It's fine. It's my fault.

607
00:31:56,276 --> 00:31:57,697
Sorry, I'm late.

608
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,293
My meeting was delayed.

609
00:31:59,388 --> 00:32:02,579
It's fine. I just came out from my class.

610
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:03,999
Shall we go?

611
00:32:04,098 --> 00:32:08,055
It's a bit cold, isn't it?

612
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,358
-Yuna, aren't your hands cold?
-What?

613
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:14,559
-I'm fine.
-I don't think so. It looks cold.

614
00:32:14,838 --> 00:32:16,237
Shall I warm them for you?

615
00:32:16,838 --> 00:32:19,378
Well, I have lots of heat.
My hands are warm.

616
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:22,171
I'm not doing it because
I want to hold your hand.

617
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:23,076
Alright?

618
00:32:24,571 --> 00:32:25,687
I know.

619
00:32:36,103 --> 00:32:40,525
Ahyoung, Ahyoung! Listen to me.
Ahyoung, the tap dance...

620
00:32:40,621 --> 00:32:41,735
God.

621
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,338
Min Sua!

622
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,941
This is all on you! Do you know that?

623
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,346
I said I'm sorry. Sorry!

624
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:52,463
Why doesn't she like tap dancing?
I like it.

625
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,367
If you like it, is that it? Hey!

626
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:57,264
Hey! Come here! Hey!

627
00:32:58,861 --> 00:33:00,066
I'm here.

628
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,354
Jungi, you are here?

629
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:06,267
Why is it so hard to see you these days?

630
00:33:06,372 --> 00:33:07,259
Sorry.

631
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:09,673
I'm busy with shooting.

632
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:11,665
I know. I know that well.

633
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:13,562
But you know we didn't
go on a date for so long.

634
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:14,675
I'm sorry.

635
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:18,675
Then should we go out
now to watch a movie?

636
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,162
It's fine.
You'll faint if you go to watch movie now.

637
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:22,376
Let's go next time.

638
00:33:23,372 --> 00:33:24,678
I'm really sorry.

639
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,918
But tomorrow, I'll finish shooting early.

640
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:29,416
So, let's watch a movie
and come home together.

641
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:31,331
I'll make time for it.

642
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,926
Really? Are you sure?

643
00:33:34,015 --> 00:33:35,116
You promise?

644
00:33:35,426 --> 00:33:36,985
-Promise.
-Promise.

645
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,070
I'm so tired.

646
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:52,070
How can they shoot
everyday until late night?

647
00:33:52,772 --> 00:33:55,076
It's killing me. Really.

648
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:56,481
It must be tiring.

649
00:33:56,979 --> 00:33:57,981
But...

650
00:33:58,074 --> 00:34:01,092
...I'm glad that I can act. Isn't it?

651
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:04,689
My body is tired,
but I'm so happy these days, Dusik.

652
00:34:07,285 --> 00:34:10,404
Hi, you nerds.

653
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,595
What are you, angry man.

654
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:14,387
Today you are so happy?
Where have you been?

655
00:34:14,492 --> 00:34:18,086
On a date with Yuna! Romantic!

656
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:21,879
Your lips are going to reach your ears.

657
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:23,386
But, Donggu.

658
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:25,682
What stage are you in?

659
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,201
Did you kiss?

660
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:32,079
What? Kiss?

661
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:35,572
I already did that.
During wedding ceremony.

662
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,777
Bro, that's not kiss.
It was peck on the lips.

663
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:39,800
Don't you know the difference?

664
00:34:40,508 --> 00:34:43,403
By your look,
guess you didn't even kiss her.

665
00:34:43,602 --> 00:34:44,903
Did you even hold hands?

666
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,722
Of course! We hold hands everyday!
We fold each others hands and all!

667
00:34:48,812 --> 00:34:52,326
Wow, so great for you.
So proud of you folding hands.

668
00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:54,619
Spend the rest of your life holding hand.

669
00:34:54,722 --> 00:34:55,826
Hey!

670
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:59,825
Don't think that the level of love is
shown by physical affection. So dirty.

671
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:04,126
Sure, sure.
Happily ever after by holding hands.

672
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:05,215
Hold it.

673
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,572
What? Are you saying you kissed Seojin?

674
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,589
What are you? A prawn? Get up! Jerk!

675
00:35:15,674 --> 00:35:19,080
Did you do that to my sister? Get up!

676
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,912
Get up!

677
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,810
-Are you up?
-Yes. Did you sleep well?

678
00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:29,115
What are you doing?

679
00:35:29,302 --> 00:35:32,012
It's spring already.
So I'm making some seasoned vegetables.

680
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:34,410
I see. It looks delicious.

681
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:37,108
Right, Yuna.

682
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,116
There's something on your lips.

683
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:41,974
I must have gotten
there, when I tasted it.

684
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:43,879
Hold on, let me do it.

685
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:48,688
It's so soft.

686
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,589
It's really soft!

687
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:53,390
It's soft even when I'm
touching with my hands.

688
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:55,898
What would it feel
when my lips touch her lips?

689
00:35:56,801 --> 00:35:58,022
Donggu, what's wrong?

690
00:35:58,116 --> 00:35:59,392
I want to kiss her.

691
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,598
I want to kiss her. Kiss her!

692
00:36:03,687 --> 00:36:05,189
Donggu, are you alright?

693
00:36:05,603 --> 00:36:06,291
What?

694
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:07,800
Yes.

695
00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:10,730
I was thinking something else.

696
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:13,833
I'll leave for work now.

697
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,229
Sure.

698
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:23,064
Now we have Shin Hyunjoon.
We can hide air gun inside the bread.

699
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:29,448
Now, our hero Kang Cheol needs to meet
with Arabian spy, Shin Hyunjoon.

700
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,932
Is there any unique way for
them to find out their identity?

701
00:36:33,032 --> 00:36:34,845
How about sending signal,

702
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:38,742
-by raising their glasses?
-No, that's too obvious.

703
00:36:38,835 --> 00:36:41,052
Any other unique way?

704
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:44,044
He's doing it again. There.

705
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,458
His idea is coming out.

706
00:36:45,558 --> 00:36:46,657
What is it this time?

707
00:36:47,346 --> 00:36:48,355
"Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss"

708
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:49,657
Kiss!

709
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,562
Kiss?

710
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:54,861
Kiss as signal?

711
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:56,948
That's unique.

712
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,250
Director!

713
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,800
It's too much! That's enough!

714
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,885
What is?

715
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:04,086
It's unique and sexy. It's good.

716
00:37:04,186 --> 00:37:06,999
Director. I can't do this movie anymore.

717
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:09,584
-Hey! What's wrong?
-I...

718
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,282
...quit.

719
00:37:13,976 --> 00:37:15,070
Well...

720
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:18,063
Senior.
Senior.

721
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:21,274
It must be hard for you these days.
You need to shoot until late night.

722
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:22,663
No, it's fine.

723
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,264
I'm just grateful that I can act.

724
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,867
Right. Do you have agency?

725
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:30,361
No, not yet.

726
00:37:30,434 --> 00:37:33,954
Really? So you take care of
all your schedules and clothes?

727
00:37:34,057 --> 00:37:37,304
-Yes.
-You need some management by agency,

728
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,490
so that you can focus on acting.

729
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:44,093
Right.
Then should I talk to my agency's CEO?

730
00:37:44,182 --> 00:37:44,782
What?

731
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:47,104
Your agency is...

732
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:48,897
...YS, right?

733
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,016
It's a really big company.

734
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,207
I don't think I can...

735
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,623
Well then,
I will set up a meeting for you.

736
00:37:56,717 --> 00:37:58,424
You should talk to our CEO.

737
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,424
Really?

738
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:02,798
Thank you. Thank you, sir!

739
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:05,600
I'm busy so I'll get going.

740
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:06,901
Yes, thank you.

741
00:38:07,406 --> 00:38:09,115
Thank you very much.

742
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:15,460
Jungi. Here you are.

743
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:17,267
The author just sent us edited script.

744
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,251
Edited script?

745
00:38:18,354 --> 00:38:21,513
Yes, important scene is added.
Read scene 38 first.

746
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:22,792
Scene 38?

747
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:26,586
Joonseok.

748
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:31,297
"His situation and Elizabeth inside
the show window seems so similar,"

749
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:34,393
"so he cries looking at Elizabeth."

750
00:38:34,694 --> 00:38:35,599
Elizabeth?

751
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:37,815
Who's Elizabeth?

752
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:42,712
What's up with a turtle?

753
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:44,643
That's Elizabeth.

754
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:45,833
What?

755
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:48,738
A turtle is called Elizabeth?

756
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:51,135
Yes. From this episode,
you have a pet turtle.

757
00:38:51,236 --> 00:38:52,032
What?

758
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:53,930
All of a sudden?

759
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:58,334
The writer wants to compare the barrier
blocking Song Joonseok's company life...

760
00:38:58,428 --> 00:39:02,213
...with the hard shell of a turtle.

761
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:06,911
By taking care of a turtle, gradually
he gets healed and interacts with it.

762
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,105
Interact?

763
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:09,812
With Elizabeth...

764
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:11,415
A turtle?

765
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:14,118
Yes. Now, there's no time.
Let's start shooting.

766
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:21,133
Elizab... A turtle...

767
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:22,841
"News Room Shooting."

768
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,642
Right now, everyone around
Song Joonseok is enemy.

769
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:30,520
After work, he finds Elizabeth
that's locked up in a tank,

770
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:33,624
and cries without knowing.

771
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,013
Do you understand?

772
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,665
Sure.

773
00:39:39,163 --> 00:39:40,070
I'll try.

774
00:39:40,168 --> 00:39:40,987
Okay.

775
00:39:41,072 --> 00:39:42,562
Let's start shooting.

776
00:39:42,661 --> 00:39:44,356
Now, let's start shooting.

777
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:50,403
Alright, ready,

778
00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:51,610
cue!

779
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,858
Cut!

780
00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:14,454
Jungi, what are you doing?

781
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:16,255
You need to cry.

782
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,049
Yes. Well...

783
00:40:18,662 --> 00:40:23,184
I can't focus looking at a turtle.

784
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:26,485
Then how? This is a very
important scene in this drama.

785
00:40:26,686 --> 00:40:31,988
Now, look at Elizabeth's
eyes and interact. Interact!

786
00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:37,467
But, its eyes are really small...

787
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:41,451
Just find its eyes.

788
00:40:41,653 --> 00:40:43,216
-Let's go again.
-Yes!

789
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:44,327
Ready.

790
00:40:44,923 --> 00:40:45,827
Cue!

791
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:56,912
Cut!

792
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:58,404
Again!

793
00:41:00,816 --> 00:41:01,704
Cut.

794
00:41:03,517 --> 00:41:04,625
Cut! Cut!

795
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:07,918
Interact! Interact!

796
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:10,455
Yes, interact, interact.

797
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,042
Cut!

798
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:13,947
Cut!

799
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:14,836
Cut!

800
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:17,741
-Yes?
-What's wrong with you today, Jungi?

801
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:32,053
Is Shin Hyunjoon acting
as Arabian in your movie?

802
00:41:32,845 --> 00:41:34,141
I want to kiss her.

803
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:35,641
I want to kiss her.

804
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:37,172
I want to kiss her.

805
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:40,172
Donggu?

806
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:42,963
Donggu, can't you hear me?

807
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:43,973
What?

808
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,028
No, no. I'm listening.

809
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:50,139
Oh, right! Yuna.

810
00:41:50,224 --> 00:41:53,345
I have something to tell you.

811
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:55,067
Yes? What is it?

812
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:59,463
Well, it's very important
so we can't talk about it here.

813
00:42:01,257 --> 00:42:03,289
Shall we go there?

814
00:42:04,044 --> 00:42:05,458
Yes, sure.

815
00:42:05,848 --> 00:42:06,760
Let's go.

816
00:42:08,663 --> 00:42:10,149
What is it?

817
00:42:10,968 --> 00:42:13,246
Well, actually these days...

818
00:42:13,543 --> 00:42:15,047
...work with the movies,

819
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:18,341
and there's not enough guests
so I'm a bit struggling.

820
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:23,265
So I kind of need
some sort of energy in my life.

821
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:25,965
Is that so?

822
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,162
Hang in there, Donggu.

823
00:42:31,043 --> 00:42:32,148
Well...

824
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:37,648
Those words don't really
give me the energy.

825
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:39,243
Really?

826
00:42:39,448 --> 00:42:41,056
What do you need?

827
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:46,158
-Could you ki...me?
-What?

828
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:49,539
I said could you ki...me?

829
00:42:49,655 --> 00:42:51,849
-What?
-Could you give me a kiss?

830
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:53,341
What? Ki...

831
00:42:53,426 --> 00:42:54,436
Kiss?

832
00:42:55,252 --> 00:42:57,944
You did all this for a kiss?

833
00:42:58,245 --> 00:42:59,341
No.

834
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:05,748
It's not that I want a kiss
but I really need energy. Energy.

835
00:43:10,161 --> 00:43:10,851
God...

836
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:13,652
Alright.

837
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:16,543
Really?

838
00:43:18,154 --> 00:43:18,946
Yes.

839
00:43:42,376 --> 00:43:43,563
Oh my god.

840
00:43:45,974 --> 00:43:46,968
What's wrong?

841
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:53,464
I'm sorry. I feel ticklish very easily.

842
00:43:54,154 --> 00:43:55,654
Your neck is very sensitive.

843
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:57,154
Well then, again.

844
00:44:12,886 --> 00:44:14,394
Your waist is ticklish too?

845
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,791
Alright. Again, again.

846
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:29,503
It's too ticklish! Ticklish! Oh my god!

847
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:37,131
God.

848
00:44:37,235 --> 00:44:39,623
Ahyoung doesn't even pick up
her phone or check my message.

849
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:42,736
-What should I do?
-Just give up on her.

850
00:44:42,924 --> 00:44:43,771
No!

851
00:44:44,124 --> 00:44:45,315
I won't give up!

852
00:44:45,411 --> 00:44:47,429
I felt destined to love her!

853
00:44:47,514 --> 00:44:50,501
Your destiny changes everyday. God.

854
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:55,311
Ahyoung.

855
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:56,812
I'm here.

856
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:00,412
You really came early!

857
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:01,717
Shall we go for a movie?

858
00:45:01,813 --> 00:45:03,910
I've paid attention
to my outfit as it's our date.

859
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,012
What do you think?

860
00:45:06,223 --> 00:45:07,422
Well, Bacca.

861
00:45:08,116 --> 00:45:09,231
I'm sorry...

862
00:45:09,316 --> 00:45:11,520
I think I can't go out for a movie.

863
00:45:11,605 --> 00:45:12,731
I'm sorry.

864
00:45:12,821 --> 00:45:13,715
What?

865
00:45:14,025 --> 00:45:15,974
Why? What's wrong?

866
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,990
Well...

867
00:45:22,983 --> 00:45:27,396
So, you need to interact with this turtle?

868
00:45:28,082 --> 00:45:28,888
Yes.

869
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:32,587
How do you interact with a turtle?

870
00:45:32,784 --> 00:45:34,079
I don't know.

871
00:45:34,573 --> 00:45:35,382
Anyway...

872
00:45:35,478 --> 00:45:40,297
My director told me to eat, sleep
and stay 24 hours with this turtle.

873
00:45:40,382 --> 00:45:41,084
What?

874
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:42,592
Seojin.

875
00:45:42,788 --> 00:45:45,592
Can we see the movie next time? Please?

876
00:45:45,703 --> 00:45:47,893
Man, always next time. Next time.

877
00:45:47,988 --> 00:45:49,705
You're really frustrating.

878
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:50,979
I'm sorry.

879
00:45:51,788 --> 00:45:55,082
But tomorrow we can really go.
I will treat you with delicious meal.

880
00:45:55,193 --> 00:45:58,193
That place you talked about.
Let's go there.

881
00:45:58,482 --> 00:45:59,591
Really?

882
00:45:59,774 --> 00:46:01,888
You must keep that promise tomorrow.

883
00:46:01,988 --> 00:46:03,789
I will.

884
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:06,347
But...

885
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:08,855
How should I interact with this?

886
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,586
Elizabeth.

887
00:46:17,888 --> 00:46:19,800
Could you please look at me?

888
00:46:19,892 --> 00:46:22,689
Let's be honest and interact with me.

889
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:26,196
Are you going to be like this?

890
00:46:26,304 --> 00:46:27,402
Elizabeth,

891
00:46:27,595 --> 00:46:29,894
where are you from?

892
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,023
Do you have friends? Siblings?

893
00:46:32,092 --> 00:46:34,729
What's your motto? Favorite book?

894
00:46:36,036 --> 00:46:38,248
Great, you won't understand me.

895
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:39,641
What am I hoping for? Lee Jungi!

896
00:46:39,726 --> 00:46:41,736
God, I'm in trouble.

897
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:45,738
Hey, you're here?

898
00:46:47,734 --> 00:46:49,142
What's wrong?

899
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:50,935
It's nothing.

900
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,347
What's up with this turtle?

901
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:53,950
What? Well...

902
00:46:54,828 --> 00:46:56,252
Work I need to do.

903
00:46:57,832 --> 00:46:59,030
Right, Jungi.

904
00:46:59,545 --> 00:47:01,633
I have something to ask you.

905
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,102
The hero from my movie has a girlfriend.

906
00:47:05,187 --> 00:47:06,502
-And?
-And.

907
00:47:06,587 --> 00:47:09,891
The hero needs to kiss his girlfriend.

908
00:47:09,983 --> 00:47:12,671
But his girlfriend feels ticklish easily.

909
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:14,884
He can't kiss her.

910
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:18,782
-So?
-How can my hero kiss his girlfriend?

911
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:20,485
So...

912
00:47:20,573 --> 00:47:23,073
Yuna feels ticklish easily
so you can't kiss her?

913
00:47:23,182 --> 00:47:25,779
Yes, I can't even touch her.

914
00:47:25,867 --> 00:47:27,296
No, no!

915
00:47:27,385 --> 00:47:29,168
It's not my story!
It's about a movie! Movie!

916
00:47:29,272 --> 00:47:31,866
You can fool a ghost but not me.
Fool a ghost!

917
00:47:32,563 --> 00:47:35,482
Jungi, what should I do?
Is there any solution?

918
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:37,569
What's so difficult about that?

919
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:40,722
If she feels ticklish, don't touch her.

920
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,833
Don't touch her?

921
00:47:43,315 --> 00:47:47,031
-How?
-Hold your hands behind your back. Back.

922
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:48,213
At the back?

923
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:00,626
-Hold it, that looks weird.
-Is it?

924
00:48:01,104 --> 00:48:03,526
Then how about her hair?
Hair is not ticklish at all.

925
00:48:03,626 --> 00:48:05,313
Hold her hair?

926
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:09,211
That's even more weird.
It's not romantic.

927
00:48:09,296 --> 00:48:10,615
But still you can kiss her.

928
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,607
Forget it!
I won't do it if I need to do that!

929
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:15,048
I'm not that crazy about kissing her!

930
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:16,835
God, you are really...

931
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,050
What do you think? It's alright?

932
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:21,431
What, you mean...

933
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:23,530
You want to kiss like this?

934
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:26,737
We have no choice.
You feel ticklish easily.

935
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:28,538
Also, I've told you before,

936
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:31,022
it's not that I want
to kiss you so much.

937
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:32,610
But I just need energy.

938
00:48:32,703 --> 00:48:35,411
God, I see. I get it.

939
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,350
What is it? I didn't touch you.

940
00:48:54,447 --> 00:48:58,962
Oh, no.
Your breathing from your nose is ticklish.

941
00:48:59,345 --> 00:49:00,756
Breathing is ticklish?

942
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:03,565
Aren't you too sensitive?

943
00:49:04,146 --> 00:49:08,324
I'm sorry. I was trying to hold it
but it was too ticklish.

944
00:49:08,409 --> 00:49:09,408
Alright.

945
00:49:09,499 --> 00:49:11,020
I will not breathe.

946
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:12,004
Again, again.

947
00:49:24,784 --> 00:49:27,994
Oh my! Oh my! It's so ticklish!

948
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,299
Donggu, I'm sorry. It's really ticklish.

949
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,650
Elizabeth.

950
00:49:44,947 --> 00:49:45,947
Is it tasty?

951
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:50,461
If it is, answer me. Huh?

952
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:56,067
Will you really do this? I cleaned you.
I pillowed you with my arm. I fed you!

953
00:49:56,164 --> 00:49:58,468
It's now time for you to listen to me.

954
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,568
-Jungi...
-What?

955
00:49:59,653 --> 00:50:00,757
...stop it.

956
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,779
-You look like a crazy person.
-What?

957
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,676
He's always been crazy.

958
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:05,669
Leave him be.

959
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,771
You guys!

960
00:50:07,867 --> 00:50:09,980
I'm not doing this because I want to!

961
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:12,083
Do you know what kind of scene,
I need to shoot with it?

962
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:13,083
What is it?

963
00:50:14,371 --> 00:50:16,104
Do you know "Days of Being Wild"?

964
00:50:16,509 --> 00:50:19,408
Leslie Cheung's mambo dance scene?

965
00:50:19,493 --> 00:50:22,310
I need to do that with this turtle.
Even staring at each other.

966
00:50:22,406 --> 00:50:25,321
Wait, mambo dance with a turtle?

967
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:26,613
Yes!

968
00:50:26,701 --> 00:50:30,321
The writer said it's really important.
He drew 10 stars there.

969
00:50:30,426 --> 00:50:32,012
You are trying really hard. Really.

970
00:50:32,128 --> 00:50:35,495
Your life is so interesting. God.

971
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,928
Well, Jungi. You remember our promise?

972
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:41,098
You have to keep it today. Alright?

973
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:44,743
Don't worry.
I reserved that restaurant already.

974
00:50:44,862 --> 00:50:48,259
Really? God, it's been so long
since we went on a date.

975
00:50:48,653 --> 00:50:50,751
God, we are eating here.

976
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,116
"Culture Department"

977
00:50:58,337 --> 00:51:01,041
I'm so excited to go on a date.
It's been so long.

978
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:05,327
Maybe I should have worn prettier clothes.

979
00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:11,929
Let's finish fast and go.

980
00:51:13,432 --> 00:51:14,722
Kang Seojin.

981
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:18,220
Read all these and summarize by today.

982
00:51:18,334 --> 00:51:19,030
Pardon?

983
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:21,639
-All these?
-Yes.

984
00:51:21,732 --> 00:51:23,227
Why? You don't want to do?

985
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,433
No, it's not that.

986
00:51:25,528 --> 00:51:28,813
It's urgent.
You need to do it by today. Alright?

987
00:51:32,312 --> 00:51:34,028
God, this is crazy.

988
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:36,233
How can I finish this in time?

989
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:39,330
I have a date with Jungi too.
God, this is crazy.

990
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:52,763
So, did you interact with Elizabeth?

991
00:51:52,855 --> 00:51:53,557
Yes?

992
00:51:54,267 --> 00:51:56,783
Well, I tried my best.

993
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,077
Alright.

994
00:51:58,467 --> 00:52:02,283
For this scene, Song Joonseok
and Elizabeth will dance mambo together...

995
00:52:02,376 --> 00:52:06,416
...to ease his pain after being
kicked out from anchor status.

996
00:52:06,611 --> 00:52:10,226
-Alright.
-But dancing well is not important.

997
00:52:10,322 --> 00:52:14,524
It's whether you two interact
with each other. Alright?

998
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:16,310
Yes, alright.

999
00:52:17,129 --> 00:52:18,016
Elizabeth!

1000
00:52:18,204 --> 00:52:19,222
Let's do this!

1001
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:22,022
Okay. Let's start shooting.

1002
00:52:22,196 --> 00:52:23,902
Alright, let's shoot.

1003
00:52:30,766 --> 00:52:32,467
Don't be angry.

1004
00:52:37,013 --> 00:52:38,513
Ready.

1005
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,418
Cue!

1006
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:12,272
Cut!

1007
00:53:12,663 --> 00:53:16,065
Jungi, what are you doing?
Elizabeth is moving away!

1008
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,367
I'm sorry.

1009
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:20,252
Interact with Elizabeth! Interact!

1010
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,863
I'm sorry.

1011
00:53:22,052 --> 00:53:23,657
I will go again, director.

1012
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:28,433
Elizabeth!

1013
00:53:28,736 --> 00:53:30,734
Why are you doing this to me?

1014
00:53:30,924 --> 00:53:33,548
Please save me once. Please?

1015
00:53:33,634 --> 00:53:36,640
Let's start from the scene where you stare
at each other while dancing mambo.

1016
00:53:36,741 --> 00:53:38,040
Yes, alright.

1017
00:53:39,238 --> 00:53:40,861
Please I beg you, Elizabeth.

1018
00:53:41,144 --> 00:53:42,249
Ready.

1019
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:43,353
Cue!

1020
00:53:47,455 --> 00:53:48,454
Cut, cut!

1021
00:53:48,848 --> 00:53:50,835
Jungi, I think Elizabeth is
running away from you.

1022
00:53:50,952 --> 00:53:52,049
I'll try again.

1023
00:53:52,138 --> 00:53:54,042
Interact a lot and go.

1024
00:53:56,743 --> 00:53:57,579
Ready.

1025
00:53:58,025 --> 00:53:58,845
Cue!

1026
00:54:02,033 --> 00:54:03,033
Cut!

1027
00:54:03,634 --> 00:54:04,427
Cut!

1028
00:54:05,331 --> 00:54:06,238
Cut!

1029
00:54:06,835 --> 00:54:07,944
Cut.

1030
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,568
Cut!

1031
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,147
"Scene 27 Take 40"

1032
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:15,758
Elizabeth.

1033
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,057
Please?

1034
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,049
Jungi, will you shoot only
this scene for the whole day?

1035
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:24,566
NG cuts are now over 40. Do you know?

1036
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:25,764
I'm sorry, director.

1037
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:29,240
I gave you a whole day.
But there's no interaction.

1038
00:54:29,446 --> 00:54:30,447
Also,

1039
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:32,145
what are you going to do?

1040
00:54:32,234 --> 00:54:35,737
Elizabeth is inside its shell.
What are you going you do?

1041
00:54:35,826 --> 00:54:39,342
What? It did it itself. I can't...

1042
00:54:39,435 --> 00:54:42,546
Jungi, you're the only
closest one with it here.

1043
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:45,735
-Do something about it.
-Pardon?

1044
00:54:46,726 --> 00:54:48,640
How can I do that?

1045
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:49,935
I don't know!

1046
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:52,633
Let's just take a rest until it comes out.

1047
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:56,048
God, what on earth is happening.
That's making me go crazy.

1048
00:54:56,734 --> 00:54:57,952
I'm sorry.

1049
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:01,660
God, really.

1050
00:55:04,462 --> 00:55:05,854
Elizabeth.

1051
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:08,448
Come out. Please?

1052
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,047
I have a date with Seojin today.

1053
00:55:13,532 --> 00:55:14,643
Elizabeth!

1054
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:16,643
Elizabeth!

1055
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,046
What is wrong with you?

1056
00:55:19,737 --> 00:55:22,340
Come out. Please?

1057
00:55:30,216 --> 00:55:32,440
Okay. I'm done.

1058
00:55:36,438 --> 00:55:37,440
Ma'am,

1059
00:55:37,828 --> 00:55:39,122
I'm done.

1060
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:41,542
-All of that?
-Yes.

1061
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:43,725
Did you do it properly?

1062
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:48,020
No, I didn't go for lunch or restroom
and tried my best to finish it.

1063
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:52,218
Good.

1064
00:55:53,011 --> 00:55:53,606
Go on.

1065
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:55,495
See you tomorrow.

1066
00:55:57,795 --> 00:55:59,320
God, I'm so tired.

1067
00:56:00,731 --> 00:56:04,242
Really, that senior
wants to make me suffer.

1068
00:56:05,526 --> 00:56:10,322
But, thinking about having a date
with Jungi makes me feel good.

1069
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:14,306
But why isn't he calling me?

1070
00:56:19,157 --> 00:56:20,465
Elizabeth.

1071
00:56:20,868 --> 00:56:22,774
Will you really do this?

1072
00:56:23,357 --> 00:56:25,442
Please come out.

1073
00:56:25,738 --> 00:56:27,934
Elizabeth.

1074
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,033
Right...

1075
00:56:34,731 --> 00:56:36,034
God.

1076
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:39,836
Yes, Seojin.

1077
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:42,444
Jungi, where are you? I'm here.

1078
00:56:42,854 --> 00:56:44,553
Oh, well...

1079
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:47,839
I'm still shooting.

1080
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,792
What?

1081
00:56:49,334 --> 00:56:51,146
Why are you still there?

1082
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,543
There's just one scene left,

1083
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:56,991
and Elizabeth is delaying it.

1084
00:56:57,076 --> 00:56:58,893
Please wait for me.

1085
00:56:58,985 --> 00:57:00,893
I will go as quickly as possible.

1086
00:57:01,802 --> 00:57:02,980
Alright.

1087
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:04,479
But you have to come fast.

1088
00:57:04,586 --> 00:57:05,678
Yes, alright.

1089
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:07,693
Yes, I'm sorry. Alright.

1090
00:57:10,072 --> 00:57:12,478
Elizabeth, did you hear that?

1091
00:57:12,872 --> 00:57:15,970
Seojin is already there and waiting.

1092
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:19,494
Please just help me. Please?

1093
00:57:20,487 --> 00:57:22,494
Will you really do this?

1094
00:57:22,693 --> 00:57:26,202
You! I have a plan, alright?

1095
00:57:30,086 --> 00:57:32,081
Turtle, turtle.

1096
00:57:32,194 --> 00:57:34,192
Give me your head.

1097
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,328
If you don't give me.

1098
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:40,328
I will cook you and eat.

1099
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:48,130
This isn't working. God, this is crazy.
What should I do?

1100
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:58,151
Elizabeth? You're out!

1101
00:58:00,248 --> 00:58:02,048
Did my spell work?

1102
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,662
Thank you, Elizabeth.
Thank you for coming out.

1103
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,360
Oh my god.

1104
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,860
Wha... What?

1105
00:58:10,683 --> 00:58:11,576
Do you...

1106
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,270
...understand me?

1107
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:16,063
What, what?

1108
00:58:17,172 --> 00:58:21,414
Then, are we interacting?

1109
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,105
Elizabeth.

1110
00:58:27,614 --> 00:58:30,278
This is possible! It is! Right?

1111
00:58:31,262 --> 00:58:32,778
Elizabeth!

1112
00:58:33,478 --> 00:58:34,865
Thank you so much.

1113
00:58:36,968 --> 00:58:38,237
Ready!

1114
00:58:39,133 --> 00:58:40,022
Cue!

1115
00:59:05,662 --> 00:59:08,162
Cut! Okay! Great!

1116
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:11,896
I felt the interaction
with you and Elizabeth!

1117
00:59:11,953 --> 00:59:14,839
Wow, good. You did great.
Great. Really great.

1118
00:59:14,936 --> 00:59:17,141
Thank you! Thank you!

1119
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:21,529
Elizabeth, I will not forget about this.

1120
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:22,739
Thank you.

1121
00:59:26,737 --> 00:59:28,448
Right. Sir!

1122
00:59:28,533 --> 00:59:30,131
May I be excused?

1123
00:59:30,227 --> 00:59:30,932
Sure.

1124
00:59:31,521 --> 00:59:34,826
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1125
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,048
What? Why are you smiling?

1126
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:50,430
Well. I just met Ahyoung.

1127
00:59:50,524 --> 00:59:52,628
I think Ahyoung is not angry.

1128
00:59:54,232 --> 00:59:54,644
Really?

1129
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,642
Yes, so I'm calling her
to ask her out tomorrow.

1130
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:02,615
But, why isn't she picking up?

1131
01:00:02,797 --> 01:00:04,197
"Ahyoung"

1132
01:00:11,799 --> 01:00:13,307
Why is her phone off?

1133
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,617
I heard dial tone just before.

1134
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:17,299
My, my...

1135
01:00:17,418 --> 01:00:19,974
She's avoiding your call.

1136
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,428
-What? Why?
-Don't you know?

1137
01:00:23,513 --> 01:00:25,738
She's still angry at you.

1138
01:00:26,152 --> 01:00:29,765
No, she's not.
I asked her whether she's angry or not.

1139
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:35,237
She said "Yes, I'm not"
and I asked "Really?".

1140
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:38,229
She said "Yes. I fine".

1141
01:00:38,324 --> 01:00:41,633
God, you are such a fool.
That doesn't mean she's fine.

1142
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,406
-What do you mean?
-In that situation,

1143
01:00:43,502 --> 01:00:47,414
"I'm not angry" means I'm really angry.

1144
01:00:47,502 --> 01:00:53,835
"I'm really fine" means I'm not really
fine, I'm still hurt.

1145
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:56,049
What? You mean,

1146
01:00:56,147 --> 01:01:01,392
"I'm not angry" means angry
and "fine" means not fine?

1147
01:01:01,487 --> 01:01:03,999
-Yes.
-Why do women say like that?

1148
01:01:05,597 --> 01:01:08,490
You really don't know women.

1149
01:01:08,586 --> 01:01:09,997
-Is she being irony?
-Yuna!

1150
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:11,879
Yuna! Hey! Where's Yuna?

1151
01:01:12,067 --> 01:01:13,879
-I think, she's on the third floor.
-She is?

1152
01:01:14,881 --> 01:01:16,980
What's wrong with him, now?

1153
01:01:17,067 --> 01:01:19,171
Yuna! Yuna!

1154
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,472
I found a way. I finally found it!

1155
01:01:23,578 --> 01:01:24,904
Find? Find what?

1156
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:26,474
The way we can kiss!

1157
01:01:27,577 --> 01:01:29,284
You're talking about kiss again?

1158
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,204
Well I already told you.

1159
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,879
It's not that I want to kiss you so much,

1160
01:01:35,384 --> 01:01:38,430
but I just need energy.

1161
01:01:39,734 --> 01:01:42,543
Fine, fine. What is it?

1162
01:01:53,746 --> 01:01:54,556
What do you think?

1163
01:01:54,755 --> 01:01:57,750
This won't make you tickle
because of my breathing. Right?

1164
01:02:00,028 --> 01:02:02,956
Do we really need to do like this?

1165
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:04,242
Well...

1166
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,425
I told you before,

1167
01:02:06,543 --> 01:02:09,337
it's not that I want
to kiss you so much.

1168
01:02:10,442 --> 01:02:12,242
I just don't have any energy.

1169
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:14,388
-That energy...
-Forget it.

1170
01:02:15,379 --> 01:02:18,507
But it's our first kiss
and it's not romantic at all.

1171
01:02:18,597 --> 01:02:20,499
Donggu, you are really a fool.

1172
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:27,488
I'm sorry.

1173
01:02:28,263 --> 01:02:30,661
There was no other way.

1174
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,476
I was being too childish.

1175
01:02:34,186 --> 01:02:35,580
I'm sorry.

1176
01:02:37,195 --> 01:02:39,692
How can you be so dumb, Donggu?

1177
01:02:39,778 --> 01:02:40,501
What?

1178
01:02:40,786 --> 01:02:41,890
Dumb?

1179
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:45,170
You don't feel ticklish easily. Right?

1180
01:02:45,968 --> 01:02:46,877
No, I don't.

1181
01:02:46,983 --> 01:02:48,178
Then, it's settled.

1182
01:03:18,267 --> 01:03:19,863
We can do like this.

1183
01:03:22,368 --> 01:03:25,273
If you want to kiss again, tell me.

1184
01:03:25,674 --> 01:03:26,977
I will do it for you.

1185
01:03:27,561 --> 01:03:28,262
What?

1186
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:30,175
Alright.

1187
01:03:31,467 --> 01:03:34,197
Then, I'll go down first.

1188
01:03:35,267 --> 01:03:35,887
Sure.

1189
01:03:46,133 --> 01:03:48,963
One more time. One more time.

1190
01:03:49,658 --> 01:03:51,048
God, Elizabeth.

1191
01:03:51,347 --> 01:03:53,944
Seojin must be angry.
I need to grab a taxi.

1192
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,612
Jungi, are you done?

1193
01:03:56,702 --> 01:03:57,702
Yes, just now.

1194
01:03:57,893 --> 01:03:58,904
Is something wrong?

1195
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:02,009
I told you before about
a meeting with my CEO.

1196
01:04:02,094 --> 01:04:05,669
He's around here and he wants to see you.

1197
01:04:07,378 --> 01:04:09,678
-Now?
-I complemented you a lot.

1198
01:04:09,778 --> 01:04:13,012
Today, you might be
able to sign a contract.

1199
01:04:14,135 --> 01:04:15,115
Really?

1200
01:04:17,203 --> 01:04:19,131
Why? Is something wrong?

1201
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:24,745
-Well, I have a date with my girlfriend.
-What?

1202
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:28,332
Hey, are you out of your mind?

1203
01:04:28,421 --> 01:04:30,130
This chance doesn't come everyday.

1204
01:04:30,231 --> 01:04:32,431
I know. I do.

1205
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:36,026
But she is waiting
for me for hours alone already.

1206
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:40,549
I'm really sorry,
but can I meet him next time?

1207
01:04:40,634 --> 01:04:43,038
Hey, is dating more important
than your acting career?

1208
01:04:43,227 --> 01:04:45,473
Do you think you will have a
chance to sign a contract...

1209
01:04:45,558 --> 01:04:47,552
...with big management like mine?

1210
01:04:48,466 --> 01:04:51,853
You said you want to be an
actor, but the way you think...

1211
01:04:52,243 --> 01:04:54,509
Forget it, do what you want.

1212
01:05:15,201 --> 01:05:16,502
"Jungi"

1213
01:05:20,901 --> 01:05:22,404
Yes, Jungi. Are you finished?

1214
01:05:22,505 --> 01:05:24,201
Yes, just now.

1215
01:05:24,563 --> 01:05:25,563
But Seojin...

1216
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:27,367
I'm really sorry,

1217
01:05:27,565 --> 01:05:29,970
but I think I can't go today.

1218
01:05:30,357 --> 01:05:30,954
What?

1219
01:05:31,669 --> 01:05:32,272
Why?

1220
01:05:32,367 --> 01:05:36,178
Well, there's this big agency
that I really want to get in.

1221
01:05:36,283 --> 01:05:39,509
The CEO from that agency
wants to see me now.

1222
01:05:40,175 --> 01:05:40,887
What?

1223
01:05:42,482 --> 01:05:43,482
So?

1224
01:05:43,678 --> 01:05:46,189
I'm really sorry but Seojin...

1225
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,189
...can we have dinner next time?

1226
01:05:54,225 --> 01:05:55,238
I'm sorry, Seojin.

1227
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,546
But it's really the only chance for me.

1228
01:05:58,631 --> 01:06:02,226
So, please just once more.
Can you understand me?

1229
01:06:04,129 --> 01:06:05,226
Alright.

1230
01:06:05,522 --> 01:06:07,501
Really? Really?

1231
01:06:07,701 --> 01:06:09,692
Are you angry?

1232
01:06:09,801 --> 01:06:11,723
No, I'm not.

1233
01:06:11,812 --> 01:06:12,715
Really?

1234
01:06:12,804 --> 01:06:14,208
You're really fine?

1235
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,812
Yes, I'm fine.

1236
01:06:15,915 --> 01:06:17,812
God, thank you Seojin.

1237
01:06:17,901 --> 01:06:19,114
Thank you so much.

1238
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:21,010
See you at home.

1239
01:06:30,716 --> 01:06:32,018
It's fine.

1240
01:06:34,211 --> 01:06:35,415
Really...

1241
01:06:37,114 --> 01:06:38,804
Really fine.

1242
01:07:11,116 --> 01:07:15,710
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1243
01:07:15,813 --> 01:07:17,821
Jungi, leave it to me from now on.

1244
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:19,973
I'll make you a top star.

1245
01:07:20,068 --> 01:07:21,378
Lee Jungi is trending number one.

1246
01:07:21,465 --> 01:07:24,259
-What's this? "Cindy, Lee Jungi Dating"?
-What?

1247
01:07:24,354 --> 01:07:25,576
I would like to clarify something.

1248
01:07:25,672 --> 01:07:26,864
I already have someone I love.

1249
01:07:26,965 --> 01:07:29,252
You can do what you want.
But, we'll cancel the contract instead.

1250
01:07:30,744 --> 01:07:32,545
Look at this. Ta-da!

1251
01:07:32,652 --> 01:07:33,942
I designed it myself.

1252
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:35,954
Who would buy these crappy clothes?

1253
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:37,615
What's wrong with it?
It's pretty.

1254
01:07:37,703 --> 01:07:40,115
Dramatic clothes are trendy these days.

1255
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,211
You want to wear one?

1256
01:07:41,296 --> 01:07:42,530
He must like me.

1257
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:43,806
Did it go well?

1258
01:07:43,917 --> 01:07:45,799
I think I might fail this time.

1259
01:07:45,884 --> 01:07:47,488
I prepared so much for it.

1260
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,488
Is there a way to cheer her up?

1261
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:50,885
MC Dot Copy?!

1262
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,790
He's the rapper I look up to the most.

1263
01:07:52,896 --> 01:07:55,738
Yuna, since you're here,
why don't we record something?

1264
01:07:55,843 --> 01:07:56,531
Really?

1265
01:07:56,616 --> 01:07:58,221
She's smiling now.

1266
01:07:58,636 --> 01:07:59,737
Yuna...

1267
01:08:00,015 --> 01:08:01,332
Who is this person?

1268
01:08:01,424 --> 01:08:02,229
Hey...

1269
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:07,006
"Welcome to Waikiki"
