1
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:08,056
What are you looking at, Donggu?

2
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:10,086
Seojin, look.

3
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:14,769
What do you think?

4
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:16,921
Guesthouse Boulanger?

5
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:18,756
-Yes.
-What about this place?

6
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:20,606
Well, it's spring already.

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,111
-We need to change our shop interior too.
-Yes.

8
00:00:23,196 --> 00:00:25,795
So I'm searching for places
where I can refer to.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,886
Isn't here nice?

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,017
Yes, the interior is nice and pretty.

11
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:31,940
Also, the owner gives
home-baked bread for free.

12
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:33,314
-Really?
-Yes.

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,068
What a nice complimentary service.

14
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,084
Um...

15
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:46,200
Hey.

16
00:00:46,436 --> 00:00:47,889
I need to go outside for a while.

17
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:48,807
Now?

18
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:50,345
At this time of the night?

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,871
Yes, I have to do something.

20
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:53,969
Alright, go ahead.

21
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,200
-Alright.
-Okay.

22
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:05,999
Yes, Jungi.

23
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:07,342
I'm here.

24
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:08,635
What? Where?

25
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:13,460
Seojin! It's me.

26
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,354
Oh my! You surprised me!

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,272
Sorry.

28
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:17,304
Come in.

29
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:22,182
Come here.

30
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,223
So...

31
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:29,261
You weren't followed, right?

32
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,426
-What about Donggu?
-He's at home, home!

33
00:01:32,763 --> 00:01:33,859
You are too much.

34
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:35,317
Too much?

35
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:38,174
You know Donggu is watching you
more closely these days.

36
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,875
I can't even go out on a date freely.

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,708
I can't tell anyone
that I have a boyfriend.

38
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:43,704
What is this?

39
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:46,117
There is nothing we can do.

40
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:49,237
But this weekend I have no schedule.

41
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:51,244
-Shall we go on a date?
-Really?

42
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:52,842
No shooting schedule this weekend?

43
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:53,866
Well...

44
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:56,160
I have no schedule this weekend too.

45
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,476
Then...

46
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,288
...let's go on a trip.

47
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:00,680
-Trip?
-Yes.

48
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:01,993
Somewhere close for one night.

49
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:02,911
What do you think?

50
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,866
Don't you think it's too soon
for an overnight trip?

51
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:08,091
What are you thinking about?

52
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:10,428
We will use separate rooms.

53
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:11,832
Are you crazy?

54
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:14,064
Oh.. Okay.

55
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:16,591
Sure, why not?

56
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:17,627
Let's go!

57
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:19,196
Let's go on a trip!

58
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:20,383
Yes, let's go.

59
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:22,076
Let's go on a trip!

60
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:27,079
Hide, hide!

61
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:32,520
Shoot. I lost her. Again!

62
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:34,900
I know she was here somewhere.

63
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:38,909
There is something going on with her.
I am sure!

64
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,362
Kang Seojin! Lee Jungi!

65
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:48,273
I am going to find you guys.

66
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:59,018
Be quick. Every corner!

67
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:00,023
Clean it.

68
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:03,740
You hardly get any customers,
but you clean so much.

69
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,444
-Why, you...
-That's what I mean.

70
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:09,679
The weather is getting warm.
I wish I can go on a trip and relax.

71
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:11,468
A trip? What are you talking about?

72
00:03:11,553 --> 00:03:13,460
We don't have money.

73
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:14,589
Just clean.

74
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,229
Yes, Hyeonjun.

75
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,732
I haven't told them yet.

76
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:21,084
But I don't think I can go.

77
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,369
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:23,483
Alright.

79
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:26,406
What? Can't go? Where?

80
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:27,778
Well...

81
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:30,245
...my baking class is going
on a group trip.

82
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:33,756
I told them I can't go because
I need to work and take care of Seol.

83
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:34,999
What? Why?

84
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:36,376
Just go.

85
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:39,089
You shouldn't miss it
when the whole class is going.

86
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:42,044
Yes, you should. We can take care of Seol.

87
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,064
By the way, when is it?

88
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:45,225
This Saturday. It's an overnight trip.

89
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:47,549
What? Overnight trip?

90
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:51,917
That means she'll be spending
two days with Song Hyeonjun.

91
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:54,702
No, I can't let that happen.

92
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:55,897
Wait, wait.

93
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:59,613
Oh, shoot. That's too bad.

94
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:05,996
That trip and our workshop
are precisely on the same day.

95
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,098
Workshop? We're going on a workshop?

96
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,198
Yes.

97
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,270
We've been working hard
doing the laundry, washing the dishes...

98
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:13,854
...and cleaning the place.

99
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:17,595
So I was planning an overnight workshop.

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,625
Since when? You said you have no money.

101
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,692
Oh, well...

102
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:24,618
...I wanted to surprise you
so I was acting.

103
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,315
It's a surprise.

104
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:28,971
Anyway, Yuna.

105
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,840
I guess you can't join
your class on that trip.

106
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:33,846
It's alright. I don't mind.

107
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:36,643
Okay! So, all of you can
make it this weekend, right?

108
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:37,754
Wait!

109
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:39,917
This weekend?

110
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:41,855
I can't make it.

111
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:43,554
Why? Do you have a plan?

112
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,285
Huh? Well...

113
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:48,518
I have a story to cover all night.

114
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:50,268
Oh, really?

115
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:52,449
Me too. I can't go.

116
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:55,046
I have an overnight shooting this weekend.

117
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:56,108
What?

118
00:04:56,308 --> 00:05:01,106
So the two of you happen to
work all night this weekend?

119
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,344
-Yes, that's right.
-It's true.

120
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,391
Is it?

121
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:06,905
What's the story you'll be
covering all night, Seojin?

122
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:07,822
What?

123
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:11,178
It's... a funeral.

124
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:12,846
What? Funeral?

125
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,001
But the weekend is still a few days away.

126
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:18,880
How do you know someone will pass away?
That doesn't make any sense.

127
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:19,797
Huh?

128
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:22,067
Well...

129
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:23,908
...that person might
pass away anytime soon.

130
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:26,818
-Oh, no.
-It could be this weekend.

131
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:29,462
So my seniors told me to be on standby.

132
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,781
- Really?
- Yes, really.

133
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,323
Then can I call your senior
to ask about this?

134
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,167
What?

135
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:38,135
He's starting again.

136
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:42,708
Whatever. Here you go.

137
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,070
Go ahead. Call them.

138
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,133
Oh, really?

139
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:49,052
I will call them now.

140
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:50,784
Go ahead and dial.

141
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,423
Check with them.

142
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:54,448
I will call. I will.

143
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:58,110
I'll push the call button now...!

144
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,130
Okay. That's enough.

145
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,707
Fine. I believe you.

146
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:09,093
-But no one else can back out.
-Yes!

147
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:12,606
Dusik and I need to shoot photos
for our online shopping mall this weekend.

148
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:15,595
You can shoot at the workshop.

149
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:19,306
Well, then. We will leave
early this Saturday.

150
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,060
-No more excuses.
-Yes!

151
00:06:21,144 --> 00:06:22,829
-Go back to cleaning.
-Let's clean.

152
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,767
Come on, hurry up.

153
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:29,235
Downstairs, now!

154
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
Donggu, we haven't been
on a trip for so long.

155
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:35,395
I was so excited yesterday,
I couldn't sleep.

156
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,884
Man, are you that happy?

157
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:38,735
Yes. Yuna, what about Seol?

158
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,438
She's asleep. I want to let
her sleep for a while.

159
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:42,869
Good thinking.

160
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:45,931
Hey! Are you a refugee or an immigrant?

161
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,884
What is all this?

162
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:48,199
What do you think?

163
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,603
The clothes for the photo shoot.

164
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:50,872
All of these?

165
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,680
You need all of these for the potshot?

166
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:55,682
And whose fault is it?

167
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:59,323
Who's forcing us to go
when we said we can't go?

168
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:00,698
Of course, you need all these.

169
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:02,656
Bring more. More.

170
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:06,224
You guys are leaving now?
Have a safe trip.

171
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:07,765
-Are you going to work?
-Yes.

172
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,183
Why are you wearing a backpack to work?

173
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,316
Well...

174
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:15,082
...I need a lot of stuffs
because I'll be working all night.

175
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,708
I wish you could come with us, Seojin.

176
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:18,812
Me too.

177
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:23,314
I really want to go but I have to work.

178
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,610
Hey, Kang Seojin!

179
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:30,411
You know what will happen if you get
too close to Jungi while I'm gone.

180
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,691
You will be buried in the ground
before you know it.

181
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:37,930
You were about to say this?

182
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:41,926
I will be 500 meters away
from Jungi instead of five, okay?

183
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,913
Great.

184
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:44,831
Go on. Good girl.

185
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:49,204
I think Seol is awake.

186
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:50,644
I'll go get her.

187
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:51,900
Yes, go on.

188
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,676
"Hyeonjun"

189
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,250
Why is this guy calling again?

190
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:03,646
Hello?

191
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,668
Yes, it's me. Kang Donggu.

192
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,354
Yuna can't pick up the phone now.

193
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:09,728
What is it?

194
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:11,691
I heard you are going on a workshop.

195
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:15,242
So I wanted to tell
Yuna to have a safe trip.

196
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:19,657
Don't worry. Yuna will have
so much fun with us.

197
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:22,893
Please enjoy your own trip.

198
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:24,938
We need to get going.

199
00:08:28,028 --> 00:08:29,603
I hung up before he could speak.

200
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,532
Yes, I'm here.

201
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:42,864
What?

202
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:45,449
Where? Three o'clock?

203
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:47,238
Where is that?

204
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:50,033
Oh, gosh.

205
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:52,022
What is that. You startled me.

206
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:53,510
Get in before someone sees you.

207
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,152
Oh, remove this cover first. Hurry up.

208
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,738
What the...

209
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:03,057
What is this, "007"
or "Mission impossible"?

210
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:06,578
I can't tell if I'm on
a date or a spy mission.

211
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,553
Give me your bag.

212
00:09:18,678 --> 00:09:20,891
Is this really necessary?

213
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:23,289
Better safe than sorry, you know.

214
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,679
What is that smell?

215
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:30,567
- The car smells funny.
- I don't know.

216
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:33,915
It smells funny ever since
Dusik and Sua practiced driving in it.

217
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:37,043
Anyway, let's go!
For our first trip together.

218
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:44,090
Seojin! Are you okay?

219
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:45,355
I'm fine.

220
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,120
But Jungi.

221
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:50,077
Please change the car
when you make some money.

222
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:52,589
Why? My Rebecca is fine.

223
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:54,112
See this? You okay, Rebecca?

224
00:09:54,197 --> 00:09:56,370
Look, she's fine. She's angry.

225
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:58,603
Let's go. Let go for our trip!

226
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:01,294
What's this?

227
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:07,814
-Is this car really okay?
-Rebecca!

228
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:14,424
The weather is so nice,
and so is the view.

229
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,561
It's even nicer because I'm with you.

230
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:20,584
And that evil Donggu is not here.
It's paradise.

231
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,029
I know, right?

232
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:24,162
Wait, I think that's it.

233
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:26,302
-We are here.
-Oh, there.

234
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:30,865
Let's park here then.

235
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:35,347
I'm so excited.

236
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,644
Let's go, go.

237
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,767
Wow, it's so beautiful here.

238
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:42,672
The name is "Boulanger"?

239
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:43,965
Even the name is pretty.

240
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,591
How did you find here?

241
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:49,640
My brother found it while he was searching
for places with nice interiors.

242
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:52,094
It was so pretty so I wanted to come.

243
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:53,656
With you.

244
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:58,372
My darling Bacca really wanted
to come here with me, huh?

245
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:00,001
Stop it. Stop it.

246
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:01,276
Shall we go in?

247
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,302
-Okay.
-Let's go.

248
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:03,984
Hop on, My princess.

249
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:05,001
Okay.

250
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:06,920
Let's go.

251
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:23,046
Director Bong, are you alright?

252
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,973
No. Carsick is killing me.

253
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,502
It was only a few hours.

254
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,135
Stop being so mean and pat me. Come on.

255
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,702
So troublesome.

256
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:34,046
Ouch! Be gentle.

257
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:35,037
Hey! Hey!

258
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:36,235
I might throw up my organs.

259
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,764
Okay.

260
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:43,012
What? Guesthouse Boulanger?

261
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,451
We are staying at a guesthouse?

262
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,621
Yes. Why?

263
00:11:47,243 --> 00:11:50,687
Isn't it a bit weird for us to stay
at a guest house when we run one?

264
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:52,352
A resort would've been nice.

265
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:54,878
Resorts are expensive.

266
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:58,718
And I wanted to check out
the interior here.

267
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:00,804
Yuna, what do you think?

268
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:02,488
It's really pretty.

269
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:04,368
Hey, let's go.

270
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:06,330
Dusik, let's go.

271
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:07,297
Hurry up.

272
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,814
Mr. Bong, are you done?

273
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:10,986
If you're done vomiting,
get the bags from the car.

274
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:11,904
Hey, hey.

275
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:14,803
I don't feel so good. You do it.

276
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:17,465
That's not the kind of work for a CEO.

277
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,116
Stop complaining and get the bags.

278
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,343
She's such an evil CEO.

279
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:31,115
I want to look pretty for Jungi.

280
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:35,879
Should I go for a sexy look?

281
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:40,237
Sua! I think this is our room.

282
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:41,889
Oh, I think so.

283
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:44,742
What? I've heard this voice.

284
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:46,599
Seol, isn't it nice?

285
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:57,348
Wow.

286
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:59,588
The room interior is so pretty.

287
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:01,768
Yes, it is. It's very cozy.

288
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,019
Oh? there's another customer.

289
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:07,987
Is she sleeping?

290
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,911
Why don't we unpack first?

291
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:11,145
Yes, sure.

292
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:13,093
Do you like it?

293
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,837
What? Why are they here?

294
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:17,297
What's going on?

295
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:19,899
Gosh.

296
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:23,081
I feel so tired after all that driving.

297
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,773
But it's our first trip together.

298
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,642
We'll have so much fun!

299
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:31,144
Dusik, over here.

300
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:35,392
Oh, is it? Gosh, I feel sick.

301
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,043
What was that?

302
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:39,516
Where is this annoying voice coming from?

303
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,265
-Do you need help?
-It's fine.

304
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:44,613
Why did you bring so many bags?

305
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:50,788
The room is big and clean.
Isn't it, Dusik?

306
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,771
Don't ask me. I feel so nauseous.

307
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,782
There's another customer. Is he asleep?

308
00:13:57,866 --> 00:14:00,766
What are they doing here?

309
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:02,181
Why are they here?

310
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:06,702
Dusik, let's unpack our bags later.
Let's take a look around first.

311
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:08,091
I want to get some rest.

312
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:11,229
Hey, we came so far. Let's go.

313
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:14,587
-I don't feel so good.
-Come on. Let's go.

314
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:17,826
What the heck?

315
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:19,548
Why are they here?

316
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:22,651
Is this where they're having the workshop?

317
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:25,087
I'm going to lose it!

318
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:26,919
Wait.

319
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,353
Seojin!

320
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:30,984
Yuna, Sua.

321
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:32,532
Unpack later and come quick.

322
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:34,160
Okay, we're coming.

323
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,510
Yuna, shall we go?

324
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:36,428
Shall we?

325
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,877
Sol, do you want to look around?

326
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,046
Come to Mommy.

327
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:47,176
What? They came here for their workshop?

328
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,917
For crying out loud.

329
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:51,858
I should go see Junggi.

330
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,529
There's a swimming pool too.
Did you bring swimming suits?

331
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,445
Awesome.

332
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,031
This place is so cool.

333
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,188
Isn't it nice?

334
00:15:01,273 --> 00:15:02,742
-Hello.
-Here are some towels.

335
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:03,752
Oh, thank you.

336
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,668
Let me know if you need anything else.

337
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:07,504
Yes, thank you.

338
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,816
By the way, your guesthouse is so pretty.

339
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:12,283
Thank you.

340
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:16,725
But are you running
this huge guesthouse alone?

341
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:18,802
I didn't see any staffs.

342
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:21,563
It costs too much to hire,
so my wife and I are running it.

343
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:25,677
Actually, we run a guesthouse in Seoul.

344
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:26,812
Oh, really?

345
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:30,686
But you came to guesthouse
when you are running a guesthouse?

346
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:33,320
Pardon? Well, yes.

347
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:34,970
Then you must know how a guesthouse works.

348
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:37,302
Why did you book last minute?

349
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,854
You were lucky
that we had some rooms left...

350
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,642
Aren't you busy?
You should go back to work.

351
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:48,456
Right. Call me if you need anything.

352
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,789
He sure likes to talk.

353
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:54,235
Well, anyway!

354
00:15:54,653 --> 00:16:00,253
We worked so hard doing the laundry
and cleaning after our guests.

355
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:03,720
So let's forget about our jobs
and have some fun.

356
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:06,198
Alright? What should we do?

357
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:09,782
Hey... I need some rest.
I'm still feeling nauseous.

358
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,904
I feel like passing out.

359
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,782
Oh, okay.

360
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:16,989
Let's go inside.
I will take you to our room.

361
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:19,582
Jungi?

362
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,747
Jungi?

363
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:25,632
Where did he go?

364
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:28,287
Dusik, are you alright?

365
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,469
-Maybe, if I lie down for a bit.
-What is this?

366
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:39,945
Here. Lie down for a bit.

367
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:43,726
Thanks.

368
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:46,705
Get some sleep. I will wake you up
later when it's time to eat.

369
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,910
No, I will be out in a while.
Just go and enjoy yourself.

370
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:52,630
Alright.

371
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,800
If you need anything, call me.

372
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:55,718
Okay.

373
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:05,279
He sure sleeps a lot.

374
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:18,048
Seojin?

375
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,799
Seojin?

376
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,851
Where did she go?

377
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,746
Sol, let's eat.

378
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,901
-It's meal time.
-What is this!

379
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:30,767
Mommy will give you some goodies.

380
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:33,961
Are you hungry?

381
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:36,870
I'll get you some goodies. Hold on.

382
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:40,186
Huh?

383
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,696
Huh? Where did it go?

384
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,413
Why? Is something gone?

385
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:49,195
My camera's gone. I know I put it here.

386
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:51,110
Maybe you left it somewhere else.

387
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:53,906
No, I really put it here.

388
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:02,114
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

389
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:04,878
But did you see a camera here?

390
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:12,024
Then, did someone else come
in here while we were away?

391
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:14,340
Go.

392
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,335
This person sure is suspicious.

393
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,297
Excuse me.

394
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:21,394
You should answer
when someone asks you a question.

395
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:23,975
Are you serious?

396
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:26,521
My gosh!

397
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:28,489
What? Jungi?

398
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,426
Donggu!

399
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:31,274
What are you doing here?

400
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:33,378
Huh? Sua?

401
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:38,028
Yuna's here too.
Why are you guys here?

402
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:40,292
Why? We are here for our workshop.

403
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:42,613
Why are you here?
I thought you had shooting schedule.

404
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:43,531
What?

405
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:45,151
Well, the thing is...

406
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:48,869
I have an outdoor shoot for today
and tomorrow nearby this area.

407
00:18:48,954 --> 00:18:52,938
But the waiting time is too long,
so I got a room to take a nap.

408
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:54,886
But why are you sleeping
in the ladies' dorm?

409
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,804
What?

410
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:57,930
This is the ladies' dorm?

411
00:18:58,163 --> 00:19:00,757
I just followed the owner.

412
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:05,969
That clumsy owner.
I should file a complaint.

413
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:08,728
He's running this place alone
so he could've been confused.

414
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,531
There's the camera!

415
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:13,042
Where? Oh!

416
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:16,971
I got it.

417
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,925
You should have looked more carefully.

418
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:21,460
Thank you.

419
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,908
Jungi! What a coincidence.

420
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:32,805
I never thought I would run into you here.

421
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,578
What a coincidence.

422
00:19:34,702 --> 00:19:38,374
I know, right? What a scary coincidence.

423
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,503
It would've been the whole gang
if Seojin didn't have to work.

424
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:43,706
It's so sad.

425
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:46,383
Oh... You're right.

426
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:50,315
Well, it's alright.
Don't you love the view here?

427
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,401
I can't believe there is
a guesthouse here.

428
00:19:55,853 --> 00:19:56,686
What?

429
00:19:57,523 --> 00:19:59,764
What's this rope?
I didn't see this before.

430
00:20:01,857 --> 00:20:02,935
Is this a bell?

431
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:08,275
Sir!

432
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:12,009
Are you okay? I'm really sorry. So sorry.

433
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:15,019
How could you shake the rope
when I was cleaning up there?

434
00:20:15,104 --> 00:20:16,635
Troublemaker.

435
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,534
I'm really sorry.

436
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:21,452
-Do you want me to take you to a hospital?
-No, forget it.

437
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:25,416
There will be a group coming later.
What am I going to do?

438
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,048
I have to clean and and get groceries.
There's so much to do.

439
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,955
Gosh, I'm sorry.

440
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,055
Then, let me ask you a favor.

441
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:33,731
What favor?

442
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,714
Well done.

443
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:46,722
Didn't you say to forget the guesthouse
and enjoy ourselves?

444
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:47,768
What is this?

445
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:51,493
What can I do? He got hurt because of me.

446
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:55,865
We don't mind but Yuna missed
the trip with her baking class.

447
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:57,690
Great job.

448
00:20:58,253 --> 00:20:59,759
I'm sorry Yuna.

449
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:01,804
It's alright.

450
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:05,865
I feel like I can work better here
while breathing in fresh air.

451
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:12,306
It's only until the owner comes back
from the hospital so, just hang on.

452
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,370
Sure.

453
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:18,127
Oh, it's the owner.

454
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:20,653
Yes, sir!

455
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,753
Huh?

456
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,613
Oh, alright.

457
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:27,716
Okay.

458
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:30,435
Why? What is it?

459
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,410
Well...

460
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:33,127
He said he will be late.

461
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:38,535
He wants us to take care of the guests
and buy the groceries too.

462
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,972
Whoop-de-doo.

463
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:41,675
This is so annoying.

464
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,867
I'm sorry.

465
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:47,063
I will go to the groceries.
You guys just clean here.

466
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:50,696
Can you go alone, Donggu?
There's a lot to buy.

467
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:53,467
You two can go then.
We'll take care of Seol.

468
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:55,019
Alright, Jungi?

469
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:56,164
What?

470
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,449
Yes, alright.

471
00:21:57,897 --> 00:22:00,549
Thank you. I will be back soon.

472
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:01,467
Okay, honey?

473
00:22:03,337 --> 00:22:05,433
-Let's go, Donggu.
-Sure. Let's go.

474
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:07,315
-Bye.
-Yes, bye.

475
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:08,339
I'm sorry.

476
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:16,848
Why do you look so anxious?

477
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:17,851
What's wrong?

478
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:18,768
What?

479
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:21,106
No. Nothing's wrong.

480
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,046
"My Love Bacca"

481
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:28,938
Jungi, save me! I'm in the men's dorm.

482
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:31,171
Why is she in the men's dorm?

483
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:36,680
I'm done mopping here.

484
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:38,435
I'll go change the
sheets in the men's dorm.

485
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,671
Sure.

486
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,117
Jungi.

487
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,440
-Oh? Dusik?
-What?

488
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:54,846
Why are you here?
I thought you had schedule.

489
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:56,275
Oh, that...

490
00:22:56,511 --> 00:23:00,044
The shoot is nearby this place
so I booked a room here.

491
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,327
Really?

492
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:03,091
What a coincidence.

493
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,008
I know, right?

494
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:07,361
I'm so stunned that I feel like crying.

495
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,461
Dusik, why are you staying in bed
when you came all this way?

496
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:18,898
Let's go out, Dusik.

497
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:22,485
No. I feel dizzy and nauseous
because of the car sick.

498
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:26,035
You should get some fresh air.
Let's go for a walk, Dusik.

499
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,236
I don't want to. I'm tired.

500
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,388
Well, then just sleep.

501
00:23:29,472 --> 00:23:31,800
-I'm not sleepy.
-Then just close your eyes.

502
00:23:31,884 --> 00:23:33,756
-No, I need to play game.
-Man! Get out!

503
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,157
Why are you staying inside? Why!

504
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:37,318
That's up to me. Why are you yelling?

505
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,253
What?

506
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:40,796
Well, that's because...

507
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:43,136
...I'm worried about you.

508
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,222
I'm worried.

509
00:23:44,307 --> 00:23:46,309
Since when did you care about me so much?

510
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:48,016
Whatever. I want to play
my game so don't bother me.

511
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,956
What the hell?

512
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,697
Why, you...!

513
00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:54,191
Jungi! What are you doing?
The guests are here. Come out.

514
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:56,135
Alright.

515
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:02,810
Fine. Don't move and stay here, okay?

516
00:24:02,894 --> 00:24:05,055
I will find way to let you out.

517
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,894
Do you trust me? Just hold on.

518
00:24:07,978 --> 00:24:09,823
I'll be right back. Okay?

519
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:17,029
What?

520
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:19,916
Why is he trying to make
someone sick to go out?

521
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,391
What should we buy?

522
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,854
The guests are going to have
barbeque party at night.

523
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,661
Shall we buy some vegetables first?

524
00:24:29,746 --> 00:24:30,579
Yes.

525
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:32,071
There is the shop.

526
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:33,735
Hello.

527
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,355
Welcome, what are you looking for?

528
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:38,912
Lettuce and sesame leaves please.
Enough for 10 people.

529
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:39,862
Alright.

530
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:44,323
You two must be newlyweds.
You two look so great together.

531
00:24:44,408 --> 00:24:45,404
-Huh?
-Huh?

532
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:48,981
It's so sweet of your husband
to help you out with the groceries.

533
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,686
I was like you guys too back then.

534
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:55,299
You guys look so sweet together.
I'll give you extra, okay?

535
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:57,874
It's not?

536
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:01,000
Thank you so much. Thank you.

537
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:04,968
My hubby loves lettuce.
Isn't this great, honey?

538
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:06,737
-Pardon?
-My goodness.

539
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:09,923
Your wife is really cute.
You are lucky.

540
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,142
Have a happy marriage.

541
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:13,996
Yes, thank you.

542
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:15,906
Honey, let's go.

543
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:16,824
What?

544
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,001
What are you doing?

545
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:25,007
Did you call me "honey"?

546
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:27,973
Why correct her when she gave us more?

547
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:30,398
We can have the extra
for ourselves, right?

548
00:25:30,482 --> 00:25:32,965
Hey, that's wrong.

549
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,567
Lying is bad, Yuna.

550
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:42,076
Honey. It's your favorite, pork belly.

551
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:45,778
But I can only buy 1.2 kg
because I don't make enough money.

552
00:25:45,863 --> 00:25:49,900
That's not enough for my darling.

553
00:25:49,985 --> 00:25:52,380
We will need more. What should I do?

554
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:02,602
Honey. It's your favorite fruit, apple.

555
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:06,218
But I can't afford to buy more.

556
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:08,315
What should I do?

557
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,272
I feel so sad.

558
00:26:17,265 --> 00:26:18,117
What was that?

559
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,546
You said lying is bad.

560
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:24,830
Well, we did get extra pork and fruit.

561
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,291
What else do we need to buy?

562
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:35,962
Yuna, follow me.

563
00:26:36,577 --> 00:26:37,627
-Why?
-Come with me.

564
00:26:37,711 --> 00:26:38,968
Where are we going?

565
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:41,918
Why are we here?

566
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,440
Oh, this is pretty.

567
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:47,672
Let's see.

568
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:50,081
Come here.

569
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:07,059
Donggu.

570
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:09,833
Oh, it's just that...

571
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:14,287
...your hair keeps falling down
and you can't see.

572
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:17,941
It will be troublesome for me
if you trip and fall.

573
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:20,706
That's why I'm buying it for you.
Don't take it too seriously.

574
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:23,206
It doesn't mean anything. Really.

575
00:27:26,574 --> 00:27:27,587
Thank you.

576
00:27:28,616 --> 00:27:29,449
Gosh.

577
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:31,954
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

578
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:35,954
Let's go.

579
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,410
Yuna.

580
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:45,109
Let's go.

581
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:54,796
You like Soondae, right?

582
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,703
-Yes.
-Shall we go get some?

583
00:27:57,021 --> 00:27:57,966
Shall we?

584
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:02,342
Two portions of Soondae please.

585
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:03,697
-Sure.
-Thanks.

586
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:12,250
Why?

587
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:14,603
You want some rice wine too?

588
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:15,527
What?

589
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:16,763
No.

590
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:19,560
They just seem to be enjoying it so much.

591
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:21,896
You should drink.

592
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:23,508
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

593
00:28:23,592 --> 00:28:24,893
One rice wine please.

594
00:28:24,977 --> 00:28:25,881
Alright.

595
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,451
-It's fine.
-It's alright.

596
00:28:37,481 --> 00:28:39,402
God, it's so tasty.

597
00:28:39,922 --> 00:28:41,791
Is it that good?

598
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:43,227
-Yes.
-Do you want one more?

599
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:45,984
I may get drunk if I drink more.

600
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,127
It's okay to get drunk today.
Just drink one more cup.

601
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:51,415
Shall I?

602
00:29:01,937 --> 00:29:06,503
I shouldn't have given her more rice wine.

603
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,303
Smoke is killing me.

604
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:14,952
Why are we making fire
when we are here to enjoy?

605
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:16,762
This is ridiculous.

606
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:20,851
Why did you choose this place
as your workshop venue? Why?

607
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:23,795
Don't get mad at me.
Donggu chose this place.

608
00:29:24,824 --> 00:29:27,332
-Is it done?
-Oh, yes, yes. Soon.

609
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:29,789
Oh, got it.

610
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:31,403
You can grill here.

611
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:32,971
Really? Thank you.

612
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,596
It looks so delicious.

613
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:42,548
Do you want to join us?
We have a lot of food.

614
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:43,494
Really?

615
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:44,960
Oh, wait.

616
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:47,666
Dusik also didn't eat anything.

617
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:49,078
I should go and ask him.

618
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,013
Oh, hold on, wait.

619
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,507
Let me do it. I will. You stay here.

620
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:55,947
-Thank you.
-No problem.

621
00:29:56,672 --> 00:29:58,650
Sol, this is barbeque.

622
00:30:07,397 --> 00:30:09,379
Dusik! Have some barbeque.

623
00:30:09,463 --> 00:30:10,321
Let's go.

624
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:13,210
No thanks. I feel sick.
I don't want to eat.

625
00:30:13,295 --> 00:30:16,431
I can't even bear the smell.
Forget the barbeque.

626
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,169
Maybe if you eat meat,
the sickness might go away.

627
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:21,224
No, I don't want to. I feel sick.

628
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:24,213
Hey! Why are you looking
at your phone when you're sick?

629
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:26,421
Please just sleep! Please!

630
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:29,031
I'm not even sleepy.
Why are you yelling at me again?!

631
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:32,068
You jerk.

632
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:37,392
-Just hang in there.
-What?

633
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,222
Stay strong.

634
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:40,182
Okay?

635
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,733
I will get you out of this room.

636
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:44,683
Okay?

637
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,036
I'm not going out! I don't want to!

638
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:55,097
What's wrong with him?
Stay strong about what?

639
00:30:57,524 --> 00:30:58,757
It's so tasty.

640
00:31:01,436 --> 00:31:03,159
Huh? Why are you alone?

641
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:04,153
Dusik won't eat?

642
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,064
No. He won't.

643
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:07,098
Really?

644
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:11,067
He must be really sick.
You should come and eat.

645
00:31:12,183 --> 00:31:14,400
No, I don't feel like eating.

646
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:21,480
Jungi! I want to eat pork. I'm starving.

647
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:24,895
How can she think about
pork at this moment?

648
00:31:25,981 --> 00:31:28,334
She's unbelievable.

649
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:35,461
Give me.

650
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,797
What? Why are you taking it?

651
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,031
You said Dusik won't eat.

652
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:40,949
What?

653
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:44,041
Oh, well...

654
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:47,855
There is starving cat nearby.

655
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:50,573
I feel so bad.

656
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,133
Can I take this?

657
00:31:52,217 --> 00:31:53,486
Yes, sure.

658
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:54,442
Thank you.

659
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:08,251
Why are you here again?
I don't want to eat.

660
00:32:08,335 --> 00:32:10,483
I'm not here to see you.

661
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:11,588
Then why are you here?

662
00:32:11,672 --> 00:32:14,050
You don't need to know.
Just play your game!

663
00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:15,638
Why are you yelling again?!

664
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:18,992
What's with that cup?

665
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:20,702
Huh?

666
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,412
It's.. coffee. Coffee.

667
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,048
I saw you in bed so I'm going.

668
00:32:38,138 --> 00:32:38,974
Hold it.

669
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:42,609
What happened to the coffee that was
in your hand just now?

670
00:32:45,974 --> 00:32:47,537
Huh? Oh, well?

671
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:51,858
Ta-da!

672
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:53,737
It's a magic. Magic!

673
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:56,846
It's completely gone. Right? Where is it?

674
00:32:57,318 --> 00:33:00,210
Holy cow! That's so amazing.
How did you do it, bro?

675
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:03,015
Show me again! One more time.
Again! Again!

676
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:05,157
Why should I? Piss off.

677
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:09,568
I know he had the cup.

678
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:11,012
Lettuce?

679
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,458
What the?

680
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,677
Please, just show me. It's so amazing.

681
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:19,053
Really?

682
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,437
That's really what you want?

683
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:23,809
Yes, I want to see it again.

684
00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:25,242
I want to see again. Show me.

685
00:33:25,326 --> 00:33:26,706
Hold on.

686
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:32,963
Hey, what about the magic?
Where are you going?

687
00:33:42,593 --> 00:33:43,991
Ta-da.

688
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:47,921
Wow! Amazing! This is really amazing!!

689
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:50,130
Where did it go? Show me again.

690
00:33:50,214 --> 00:33:52,171
Why should I? Piss off!

691
00:33:53,235 --> 00:33:54,212
How did he do it?

692
00:33:56,465 --> 00:33:58,017
Garlic and sauce?

693
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,968
Bro, don't be like that.
Just show me one more time.

694
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:03,008
One more time.

695
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:04,875
Really?

696
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:06,635
You really want it?

697
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:12,837
Do you really need to have everything?

698
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:16,905
What are you talking about?
I'm just curious.

699
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:19,315
Just one last time. Please?

700
00:34:20,923 --> 00:34:22,694
Fine, you really want it?

701
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:36,056
Ta-da.

702
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:41,394
Wow, this is really cool. Amazing.
Where did it go? Where?

703
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,534
It's the last time. It's done!

704
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:48,159
I can't do this anymore.
Don't ask me for more.

705
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:51,294
Fine. But it's really cool.

706
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:52,843
Bro, when did you learn to do magic?

707
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:54,497
I don't know! Back off!

708
00:34:56,062 --> 00:34:56,895
Get lost!

709
00:34:57,369 --> 00:34:58,409
What's your problem?

710
00:35:19,657 --> 00:35:23,376
Yuna, you are drunk. Stop drinking.

711
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,842
I'm not drunk at all.

712
00:35:26,314 --> 00:35:27,495
I am fine.

713
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,583
Alright. But stop drinking.

714
00:35:29,855 --> 00:35:31,970
We have more groceries to buy.

715
00:35:32,784 --> 00:35:33,726
Fine.

716
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:38,819
But, Donggu... Do you like hide and seek?

717
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:40,553
Hide and seek?

718
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:44,142
I love hide and seek.
Do you want to play?

719
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,073
Do you want to play?

720
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:48,953
What hide and seek?

721
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:51,326
We're not done with grocery shopping.
Get up.

722
00:35:58,527 --> 00:35:59,719
How much?

723
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:01,026
14,000 won.

724
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:07,235
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

725
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:09,141
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

726
00:36:09,258 --> 00:36:10,526
Yuna, let's go...

727
00:36:11,848 --> 00:36:12,681
What?

728
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:14,492
Yuna?

729
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:15,640
Yuna?

730
00:36:16,581 --> 00:36:18,510
Where is this woman?

731
00:36:19,112 --> 00:36:20,565
This is crazy.

732
00:36:20,898 --> 00:36:21,753
Yuna!

733
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,046
Yuna!

734
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:24,558
Yuna!

735
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,924
Where is she? Yuna!

736
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:29,136
Yuna!

737
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,476
Yuna!

738
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:32,743
Yuna!

739
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:33,980
-Hey, you!
-Yes?

740
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,094
Here.

741
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:43,735
Yuna, what are you doing here?

742
00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:47,372
I'm busted.

743
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:50,425
You found me.

744
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:54,227
Now I need to find you.
Go and hide, Donggu. Hide.

745
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:58,817
Why would I hide?
Pull yourself together, Yuna.

746
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:02,055
She was fine just before. What's wrong?

747
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:05,252
Well, she had some
rice wine and got drunk.

748
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:07,617
Oh, can I have this green onion?

749
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:08,672
Sure.

750
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:12,298
Yes, here.

751
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:15,754
What?

752
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,518
Yuna? Where is she?

753
00:37:20,091 --> 00:37:22,234
She's driving me crazy.

754
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:31,584
Yuna, what are you doing?

755
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:35,168
Oh! You got me again.

756
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,145
Okay!

757
00:37:36,294 --> 00:37:39,318
I will catch you. Donggu, hide.

758
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:40,892
This is crazy.

759
00:37:41,308 --> 00:37:43,629
Why are you so obsessed
with hide and seek?

760
00:37:43,713 --> 00:37:44,658
You don't want?

761
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:49,945
Fine. Okay. Then I will go hide.

762
00:37:50,429 --> 00:37:52,067
Where do you think you're going?

763
00:37:52,712 --> 00:37:56,336
Let me go, Donggu. I need to hide.

764
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,819
What should I do with her?

765
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:01,665
Oh!

766
00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:09,113
Donggu, untie me.

767
00:38:09,197 --> 00:38:11,374
I need to hide.

768
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:12,659
Be quiet!

769
00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:15,938
You're the weirdest drunk I've ever seen.

770
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,620
Just follow me!

771
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:20,331
Jeez.

772
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:23,311
For goodness' sake.

773
00:38:45,402 --> 00:38:48,311
Yuna, Yuna. Pull yourself together.

774
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,993
Awe, you got me again.

775
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:55,303
Okay, you hide.

776
00:38:55,447 --> 00:38:56,997
I'll catch you.

777
00:38:57,638 --> 00:38:59,422
My god. I'm going crazy.

778
00:39:01,193 --> 00:39:02,026
Fine. Okay.

779
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:04,133
I will find you again.

780
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,690
You go hide again. Okay?

781
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:11,050
Do you want to know
where I can never find you?

782
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,727
Where?

783
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,527
Over there. Follow me.

784
00:39:15,206 --> 00:39:16,039
Over here.

785
00:39:24,634 --> 00:39:27,641
You mean you can't find me in here?

786
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:29,432
Oh, no. I can't.

787
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:31,603
Okay.

788
00:39:38,812 --> 00:39:39,760
Hide. Hide.

789
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,648
Donggu, I'm done hiding.

790
00:39:42,732 --> 00:39:43,982
Find me.

791
00:39:44,066 --> 00:39:45,249
Alright!

792
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:51,249
Oh, no. I can't find you.
You hid yourself so well.

793
00:39:51,845 --> 00:39:53,723
What should I do?

794
00:39:57,954 --> 00:40:00,131
What am I doing on a trip?

795
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:27,720
What? You found me again.

796
00:40:28,402 --> 00:40:31,535
Donggu, you need to hide.
I will find you.

797
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,469
Please stop, Yuna.

798
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:35,999
Get it together. Please.

799
00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:40,359
Donggu. Are you mad at me?

800
00:40:40,443 --> 00:40:41,569
I am not.

801
00:40:41,653 --> 00:40:44,052
No, I think you are.

802
00:40:44,136 --> 00:40:45,521
I am not.

803
00:40:45,606 --> 00:40:49,787
Sorry, I'm really sorry, Donggu.

804
00:40:49,872 --> 00:40:51,659
You don't need to be sorry.

805
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:54,018
So please just sleep until we arrive.

806
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:55,466
Pretty please.

807
00:40:58,511 --> 00:40:59,770
Donggu.

808
00:40:59,854 --> 00:41:01,092
Now what?

809
00:41:02,112 --> 00:41:04,466
I'm giving you a hard time, right?

810
00:41:05,687 --> 00:41:07,464
I know very well.

811
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,033
But, the thing is...

812
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:13,612
...I'm scared.

813
00:41:17,023 --> 00:41:19,243
I am scared I might get hurt again.

814
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:22,974
I'm scared.

815
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,551
Really scared.

816
00:41:29,563 --> 00:41:33,305
So, Donggu. You shouldn't hate me.

817
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:37,022
Don't hate me.

818
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,719
Dusik, are you okay? Good?

819
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:09,291
Yes. I feel much better
now that I had some rest.

820
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:11,391
Well, that's good to hear.

821
00:42:11,475 --> 00:42:13,136
Then, shall we go out for a walk?

822
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,912
Okay, just after this.
It's the last stage.

823
00:42:19,786 --> 00:42:21,675
What? What is that sound?

824
00:42:23,386 --> 00:42:25,626
Is that snoring?

825
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:29,725
How long is he going to sleep?
He's been sleeping since we came here.

826
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,276
What? What is that?

827
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,969
He has such a long hair.

828
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:37,151
You're right.

829
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:40,270
-Hold on.
-Huh?

830
00:42:40,494 --> 00:42:42,195
Is he wearing a floral pattern outfit?

831
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,113
Floral?

832
00:42:43,705 --> 00:42:44,893
You're right.

833
00:42:45,124 --> 00:42:47,528
It looks like a floral pattern dress.

834
00:42:47,613 --> 00:42:48,900
Is he really a man?

835
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,921
What are you talking about?
He looks like a man.

836
00:42:53,024 --> 00:42:55,103
There are so many men with long hair.

837
00:42:55,188 --> 00:42:57,658
And haven't you heard of "unisex"?

838
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,878
Clothes are not sex-specific these days.

839
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:01,209
Look! I'm wearing flower pattern too.

840
00:43:01,293 --> 00:43:03,480
Hey! What are you doing?

841
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:06,325
But still it's strange.

842
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:08,520
This man has better body shape than me.

843
00:43:08,605 --> 00:43:09,948
-Huh?
-She's right.

844
00:43:10,032 --> 00:43:12,168
-Isn't he a woman?
-What?

845
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:13,919
Sua, go and check.

846
00:43:14,004 --> 00:43:15,583
-Should I?
-Hey!

847
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,704
Don't do that!

848
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:18,128
Don't touch someone who is sleeping.

849
00:43:18,212 --> 00:43:19,605
Where are your manners?

850
00:43:19,689 --> 00:43:22,086
Move. I'll just take a peek.

851
00:43:23,928 --> 00:43:25,403
Move!

852
00:43:32,036 --> 00:43:32,869
Oh, well.

853
00:43:34,687 --> 00:43:35,722
He's a man.

854
00:43:35,806 --> 00:43:36,832
He's got a beard.

855
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:38,573
-Beard?
-Oh, is it?

856
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:39,787
I thought he was a woman.

857
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:41,306
Beard?

858
00:43:41,553 --> 00:43:43,250
-Wait.
-Huh?

859
00:43:43,335 --> 00:43:45,303
Seojin has a beard
even though she's a woman.

860
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:46,643
- Seojin?
- Hey.

861
00:43:46,728 --> 00:43:49,700
No woman can have a beard
like that except Seojin.

862
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,728
- I guess you're right.
- Anyway,

863
00:43:51,813 --> 00:43:54,730
since you're all okay, let's do
the photo shoot when Donggu gets here.

864
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,932
Sure.

865
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:13,733
Yuna.

866
00:44:15,017 --> 00:44:15,850
Yuna.

867
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,352
We are here.

868
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:44,291
Oh!

869
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:47,802
Donggu.

870
00:45:49,143 --> 00:45:50,508
What happened?

871
00:45:50,593 --> 00:45:52,684
What do you think happened?

872
00:45:53,044 --> 00:45:55,789
You got drunk and kept hiding.

873
00:45:56,002 --> 00:45:59,959
I had to search every corner
of the market to look for you.

874
00:46:00,053 --> 00:46:03,823
Oh, really? I did that? I'm sorry.

875
00:46:04,184 --> 00:46:07,038
I play hide-and-seek a lot
when I get drunk.

876
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,885
Any other problems I caused?

877
00:46:12,587 --> 00:46:13,743
No.

878
00:46:13,828 --> 00:46:15,560
Ah, that's a relief.

879
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:18,776
I'm sorry, Donggu.

880
00:46:19,028 --> 00:46:19,914
It's fine.

881
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:21,504
Get some rest.

882
00:46:21,685 --> 00:46:25,054
It's fine. There's so much to do.

883
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:37,802
Where is everyone?

884
00:46:37,887 --> 00:46:39,715
The guests are going to arrive soon.

885
00:46:40,752 --> 00:46:42,068
Excuse me.

886
00:46:42,153 --> 00:46:44,245
Oh, I think the guests are here.

887
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,381
Welcome.

888
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,202
Oh? Hyeonjun?

889
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:52,705
Yuna? What happened?

890
00:46:52,874 --> 00:46:55,004
You came here for your workshop?

891
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:57,761
Yes. Why are you here?

892
00:46:57,846 --> 00:47:01,182
This guesthouse is owned by my friend.

893
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,925
This is so amazing.

894
00:47:03,009 --> 00:47:04,576
Wow, really?

895
00:47:04,661 --> 00:47:06,290
What a coincidence.

896
00:47:12,392 --> 00:47:14,354
Let's move the bags first.

897
00:47:14,439 --> 00:47:15,379
Fine.

898
00:47:17,386 --> 00:47:20,523
Wait? Why is it so noisy outside?

899
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:22,775
Are the guests here? Let's go, Dusik.

900
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:23,693
Okay.

901
00:47:28,941 --> 00:47:31,756
Seojin, Seojin! Get up, Seojin!

902
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:35,684
Wake up!

903
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,584
How can you sleep right now?

904
00:47:39,728 --> 00:47:41,267
Oh, god. What happened?

905
00:47:41,352 --> 00:47:43,990
I don't know. We don't have time.
Let's go before the guys come back.

906
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:45,402
-Hurry!
-Oh, alright.

907
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:55,973
Why is he here? This is crazy, my god.

908
00:47:56,058 --> 00:47:59,476
Seojin, we can't go out this way.
What should we do?

909
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,508
Really? Then what should we do?

910
00:48:03,055 --> 00:48:04,894
Oh, yeah. The window!

911
00:48:06,442 --> 00:48:07,470
Open it.

912
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:09,963
What? What's wrong with this?

913
00:48:10,936 --> 00:48:12,776
I think it's broken.

914
00:48:12,861 --> 00:48:13,694
What?

915
00:48:14,216 --> 00:48:16,161
Damn it. We're in trouble.

916
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:18,501
We can't be seen by Donggu.

917
00:48:19,078 --> 00:48:20,521
What should we do?

918
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,554
Oh, yes.

919
00:48:26,953 --> 00:48:29,197
Why? Do you have an idea?

920
00:48:30,012 --> 00:48:31,208
-Seojin.
-Yes?

921
00:48:31,561 --> 00:48:32,510
You should get in there.

922
00:48:33,816 --> 00:48:34,649
What?

923
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:36,514
In the bag?

924
00:48:36,744 --> 00:48:38,817
- Are you crazy?
- Then what?

925
00:48:38,902 --> 00:48:41,066
Dusik is in front of the door.
The window is broken.

926
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,598
Do you want to crawl
into the blanket again?

927
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:44,516
What if you get caught? Huh?

928
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,300
Do we really need to do this?

929
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:48,926
-There's no other way.
-Jeez.

930
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:51,124
Fine. I will get in.

931
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:53,864
Right. Let's get in.

932
00:49:06,758 --> 00:49:08,141
Get inside.

933
00:49:12,098 --> 00:49:13,300
Careful. Careful.

934
00:49:14,048 --> 00:49:15,180
I will let you out soon.

935
00:49:33,113 --> 00:49:34,297
Hold on a bit.

936
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:53,642
Seojin! Seojin!

937
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:55,034
I'm sorry.

938
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:00,726
-Jungi!
-Oh my god!

939
00:50:00,811 --> 00:50:01,644
Oh my god.

940
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:03,834
Why are you so surprised?

941
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:06,459
Where are you going with my bag?

942
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,397
What?

943
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:09,915
Oh, I was just...

944
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,565
Are you helping us with our bags?

945
00:50:12,649 --> 00:50:13,482
Thank you.

946
00:50:14,388 --> 00:50:16,621
-Why is it so heavy?
-Hey, wait.

947
00:50:16,871 --> 00:50:17,704
No...

948
00:50:20,841 --> 00:50:23,545
Why is it so heavy?
How much clothes did you pack?

949
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:24,462
Quiet.

950
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:33,717
Why are you following us?

951
00:50:33,994 --> 00:50:35,327
-Yeah.
-What?

952
00:50:36,536 --> 00:50:39,136
I just want to help you.

953
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,420
Sua, the bag must be heavy.

954
00:50:41,806 --> 00:50:42,737
Do you need help?

955
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:44,253
Thank you.

956
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:46,843
Let's go.

957
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,897
-Come quick.
-Okay.

958
00:50:57,415 --> 00:50:59,397
This is really great.

959
00:50:59,482 --> 00:51:01,771
I was really sad to hear
that you were not coming.

960
00:51:01,856 --> 00:51:03,264
It's so great that we met here.

961
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:04,237
I know.

962
00:51:04,321 --> 00:51:07,865
I didn't know this guesthouse is
owned by Hyeonjun's friend.

963
00:51:08,788 --> 00:51:10,763
What should we do now?

964
00:51:10,924 --> 00:51:13,147
It's too early for dinner.

965
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:14,931
Shall we play a game?

966
00:51:15,015 --> 00:51:17,198
Sure. Which game should we play?

967
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,650
007 game!

968
00:51:18,735 --> 00:51:20,550
-Electric game?
-King game!

969
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:24,794
The best game to play
on a group trip is...

970
00:51:24,879 --> 00:51:26,640
...foot volleyball!

971
00:51:26,724 --> 00:51:27,849
Foot volleyball?

972
00:51:28,283 --> 00:51:31,336
There are ladies here.
Foot volleyball's not a good idea.

973
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,628
Everybody can play sports
regardless of gender.

974
00:51:34,712 --> 00:51:36,483
What you said can be misunderstood.

975
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:40,798
I just think that everyone's
too tired to play a ball game.

976
00:51:41,214 --> 00:51:44,792
How about an indoor game?
Like charades?

977
00:51:44,877 --> 00:51:47,850
Foot volleyball is the best.

978
00:51:47,935 --> 00:51:49,005
Isn't that right, Yuna?

979
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:53,110
I don't think I can play foot volleyball.
I'm still a bit dizzy.

980
00:51:53,256 --> 00:51:55,524
I think charades would be better.

981
00:51:55,608 --> 00:51:58,372
Join us, Donggu. Please?

982
00:51:58,883 --> 00:51:59,983
Sure.

983
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:01,610
Why not.

984
00:52:08,786 --> 00:52:10,472
I'm really bad at this kind of thing.

985
00:52:10,557 --> 00:52:13,450
We've been living under
the same roof for a long time.

986
00:52:13,535 --> 00:52:18,135
Hyeonjun might have a hard time,
but I can get everything right.

987
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:20,270
"Egg"

988
00:52:23,651 --> 00:52:24,698
I know the answer!

989
00:52:24,782 --> 00:52:26,521
It's "fart"!

990
00:52:30,434 --> 00:52:31,601
I got it.

991
00:52:31,686 --> 00:52:32,871
"Constipation"!

992
00:52:32,956 --> 00:52:34,323
You can't poop.

993
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,460
-"Egg"?
- Correct!

994
00:52:38,616 --> 00:52:39,490
"Shrimp"

995
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:41,668
I know!

996
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:43,794
"Zombie"?

997
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:46,105
Zombie with a broken backbone.

998
00:52:46,733 --> 00:52:47,566
"Shrimp"!

999
00:52:47,782 --> 00:52:48,615
Correct!

1000
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:53,726
What is that? What's that?

1001
00:52:53,811 --> 00:52:55,421
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being."

1002
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:56,673
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being"

1003
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:01,221
"'Even if the world ends tomorrow,
I would still plant my apple tree."

1004
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:02,308
Correct!

1005
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:05,157
Wow, Hyeonjun!
You are really good at this.

1006
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:06,516
How did you get this?

1007
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:09,044
Is this possible? How is this possible?

1008
00:53:10,953 --> 00:53:12,063
Let's do this.

1009
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:13,198
Good, good.

1010
00:53:13,282 --> 00:53:14,175
One more.

1011
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,264
You look kind of snobbish.
Try differently.

1012
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,215
Good, good.

1013
00:53:18,682 --> 00:53:19,993
Seojin! Seojin!

1014
00:53:20,077 --> 00:53:21,015
Yes, Jungi.

1015
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,616
-Stop.
-Let's go.

1016
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:25,278
Are you okay?

1017
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,458
How long should I be here?

1018
00:53:28,172 --> 00:53:31,133
I can't feel my legs and I'm suffocating.

1019
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:33,591
Sorry. Just hang in there a little longer.

1020
00:53:33,702 --> 00:53:35,396
I will find a way, okay?

1021
00:53:35,707 --> 00:53:37,623
Jungi, who are you talking to?

1022
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:38,624
What?

1023
00:53:39,267 --> 00:53:40,105
Oh.

1024
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:42,203
With this rock.

1025
00:53:42,813 --> 00:53:46,492
You must be frustrated
from being stepped on every time.

1026
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:49,269
You're a tough rock.

1027
00:53:50,467 --> 00:53:51,619
What are you talking about?

1028
00:53:51,703 --> 00:53:54,221
Move. I need to take out some
clothes for the next shoot.

1029
00:53:54,305 --> 00:53:55,138
You can't!

1030
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,811
Jeez. What do you mean I can't?

1031
00:53:57,896 --> 00:53:59,796
No, not this bag.

1032
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,333
What are you talking about?
That's my bag. Move right now.

1033
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:04,382
No! I can't give you this bag.

1034
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:06,517
- Never!
- Are you crazy?

1035
00:54:06,602 --> 00:54:08,131
What's up with you? Give me my bag!

1036
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:10,053
No! No! No!

1037
00:54:10,995 --> 00:54:11,888
Oh! There!

1038
00:54:11,972 --> 00:54:12,805
What?

1039
00:54:15,175 --> 00:54:17,197
Hey! What is wrong with him?

1040
00:54:17,282 --> 00:54:18,746
Hey, Dusik! Get Jungi. Now!

1041
00:54:18,831 --> 00:54:19,664
Okay.

1042
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:23,720
Jungi!

1043
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:26,283
Jungi! What is wrong with him?

1044
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,952
Where is he?

1045
00:54:49,223 --> 00:54:51,260
Why did he run away with our bag?

1046
00:54:51,344 --> 00:54:53,680
Really. What is wrong with him?

1047
00:54:53,765 --> 00:54:56,731
I don't think he's here.
Let's try over there.

1048
00:54:56,816 --> 00:54:57,649
Okay.

1049
00:55:05,592 --> 00:55:07,567
They are gone! It's over.

1050
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:09,033
It's over now.

1051
00:55:11,634 --> 00:55:12,813
What? What is this?

1052
00:55:14,176 --> 00:55:16,293
What? What is this?

1053
00:55:17,763 --> 00:55:18,596
Wait...

1054
00:55:21,928 --> 00:55:22,761
Seojin!

1055
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:24,316
Seojin!

1056
00:55:24,776 --> 00:55:26,337
Seojin!

1057
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,529
"Shrimp"

1058
00:55:33,614 --> 00:55:34,781
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being"

1059
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:38,569
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being"...

1060
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:41,212
Aren't you hungry after playing games?

1061
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:43,640
Shall we eat something?

1062
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:44,758
Should we?

1063
00:55:45,496 --> 00:55:46,902
Then you ladies take a rest.

1064
00:55:46,987 --> 00:55:49,894
The men should cook on a trip like this.

1065
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:51,882
I will cook.

1066
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:54,015
Hold on.

1067
00:55:55,195 --> 00:55:57,854
Then let's do it
with Kang Donggu, a real man.

1068
00:55:58,695 --> 00:55:59,889
You can cook?

1069
00:55:59,974 --> 00:56:00,807
Of course.

1070
00:56:00,977 --> 00:56:03,727
I've been a guesthouse CEO for years.

1071
00:56:03,913 --> 00:56:06,468
Ordinary chefs can't even compete with me.

1072
00:56:06,552 --> 00:56:10,023
Is that so? Then let's cook together.

1073
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:12,067
Sure, let's go.

1074
00:56:12,242 --> 00:56:14,037
I will show you how real men cook.

1075
00:56:22,684 --> 00:56:24,281
What are you making?

1076
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:27,803
I'm going to grill some meat
and cook kimchi stew.

1077
00:56:27,887 --> 00:56:29,837
Oh, kimchi stew?

1078
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:31,768
I was going to cook kimchi stew as well.

1079
00:56:31,853 --> 00:56:33,348
It's my specialty.

1080
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:34,584
How are you going to cook it?

1081
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:36,779
Just put some pork neck and kimchi...

1082
00:56:36,908 --> 00:56:38,441
...then boil it all together.

1083
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:43,633
The best kimchi stew is
made with mackerel.

1084
00:56:43,717 --> 00:56:46,270
Isn't pork kimchi stew
the most simple way to go?

1085
00:56:46,354 --> 00:56:49,233
Wow, you really don't know.

1086
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,847
Should we have a bet
on which one is better?

1087
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,377
Sure.

1088
00:56:55,321 --> 00:56:56,656
Let's do this.

1089
00:57:35,407 --> 00:57:38,055
Why are there two pots of kimchi stew?

1090
00:57:38,271 --> 00:57:39,123
Oh, well.

1091
00:57:39,227 --> 00:57:42,975
Hyeonjun and I had different ideas
on kimchi stew.

1092
00:57:43,801 --> 00:57:47,264
Everyone, please try them
and decide which was better.

1093
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:50,000
We had a bet.

1094
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,855
Really?

1095
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,811
Let's try.

1096
00:57:58,571 --> 00:57:59,567
This is too greasy.

1097
00:58:02,778 --> 00:58:05,349
This one's really good.

1098
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:07,093
I think so too.

1099
00:58:07,178 --> 00:58:09,667
I think the one with pork tastes better.

1100
00:58:09,751 --> 00:58:10,687
How about you, Yuna?

1101
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:18,495
Oh, this is very good.

1102
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:20,953
What about that one?

1103
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,907
It's tasty.

1104
00:58:31,558 --> 00:58:33,286
But a little greasy.

1105
00:58:34,441 --> 00:58:36,949
Actually, I don't like fish.

1106
00:58:37,985 --> 00:58:38,818
Why?

1107
00:58:38,979 --> 00:58:41,729
Did you cook the one
with the mackerel, Donggu?

1108
00:58:44,283 --> 00:58:46,165
Why is that important?

1109
00:58:46,249 --> 00:58:49,174
What's important is
that everyone enjoys it together.

1110
00:58:50,146 --> 00:58:51,334
I'm sorry.

1111
00:58:52,307 --> 00:58:53,951
No, it's fine.

1112
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,304
I'm going out for a walk.

1113
00:59:11,837 --> 00:59:15,113
The weather is so nice with fresh air.

1114
00:59:15,198 --> 00:59:17,587
I hate Song Hyeonjun.

1115
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,724
Song Hyeonjun, Song Hyeonjun,
Song Hyeonjun!

1116
00:59:19,808 --> 00:59:20,888
That jerk!

1117
00:59:20,973 --> 00:59:24,100
He ruined everything!

1118
00:59:36,688 --> 00:59:39,166
It seems like no one will eat this.
Should I put it away?

1119
00:59:39,251 --> 00:59:41,265
Leave it. I will eat it.

1120
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:42,820
But I thought you don't like fish.

1121
00:59:42,905 --> 00:59:43,738
Huh?

1122
00:59:44,336 --> 00:59:45,169
Well...

1123
00:59:45,556 --> 00:59:47,248
But this one looks delicious.

1124
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:48,868
I'll eat it.

1125
01:00:11,848 --> 01:00:13,745
I always knew that guy was a wacko...

1126
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:15,904
...but I just can't understand this time.

1127
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,794
Why did he run away with our bag?

1128
01:00:18,879 --> 01:00:20,372
Is he really messed up in the head?

1129
01:00:20,457 --> 01:00:21,443
Leave him be.

1130
01:00:21,527 --> 01:00:24,296
Don't try to understand Jungi.
Just give up.

1131
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,221
We couldn't finish the photo shoot
because of him.

1132
01:00:26,305 --> 01:00:27,488
What is this!

1133
01:00:29,364 --> 01:00:30,702
Oh, Jungi?

1134
01:00:30,787 --> 01:00:31,620
What are you...?

1135
01:00:33,145 --> 01:00:34,760
Give me that bag.

1136
01:00:34,844 --> 01:00:37,137
What? What is wrong with you?

1137
01:00:37,222 --> 01:00:39,981
Just give it to me. Right now.

1138
01:00:40,065 --> 01:00:41,904
What did this bag do to you?

1139
01:00:41,988 --> 01:00:43,656
What is wrong with you?

1140
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,082
Just give it to me! Now!

1141
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:46,473
-No!
-Hand it over!

1142
01:00:46,558 --> 01:00:48,650
-Give me!
-Let go of my bag!

1143
01:00:48,735 --> 01:00:50,982
What's wrong, Junggi?

1144
01:00:51,067 --> 01:00:52,320
Give it to me!

1145
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:02,359
My clothes! What did you do?

1146
01:01:02,812 --> 01:01:03,823
Seo.. Seojin!

1147
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:04,968
Seojin!

1148
01:01:05,052 --> 01:01:06,732
What? Seojin?

1149
01:01:06,817 --> 01:01:08,860
Darn! Seojin!

1150
01:01:15,397 --> 01:01:16,781
Seojin, no!

1151
01:01:16,866 --> 01:01:18,535
-Seojin!
-What's wrong with him?

1152
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,528
No, no!

1153
01:01:20,613 --> 01:01:22,134
Seojin! Seojin!

1154
01:01:22,413 --> 01:01:23,098
Seojin!

1155
01:01:23,182 --> 01:01:25,655
Wait, Seojin? What is he talking about?

1156
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,184
I don't know. I think he's crazy.
What should we do?

1157
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:29,136
Seojin!

1158
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,146
No, Seojin! Seojin!

1159
01:01:33,235 --> 01:01:34,371
Why are you looking for Seojin?

1160
01:01:34,456 --> 01:01:36,440
-Jungi!
-Get out!

1161
01:01:38,521 --> 01:01:40,530
Get out!

1162
01:01:47,982 --> 01:01:49,384
Seojin! Seojin!

1163
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,654
What the hell?

1164
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:55,676
Are you okay?

1165
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,181
Yes, I'm fine.

1166
01:01:59,603 --> 01:02:00,381
I'm okay.

1167
01:02:00,465 --> 01:02:02,639
What? Seojin?

1168
01:02:02,976 --> 01:02:03,820
What?

1169
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:05,463
Why is Seojin here?

1170
01:02:05,554 --> 01:02:06,738
What is going on?

1171
01:02:10,998 --> 01:02:11,831
Is this...

1172
01:02:12,422 --> 01:02:13,427
...magic?

1173
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:16,469
Wow, bro! Amazing!
Can you do this kind of magic too?

1174
01:02:16,554 --> 01:02:19,183
What, magic? Do you know
how ridiculous you sound?

1175
01:02:19,341 --> 01:02:22,740
Jungi, what's happening?
Why is Seojin here?

1176
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,063
Well...

1177
01:02:24,148 --> 01:02:25,629
Hey, what are you guys doing over there?

1178
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:27,100
What is it?

1179
01:02:27,323 --> 01:02:29,152
-Donggu.
-What are you doing?

1180
01:02:29,798 --> 01:02:30,914
What? Seojin?

1181
01:02:31,376 --> 01:02:32,319
Why are you here?

1182
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:35,694
You said you were covering a funeral.

1183
01:02:36,138 --> 01:02:38,674
Donggu... The thing is...

1184
01:02:38,758 --> 01:02:39,903
-Wait. Wait.

1185
01:02:40,741 --> 01:02:43,117
Why am I getting a bad feeling about this?

1186
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:50,091
Why do I feel like I'm about to
find out something awful?

1187
01:02:51,031 --> 01:02:51,864
I...

1188
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:54,597
Well, it's...

1189
01:02:54,877 --> 01:02:55,710
Jungi.

1190
01:02:56,471 --> 01:03:00,696
Let's just stop here. Let's come clean.

1191
01:03:01,269 --> 01:03:02,874
Come clean about what?

1192
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:04,494
What is it?

1193
01:03:05,371 --> 01:03:06,456
Well...

1194
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:09,533
Well, I... The thing is...

1195
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:14,068
Are you going to be like this?
Fine. Just forget about it.

1196
01:03:14,263 --> 01:03:15,893
You jerk.

1197
01:03:30,879 --> 01:03:31,712
What is that?

1198
01:03:34,884 --> 01:03:36,079
What are you two doing?

1199
01:03:37,236 --> 01:03:38,381
Why are you holding hands?

1200
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:40,190
Donggu.

1201
01:03:41,272 --> 01:03:42,686
I like Seojin.

1202
01:03:42,921 --> 01:03:43,754
What?

1203
01:03:46,304 --> 01:03:47,357
What?

1204
01:03:49,114 --> 01:03:50,446
What are you talking about?

1205
01:03:51,336 --> 01:03:52,431
I, Lee Jungi...

1206
01:03:53,684 --> 01:03:55,446
...like your sister, Kang Seojin.

1207
01:03:55,652 --> 01:03:56,485
No.

1208
01:03:58,132 --> 01:03:59,182
I love her.

1209
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:01,492
What?

1210
01:04:02,561 --> 01:04:03,576
Love?

1211
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,311
So, let me sum this up.

1212
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:11,979
You and Seojin love each other?

1213
01:04:14,248 --> 01:04:15,201
Are you serious?

1214
01:04:15,317 --> 01:04:17,854
Yes! I love Seojin!

1215
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:21,817
So... Kill me or whatever.

1216
01:04:22,555 --> 01:04:23,679
Do what you want.

1217
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,495
Kill you?

1218
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:28,123
Fine.

1219
01:04:29,688 --> 01:04:31,008
I will kill you!

1220
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:36,671
How could you do this?
My sister of all people!

1221
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:42,070
You jerk! Since when?
When?! Tell me!

1222
01:04:55,717 --> 01:04:59,039
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1223
01:04:59,124 --> 01:05:01,127
So you two deceived me all this time?

1224
01:05:01,212 --> 01:05:02,294
You are not my sister anymore.

1225
01:05:02,379 --> 01:05:03,679
Donggu, let's talk.

1226
01:05:03,764 --> 01:05:05,672
You don't exist to me.

1227
01:05:05,757 --> 01:05:07,965
So don't even try to talk to me.

1228
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:11,558
I will not shave
until you acknowledge us.

1229
01:05:11,643 --> 01:05:13,080
-Understand?
-What?

1230
01:05:13,164 --> 01:05:15,483
He's like the Park Bogum
of the modeling world.

1231
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:17,232
I'm Min Sua.

1232
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:18,725
Bad rhinitis!

1233
01:05:20,046 --> 01:05:21,064
What is this smell?

1234
01:05:21,148 --> 01:05:23,153
How could his feet smell so bad?

1235
01:05:24,028 --> 01:05:26,851
-I'm sorry.
-I don't feel like shooting today.

1236
01:05:26,936 --> 01:05:27,962
You stay here.

1237
01:05:28,047 --> 01:05:30,025
You crazy jerk!

1238
01:05:30,165 --> 01:05:32,891
This calls for a celebration.
How about a drink later?

1239
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:35,215
I should celebrate together.

1240
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:38,631
- You said you want to tell me something.
- Yes, I...

1241
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:41,937
I think Song Hyeonjun,
is actually a nice guy.

1242
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,786
Donggu, you're such a fool.

1243
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:44,821
Yuna.
