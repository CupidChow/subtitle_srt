1
00:00:00,894 --> 00:00:02,007
What is it?

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:06,515
Then say, I like you.

3
00:00:06,619 --> 00:00:09,419
Donggu, I like you.

4
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:10,322
Make it more cute.

5
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:12,030
I like you.

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,119
More brave.

7
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:15,211
I really like you.

8
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:32,422
What is this?

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,191
I like you.

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,430
I really do, Donggu.

11
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:49,394
Shall we...

12
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,483
...see each other, seriously?

13
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,486
Yuna?

14
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:10,341
Really? Yuna confessed to you?

15
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:12,555
Wow, you succeeded.

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,549
-It's great, Donggu.
-Congratulation, Donggu.

17
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:17,255
-Great, congratulation, Donggu.
-Thank you.

18
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:20,936
But this feels so weird.

19
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,949
My ex received confession from
other woman, but I'm celebrating.

20
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:25,607
Is this okay?

21
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:29,909
I know, you're so cool.
You're like human dry ice.

22
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,004
I can even see the fog.

23
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,191
She's here. Donggu's woman.

24
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:41,080
Yuna, give me that.

25
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:44,079
You're up early.
Did you sleep well?

26
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:45,982
-Yes, I did.
-What are you doing today?

27
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:47,482
Are you going to academy?

28
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,668
-Yes.
-After that, what are you doing?

29
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:50,961
Are you going to bakery?

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,358
Yes.

31
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:57,970
I see.

32
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:01,660
Seol's up.

33
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:07,836
What? What was that?

34
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:09,542
Aren't you guys in a relationship now?

35
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,431
Yes, we are.

36
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,944
She asked me yesterday and asked me
about our serious relationship.

37
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,730
Well, then did you say you want to?

38
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:17,994
Hey, I don't need to say that.

39
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:19,736
Of course, bro.

40
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:21,736
You should say you want to,
then it's a done.

41
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,232
-Isn't it, Dusik?
-What?

42
00:02:23,948 --> 00:02:26,948
Yes, it is. If you didn't say,
you're not in a relationship.

43
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:28,144
Is that so?

44
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:30,755
Then, Yuna and I are not going out?

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,951
If you're not sure, ask her. To Yuna.

46
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:34,848
Hey, how I can do that now?

47
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:37,457
Hey, what if later you find out
only you're in the relationship?

48
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:38,552
Can that happen?

49
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:42,060
I should ask her.

50
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:49,812
-He's really going to ask her.
-He's a fool.

51
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:53,228
Hey, love makes a fool.

52
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:55,328
But I think he is real fool.

53
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:00,079
-Quiet.
-Why won't you play with me too!

54
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:03,595
-God, is it funny to make fun of him?
-Yes, it is.

55
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:06,286
-Me too.
-It really is.

56
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,484
Laugh with me! Laugh!

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,092
Yuna.

58
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:18,592
Can I go in?

59
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:20,176
Yes.

60
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,866
Well, Yuna.

61
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,667
May I ask you something?

62
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:34,667
Yes.

63
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:38,167
Yesterday...

64
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,477
Do you remember confessing to me?

65
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,675
You sent me
a video saying that you like me.

66
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:45,564
You said we should date each other.

67
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:48,072
Also, we smiled together
looking at each other.

68
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,262
Yes.

69
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:53,441
Well, so are we...

70
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:55,346
...in a relationship?

71
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:57,345
Yes.

72
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,142
Right?
We are, right?

73
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,048
I told you guys!

74
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,237
God, those people.

75
00:04:08,743 --> 00:04:10,053
Well, then carry on.

76
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:10,949
Sure.

77
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:17,541
So glad to hear!

78
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:18,843
Hey.

79
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,345
Did you ask?

80
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:23,138
-What did she say?
-We're in a relationship.

81
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:25,247
I told you we are.

82
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:26,446
Is it?

83
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:29,753
Her reaction was really weird.

84
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:31,472
What's weird?

85
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:32,761
Think about it.

86
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,452
You like someone.

87
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,555
You confessed
so you're going out with her.

88
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:37,939
What do you feel?

89
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,656
I'll feel like I can fly the sky.

90
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:43,543
That's right. You are like that.

91
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:48,436
-Of course.
-But, Yuna doesn't seem to be.

92
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,419
Isn't it? Isn't it, Dusik?

93
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:56,820
Yes, really. She kind of looks gloomy.
A bit suffering.

94
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:58,015
Really?

95
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:01,317
Well, I also think
her expression wasn't good.

96
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:02,314
Yes, yes.

97
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:06,417
-Maybe Yuna is regretting?
-Oh, my.

98
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,512
Regret? What regret?

99
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:14,219
Well, sometimes you could regret
for confessing the next day. Isn't it?

100
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:15,417
Isn't it, Dusik?

101
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,560
Yes, yes. Of course.

102
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:23,042
I didn't experience it
but we saw in movies or novels.

103
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:24,454
That mustn't happen.

104
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:25,900
Really that shouldn't.

105
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:29,558
-Well, ask her out for a date now.
-What?

106
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:32,356
Before she changes her mind,
you need to look good to her.

107
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:35,158
Or you will get kicked again.

108
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:39,650
That must not happen!

109
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:55,640
Yes.

110
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:58,544
Donggu is out with Yuna for a date.

111
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,044
Lunch?

112
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:03,732
I ate already.

113
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,843
Did you eat lunch, my Bacca?

114
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:09,843
He's annoying.

115
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:13,126
-Is his tongue gone?
-I miss you too.

116
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,919
Then see you later.

117
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:18,517
You hang up.

118
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:21,732
My Bacca, hang up first.

119
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:26,535
What are you doing?!

120
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,432
You are really too much.

121
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:29,940
Isn't it, Dusik?

122
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:33,933
I want to be too much.

123
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:37,492
Even you and Donggu.
All of you're enjoying spring.

124
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:40,294
But I'm still so cold. Isn't it, Seol?

125
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:43,484
Then you should date someone.

126
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,000
There's a lonely girl next to you.

127
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:46,284
What? Who?

128
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:48,482
Seol?

129
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:50,960
Her?

130
00:06:51,156 --> 00:06:52,269
Suarez?

131
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:53,761
Yes.

132
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:57,727
Lonely people can come together.
It's good.

133
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:01,727
Are you crazy?
How can you put me with him?

134
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:04,614
Hey, I don't want a stupid woman
who doesn't know simple math...

135
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,818
...and thought that the
crown prince is Yoo Ahin.

136
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,310
-You wanna fight?
-I retract.

137
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:12,418
Anyway, I can't date her.
So don't say that. It's terrible.

138
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:13,412
-Fine.
-God.

139
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:16,601
It's more terrible for me. Don't brag!

140
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,697
Look at her turning back,
so terrible, so idiotic.

141
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:24,610
Seol. You shouldn't turn out
so idiotic like her.

142
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,754
Let's read newspaper and get smart.

143
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:31,103
Let me see, is there any fun story?

144
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,198
"Dong Won Economy"

145
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:34,806
Head of households,
with no power to work.

146
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,312
Early retirement.

147
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,819
God, if this happens, it'll be so hard.

148
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,711
-Isn't it?
-Don't even talk about it.

149
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:44,203
It'll be hard to even look
at their wives and children.

150
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,022
That's why I'm worried
about getting married.

151
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:49,411
Don't worry.

152
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,911
You can't get married.

153
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:53,903
How can you criticize me like that?

154
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,581
Wow, there are so many programs
in culture center nowadays.

155
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:05,867
Baby's sense development.

156
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,736
What?

157
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:12,935
What's this sound?

158
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:14,435
What's this sound?

159
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,935
Hey.

160
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,742
-Is that your heart again?
-Jungi.

161
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,051
I think I fell in love.

162
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:25,850
With who? Wait, with her?

163
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:29,446
What are you talking about
right after looking at a photo?

164
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,144
I have no choice.
I'm going to the culture center.

165
00:08:35,637 --> 00:08:37,436
-What are you doing? Get up.
-Me too?

166
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:40,539
Hey, I can't.
Bacca is going to kill me for that.

167
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,837
I didn't tell you to meet her.
I'll meet her. You just come with me.

168
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:47,043
Bro, let's go.

169
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:48,741
Let's go to the culture center!

170
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:51,722
Let me be too much
for other people to see!

171
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,717
Why isn't she talking at all?

172
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:00,511
She looks gloomy.

173
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,295
Is she really regretting
about our relationship?

174
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:05,906
That shouldn't happen.

175
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:08,493
Well, the weather is so nice.

176
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,102
Yuna, what should we do?

177
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:13,799
Shall we eat something?

178
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:14,796
Sure.

179
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:18,494
What would you like to eat?

180
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:20,856
-Would you like soondae? You like it.
-Sure.

181
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:24,467
Shall we go?

182
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:25,451
Sure.

183
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:27,547
What's happening? What?

184
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:29,790
Why is she only saying sure, sure, sure?

185
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,591
Maybe she doesn't want to talk to me?

186
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:34,781
God, it's making me really nervous.

187
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,164
I feel like I have upset stomach.

188
00:09:43,574 --> 00:09:47,077
This is our first date. What is this?

189
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:48,363
God.

190
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:50,995
I need to change this mood.

191
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:55,369
Yuna, would you like to go
somewhere after this?

192
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:57,898
The weather is so nice.
Shall we go to an amusement park?

193
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:58,795
Sure.

194
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,097
Do you like to go on the rides?

195
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:03,898
Yes.

196
00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:10,296
Honey.

197
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,810
Yuna.

198
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:22,905
-Yes?
-Here you go.

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,285
I will give you.

200
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:25,690
It's fine.

201
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:28,089
Hey, I want to give it to you myself.

202
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:29,079
Hurry, open your mouth.

203
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:30,986
It's fine. I'll eat myself.

204
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:33,967
Hurry. I want to give you.

205
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,570
No, it's fine. Really.

206
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:37,467
Why won't you?

207
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:38,753
It's really fine.

208
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:44,955
Are you okay, Yuna?

209
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:47,851
God, it's painful.

210
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,955
I think salt went inside my eyes.

211
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,349
Hold on. I need to go to the restroom.

212
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:55,751
Yuna, I'm really sorry.

213
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:59,449
God, this is crazy.

214
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:06,828
Dusik.

215
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,234
We...

216
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,432
I think people are seriously
misunderstanding us. Isn't it?

217
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:13,217
What misunderstanding?

218
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:16,246
There's something on your lips.

219
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:22,356
What are you doing?

220
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:23,868
People are looking at us strangely!

221
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:24,866
Are you crazy?

222
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:25,773
Move away!

223
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:27,263
Move away!

224
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,655
-Hello.
-Hello.

225
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:36,153
Hello.

226
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,264
Are you here alone?

227
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,285
Well, yes.

228
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,166
We thought we are the only men attending.
There's more.

229
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:44,460
That's nice.

230
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:48,269
Well, I run my own business.

231
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:51,681
I'm really busy so I couldn't
spend lot of time with my kid.

232
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,458
So I took this time for my kid.

233
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:56,552
-Wow, you're really cool.
-Oh, really.

234
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:58,264
Then, well...

235
00:11:58,355 --> 00:12:00,182
Is the teacher married?

236
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:02,476
I'm not sure.
But I think she's single.

237
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,674
Really?

238
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,182
That's good.

239
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,567
Hello.

240
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,377
-Hello.
-Hello.

241
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:10,980
Wow, there are so many fathers today.

242
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:12,669
Nice to meet you.

243
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:16,773
Are you guys all angry?

244
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:19,686
Why do you look so gloomy?
Let's clap together.

245
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:25,301
Today, we will learn how to
massage a baby for better digestion.

246
00:12:25,404 --> 00:12:28,601
Please put the mattress and oil
back at its original place.

247
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:31,006
Fine. Hey, get up.

248
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,313
You guys are Seol's uncles?

249
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:37,202
How was the class?

250
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:39,490
If you like I can help you
to register now.

251
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:41,083
No, thanks. I sincerely refuse.

252
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,877
Don't be like that.
Think about it again.

253
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,069
Massage can help the baby to grow well
only when you do it frequently.

254
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,490
No, it's fine.

255
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:49,982
-Jungi!
-Yes, yes.

256
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,779
What're you doing! Come!
Let's go home!

257
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:52,676
Alright.

258
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:07,567
Hey, where have you been?

259
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:11,480
I just found out the sad truth
about living in strong IT country.

260
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,385
-What?
-I wasted my energy because of you.

261
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,478
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:18,634 --> 00:13:22,033
Seol, is your bowel movement
very active after the massage?

263
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:25,319
It's even louder than usual.

264
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:27,291
-Yes, it is. I'll bring the diaper.
-Sure.

265
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:30,623
Let's change the diaper.

266
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,004
Were you wearing this?

267
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:34,288
What is this?

268
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:36,001
What?

269
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,684
-Dusik.
-Yes?

270
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:39,892
Did teacher...

271
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:42,610
...say that something will
appear after the massage?

272
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:44,507
Why? Is there something on her?

273
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:45,613
-Yes.
-What?

274
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:47,015
-A penis.
-What?

275
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:55,023
What? He's not Seol.

276
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,824
Right? I knew something was wrong.

277
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,126
What are you saying?
What do you mean it's not Seol?

278
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:04,064
Then where is Seol? Where is Seol?

279
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,159
Hey! I think we mixed up
with other baby in the culture center.

280
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,659
What? How could you not check
whether it's Seol or not!

281
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:11,961
You were pressuring me!
I was out of my mind!

282
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:12,963
Shut it!

283
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:15,655
Is it time for you two to fight?
Get Seol quickly! Now!

284
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,246
Right, right. Seol...

285
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:21,843
-Seol!
-Seol!

286
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:23,343
God, really.

287
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,714
Yuna. I'm sorry.

288
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:38,511
Is your eye alright?

289
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,008
Yes.

290
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:42,421
Can you go on rides?

291
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:43,413
Yes.

292
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:47,194
Oh my, oh my.
She looks even more bad now.

293
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,383
God, I need to change this mood.
I need to make up for my mistake.

294
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:53,469
"Viking"

295
00:14:56,376 --> 00:15:00,292
That's it. Just right
amount of thrill and touch.

296
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,980
It'll cheer us up,
and I can show my masculinity.

297
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:04,309
The best ride!

298
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:06,920
Yuna, shall we ride Viking?

299
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:07,626
What?

300
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:09,713
Sure.

301
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:11,219
Let's go.

302
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,296
Alright, Viking's going to start.
Safe bar will go down.

303
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:19,113
Wow.

304
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:22,370
Wow, I haven't been on Viking for so long.

305
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:25,473
Yuna, hold tight.

306
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:26,283
Alright.

307
00:15:26,878 --> 00:15:29,572
If you are too scared,

308
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,572
you can hold me.

309
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:32,678
Alright?

310
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:33,969
Sure.

311
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,881
Let's go!

312
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:40,366
Let's go to the mysterious world.

313
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:54,488
-Aren't you scared?
-Yes.

314
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:04,393
What? Was Viking this scary?

315
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:09,942
What? Why is this going up so high?

316
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,517
It's too high. I'm scared. Stop!

317
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,632
Stop! Stop.

318
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:25,942
Stop!

319
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:30,748
Mister! Mister! Stop it! Let me down!

320
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,287
Mister! I'm scared. Stop it!
Quickly! Stop this!

321
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:48,457
Donggu, calm down.

322
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,060
Let me down now!

323
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:51,938
It's going to stop.

324
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:56,725
Safe bar will go up.

325
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:02,019
Donggu. It's fine now. Get up.

326
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,320
Really?

327
00:17:03,618 --> 00:17:04,320
Yes.

328
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:13,117
It's finished. I was dying there. God.

329
00:17:15,462 --> 00:17:17,666
Yuna, I'm sorry.

330
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:19,570
I'm really sorr...

331
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:28,679
Oh, my! Oh my god.

332
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,765
Hey, Donggu!

333
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:36,840
I earn money for our family so hard.

334
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:41,335
Do I really need to take a day off
to prepare for ancestral rites?

335
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,643
God, my life.

336
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,429
-Hello?
-Hello?

337
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:51,228
Are you Heedong's father?

338
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:54,236
We met at the culture center.
I'm Seol's uncle.

339
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:56,727
Yes. What's up?

340
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,786
Well, I think our babies are changed.

341
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:04,103
We have Heedong
and I think you have Seol.

342
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:07,089
What? That's nonsense.

343
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:13,609
What's wrong? What is it?

344
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:15,303
No, it's nothing.

345
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,110
Meet me in front of restroom
on the second floor in a minute.

346
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:25,221
Why isn't he coming?

347
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,490
Dusik.

348
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:31,291
We may misunderstand the baby
but how could a father doesn't know?

349
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,593
Is he really a father?
He failed as a father!

350
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,203
Heedong. Oh, Heedong.

351
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,371
Hey, where is my Seol?

352
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:43,760
Well, I have some reasons.

353
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,871
What reasons? Where is Seol?

354
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,783
I'm sorry, but can I ask you a favor?

355
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:49,868
-Pardon?
-What?

356
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:51,171
What favor?

357
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:52,278
Actually,

358
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:54,473
I have no job.

359
00:18:54,762 --> 00:18:57,533
I was fired, and I'm staying
at home for 2 years now.

360
00:18:57,635 --> 00:19:01,326
My wife earns money for my family
and I'm not really welcomed right now.

361
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:02,329
So?

362
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:06,634
I always get ignored
by my wife these days.

363
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:10,050
If she finds out I lost my baby,
I may get divorced.

364
00:19:10,243 --> 00:19:11,740
So what do you want us to do?

365
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:14,563
Can we swap the babies
without my wife finding out?

366
00:19:14,674 --> 00:19:17,167
What? Are you kidding me?

367
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:20,277
Just be quiet and bring Seol. Now!

368
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:21,983
It's too much to ask you, right?

369
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:23,276
Alright.

370
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:24,468
Well then.

371
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:26,658
I'll just tell her the
truth, and get divorced.

372
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:28,069
Let's go.

373
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:32,162
Alright, fine.

374
00:19:32,264 --> 00:19:35,058
What do you want us to do?

375
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:38,766
I have a great plan.

376
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:47,158
There is cacao nibs!

377
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:52,372
My favorite cacao nibs.

378
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:58,070
It's buy one free one.

379
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:02,418
Wow, the price is pretty good.

380
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:10,022
Seol.

381
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:12,418
It's not buy one get one free.

382
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:27,146
God.

383
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:30,371
How long do we need to do this?

384
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,157
There's nothing we can do.
He might get divorced.

385
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:34,262
It's a pity.

386
00:20:34,355 --> 00:20:36,575
This happened because you went to
that culture center!

387
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:39,361
-You mixed the babies!
-Are you saying it's my fault?

388
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:41,483
-God.
-God.

389
00:20:42,765 --> 00:20:45,274
Where the hell is this guy?

390
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:46,559
Gosh!

391
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:48,681
Hey.

392
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:50,575
Hey, what are you doing?

393
00:20:50,661 --> 00:20:51,661
I'm sorry.

394
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,894
My wife might see.

395
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,065
Could you sit down for a bit?

396
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,067
-What?
-You should keep a watch there.

397
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:01,812
-What?
-Don't look here.

398
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,113
Mister.

399
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:09,519
How long will you do this?

400
00:21:09,614 --> 00:21:10,735
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:14,322
Consider saving someone's life
and please help me. Please?

402
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:16,735
I know. I want to help you.

403
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:19,358
But your wife never turns around.
She never gives a chance.

404
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:22,747
So that's why I have another perfect plan.

405
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:26,453
What is it now?

406
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:40,197
So here's the plan.

407
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,291
The only place we can
swap Heedong and Seol...

408
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,995
...without my wife knowing
is the cash counter.

409
00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:49,900
It's the only place my wife
doesn't look at the stroller.

410
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:53,896
Cashier in the counter will scan
all the products and say...

411
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:57,896
Total 158 dollars.
Would you like to pay in cash or card?

412
00:21:58,175 --> 00:21:59,282
Card, please.

413
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:01,885
At that point, she'll move
her hands away from the stroller...

414
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:03,194
...to take her wallet out.

415
00:22:03,304 --> 00:22:06,702
From that point, five seconds
to take out her card from the wallet.

416
00:22:06,902 --> 00:22:08,995
-Do you have point card?
-It's my phone number.

417
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:12,635
Five seconds for her to enter her number.

418
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:16,351
Five seconds for the cashier to swipe
the card and print the receipt.

419
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:18,644
Total 15 seconds.

420
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,880
15 seconds, that's our last chance
to swap Heedong and Seol.

421
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:32,094
Code to begin our plan is...

422
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:35,086
..."would you like to pay
with cash or card?"

423
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,593
-Keep in mind.
-Madam.

424
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:40,646
Total 158 dollars.
Would you like to pay in cash or card?

425
00:22:40,746 --> 00:22:42,248
-Card, please.
-Sure.

426
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:39,226
What?

427
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,100
What are you doing?

428
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:45,187
Well. That's...

429
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:47,886
Why are you hugging my baby?

430
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:49,394
Pardon?

431
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,293
Well, well...

432
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:54,198
Mister?

433
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,290
What?

434
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:56,999
Do you know him?

435
00:23:57,704 --> 00:23:59,196
No. I saw him just now only.

436
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:03,093
What? What are you saying?

437
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:06,813
Who are you?
How dare you touch my baby?

438
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,805
Hey, what are you doing?

439
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,813
How dare you touch my Heedong?

440
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:17,109
My Hyesook who suffers to earn money
because of unworthy husband.

441
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:24,091
Warm hearted Hyesook could not even
go overseas and buy pretty clothes.

442
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:28,476
Heedong is the fruit of our love
and how dare you touch him?

443
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:32,282
If you want to harm
my family just kill me, you jerk!

444
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:33,888
-What?
-Wait.

445
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:37,285
I'm not killing anyone.
You said 15 seconds...

446
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,293
Shut up! Shut up, you jerk!

447
00:24:42,658 --> 00:24:46,755
Young man, I don't even know
your name but please let go.

448
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:48,152
Please.

449
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:52,445
Mister, I don't even know your
name but this is not right.

450
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:56,168
Please help me regain
my reputation in this house.

451
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:02,771
God, I'm busted.

452
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:06,342
What a great husband?

453
00:25:06,737 --> 00:25:07,644
Madam.

454
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:11,255
You're blessed to have
this man as your husband.

455
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
I'm going.

456
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:15,362
Go.

457
00:25:17,764 --> 00:25:21,361
Do not ever show yourself again!
You jerk!

458
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:28,368
Honey, I didn't know
you cared me that much.

459
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:30,559
Honey!

460
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,861
Thank you. Young man
whom I don't even know the name.

461
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:40,449
You're welcome.

462
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:42,265
Husband in Korea.

463
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:43,868
Cheer up!

464
00:25:55,427 --> 00:25:56,796
Yuna, I'm sorry.

465
00:25:57,144 --> 00:25:59,334
I felt really sick.
I couldn't hold it.

466
00:26:00,922 --> 00:26:02,438
Are you angry?

467
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,621
No.

468
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:07,224
You are really not angry?

469
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:09,835
Yes.

470
00:26:10,522 --> 00:26:14,950
She's angry. Angry.
She certainly looks really sullen.

471
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:18,458
It's our first date but I hit her eye
with soondae and threw up on her skirt.

472
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:24,045
She must be angry. This is great.
She really seems regretting it.

473
00:26:24,244 --> 00:26:25,425
Hey, Yuna.

474
00:26:25,844 --> 00:26:28,124
Aren't you thirsty?
Do you want some drinks?

475
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:29,123
Sure.

476
00:26:31,928 --> 00:26:33,144
Hold on a bit.

477
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:58,331
It's over. It's done.
She doesn't look happy.

478
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,527
All day, she only said yes.

479
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:04,130
I bet she's regretting it.

480
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,545
I'm done.

481
00:27:07,437 --> 00:27:09,149
It's over.

482
00:27:18,868 --> 00:27:20,769
"Seojin"

483
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:24,878
Yes, Seojin. I'm on my way back home.

484
00:27:24,963 --> 00:27:26,377
Is Seol doing well?

485
00:27:26,484 --> 00:27:27,484
Sure.

486
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:28,766
Seol was...

487
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,459
...really great.

488
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:33,569
How about you?

489
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:35,261
How was your date?

490
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:36,768
Well, actually.

491
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:41,054
Together with Donggu alone made me
so nervous so I didn't know what to say.

492
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:46,655
I went blank the whole day.
I only could said yes, sure.

493
00:27:47,754 --> 00:27:49,273
What if Donggu is angry?

494
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:51,152
I'm so worried.

495
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:55,977
Anyway, I'm out of my mind right now
so let's talk later.

496
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,676
Yes, alright.

497
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,966
Donggu!

498
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:12,093
That was it.

499
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:16,054
I didn't realize that.

500
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:17,245
What?

501
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,942
Donggu!

502
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:29,730
Wait, are you crying?

503
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:33,430
I thought, you never talked much,

504
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:37,229
and you didn't look happy.

505
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:40,700
So I thought you regret going out with me.

506
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:43,604
It bothered me the whole day
and I was worried.

507
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:47,787
I was scared we might break up
just like that.

508
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:50,032
Why would I do that?

509
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:54,024
I feel so nervous just being next to you.

510
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:56,325
Really?

511
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,739
Then you should have told me.
You are so mean.

512
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:02,533
You are making me
really scared and worried.

513
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:07,929
Then Yuna...

514
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:11,822
You don't regret going out with me?

515
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:13,132
Yes.

516
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,926
Then today is...

517
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:17,227
...our day one together, right?

518
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:23,660
Then we are now couple...

519
00:29:26,168 --> 00:29:27,858
...so can I hold your hand?

520
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,295
Yuna.

521
00:29:49,694 --> 00:29:53,295
Then, shall we go on a real date tomorrow?

522
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,898
Sure.

523
00:29:55,098 --> 00:29:57,684
Don't you have any other words except yes?

524
00:29:59,904 --> 00:30:00,693
Yes.

525
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:02,488
Alright, fine.

526
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:05,092
Let's just go. Go.

527
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:18,649
Alright, you know that
today we have a lot of guests, right?

528
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,840
So, pay close attention
and clean every corners. Alright?

529
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:23,949
-Sure.
-Good.

530
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:26,838
Oh! Yuna, give me.

531
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:27,949
I'll do this.

532
00:30:28,147 --> 00:30:29,813
It's fine.

533
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:31,343
Thank you, Donggu.

534
00:30:31,435 --> 00:30:35,740
No problem. You can go inside
and take a rest with Seol.

535
00:30:35,843 --> 00:30:37,016
No, it's okay.

536
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:43,685
Seojin. You should stop here and go in.
Take some rest.

537
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,183
You worked until late night yesterday.
Don't clean.

538
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:49,174
Thank you. You are the best.

539
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:52,485
Will you stop?

540
00:30:52,588 --> 00:30:54,892
It's very hard for singles to live here.
It's unfair.

541
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:56,772
If you envy us, date someone.

542
00:30:56,872 --> 00:30:59,987
You're just jealous.
That's why you're being mean. Mean person.

543
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,797
You wait and see.

544
00:31:01,898 --> 00:31:07,186
I will soon meet someone
better than Yuna or Seojin.

545
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:09,915
Is it?

546
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:13,312
But I don't think
there is another woman...

547
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:18,290
...like Yuna who's kind
and pure like a morning dew.

548
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:19,496
I think so too.

549
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,091
I don't think there's woman like
Bacca who is cute and adorable.

550
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:26,991
Also has really cool beard
even better than Park Chanho.

551
00:31:27,096 --> 00:31:28,792
Stop it.

552
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:33,102
What are you doing?!

553
00:31:33,197 --> 00:31:36,013
Hey, stop it. You guys are not kids.

554
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:37,811
Where's Sua?

555
00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:40,303
I'm not sure. I think she's in her room.

556
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,310
What?

557
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:44,310
Everyone is cleaning
but how can she stay in her room?

558
00:31:53,766 --> 00:31:54,961
What are you doing?

559
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,167
What? Nothing.

560
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,278
Are you massaging with cucumber?

561
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:05,819
No, I cut it to cook it.

562
00:32:05,914 --> 00:32:08,423
Why are you putting it on your face?

563
00:32:08,513 --> 00:32:09,812
Oh, this?

564
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,212
I'm making pickle.

565
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:14,494
There's no salt.
So I'm using my salty face.

566
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:17,010
Ridiculous. Stop it and come out to clean.

567
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:20,399
Hey, I have shooting today
so I need skin care.

568
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:22,195
That's not my business.

569
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:24,791
You're living off here
and doing everything you want.

570
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,092
Living off? Living off?
I'm long term stay guest!

571
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,310
What do you mean long term?

572
00:32:30,403 --> 00:32:33,212
God, why are you fighting? Stop it.

573
00:32:33,297 --> 00:32:35,416
How could you two always fight?

574
00:32:35,513 --> 00:32:37,424
She's indiscreet!

575
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:39,011
What? Indiscreet?

576
00:32:39,106 --> 00:32:40,813
How dare you talk like that to senior?

577
00:32:40,928 --> 00:32:43,729
-Hey, Kang Seojin. Are you done?
-Yes, I'm done. So what?

578
00:32:43,814 --> 00:32:45,925
Senior should act like one
if you want to be treated.

579
00:32:46,021 --> 00:32:49,305
- What? You little.
-God, please stop it. Stop.

580
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:55,844
God, it was so tiring.

581
00:32:56,246 --> 00:32:59,058
God, I don't even have energy to get up.

582
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:00,451
Great job, guys.

583
00:33:15,013 --> 00:33:16,140
Welcome.

584
00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:23,727
Who are you?

585
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:25,021
Who are you?

586
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:28,428
I reserved for today.

587
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:32,006
What? What's that language?

588
00:33:32,103 --> 00:33:33,212
Is she reserved guest?

589
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,437
-Are you Angela?
-Yes, yes. Angela.

590
00:33:46,931 --> 00:33:50,791
Hey, what was that? What was the language?

591
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,505
She's from Ukraine.

592
00:33:53,294 --> 00:33:54,695
Maybe she can't speak English?

593
00:33:54,805 --> 00:33:55,918
Can you speak English?

594
00:33:56,003 --> 00:33:59,229
No, I can't. I can only speak Ukrainian.

595
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,241
What's she saying?
I think she can't speak English.

596
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:03,531
It's fine.

597
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,451
Well, I will show you the room.

598
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:07,751
Follow me.

599
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,792
Wow, she's really pretty.

600
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:26,197
She's like a doll.

601
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:27,586
Isn't it Dusik?

602
00:34:28,003 --> 00:34:31,126
What? What's this sound?

603
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:32,340
What?

604
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:35,126
Hey, is this your heart again?

605
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:36,133
Jungi.

606
00:34:36,727 --> 00:34:40,099
I think I'm in love.

607
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,900
What? Again?

608
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:44,408
How can you fall in love every time!

609
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,694
This is real.

610
00:34:47,088 --> 00:34:49,805
This is first time
I felt the love really strong.

611
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:51,202
Wake up.

612
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,496
You and that goddess?

613
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:57,969
Hey, don't even look at the tree
you can't even climb up.

614
00:34:58,081 --> 00:34:59,477
It will be a headache. Okay?

615
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:01,477
Hey, wake up! Hey!

616
00:35:01,562 --> 00:35:04,688
Hey. He's out of his mind. Hey.

617
00:35:04,773 --> 00:35:05,996
Angela.

618
00:35:16,524 --> 00:35:17,212
Come in.

619
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Angela.

620
00:35:26,443 --> 00:35:28,259
Here you go.

621
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:29,656
Drinking?

622
00:35:29,746 --> 00:35:31,147
Thank you.

623
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:35,046
What should I say?

624
00:35:36,546 --> 00:35:37,845
Do you like the room?

625
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,342
Do you need anything?

626
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:41,371
I'm sorry. I can't understand English.

627
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:43,169
God, I can't understand a thing.

628
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:45,686
Translator.

629
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:51,072
Angela, I felt in love at first sight.

630
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:55,072
Angela, would you want to cut
your first eye into to?

631
00:35:55,171 --> 00:35:58,475
What? Excuse me?

632
00:36:00,352 --> 00:36:01,549
What?

633
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:04,653
She didn't understand.
Is this not working?

634
00:36:06,145 --> 00:36:07,145
Angela.

635
00:36:07,554 --> 00:36:08,457
Do you...

636
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:10,648
...have a boyfriend?

637
00:36:11,451 --> 00:36:14,140
Angela, does your ovum have a friend?

638
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:15,044
What?

639
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:17,910
What are you talking about?

640
00:36:18,505 --> 00:36:21,497
I'm sorry. I need to go out.

641
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:22,505
Angela.

642
00:36:23,095 --> 00:36:25,114
Angela. Angela.

643
00:36:26,813 --> 00:36:28,520
God. What was that?

644
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:30,098
Translator is not working.

645
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:31,709
What should I do?

646
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,950
Wash it well.

647
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:39,037
Fine. I'm washing it well.

648
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,141
Why are you yelling?! You did nothing!

649
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:44,777
It's my senior.

650
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:47,082
Yes, ma'am.

651
00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:48,593
"Yes, ma'am."

652
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:50,888
It's me. Are you taking a rest?

653
00:36:50,973 --> 00:36:52,054
Yes, I am.

654
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:54,576
I'm taking this rare opportunity to do so.

655
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:55,661
Is it?

656
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,054
That's good.

657
00:36:57,163 --> 00:37:04,177
I'll email you a file. Please summarize it
by 8 AM tomorrow morning.

658
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:06,375
I have assignment for my
graduate school. Alright?

659
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:08,063
What? Me?

660
00:37:08,178 --> 00:37:09,975
Why? You don't want?

661
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:11,769
No, no.

662
00:37:11,872 --> 00:37:13,269
Alright.

663
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:14,459
Yes.

664
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,187
Oh, god.

665
00:37:17,272 --> 00:37:18,576
Why? What is it?

666
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,790
It's my senior from work. She asked me to do
her graduate school assignment.

667
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:24,584
What? Why does she make you to do it?

668
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:28,079
I don't know.
But I can't say no to a senior.

669
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:32,586
Wow, you always talk back to me
but you're like a lamb to a senior.

670
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:33,888
Be quiet.

671
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:36,098
Continue with washing. Alright?

672
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:39,193
God, it's my only day off. This is crazy.

673
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:45,154
Well, good for you. You deserve it.

674
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:59,482
-What are you doing?
-Learning Ukrainian. Why?

675
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:01,595
But I can't figure out
even one word of it.

676
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:03,579
Boy, that won't solve anything.

677
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:07,069
Then what? I need to do everything
I can to talk to her.

678
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,467
Don't you worry.

679
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:11,324
We found a way for you to talk to Angela.

680
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:14,257
Really? How?

681
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:16,928
Come on. Come on. Come on.

682
00:38:19,717 --> 00:38:21,730
Wait. Who are these people?

683
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:23,039
Are they our guests?

684
00:38:23,138 --> 00:38:24,629
Listen to me first.

685
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:28,526
Now, you two can communicate.

686
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:32,055
Why?
Because Angela can only speak Ukrainian.

687
00:38:32,152 --> 00:38:33,352
-That's right.
-Yes.

688
00:38:33,454 --> 00:38:35,663
So now, it gets complicated.

689
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:38,059
So, listen very carefully. Alright?

690
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:39,247
Alright.

691
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:42,955
First,
Mark from Germany can speak Ukrainian.

692
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,752
And Bruno from France can speak German.

693
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:49,443
Luckily, Hanako from Japan can speak
a little bit of French and Korean.

694
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:50,649
Alright? You get it?

695
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:52,118
No, not at all.

696
00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:54,427
Why is this connection related to Angela?

697
00:38:54,514 --> 00:38:56,227
Boy, you.

698
00:38:56,312 --> 00:39:03,151
See. If Angela talks to Mark in Ukrainian
Mark can tell Bruno in German.

699
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,661
Then, Bruno can talk to Hanako in French.
Now, Hanako can tell you in Korean.

700
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,162
That's about it. Understand?

701
00:39:10,254 --> 00:39:12,162
So I need...

702
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:15,059
...one, two, three bridges to talk?

703
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:16,644
That's right.

704
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:18,553
You can talk, isn't it?

705
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,243
Why? Don't you like it?

706
00:39:21,753 --> 00:39:24,279
-If you don't then fine.
-No, no.

707
00:39:24,402 --> 00:39:25,279
Thank you, bro.

708
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,382
What are you doing? Go ask her out.

709
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:30,192
You're right. Hey! Follow me. Follow me.

710
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,201
Follow me!

711
00:39:37,012 --> 00:39:38,963
Boy. He likes it.

712
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:40,971
But...

713
00:39:41,063 --> 00:39:44,161
Will Angela go out with him
even if she can communicate?

714
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:46,265
Do you think that's possible?

715
00:39:46,354 --> 00:39:50,493
Some people listen to dead man's wish
so I'm just giving him a chance.

716
00:39:50,586 --> 00:39:54,392
I can see him being rejected painfully.

717
00:39:54,597 --> 00:39:57,502
Then, shall we go to comfort him?

718
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:58,906
Shall we?

719
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,604
I bet he's going to cry.
Should we bring a box of tissue?

720
00:40:02,689 --> 00:40:04,097
Shall we bring two boxes?

721
00:40:04,204 --> 00:40:05,802
Shall we go?

722
00:40:12,505 --> 00:40:14,308
What are you doing? Do it.

723
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:16,606
Yes, alright.

724
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,604
Well.

725
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:22,311
I'm in love at first sight.

726
00:40:23,303 --> 00:40:25,012
Really? Since when?

727
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:26,607
What do you like about me?

728
00:40:26,695 --> 00:40:28,294
-What?
-Hey, Hanako.

729
00:40:28,379 --> 00:40:32,401
Not you. Pass to Angela. Pass.

730
00:40:32,486 --> 00:40:34,462
I thought...

731
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,367
Angela, I'm in love
with you at first sight.

732
00:40:37,754 --> 00:40:41,454
Angela, I'm in love
with you at first sight.

733
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,898
Angela, I'm in love with you
at first sight.

734
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,786
Oh, really?

735
00:40:49,598 --> 00:40:51,477
Hey, hey! Angela!

736
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:56,219
Not him. Him. He fell in love with Angela.
Here.

737
00:40:59,205 --> 00:41:02,574
Well, ask her how she thinks about me.

738
00:41:03,386 --> 00:41:04,487
Alright.

739
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,289
What do you think about me?

740
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:08,479
What do you think about me?

741
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:10,626
What do you think about me?

742
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:13,920
I like you. I had good impression
since I met you yesterday.

743
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:17,936
She likes him. She had good impression
since she met him yesterday.

744
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:20,862
She likes him. She had good impression
since she met him yesterday.

745
00:41:21,264 --> 00:41:23,759
That's good. She likes you.

746
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:24,672
Really?

747
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:26,077
Really?

748
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:31,217
Then ask her
whether she will go out with me or not.

749
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:32,804
Go, go.

750
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:35,701
-Yes.
-She would.

751
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,776
Really? Really?

752
00:41:38,981 --> 00:41:40,371
Really, Angela?

753
00:41:40,587 --> 00:41:42,887
Thank you, Angela. Thank you so much.

754
00:41:44,183 --> 00:41:48,159
Jungi, Donggu. Thank you so much.
This is all because of you.

755
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:49,658
Really. Thank you so much.

756
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:52,269
Wow, that's great.

757
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:54,296
I did nothing.

758
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,697
God. It's done.

759
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,086
What is this? It's late already.
It's my day off.

760
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:09,601
God, only if she wasn't my senior.

761
00:42:10,682 --> 00:42:13,602
Man, let's just let it go.

762
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:16,205
If not, it'll be trouble for my carrier.

763
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:18,975
I'm hungry.

764
00:42:19,594 --> 00:42:22,284
Then let's go out to grab something.

765
00:42:24,673 --> 00:42:26,091
Hey, lend me your hair dryer.

766
00:42:28,888 --> 00:42:30,496
My phone.

767
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,196
God! What are you doing!

768
00:42:33,298 --> 00:42:35,577
Sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

769
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:37,395
God, you are so clumsy.

770
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:40,792
I said I'm sorry. You can take it out.

771
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:52,963
I can't see. Point the light properly.

772
00:42:53,052 --> 00:42:54,753
Fine. I'm doing it.

773
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:55,860
Move it over here. Here.

774
00:42:55,945 --> 00:42:57,073
Alright. Fine.

775
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,565
Here it is.

776
00:43:08,171 --> 00:43:09,076
I got it.

777
00:43:10,985 --> 00:43:11,870
I got it.

778
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:16,152
What? What is this?

779
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:18,755
What? What's happening?

780
00:43:20,258 --> 00:43:21,361
My god.

781
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:23,972
My hair is tangled up with your brush.
What are you going to do!

782
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,096
Hey. You're the one who kept rubbing.

783
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:30,810
Stay still!

784
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:35,700
What should I do with this?

785
00:43:38,188 --> 00:43:39,791
It hurts!

786
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:45,799
I can't do it.
I can't separate you two.

787
00:43:45,905 --> 00:43:48,497
Really? God, it's crazy.

788
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:50,092
What should we do?

789
00:43:50,888 --> 00:43:53,179
Maybe you can go to hair salon?

790
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,387
-Hair salon?
-Hair salon?

791
00:44:01,845 --> 00:44:03,144
Angela, here you go.

792
00:44:10,534 --> 00:44:11,814
You know...

793
00:44:12,038 --> 00:44:15,830
Angela has poor taste in man.

794
00:44:16,534 --> 00:44:17,443
Right?

795
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:21,641
You're right.
Isn't that couple too unbalanced?

796
00:44:21,738 --> 00:44:23,538
That's what I'm saying.

797
00:44:23,629 --> 00:44:26,652
Just like beauty and the beast. No.

798
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:30,541
Beauty and a dwarf.

799
00:44:30,647 --> 00:44:33,144
Why? They look good together.

800
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:36,773
Are you jealous
because he has pretty girlfriend?

801
00:44:36,858 --> 00:44:38,439
-What?
-What?

802
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:39,553
Of course not.

803
00:44:39,642 --> 00:44:43,988
I have a pretty girlfriend like you, Yuna.
Why would I?

804
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:50,197
I'm jealous. I don't like this.

805
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:54,086
Why? How can someone like Dusik meet
someone like Angela?

806
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,887
Of course not.

807
00:44:55,971 --> 00:45:01,977
I'm not jealous. I have a cute
and adorable girlfriend like Seojin.

808
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,167
I am jealous!

809
00:45:03,569 --> 00:45:09,379
I'm so jealous! I feel like
there is a huge stone in my heart.

810
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,888
I'm even angry.

811
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:17,896
I can't do it.

812
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:20,730
It's too tangled up together.
I can't do it.

813
00:45:20,815 --> 00:45:22,230
You guys need to cut your hair.

814
00:45:22,314 --> 00:45:23,314
What?

815
00:45:23,435 --> 00:45:24,722
Cut my hair?

816
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,234
No, I can't. This is my style.

817
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:29,099
Then will you two stay like this forever?

818
00:45:29,203 --> 00:45:33,288
One of you need to cut your front bang.
Then only I can separate you two.

819
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,297
Well, then there's no choice.
You should cut it.

820
00:45:36,384 --> 00:45:37,762
What? Hey.

821
00:45:37,873 --> 00:45:41,175
I'm the owner of a shopping mall
and a model.

822
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:46,161
-I can't cut my hair.
-Then should I? I only have this much.

823
00:45:46,282 --> 00:45:48,581
How should I go to work and interview?

824
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:50,668
Whatever, I won't cut it.

825
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,988
I'll rather die than cut it.

826
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:54,567
This is all on you. You cut it.

827
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:56,877
Why is this all on me?
I don't want to. You cut it.

828
00:45:56,975 --> 00:45:58,686
You are really not helping.

829
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,350
Who is it now?

830
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,937
It's my senior.

831
00:46:03,434 --> 00:46:04,636
Hello, yes.

832
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:06,152
I got your summary.

833
00:46:06,248 --> 00:46:07,437
But...

834
00:46:07,637 --> 00:46:09,045
Will you come to my house now?

835
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:11,045
What? Now?

836
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:14,029
Well, I'm in the middle of something.

837
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:17,046
Don't say anything.
Just come to my house in 30 minutes.

838
00:46:17,351 --> 00:46:19,078
Ma'am! Ma'am!

839
00:46:20,352 --> 00:46:22,164
God, this is going crazy.

840
00:46:22,249 --> 00:46:25,246
-What now?
-Well, she wants me to come to her house.

841
00:46:25,368 --> 00:46:27,159
So you cut it now. Quick.

842
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:29,266
Why should I? You're the one in hurry.

843
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:31,672
I'm not in hurry at all.

844
00:46:31,757 --> 00:46:33,369
Really?

845
00:46:33,562 --> 00:46:35,052
You want to do this?

846
00:46:37,684 --> 00:46:39,889
It hurts! Wait!

847
00:46:46,778 --> 00:46:48,264
Where is our board game?

848
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:49,978
Angela wants to play board game. Join us?

849
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:51,169
No. I'm fine.

850
00:46:51,263 --> 00:46:53,462
-Me too.
-Is it? Alright.

851
00:46:57,554 --> 00:46:58,649
But Dusik.

852
00:46:59,146 --> 00:47:00,557
Are you gonna be alright?

853
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,362
What?

854
00:47:04,144 --> 00:47:06,565
-What do you mean?
-I mean Angela.

855
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,561
Do you even know about Angela?

856
00:47:08,656 --> 00:47:10,069
-What do you mean?
-Well, you see.

857
00:47:10,156 --> 00:47:11,950
Angela is so pretty.

858
00:47:12,069 --> 00:47:15,650
It doesn't make sense.
How can she have no boyfriend?

859
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:17,634
Think about it.

860
00:47:17,738 --> 00:47:19,341
If there is pretty girl like her around.

861
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:22,738
Don't you think
men around her would have let her be?

862
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:25,779
Yes. That's impossible.

863
00:47:25,864 --> 00:47:28,578
Then, are you saying
she could be cheating on me?

864
00:47:28,677 --> 00:47:29,578
No.

865
00:47:29,671 --> 00:47:31,372
Well, I'm not saying that's true.

866
00:47:31,467 --> 00:47:34,570
But when you're on a trip, you could say
you don't have boyfriend even if you do.

867
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:37,760
You feel like you want
to cheat on someone.

868
00:47:37,863 --> 00:47:39,769
Yes, yes. That's right.

869
00:47:39,872 --> 00:47:42,864
When you're traveling,
you can feel like that.

870
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:45,662
Then, should I ask her
whether she have a boyfriend?

871
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:47,859
Well. You can do that.

872
00:48:02,288 --> 00:48:05,578
Well, I'm just worried about Dusik.

873
00:48:05,678 --> 00:48:08,888
Me too. I don't want to see
Dusik get heartbroken.

874
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:22,931
Angela, I'm sorry to ask you this
but do you have boyfriend back in Ukraine?

875
00:48:23,027 --> 00:48:24,550
Ask her this, Hanako.

876
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,735
Alright.

877
00:48:26,939 --> 00:48:29,578
No, you're her first boyfriend.

878
00:48:29,663 --> 00:48:34,670
She's pretty and also pure. I envy you.

879
00:48:36,878 --> 00:48:38,982
Really? I'm first?

880
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:40,593
-Yes.
-That's a relief.

881
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:42,077
That's really a relief.

882
00:48:44,478 --> 00:48:45,277
What?

883
00:48:45,783 --> 00:48:50,828
Angela has no boyfriend
and even more you're her first boyfriend?

884
00:48:50,913 --> 00:48:54,629
Yes. I'm her first love. First love!

885
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:55,724
Is it?

886
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,206
-That's good for you.
-I guess so.

887
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,191
That's really good.

888
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,500
Dusik, you must be happy.

889
00:49:01,595 --> 00:49:03,698
-Congratulation.
-Yes, thanks.

890
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,310
But Dusik.

891
00:49:05,499 --> 00:49:07,470
Do you need to look at me like that?

892
00:49:07,576 --> 00:49:10,573
The way you look, it's kind of annoying!

893
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:13,366
Really? Sorry. I'll be more careful.

894
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:18,171
Quiet!

895
00:49:19,075 --> 00:49:21,229
When you walk, can you be more careful?

896
00:49:21,634 --> 00:49:24,936
It's very noisy. It's bothering me.

897
00:49:25,037 --> 00:49:25,928
Is it?

898
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,840
Sorry. I'll be careful.

899
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:47,937
We're here. Get out.

900
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:50,048
Ouch! Hey! You get out from here.

901
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:52,936
Don't you know that's broken?
It doesn't open from inside. Get out!

902
00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:56,734
God, how can you not lose once?
Not even once! Stay still!

903
00:49:57,524 --> 00:49:59,238
What in the world are you doing?

904
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:01,937
Are you disobeying me in some way?

905
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,152
No, it's not.

906
00:50:04,247 --> 00:50:07,342
Well, something just happened to me.

907
00:50:07,456 --> 00:50:09,445
Forget it. This is my clothes.

908
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:11,434
Change the size from the department store.

909
00:50:11,535 --> 00:50:14,640
-What?
-Later today, I have an important meeting.

910
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:19,137
I ate too much soju
with grilled beef tripe yesterday night.

911
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,910
And now it doesn't fit.
I've already called the shop.

912
00:50:22,021 --> 00:50:23,307
So you can just go and change.

913
00:50:23,403 --> 00:50:25,418
Alright.

914
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:29,032
What are you doing? I have no time.
Go now.

915
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:35,727
What? What is wrong with her?
Why does she ask you to change her cloth?

916
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,330
God, I don't know.

917
00:50:37,614 --> 00:50:42,049
-Just come quick.
-Ouch. Tell me before you move. It hurts!

918
00:50:44,645 --> 00:50:46,846
I'm Angela's first love.

919
00:50:46,953 --> 00:50:48,750
This is so awesome. Isn't it?

920
00:50:49,155 --> 00:50:50,155
Yes.

921
00:50:50,645 --> 00:50:52,253
Good for you, Dusik.

922
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:53,952
But...

923
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:56,550
Are you gonna be alright?

924
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,351
What? What now?

925
00:50:58,463 --> 00:51:03,482
International relationship
is very difficult.

926
00:51:03,581 --> 00:51:05,379
Yes, that's right.

927
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:08,482
You get tired of the relationship
and someone new appears to cheer you up...

928
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:09,776
...and you're attracted.

929
00:51:09,881 --> 00:51:14,323
It's cycle of betrayal. It's 100% sure.

930
00:51:14,427 --> 00:51:15,331
Is that so?

931
00:51:16,316 --> 00:51:17,624
I need to ask her.

932
00:51:20,029 --> 00:51:22,610
Wow, I didn't know
she is a transfer student.

933
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:26,801
Then if she wants to live in Korea,
I may marry her.

934
00:51:26,886 --> 00:51:27,801
Maybe.

935
00:51:28,395 --> 00:51:30,231
That's really good.

936
00:51:30,336 --> 00:51:31,549
That's what I mean..

937
00:51:31,928 --> 00:51:33,834
Really, what an odd world.

938
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:36,350
But, Dusik.

939
00:51:36,747 --> 00:51:38,159
What about your parents?

940
00:51:38,246 --> 00:51:39,350
What? Parents?

941
00:51:39,444 --> 00:51:41,850
Yes. You guys are an international couple.

942
00:51:41,948 --> 00:51:43,359
But as Korea's traditional religion...

943
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:45,851
...there's still some bias
about international couple.

944
00:51:45,944 --> 00:51:50,467
So, do you think your parents will
allow you to meet Angela?

945
00:51:50,557 --> 00:51:53,356
Yes, yes.
All people around me says no.

946
00:51:53,451 --> 00:51:55,153
It always does.

947
00:51:55,267 --> 00:51:58,462
That's right.
I did not think that through

948
00:52:00,466 --> 00:52:04,035
Wow, I never saw my
parents that happy before.

949
00:52:04,148 --> 00:52:07,335
I never thought they'll call her
daughter in law already.

950
00:52:07,742 --> 00:52:08,646
Me too.

951
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:10,439
That's great.

952
00:52:10,854 --> 00:52:13,405
-Congratulation.
-Congratulation, Dusik.

953
00:52:13,516 --> 00:52:14,318
Thank you.

954
00:52:15,406 --> 00:52:18,611
But Dusik, when you smile I can see
your gums. Can you do something about it?

955
00:52:18,714 --> 00:52:20,397
It's unattractive.

956
00:52:20,502 --> 00:52:21,886
Really?

957
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,187
Sorry. I'll be careful.

958
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:25,180
And Dusik,

959
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:27,989
when you laugh, your nostrils get big.
Can you do something?

960
00:52:28,092 --> 00:52:30,323
I feel like you are making fun of me
with your nostrils.

961
00:52:30,424 --> 00:52:33,014
Is it? I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

962
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:35,934
-What?
-Right.

963
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,918
I'm having beer with Angela.
I'll be up then.

964
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,762
That, that fingers in his nose.

965
00:52:45,754 --> 00:52:46,762
I'm so jealous.

966
00:52:46,865 --> 00:52:48,159
So jealous.

967
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:54,561
There you go.

968
00:52:54,656 --> 00:52:56,758
Hey, why are you so late?

969
00:52:56,843 --> 00:52:59,556
Can't you do this simple thing right?

970
00:53:00,251 --> 00:53:01,460
I'm sorry.

971
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:04,547
Forget it! Go.

972
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:11,318
God, what kind of person is that?

973
00:53:11,403 --> 00:53:14,631
You did it for her
and she never says thank you.

974
00:53:15,223 --> 00:53:17,076
It's fine. Let's go.

975
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:22,041
Hey, you always fight me
but why do you keep quiet in front of her?

976
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,748
You are not like you.

977
00:53:23,857 --> 00:53:26,373
Then what should I do?
She's my senior from work.

978
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:29,463
I've already hit her so many times
in my imagination.

979
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:33,659
Really? If you can, you want to hit her?

980
00:53:33,756 --> 00:53:34,756
Yes. Why?

981
00:53:35,661 --> 00:53:37,928
Hey, what are you thinking? Don't.

982
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:40,026
Don't make my work life difficult.

983
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:42,620
Don't worry. She'll never know.

984
00:53:42,922 --> 00:53:46,856
-Where is the nearest convenient store?
-Why are you looking for convenient store?

985
00:53:49,155 --> 00:53:50,451
She's out. Out. Out.

986
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,967
Honey, I'm leaving now.

987
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:56,378
Yes, sure. See you later.

988
00:53:56,475 --> 00:53:57,671
Sure.

989
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:01,362
What?

990
00:54:02,815 --> 00:54:04,629
What's happening? What's going on?

991
00:54:04,714 --> 00:54:06,327
Why can't I?

992
00:54:11,694 --> 00:54:13,789
My, why is it stuck?

993
00:54:13,885 --> 00:54:15,091
Hey!

994
00:54:15,202 --> 00:54:16,496
Who did this?!

995
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,606
That won't come off easily.
It's super glue.

996
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:26,113
But...

997
00:54:26,606 --> 00:54:28,819
-...can we really do this?
-Of course.

998
00:54:28,906 --> 00:54:30,708
It's kamma. Kamma.

999
00:54:31,315 --> 00:54:33,932
It's not kamma. It's karma.

1000
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:35,836
You are so dumb.

1001
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:38,019
Hey, that's not the point.

1002
00:54:38,132 --> 00:54:40,035
It's important to make sure she suffers.

1003
00:54:40,437 --> 00:54:41,533
What are you doing? Let's go.

1004
00:54:41,647 --> 00:54:43,223
I'm in trouble if she finds out.

1005
00:54:43,342 --> 00:54:45,326
God, she won't.

1006
00:54:45,438 --> 00:54:48,125
Put your head down a bit.
She will never see you.

1007
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:49,918
-But, still...
-Hey.

1008
00:54:50,029 --> 00:54:54,140
I made it by carrying 20 liters of water.
Go!

1009
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:56,338
Fine, alright.

1010
00:54:57,738 --> 00:54:59,537
Let's go!

1011
00:54:59,734 --> 00:55:01,267
Let's go!

1012
00:55:06,175 --> 00:55:07,071
Down!

1013
00:55:18,312 --> 00:55:19,632
Hey! Who are you?!

1014
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:20,918
Hey!

1015
00:55:25,411 --> 00:55:28,138
God, this feels so good.

1016
00:55:28,223 --> 00:55:30,731
You need to be kind to people. You little.

1017
00:55:31,223 --> 00:55:34,501
Sua, I feel really good. So great.

1018
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:36,528
Right? You feel great?

1019
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:37,705
Yes, thank you sis.

1020
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:40,007
If you are, can I do cucumber face pack?

1021
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:41,696
No, never!

1022
00:55:42,389 --> 00:55:44,900
Hey, I helped you revenge,
aren't you going to thank me?

1023
00:55:44,985 --> 00:55:47,090
I will pay you back. I will.

1024
00:55:47,205 --> 00:55:48,890
You know I don't owe to anyone.

1025
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,497
How will you pay me back?

1026
00:56:00,701 --> 00:56:03,933
What's wrong with you two?

1027
00:56:04,138 --> 00:56:05,542
Is there something wrong?

1028
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:07,137
I don't know.

1029
00:56:07,933 --> 00:56:11,137
Suddenly, I just don't have
any energy to do something.

1030
00:56:11,222 --> 00:56:12,618
Me too.

1031
00:56:12,714 --> 00:56:17,814
Suddenly, I'm gloomy,
don't want to eat and feel powerless.

1032
00:56:18,315 --> 00:56:19,814
Why is that so?

1033
00:56:21,106 --> 00:56:22,106
-I'm here.
-I'm here too.

1034
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:23,398
Oh, you guys are here.

1035
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,104
Are you here?

1036
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:26,907
What were you two...

1037
00:56:29,709 --> 00:56:31,810
What? What's wrong with your hair!

1038
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,814
What's wrong? I don't have any energy.

1039
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,730
What? What happened?

1040
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:46,437
Where were you Sarang?

1041
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,228
Who wants to eat banana?

1042
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,330
Stop it.

1043
00:56:50,415 --> 00:56:52,418
Why is your hair like Chu Sarang?

1044
00:56:52,531 --> 00:56:55,235
-What happened to your hair?
-Something happened.

1045
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,529
Hey, I owe you nothing.

1046
00:56:58,622 --> 00:57:00,123
Fine, fine.

1047
00:57:00,234 --> 00:57:04,043
God, you never lose once. Just once.

1048
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,959
What was that? Is that Dusik?

1049
00:57:09,055 --> 00:57:10,562
Why is he so happy?

1050
00:57:10,654 --> 00:57:13,745
Well, Dusik and Angela are going out
from today.

1051
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:15,070
It seems it's going really well.

1052
00:57:15,155 --> 00:57:17,854
Really? That's good for Dusik.

1053
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,966
God, I can't digest.

1054
00:57:21,064 --> 00:57:24,958
God, I think I have an upset stomach.

1055
00:57:25,555 --> 00:57:27,460
God, my stomach.

1056
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,555
What's wrong?

1057
00:57:33,603 --> 00:57:36,403
Drink, drink! One shot!

1058
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:40,895
God, I'm sleepy.

1059
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,102
Let's sleep.

1060
00:57:43,196 --> 00:57:46,697
Hey, hey. Let's drink a bit more.
It's fun.

1061
00:57:46,885 --> 00:57:47,885
Bullshit.

1062
00:57:48,084 --> 00:57:49,285
What's so darn fun here?

1063
00:57:49,372 --> 00:57:50,896
Bullshit? Darn?

1064
00:57:51,286 --> 00:57:54,294
Hey, Hanako. Who taught you Korean?

1065
00:57:54,386 --> 00:57:55,786
You learned bad words.

1066
00:57:55,897 --> 00:57:57,199
I need to pee.

1067
00:57:57,595 --> 00:57:59,596
Hey, I'm going to the restroom.

1068
00:58:00,494 --> 00:58:01,813
Tell Angela.

1069
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:03,615
Pee or poo?

1070
00:58:03,711 --> 00:58:04,821
Do I need to tell that too?

1071
00:58:04,906 --> 00:58:07,710
Then only we know
how long we need to wait.

1072
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:11,366
What, fine. Pee! Pee. You good?

1073
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:12,366
Fine.

1074
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,461
Hey, he's going to poop.

1075
00:58:16,278 --> 00:58:17,771
He's going to poop.

1076
00:58:18,268 --> 00:58:20,151
Hey, he's going to poop.

1077
00:58:21,252 --> 00:58:23,040
What?
You don't need to tell me that too.

1078
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:26,548
What are you talking about?
It's so hard to go pee.

1079
00:58:26,747 --> 00:58:30,120
Angela, you wait here. I'll be back.

1080
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,318
Play, play. Drink.

1081
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:37,242
Angela, what's wrong?

1082
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:44,038
It's very inconvenient
as I can't communicate with Dusik.

1083
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:47,243
You must be tired to translate for us.

1084
00:58:47,328 --> 00:58:49,924
No, I liked it as I was
able to be with you.

1085
00:58:50,015 --> 00:58:52,523
While talking with you, I knew that
you're really a good person.

1086
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,112
Really?

1087
00:58:55,419 --> 00:58:58,147
Me too. I liked you.

1088
00:58:58,611 --> 00:58:59,419
Really?

1089
00:59:09,306 --> 00:59:11,942
God, I may really marry with Angela.

1090
00:59:12,027 --> 00:59:15,332
Hold on, then wedding ceremony should
be conducted once in Ukrainian...

1091
00:59:15,446 --> 00:59:18,435
...and once in Korea, so two ceremonies?

1092
00:59:18,534 --> 00:59:21,326
How about our guests?
Should I borrow the whole plane?

1093
00:59:21,438 --> 00:59:23,548
Oh my, my. What should I do?

1094
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:26,230
Angela! My Angela!

1095
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:34,901
Oh, my.

1096
00:59:36,203 --> 00:59:37,806
What's wrong with you guys?

1097
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:40,910
Maybe it's insomnia...

1098
00:59:41,222 --> 00:59:42,706
I couldn't sleep at all.

1099
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,913
Maybe I focused too
much on my shooting,

1100
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:48,809
so my insomnia has gotten worse.

1101
00:59:49,206 --> 00:59:50,319
Really?

1102
00:59:50,611 --> 00:59:52,526
That's problem.

1103
00:59:54,311 --> 00:59:56,310
This is strange. Where is she?

1104
00:59:56,964 --> 00:59:58,067
What's wrong?

1105
00:59:58,168 --> 00:59:59,257
Who are you looking for?

1106
00:59:59,371 --> 01:00:02,480
I woke up in the morning
and Angela is gone.

1107
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:03,980
Her luggage is not here too.

1108
01:00:04,487 --> 01:00:05,980
Hey! Hanako!

1109
01:00:06,194 --> 01:00:08,400
-Did you see Angela?
-Angela?

1110
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,403
She went out early in the morning.

1111
01:00:11,499 --> 01:00:14,697
What? What do you mean? Went out?

1112
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:20,706
Well, yesterday, I was with Angela
and Mark until late night.

1113
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:23,392
I felt something is going on between them.

1114
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:26,986
-What?
-Then I saw them gone this morning.

1115
01:00:29,527 --> 01:00:31,941
What, what do you mean. What? Hey!

1116
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,028
Well then, did Angela and Mark...

1117
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:37,230
...run away together?

1118
01:00:37,344 --> 01:00:39,347
-What?
-How could this happen!

1119
01:00:39,448 --> 01:00:42,236
They like each other.

1120
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:43,933
They can communicate. He's handsome.

1121
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:47,123
For sure they did. Isn't it?

1122
01:00:48,037 --> 01:00:50,656
That...that can't be. That can't be!

1123
01:00:50,761 --> 01:00:54,561
Angela! Angela! Angela! Angela!

1124
01:00:55,254 --> 01:00:56,647
Oh, my.

1125
01:00:56,956 --> 01:00:59,601
I feel so bad for Dusik.

1126
01:00:59,686 --> 01:01:03,292
I really hoped this time
it would work out for him.

1127
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:04,903
That's what I mean too.

1128
01:01:05,585 --> 01:01:10,917
I prayed for him to have found girlfriend
for the first time in his life.

1129
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:14,718
I feel really sorry for Dusik.

1130
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,474
They said they had insomnia.
But they're sleeping?

1131
01:01:24,772 --> 01:01:25,664
What?

1132
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:27,592
They are even smiling.

1133
01:01:30,772 --> 01:01:32,894
Are they dreaming something happy?

1134
01:01:55,971 --> 01:01:59,468
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1135
01:01:59,662 --> 01:02:00,559
I have a fan?

1136
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,265
You look super happy.

1137
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:04,836
-We haven't been on a date for so long.
-Shall we watch movie?

1138
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,344
Really? Promise?

1139
01:02:06,438 --> 01:02:07,741
Why isn't he contacting me?

1140
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,233
-Jungi!
-What are you doing here?

1141
01:02:09,338 --> 01:02:11,542
-What?
-I changed all with my photo.

1142
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:14,880
-What?
-Why do you always tease Dusik?

1143
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:17,561
Teasing him is the most fun thing to do.

1144
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:19,346
Bong Dusik,
you fell in love with Ahyoung?

1145
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:20,951
If you like her, ask her out.

1146
01:02:21,036 --> 01:02:23,449
I'm going to ask Ahyoung to date me.

1147
01:02:23,546 --> 01:02:24,843
You are too much!

1148
01:02:24,945 --> 01:02:26,679
You two look like newlyweds.

1149
01:02:26,745 --> 01:02:29,350
Donggu, what stage are you in?

1150
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,440
Must have kissed?

1151
01:02:30,544 --> 01:02:34,639
You can't judge our love
with the speed of our physical affection.

1152
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:37,261
I want to kiss. I want to kiss.
I want to kiss.

1153
01:02:37,346 --> 01:02:39,343
Donggu. Donggu. Can't you hear?

1154
01:02:39,448 --> 01:02:42,420
Actually, I have something to tell you.

1155
01:02:42,534 --> 01:02:43,611
-Yes?
-Yuna.

1156
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:45,825
Can I kiss you?
