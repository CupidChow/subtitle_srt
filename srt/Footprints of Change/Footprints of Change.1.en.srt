I don't know.

on your sister-in-law upstairs.

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,650
Search.

189
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,030
Have we...

190
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,030
met before?

191
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,440
I don't know you.

192
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,560
You're really beautiful.

193
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,510
Yi,

194
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,870
go upstairs and check on your mom.

195
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,030
Call me if she shows any symptoms.

196
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,480
Okay.

197
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,570
I'll come right up.

198
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,120
How much does Jinghan owe them?

199
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,160
Quite a lot, I think.

200
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,000
It must be a significant amount.

201
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
How much exactly?

202
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
A debt is a debt—we can just repay it.

203
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,820
Where would we get the money
to pay it back?

204
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,450
During the years your father was ill,

205
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,360
everyone avoided us.

206
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,080
Now that your father is gone,

207
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,010
who would even pay attention to us?

208
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,510
Even the banks are snobs,

209
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,380
and they won't grant us a loan.

210
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,690
It hurts.

211
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,670
Xiu,

212
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,310
take my mom upstairs too.

213
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,790
Ao,

214
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,130
no sign of Lin Jinghan on the first floor.

215
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,400
Then search the second floor.

216
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
When you find Lin Jinghan,
break one of his legs first.

217
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,890
Let's go.

218
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,620
It hurts.

219
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,900
Ao,

220
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,120
we couldn't find him.

221
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,630
This is my bedroom.

222
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,110
You can't go in!

223
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,320
My sister-in-law is inside.

224
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,780
She's about to give birth.

225
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,350
I'm sorry.

226
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,910
Lin Jinghan

227
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,330
must come with us.

228
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,110
Try going in if you dare!

229
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,540
Is she going to cut you?

230
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,810
It seems like it.

231
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,730
She wouldn't dare.

232
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,630
He won't hurt you either.

233
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,240
I know this man.

234
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,560
He always keeps his word
and handles things professionally.

235
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,090
Here, give me this cleaver.

236
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,440
Be good.

237
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,620
That was scary.

238
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,040
She actually did it!

239
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,600
Do you want me to
shoot a bullet through your dimple?

240
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,450
Are you crazy?

241
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,680
Why are you bullying a girl?

242
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,820
She cut me.

243
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,840
Didn't you bring that on yourself?

244
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,440
Auntie, my mom is in labor!

245
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,180
I'll give you 30 days.

246
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,800
Tell Lin Jinghan.

247
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,609
Get the money ready within 30 days.

248
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,430
This is the final deadline.

249
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,640
Let's go.

250
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,550
Boss says we're leaving.

251
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,310
Get lost!

252
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,500
Are you leaving or not?

253
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,780
Let's go!

254
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,730
I need a quick bandage.

255
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,000
Is it a boy or a girl?

256
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,960
Does it matter?

257
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,060
No, it doesn't.

258
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,550
Siyun,

259
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,200
with all this chaos at home today,

260
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,720
thank goodness you're here
to help deliver the baby.

261
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,610
Great.

262
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
It's a boy.

263
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,470
Our Lin family finally has an heir.

264
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,750
He's so beautiful.

265
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,750
He looks just like your dad

266
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,720
when he was just born.

267
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,350
I think he looks more like my mom.

268
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,080
What's wrong with your eyes?

269
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,040
Sister-in-law.

270
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,510
Yi,

271
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,880
get your mother a glass of water.

272
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,680
Okay.

273
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,640
How are you feeling?

274
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,880
I'm fine.

275
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,360
Where's Lin Jinghan?

276
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,310
I... I'm here.

277
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,910
Down here.

278
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,350
Here.

279
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,910
Siyun,

280
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,530
are they all gone?

281
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,550
How did you make them leave?

282
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,680
Tell me about it.

283
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,840
How did you get in there?

284
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,000
Mom,

285
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,110
Xiu and Yi,

286
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,200
they lifted the bedboard for me.

287
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,910
In that critical moment,

288
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,240
I crawled in here.

289
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,850
Why didn't you tell me
you owed so much money?

290
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,550
Well, you just got back,

291
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,310
I needed time to tell you.

292
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,480
I just heard

293
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,120
that you're in charge of the family now.

294
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,870
Do you have a good plan
to help me repay the debt?

295
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,360
You owe the money.

296
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,410
Yes, right.

297
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,790
I didn't mean anything else.

298
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,070
I know I owe the money.

299
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,780
But aren't you
marrying into the Qiao family?

300
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,560
The Qiao family owns a huge bank.

301
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,600
Surely you can help me.

302
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,130
Please help me.

303
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,970
Tell me if you have any good ideas.

304
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,100
You owe the money,

305
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,300
so you pay it back yourself.

306
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,230
What's wrong with her?

307
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,190
Mom,

308
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,070
come here,

309
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,960
come here.

310
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,200
Help me lift

311
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,470
this bed board

312
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,380
so I can get out.

313
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,880
I'm suffocating down here.

314
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,550
Jinghan,

315
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,150
take a look at your son!

316
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,830
He looks so much like you.

317
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,160
I see him—he does look like me.

318
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,310
Lift the bed board

319
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,000
and get me out—I can barely breathe!

320
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,440
This child is really beautiful.

321
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,550
Yes, yes, he is.

322
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,270
But I'm stuck in here,

323
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,240
-and I can't even see him.
-He looks just like you.

324
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,110
Hey, I just realized that

325
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,030
you've forgotten your own son
since you got a grandson.

326
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,650
How could you do this to me?

327
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,680
I know I'm in debt,
but you can't treat me like this!

328
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,740
Look at those eyes.

329
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,840
They're exactly like yours.

330
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,130
We came all this way for nothing today.

331
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,030
We didn't collect the debt.

332
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,310
How are you going to explain this
to my dad when you get back?

333
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,160
It's fine.

334
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,400
I'll talk to him.

335
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,910
You're still so aggressive.

336
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,250
You always act recklessly,

337
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,710
doing whatever you want without thinking.

338
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,750
Since when do you hit women?

339
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,280
I've been different from others
since I was a kid.

340
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,100
Do you know about a hormone

341
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,820
called adrenaline?

342
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,240
My adrenaline levels

343
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,080
are higher than average,

344
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,070
so I'm prone to high blood pressure.

345
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Is high blood pressure contagious?

346
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,030
Your friend seems short-tempered too.

347
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,410
You're Jin, right?

348
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,790
How's your blood pressure?

349
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,790
It's normal.

350
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,480
That's good.

351
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,920
From now on, when we're out,
speak when you should,

352
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,350
and keep quiet

353
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,810
when you shouldn't.

354
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,270
Jin,

355
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,590
make a toast to Ao.

356
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,030
Ao, here's to you.

357
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,260
Cheers, Cheng.

358
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,270
Get lost!

359
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,980
Say that again, I dare you.

360
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,270
Stop, stop.

361
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,200
I just got back.

362
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,920
How about this?

363
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,790
I'll dance for you guys.

364
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,070
Follow me.

365
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,070
Have some tea.

366
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,310
Shijun,

367
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,690
long time no see.

368
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,420
You've studied abroad too.

369
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,330
Do you approve of arranged marriages?

370
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,010
Do you think we could be happy

371
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,880
if we got married?

372
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,530
When I was in middle school,
I promised Siyun

373
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,040
that I would make her

374
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,870
the happiest bride in Shanghai.

375
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,530
Everyone laughed at me back then,

376
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,110
but I meant it.

377
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,030
A big reason I went to study abroad later

378
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,350
was actually because of Siyun.

379
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,440
I thought we could go together

380
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,600
and look out for each other.

381
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,730
But I never expected

00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,520
she would go to Germany
while I went to America.

383
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,680
A girl alone in a foreign country

384
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,310
must have suffered much more than I did.

385
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,620
I don't approve of arranged marriages.

386
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,720
But Siyun,

387
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,500
could you give me, Qiao Shijun, a chance?

388
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,280
Let's get to know each other again.

389
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,550
Yes, of course.

390
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,350
Well said.

391
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,500
Marriage is a big deal,
and it should be decided by parents.

392
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,040
Do you remember
when you two were kids, building blocks

393
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,350
and holding hands?

394
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,980
Now that you've grown up,

395
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,740
you even have the same long eyes

396
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,750
and oval face.

397

398
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,010
Look at that tall nose bridge.

399
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,530
You two really look alike.

400
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,440
Isn't that what they call
the couples' resemblance?

401
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,550
Uncle Qiao.

402
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,510
Couples who look alike

403
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,580
usually have beautiful children.

404
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,480
Whether the child looks like Siyun

405
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,590
or Shijun,

406
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,130
they're bound to be good-looking.

407
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,990
Did Mr. Qiao ask for your opinion?

408
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,010
Uncle Qiao,

409
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,030
I think we should

410
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,240
arrange their marriage

411
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,830
in the next day or two.

412
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,960
We should invite
all the influential people

413

in Shanghai.

414

The next day or two?

415
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,270
Tomorrow it is, then.

416
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,060
Isn't that too rushed?

417
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,230
Shijun,

419

to spend with Siyun.

420
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,700
You haven't seen each other
in years, right?

421
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,220
Yes.

422
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,550
Right, right.

423
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,640
Spend more time together.

424
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,400

426
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Get reacquainted

427
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,220
and enjoy some sweet moments.

428
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,210
Alright.

any more of your time today.

No.

I've already ordered for you.

They're all your favorites.

445
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,040
How did you know
these are my favorite dishes?

446
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,280
I wrote them down in a notebook
when we were little.

447
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,300
You... you wrote them down?

448
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,880
I also remember

449
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,960
that before you went abroad, you said

450
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,720
you wanted to open a
maternity hospital when you returned.

451
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,310
I can't believe you still remember that.

452
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,110
Of course I do.

opening a maternity hospital
has great potential.

There's a real need for it here

It's a great choice.

00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,690
Did you have a fight with Mr. Qiao?

562
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,440
How many times have I told you?

563
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,670
Don't act like a spoiled young lady again.

564
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,000
How could you argue with Mr. Qiao?

565
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,659
Mr. Qiao's such a nice person.

566
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,350
He has such a calm temper.

567
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,670
It must be your fault, right?

568
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,670
Don't you guys care about Xiu at all?

569
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,460
Who?

570
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,880
Xiu?

571
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,440
I mean, didn't you report it

572
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,710
to the police station this morning?

573
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,550
Leave Xiu's case to the police.

574
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,000
Focus on what matters,

575
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,270
like planning your own wedding, okay?

576
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,750
Xiu was murdered.

577
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,920
I can't get married now.

578
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,870
I understand,

579
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,960
Xiu was Nanny's daughter,

580
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,320
and Nanny was alawys good to you
when you were little,

581
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,230
right?

582
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,030
When you got sick,
she'd stay up all night watching over you.

583
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,320
I get it.

584
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,440
That child, Xiu, had a hard life.

585
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,040
But since she's gone,

586
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,020
we should comfort her father.

587
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,110
We'll cover the funeral expenses.

588
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,440
Would that be okay?

589
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,840
Siyun,

590
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,350
just focus on preparing for your wedding.

591
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,620
As for Xiu's case,

592
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,800
just leave it to Jinghan,

593
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,800
okay?

594
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,890
Hello?

595
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,150
Siyun,

596
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,510
my father would like to invite you
to our home for dinner tonight.

597
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,590
Please prepare for it.

598
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,590
I'll have someone come pick you up later.

599
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,400
Shijun,

600
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,630
Xiu is dead.

601
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,950
I need to take care of her funeral

602
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,740
and the lawsuit.

603
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,650
I won't be able to make it to dinner.

604
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,520
Who is Xiu?

605
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,080
My nanny's daughter.

606
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,130
Alright,

607
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,710
then you should
take care of Xiu's matter first.

608
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,910
Don't be too sad.

609
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,110
Take care of yourself
and don't wear yourself out.

610
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,040
My condolences.

611
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,510
Thank you.

612
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,550
Was that my future brother-in-law
on the phone?

613
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,300
Are you having dinner with him tonight?

614
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,610
You should eat, drink,

615
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,550
and enjoy your time.

616
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,250
Why don't you go by yourself?

617
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,390
Is this Dr. Lin Siyun's residence?

618
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,290
I'm Ling, a midwife from Zhongde Hospital.

619
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,470
The director asked me to inform you

620
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,490
that your job application
has been approved.

621
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,140
You can come to the hospital next Monday
to handle the paperwork.

622
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,820
Okay,

623
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,750
I understand.

624
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,160
Was that Shijun on the phone again?

625
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,760
Siyun, listen to me.

626
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,870
Would I ever harm you?

627
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,670
I'm your own brother.

628
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,320
Let me tell you.

629
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,730
Tonight, you...

630
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,030
Tonight,

631
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,250
you must go to have dinner with him.

632
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,320
If you offend him,

633
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,590
it'll affect the wedding.

634
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,510
Most importantly,
it's about the Lin family's legacy.

635
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,510
Do you hear me?

636
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,230
Mom,

637
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,620
I want to postpone the wedding.

638
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,890
Why do you want to postpone it?

639
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,880
Xiu was murdered.

640
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,670
Yes, I'm also sad

641
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,980
that Xiu died.

642
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,550
But at the end of the day,
wasn't she just an outsider?

643
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,680
Can't you tell what's more important?

644
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,280
If you keep messing around like this,

645
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,710
the Lin family will be ruined by you
sooner or later!

646
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,710
Have you no shame?

647
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,050
Is it me ruining the family or you?

648
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,400
Siyun,

649
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,720
just listen to your brother.

650
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,960
Don't worry about Xiu's case for now.

651
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,510
Let Jinghan handle it,

652
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,400
okay?

653
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,690
All he wants is for the Qiao family
to pay off his debts.

654
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,230
How can he be so despicable?

655
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,710
Since you put it that way,

656
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,370
then we need to have a real talk

657
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,670
in front of our mom.

658
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,960
You've had the finest food and drinks
since childhood.

659
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,760
We never mistreated you, right?

660
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,620
That's because of the Lin family.

661
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,750
Sending you abroad

662
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,280
to study,

663
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,880
getting a foreign education,

664
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,400
having all that knowledge to show off...

665
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,530
that's also because of the Lin family.

666
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,670
People...

667
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,380
shouldn't forget where they came from.

668
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,130
You're right.

669
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,960
The reputation earned
by the Lin family's ancestors

670
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,560
and the upbringing they gave me

671
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,820
mean I must repay them.

672
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,470
But I'm repaying the Lin family

673
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,510
and my parents.

674
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,500
Why should I have to
pay off the debts you owe?

675
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,890
By the way,

676
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,160
I was sent abroad
on a government scholarship.

677
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,820
I worked to support myself
in Germany for 4 years

678
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,660
and didn't spend a cent
of the family's money.

679
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,820
You've been in business for years.

680
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,760
Have you earned anything?

681
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,880
The Lin family served as officials
for generations,

682
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,770
and remained wealthy for over a century.

683
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,820
Now creditors are coming
to our door to collect debts.

684
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,350
Our reputation is damaged,

685
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,450
and we can't even keep our residence.

686
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,940
Whose fault is this, really?

687
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,530
Who squandered the Lin family's fortune?

688
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,940
Ao,

689
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,060
I'd like to report something to you.

690
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,150
Go ahead.

691
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,000
The day the Lin family's maid died,

692
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,800
Young Master didn't go to the theater.

693
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,950
That son of the Liu family

694
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,550
picked him up to go drinking.

695
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,510
And he took you along as well?

696
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,230
Yes, he did.

697
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,880
Then who drove his car?

698
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,610
I don't know.

699
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,180
Alright, I got it.

700
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,000
Ao,

701
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,710
this is a big deal.

702
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,400
Should we tell Master?

703
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,790
With Dalun's personality,

704
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,690
if he's determined to do this,

705
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,300
telling Master won't help.

706
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,690
That's true.

707
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,850
Dalun...

708
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,010
is hard to deal with.

709
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,760
So what should we do?

710
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,750
Don't worry. Let me think about it.

711
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,380
What do you want?

712
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,150
Do you have coffee here?

713
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,760
No.

714
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,710
Who would drink coffee this late at night?

715
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,240
About Zeng Dalun's case...

716
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,270
you're his defense lawyer, right?

717
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,960
The eldest daughter of the Lin family
came to see me today.

718
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,380
She said she's going to publish a report

719
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,580
alleging that Dalun murdered her maid.

720
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,000
As you know,

721
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,180
our paper has
the biggest circulation in Shanghai.

722
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,110
The Zeng family may be powerful,

723
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,770
but the victim was only a maid.

724
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,170
If this gets published,

725
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,970
it will cause such public outrage

726
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,100
and social pressure

727
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,360
that when you go to court,

728
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,710
hundreds of people will be outside,
blocking the courthouse.

729
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,510
How could you possibly win that case?

730
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,770
It will influence the judge's decision.

731
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,660
So tell me, should I publish it or not?

732
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,120
You must not publish this.

733
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,850
Fine,

734
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,910
I won't.

735
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,760
But,

736
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,220
putting our past as classmates aside,

737
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,800
based on my experience,

738
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,570
this piece would sell extremely well.

739
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,360
If I don't publish this,

740
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,840
what am I supposed to tell

741
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,030
my editor-in-chief when he asks?

742
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,300
How about this?

743
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,730
Lu Yingchen,

744
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,420
I'll buy every last copy
