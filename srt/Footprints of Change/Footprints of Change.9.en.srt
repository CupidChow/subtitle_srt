[Footprints of Change]

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,810
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:47,759
Mr. Cheng,

4
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,890
a gentleman is waiting for you inside.

5
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,910
I've made coffee for you.

6
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,759
No sugar.

7
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,010
What happened?

8
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,610
You've fallen out with Dalun?

9
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,740
Why do you say that?

10
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,120
Don't you know that Kang Kaisheng
is Zeng Dalun's henchman?

11
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,680
Kang Kaisheng is Zeng Dalun's henchman?

12
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,240
Yes.

13
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,680
Shen Yiqun arrested Kang Kaisheng by night

14
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,870
and reported it to the Nanjing government.

15
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,470
The government immediately issued an order

16
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,400
to treat Kang Kaisheng as a rebel.

17
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,410
By the time Zeng Dalun arrived,

18
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,829
Kang Kaisheng had been sent to Nanjing.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now even if Zeng Dalun claims

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,660
that Kang Kaisheng is his man,

21
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,150
the Nanjing government wouldn't
admit their mistake.

22
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,520
Kang Kaisheng is doomed.

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,840
Shen Yiqun said

24
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,130
you and he are on the same side,

25
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,120
and you two worked together
to arrest Kang Kaisheng.

26
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,840
You can't take Shen Yiqun's words

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,910
seriously.

28
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,840
Well done, bro.

29
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,250
You're playing politics now.

30
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,750
If you have any
inside political information,

31
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,350
tell me at the first time.

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,600
But you should know

33
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,450
playing politics isn't that easy.

34
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,190
Whether you

35
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,590
work with Shen Yiqun

36
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,280
or with Zeng Dalun,

37
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,730
you have to be careful.

38
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,500
I won't work with anyone.

39
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,550
You are different now.

40
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
You won't even be honest with me now.

41
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,210
Fine.

42
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,750
I understand.

43
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,000
Director.

44
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,470
Siyun.

45
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,870
These two say they're
from the Health Department

46
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,930
and want to see you.

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,430
Please come with me to my office.

48
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,030
No need.

49
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,710
We've received reports.

50
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,840
Sinan Maternity Hospital is suspected
of illegal medical practice

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
and violations of health regulations.

52
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,210
Some of your practices even
violated ethical standards.

53
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,070
We have decided

54
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,520
to order your hospital
to cease operations immediately

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,980
for legal rectification.

56
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,120
The reopening time

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,720
depends on the rectification results.

58
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,190
I have government approval
for my operation.

59
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,790
Who gave you this authority?

60
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,440
Here is the closure notice.

61
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,050
Read it yourself.

62
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,860
[Notice of Closing]

63
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,029
Those two people were sent by my father.

64
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,300
He was furious,

65
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,660
and almost tore the house apart.

66
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,420
Why?

67
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,710
You prescribed
birth control pills for Aunt Nan, right?

68
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,790
Yes, I did.

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,680
He found out.

70
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,159
All these years, he's been hoping that

71
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,960
he and Aunt Nan could have a baby.

72
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,560
Has your father ever asked

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,490
if Aunt Nan wants to have children?

74
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,380
Siyun.

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,010
I understand your progressive thoughts.

76
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,140
But my father doesn't.

77
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,470
He's very traditional.

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,270
Is Aunt Nan okay?

79
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,610
She is fine.

80
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,640
My father didn't get too angry with her.

81
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,870
Instead, he directed all his anger at you.

82
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,680
Don't worry.

83
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,680
Take

84
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
these days a vacation for yourself.

85
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,800
Take a good rest.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,860
I'll communicate with my father.

87
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,820
I'm glad Aunt Nan is okay.

88
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,610
Shen Yiqun.

89
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,640
Thank you for your concern.

90
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,510
Still worried?

91
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,150
Yes.

92
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,390
I need to discuss something with you.

93
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,630
The statement on this notice

94
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,480
about Sinan Hospital

95
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,980
is completely false.

96
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,480
I didn't do anything illegal.

97
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,270
If we can trace the source
of these rumors,

98
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,360
and file an appeal,

99
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,510
will Sinan Hospital

100
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,480
be able to resume business soon?

101
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

102
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,960
But according to my experience,

103
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,120
from filing an appeal
to getting the verdict,

104
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
it will take

105
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,650
at least three months.

106
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,680
Three months?

107
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,430
If

108
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,360
you have trouble tracking

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,080
the source of the rumors,

110
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,950
it might take

111
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,070
half a year.

112
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,200
So long?

113
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,390
Besides,

114
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,210
if there are many cases in court,

115
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,480
it might take ten months

116
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,820
or even a year.

117
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
How can I keep my hospital running if so?

118
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,770
My funds won't last ten months.

119
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,430
I have so many doctors and nurses,

120
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,480
and medical supplies.

121
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,150
However,

122
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,670
I do have a quicker solution.

123
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,470
Why are you so annoying?

124
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,159
Why didn't you say so earlier?

125
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,390
Hello.

126
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,650
I'm looking for Director Shen.

127
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,980
Director Shen isn't seeing anyone today.

128
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,210
I told you already.

129
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,540
Director Shen isn't seeing anyone today.

130
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,130
Then please give this photo

131
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,659
to him.

132
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,830
Director.

133
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,190
Come in.

134
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,950
Get out.

135
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,720
Miss Lin,

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,930
what do you mean?

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,720
With Director Shen's intervention,

138
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,960
I believe the hospital's crisis

139
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,560
will be resolved soon.

140
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
You're threatening me?

141
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,310
Director Shen, you're overreacting.

142
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,240
It's just a matter of reciprocity.

143
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,820
Besides,

144
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,190
about Aunt Nan's birth control issue,

145
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,860
I hope you can stop interfering with it.

146
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,060
You want to meddle in my family affairs?

147
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,510
Then, I have no choice but
to talk to Mayor Zhu

148
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,970
about his family matters.

149
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,650
Thank you for your understanding,
Director Shen.

150
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,920
Dalun.

151
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,920
What are you doing here?

152
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,280
You want to talk to the director?

153
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,320
He probably won't be here for a while.

154
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,190
Why don't you come to my office first?

155
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,270
Let's have a chat.

156
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,330
Kang Kaisheng's incident

157
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,909
was truly a case of friendly fire.

158
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,880
He's too much like a Communist.

159
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,630
Think about

160
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,870
those articles he wrote,

161
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,669
and the things he did.

162
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,960
He looked exactly like
a rebel sympathizer.

163
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,909
I didn't know he was your man.

164
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
Dalun,

165
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,120
although he's been sent to Nanjing now,

166
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,750
don't worry.

167
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,480
I'll go there myself later

168
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,200
to clear things up,

169
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,600
and bring him back to you.

170
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,480
Shen Yiqun.

171
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,490
What are you most afraid of?

172
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,290
What am I most afraid of?

173
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,870
Given the current situation,

174
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
what I fear most is that

175
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,320
Japan would launch
a full-scale invasion of China.

176
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,630
People will be homeless refugees
at that time.

177
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,440
Imagine it.

178
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,160
When that time comes,

179
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,480
how much will the people suffer?

180
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
I'm most afraid of venomous snakes.

181
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,760
Tigers and lions don't scare me at all.

182
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,000
But venomous snakes

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,440
always live in dark, damp places.

184
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,770
They will bite you
when you least expect it

185
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,240
and kill you easily.

186
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,910
Indeed.

187
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,150
Yiqun.

188
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,910
Director.

189
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,080
What are you doing here?

190
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm working here.

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,270
I saw Dalun here.

192
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,870
So, I came in to chat with him.

193
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,360
You two know each other?

194
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,350
We've known each other since childhood.

195
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,410
We are old friends.

196
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,200
Altough

197
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,390
you are friends,

198
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,150
let me formally introduce you.

199
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,270
Dalun has joined

200
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,320
our department's special action team.

201
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,870
You two should work closely together
from now on.

202
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,630
What's more,

203
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,870
even Mr. Dai thinks highly of him.

204
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,670
Take good care of him.

205
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,070
Well, well!

206
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,340
Dalun,

207
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,810
congratulations!

208
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,840
If you need anything,

209
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,670
just let me know.

210
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,400
I'll fully cooperate with you.

211
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,300
Thanks for your kindness.

212
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,600
Now that the Director is here,

213
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,390
you'd report to him.

214
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,550
I'll head back first.

215
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,200
Come to my place for tea
after you're done.

216
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,670
Okay.

217
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,740
I'll leave, Director.

218
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,790
Good!

219
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,860
My method worked out, right?

220
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,030
Thank you.

221
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,280
What's next?

222
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,230
♪ What we've loved, what we've said ♪

223
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,880
♪ Won't be swept away by wind or rain ♪

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,490
♪ What we've suffered, what we've missed ♪

225
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,400

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,930

♪ That brightness in the darkness ♪

231
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,750
What happens next

232
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,330
is very important.

233
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,240
♪ I'll treasure what you gave me ♪

234
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm having dinner with Mr. Zeng tonight.

235
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:46,400
♪ That brightness in the darkness ♪

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,150
You're all busy.

237
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
But you came to celebrate my birthday.

238
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,550
Thank you.

239
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,870
It's our pleasure.

240
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,360
Our friendship

241
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
has lasted over 30 years now.

242
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,800
He wasn't even born at that time.

243
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,740
Does your father know
about our relationship?

244
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,870
What relationship?

245
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,310
Why are you making it sound like

246
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,770
we have something to hide?

247
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,700
Will your father like

248
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,440
the gift I prepared for him?

249
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,750
Don't worry.

250
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,030
He'll definitely like it.

251
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,360
He loves drinking tea,

252
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,500
not to mention that

253
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,390
it's your gift.

254
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Don't be nervous.

255
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,300
It isn't your first time here.

256
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,440
And you've met him before.

257
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,150
It's different this time.

258
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,790
We came in arm in arm.

259
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,230
It'll get better if you come more often.

260
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,060
So,

261
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,800
whatever happens,

262
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,260
let us support each other.

263
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,180
Father.

264
00:12:59,390 --> 00:12:59,960
Ao.

265
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,240
Dr. Lin.

266
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,190
Come in.

267
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,300
Please, come in.

268
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,390
Mr. Zeng.

269
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,390
Wish you a happy birthday.

270
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,750
Thank you.

271
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,120
Look,

272
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,150
our family

273
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,510
has a lawyer.

274
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,470
In the future,

275
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,750
we will have a doctor.

276
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,840
Today,

277
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,920
I'm blessed with double happiness.

278
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,980
Congratulations.

279
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,400
Father,

280
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,440
Siyun brought you a gift.

281
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,070
That's very kind of you.

282
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,510
What's this?

283
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,950
Tea.

284
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,360
Foreign tea. Look.

285
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,110
It even has foreign letters.

286
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,800
Put it away quickly.

287
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,090
I told you he would like it.

288
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,150
Cheng Ao, come here.

289
00:13:59,290 --> 00:13:59,930
Father.

290
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,610
Thank you, Father.

291
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,670
What are you thanking me for?

292
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,840
It's not for you.

293
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,630
Take it.

294
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,630
It's from Father.

295
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,030
Thank you, Mr. Zeng.

296
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,600
It's nothing.

297
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Master, bad news.

298
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,470
A group of people
from the police station are here.

299
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,600
Excuse me.

300
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,240
My friend.

301
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,150
May I help you?

302
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,200
Mr. Zeng,

303
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,380
someone reported that your son,
Zeng Dalun,

304
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,210
is hiding and selling opium.

305
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,150
There must be a misunderstanding.

306
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,480
Our family has strictly forbidden

307
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
opium trading.

308
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,270
Mr. Zeng,

309
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,410
this is an order from my senior.

310
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,760
This is a search warrant.

311
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,480
Have you lost your minds?

312
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,160
Get out of my house now!

313
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,000
If you don't leave,

314
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,840
I'll pull out my gun.

315
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,600
How dare you!

316
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,750
Step aside!

317
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,450
Young Master Zeng,

318
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,280
Mr. Zeng,

319
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,410
we came with a search warrant.

320
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,550
If we leave without doing anything,

321
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,600
we won't be able to report back properly.

322
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sure you understand.

323
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,240
Okay.

324
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
Do your job.

325
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,300
But

326
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,750
today is my birthday.

327
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,330
I've invited many guests.

328
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,130
Our family values our reputation.

329
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,080
If you find nothing,

330
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,330
the police station

331
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,670
has to publicly apologize to our family.

332
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,390
Mr. Zeng,

333
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,790
if we find nothing,

334
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,030
I will certainly apologize.

335
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,910
And we'll publish

336
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,250
a front-page apology in the newspaper.

337
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,180
Please proceed.

338
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,750
Search!

339
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,790
Hurry up.

340
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,050
Over here!

341
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,440
Did you do this?

342
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,270
Dad,

343
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,690
I didn't do it.

344
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,090
Please trust me.

345
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,930
Found it!

346
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,790
Take it out!

347
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,630
Let's go!

348
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,550
Take it out!

349
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,100
Mr. Zeng,

350
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,630
please

351
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,010
verify if this is real.

352
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,250
Do what you should do.

353
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,160
Take him away.

354
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,210
It's fine.

355
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,100
I didn't do it anyway.

356
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,200
Alright.

357
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,220
I can walk.

358
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,270
Pack up and take him away.

359
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,480
Hurry up!

360
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,510
Mr. Cheng.

361
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,510
Our law firm has quite a few cases lately.

362
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,550
Could you help us handle some of them?

363
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,410
Here are the relevant documents.

364
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,400
No problem.

365
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,210
That's what old classmates are for.

366
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,730
You helped me a lot before.

367
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,080
This person has asked me for help.

368
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,160
You were too busy.

369
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,960
I recently have

370
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,070
a similar case.

371
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,600
I'll handle them together.

372
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,870
Alright, leave it to me.

373
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,480
Okay.

374
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,550
Cheng Ao,

375
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,240
when I was paying the fine
at the police station,

376
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,310
I asked around.

377
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,620
They said a lawyer
named Cheng reported me.

378
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,780
We didn't have any conflict, did we?

379
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,620
Even though you don't like

380
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,050
my way of doing things,

381
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,080
you shouldn't stab me
in the back like this.

382
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,150
You know I work

383
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,400
for the government.

384
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,390
My reputation is important.

385
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,840
After this incident,

386
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,960
I've been bribing officials,

387
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,800
explaining myself and entertaining others.

388
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,120
But I don't even know if these will help.

389
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,110
Shen Yiqun watches me every day.

390
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,880
You deliberately

391
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,940
gave him something to use against me.

392
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,130
Besides, I didn't even do this thing.

393
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,930
Boiling beans,

394
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,880
with beanstalks as fuel,

395
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,610
the beans

396
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,260
weep in the pot.

397
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,680
We are brothers.

398
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,480
I won't be angry with you.

399
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,380
You're blocking my light.

400
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,440
You had the police

401
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,170
arrest me at Dad's birthday banquet.

402
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,010
I can also choose not to tell Dad
about it.

403
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,240
Do not let him

404
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,110
worry about us.

405
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
He's getting old.

406
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,800
You can see that too, right?

407
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,450
From now on, you'll be
the head of this family.

408
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,170
And I'll be the second-in-command.

409
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,750
Cheng Ao.

410
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,860
We need to stick together.

411
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,720
Cheng Ao.

412
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,350
You're so talented.

413
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,000
Dalun.

414
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,150
I am

415
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,590
Jinghan.

416
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,270
I've noticed that

417
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,990
since you returned from the Northeast,

418
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,680
you've become quite famous in Shanghai.

419
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,240
Everyone knows your name.

420
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,830
Your career is really taking off.

421
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,640
I heard that you're now

422
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,680
working at the Revival Society,

423
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,610
and engaging in the opium trade.

424
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,880
I want to make big money with you.

425
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,720
I graduated from business school,

426
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,510
and I want to follow
in your footsteps, Dalun.

427
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,340
I'll follow your lead.

428
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,270
I will do whatever you want me to do.

429
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,680
Jinghan.

430
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,130
Have a drink.

431
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,410
Let me fill it up.

432
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,480
I actually quite like you.

433
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,570
How should I describe you?

434
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,310
You're like

435
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,440
a toothless old dog.

436
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,340
You don't bite,

437
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,850
but you're still quite intimidating.

438
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,590
I can't help you with work matters.

439
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,720
But if you want to come here for drinks,

440
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,640
it's on me.

441
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,750
Get out.

442
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,830
No visitors for the next 30 minutes.

443
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,690
Close the door.

444
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:42,970
Yes.

445
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,900
I did it.

446
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,790
Is everything in place?

447
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,880
All set, Director.

448
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,710
Let's go.

449
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,280
This is a search warrant.

450
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,270
Take it out.

451
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,000
Cheng Ao.

452
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,270
When I was paying
the fine at the police station,

453
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,350
I asked around.

454
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,860
I heard it was reported
by a lawyer named Cheng.

455
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,610
You dragged me down,

456
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,250
trying to tie me to you.

457
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,410
You're too afraid to face
Zeng Dalun yourself

458
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,880
because he works for Mr. Dai.

459
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,430
You're quite shameless.

460
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,030
I admit my method

461
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,670
is somewhat despicable.

462
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,760
But to make great achievements,

463
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,480
I should use some tactics.

464
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,800
I know Zeng Dalun is
the one who caused you trouble.

465
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,880
You're concerned about Mr. Zeng.

466
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,070
So, you didn't dare scheme against Dalun.

467
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,930
But I have nothing to worry about.

468
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,710
Since we have a common enemy,

469
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,880
why don't we brothers join forces?

470
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,070
It's a good thing.

471
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,550
Who said we're brothers?

472
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,240
No matter what Zeng Dalun did to me,

473
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,550
it is my own business.

474
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,550
I know.

475
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,960
You grew up together

476
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,860
and have loyalty between you.

477
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,010
But don't we have
something between us, too?

478
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,790
We did.

479
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,660
Before this incident, we did.

480
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,530
Now, when I look at you,
I just feel disgusted.

481
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,310
Cheng Ao,

482
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,200
I never thought

483
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,930
I would hear

484
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,160
these words from you.

485
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,480
I admit I'm a despicable person.

486
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,130
But without being this way,

487
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,770
how could I ever succeed?

488
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,390
Once I have power in my hands,

489
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,320
I'll share it with you.

490
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,070
Bro,

491
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,790
one of us has to be

492
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,480
the disgusting one.

493
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,830
Now, I've chosen to be the one.

494
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,680
What right do you have to criticize me?

495
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,750
Are you crazy?

496
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,640
Who's crazy?

497
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,160
Who wants your pathetic power?

498
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,960
No matter what happens
between you and Zeng Dalun,

499
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,700
don't get me involved. Got it?

500
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,200
Understand?

501
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,710
Director Shen.

502
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,240
Mr. Zeng.

503
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,290
Mr. Sada.

504
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,790
Your dad refuses to cooperate with us.

505
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,750
He also incited the union workers
to organize strikes.

506
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,200
Do you know all this?

507
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,200
My dad is quite traditional

508
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,310
and conservative.

509
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,110
Mr. Zeng.

510
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,680
Can you persuade your dad
to cooperate with us?

511
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,590
He could make a lot of money.

512
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,790
And we can guarantee your dad's safety.

513
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,110
Your dad has two choices,

514
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,200
cooperating with us

515
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,000
or being killed by us.

516
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,880
You're threatening me?

517
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,910
That's not my intention.

518
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,790
We are friends.

519
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,400
So, I'm telling you this.

520
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,190
I hope you can consider it.

521
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Why did you ask me to meet at the dock?

522
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,320
When we were kids,

523
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,700
we always played here.

524
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,750
When we were young,
Dad didn't allow us to drink

525
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,410
but we always drank in secret.

526
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,620
Remember that time

527
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,940
when you got drunk and Dad caught you?

528
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,230
He slapped you so hard
that two of your teeth flew out.

529
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,200
Nonsense.

530
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,590
He did slap me.

531
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,510
But my teeth didn't fall out.

532
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,490
Well,

533
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,240
I remember now.

534
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,880
I bought the wine for you.

535
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,070
You did buy it for me

536
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,430
but I never got to drink it.

537
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,440
You finished it all
before you even got home.

538
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,880
I saved you.

539
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,160
Otherwise, you would've been slapped, too.

540
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,200
Fine, thank you.

541
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,660
Cheng Ao.

542
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,720
About Xiu,

543
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,280
I didn't tell you the truth.

544
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,200
I know.

545
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,230
About Huang Aniu,

546
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,110
I also lied to you.

547
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,240
I know.

548
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,640
But today,

549
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,340
I need to tell you the truth

550
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,440
and be honest.

551
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,090
I do have connections with the Japanese.

552
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,740
They now wield considerable
influence in Shanghai.

553
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,400
I can only befriend them
and avoid making enemies.

554
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,720
It allows me to make money

555
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
without any risk.

556
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,320
I hope you understand that

557
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,770
and help me convince Dad

558
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,990
to cooperate with the Japanese.

559
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,990
What do you think?

560
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,160
Forget about Communism.

561
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,000
If you continue down that path,

562
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,730
it will only lead to your death.

563
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,750
Besides,

564
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,010
our family business

565
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,020
is only in the French Concession.

566
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,150
Soon after the Japanese come,

567
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,550
the French will all flee.

568
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,960
Have you ever had Japanese food?

569
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,440
Tomorrow,

570
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,720
I'll invite Sada

571
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,030
to have a meal with us.

572
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,270
Sada is a nice person.

573
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,430
And

574
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
when you

575
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,440
put the sashimi in your mouth,

576
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,350
you will find the taste

577
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,070
is amazing.

578
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,840
What are you doing?

579
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,680
Where are you going?

580
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,480
Zeng Dalun.

581
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,870
We're not brothers anymore.

582
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,400
Why?

583
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,680
Cheng Ao!

584
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,510
Come back!

585
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,570
Help me massage my back.

586
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:17,900
Master.

587
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,890
Mr. Cheng and Miss Lin are here.

588
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,310
Please show them in.

589
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,170
Yes, Master.

590
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,000
Father.

591
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,270
Dr. Lin.

592
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,730
Father, please don't move.

593
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,110
I'm sorry.

594
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,640
I'm not feeling well.

595
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,160
Please excuse my negligence.

596
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,220
Please have a seat.

597
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,270
Mr. Zeng.

598
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,160
You don't need to attend to me.

599
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,510
Have you seen a doctor?

600
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,620
Would you like me to recommend
some Western doctors?

601
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,110
No need.

602
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,400
It's an old ailment.

603
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,480
A few doses of Chinese medicine will help.

604
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,240
Miss Lin.

605
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,680
Come sit in my room.

606
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,590
I want you to check on my baby.

607
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,450
Okay.

608
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,240
Yes.

609
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,160
Keep Dr. Lin company for a while.

610
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,610
Take it slow.

611
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,410
Come, have a seat.

612
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,710
Tell me the truth.

613
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,590
Did you report Dalun?

614
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,070
No.

615
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,580
Reporting him wouldn't be wrong.

616
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,200
I just don't want to see

617
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,110
you two turning against each other.

618
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,030
You lost your parents when you were young.

619
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,030
I've always treated you as my own son.

620
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,200
I hoped you two

621
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,310
would get along well

622
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,950
and support each other.

623
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:11,139
Dalun is a jerk

624
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,840
who deserves to die.

625
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,880
But I hope the one who kills him

626
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,040
wouldn't be you.

627
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,650
Do you understand?

628
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,949
Have a rest, Father.

629
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,880
Dad.

630
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,070
Stand up!

631
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,320
Are you still hanging around
with the Japanese?

632
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,280
Cut the crap.

633
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,280
You did business

634
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,630
with the Japanese in Changchun,

635
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,160
selling local goods to them

636
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,910
and bringing Japanese products back here.

637
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,570
You think I don't know?

638
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,740
I did it to make money.

639
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,590
Nonsense!

640
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,470
Besides doing business,

641
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,670
what else did you do?

642
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,480
Nothing.

643
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,340
You worked with Huang Aniu

644
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,420
trafficking opium

645
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,950
and had your gang members

646
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,560
attack Cheng Ao,

647
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,220
right?

648
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,960
Zeng Dalun,

649
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,600
you're playing with fire.
Do you realize that?

650
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,230
Dad.

651
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,840
I'm working for the Revival Society now.

652
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,680
I need

653
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,320
money to get things done here.

654
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,550
How can I rise step by step
without money?

655
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,590
But you should not
collude with the Japanese.

656
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,030
That's my bottom line.

657
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,870
I'm not trying to collude with them.

658
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,580
They came to me first.

659
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,930
You incited the union workers to strike.

660
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,030
They gave you two options.

661
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,630
Cooperate with them

662
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,890
and make a lot of money.

663
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,790
Or,

664
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
they'll kill you.

665
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,480
Let them try.

666
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,230
If I am frightened,

667
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,830
I'm not worthy to be your dad.

668
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,150
Dad.

669
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,230
In my opinion,

670
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,110
you are too conservative.

671
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,230
Why are you so stubborn?

672
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,880
You've taught us since we were young

673
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,010
we should not make enemies
with forces stronger than us.

674
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,710
You made the union workers strike.

675
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,030
The Japanese didn't punish you.

676
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,070
Instead, they want to cooperate with you.

677
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,360
What a great opportunity!

678
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,230
I think

679
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,920
the Japanese influence in Shanghai

680
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,890
is getting stronger and stronger.

681
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,710
You'll have to face the Japanese
sooner or later.

682
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,630
Better sooner than later.

683
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,750
We need to use

684
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,850
the Japanese influence

685
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,510
to become the number one group
in Shanghai.

686
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,400
Get out!

687
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,270
Dad.

688
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,670
After more than 20 years,

689
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,710
your still have so much strength.

690
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:32,990
Alright.

691
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,710
It won't be long

692
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,010
before we see whose judgment is correct.

693
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,670
Old man.

694
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,670
Don't go out these days unless necessary.

695
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,630
Take some men with you when you go out.

696
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,160
Be careful not to be killed.

697
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,590
Hello, this is Pingzheng Law Firm.

698
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,440
Mr. Cheng,

699
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,520
Master is feeling unwell.
He's asking you to come over.

700
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
What's wrong with Father?

701
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,710
Is he okay?

702
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,690
He said he has important matters
to tell you.

703
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,110
Okay, I'll be right there.

704
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,090
Master.

705
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,320
Mr. Cheng is

706
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,510
waiting at the door.

707
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,670
I'll step out first.

708
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,270
Call me if you need anything.

709
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,170
Yanhong.

710
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,190
Sit down.

711
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,540
What I'm about to discuss

712
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,360
concerns you.

713
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,280
Father.

714
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,510
Ao,

715
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,760
have a seat.

716
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,720
I'll tell you something.

717
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,810
Write it down.

718
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,950
I want to change my will.

719
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,200
All my assets,

720
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,760
houses,

721
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,050
and the land in my hometown

722
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,510
which were originally intended for
my sole heir, Zeng Dalun,

723
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,770
will be divided into four equal parts.

724
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,510
One part

725
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,570
goes to my eldest son, Zeng Dalun.

726
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,480
One part

727
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,390
goes to my adopted son, Cheng Ao.

728
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,590
One part

729
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,430
goes to Xiao Yanhong

730
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,420
and her young son.

731
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,060
The last part

732
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,080
should be donated to my hometown

733
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,620
to build schools

734
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,090
and charity houses.

735
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,590
Thank you, Master.

736
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,350
Have you written everything down?

737
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,150
After it's finished,

738
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,770
I'll sign it.

739
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,600
Everything is noted.

740
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,990
I'll take my leave now, Father.

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:51,990
