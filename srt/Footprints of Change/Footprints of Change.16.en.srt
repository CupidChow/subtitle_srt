[Episode 16]

3
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Actually, all I wanted was

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,920
to keep her company.

5
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,060
I was afraid she'd be lonely

6
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,460
or that she'd be bullied.

7
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,729
Who knew she would react so strongly?

8
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,430
Actually,

9
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,430
I get what Yang meant.

10
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,640
He's just worried your sister-in-law

11
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,470
might fall for some shady man

12
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,750
and tarnish

13
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,310
the name of a martyr's widow.

14
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:12,800
Right?

15
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,110
Mr. Yang definitely meant well.

16
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,710
I know

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,360
my brother and sister-in-law
truly loved each other.

18
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,680
She would never love another man.

19
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,570
Director Fang,

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,560
what do you think?

21
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,190
I don't know.

22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,800
So you're saying

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,530
she might fall for another man?

24
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,360
Hard to say.

25
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,450
Then I'll go talk to her!

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,400
Well,

27
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,190
are you suggesting

28
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,079
that you expect her to remain a widow

29
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,520
for the rest of her life?

30
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,560
You're a Communist Youth League member.

31
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,750
This kind of idea isn't right.

32
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,520
It's feudal thinking

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,630
that should be criticized.

34
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,430
But I just can't get over it.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,310
The thought of her with another man…

36
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,910
I...

37
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,680
I feel uncomfortable.

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,470
It upsets me.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,460
You understand me, right?

40
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,560
Young comrade,

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,080
you're quite adorable.

42
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,940
Director Fang says I'm adorable.

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,680
Ms. Yi,

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,190
may I share my thoughts

45
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,280
about this design draft?

46
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,630
Of course.

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,030
I might not be right.

48
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,720
I actually wanted to say this last time.

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,750
I think this design

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,020
isn't quite complete yet.

51
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,700
On the surface, it looks fine,

52
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,030
but somehow it lacks a bit of...

53
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,470
character.

54
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,680
Ms. Su,

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,150
I feel the same.

56
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,710
That's why I've been delaying submission.

57
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,160
I've been stuck at home lately,

58
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,690
no inspiration at all.

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,280
Then get out for a walk.

60
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Haven't you been out for a long time?

61
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,520
Is that allowed?

62
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,710
Of course it is.

63
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,120
That's great!

64
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,840
My bike's broken.

65
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,370
I'll get it fixed tomorrow.

66
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,170
Okay.

67
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,220
What are you doing?

68
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,760
Fixing the bike.

69
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,159
Xiurong said

70
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,370
the chain fell off.

71
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,610
Turns out the tire's flat too.

72
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,040
Where did you ride this nice bike to,

73
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,240
getting it like this?

74
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,390
To the mountains.

75
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,020
The mountains?

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
How did you get the bike back?

77
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
I carried it.

78
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,040
You?

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,270
Yes, me.

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,920
Once I fix this bike,

81
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,070
no matter how you ride it in the future,

82
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,800
the chain won't come off again.

83
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,640
Don't carry it next time.

84
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,670
With those skinny arms and legs,

85
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,210
you might fall into a ditch.

86
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,680
Are you worried about me?

87
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,430
Yes.

88
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,820
But you're not fixing my bike.

89
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,720
You—

90
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,070
You're lying.

91
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,120
This is your bike.

92
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,480
Are you kidding me?

93
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,140
Don't touch it.

94
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:36,880
It's dirty.

95
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,750
Scholar.

96
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,400
Haven't had hot oil noodles
for a long time, right?

97
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,430
Yeah.

98
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,040
What's up?

99
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,920
Do you remember Sun from the mess hall?

100
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,630
I do.

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,600
He made the best hot oil noodles.

102
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,510
His whole family has moved here.

103
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,560
They moved to Shanghai?

104
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,270
Yes.

105
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,360
Really?

106
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
Really.

107
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,160
Where?

108
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,200
Right under the bridge.

109
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,120
Look.

110
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,680
-It's over there.
-That one.

111
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,920
We can't show up empty-handed.

112
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,480
There was a pastry shop on the way.

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,120
Here.

114
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,560
Buy some snacks for the kids.

115
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,390
I have money.

116
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,830
Come on, put that away.

117
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,920
You really do?

118
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,430
I'll go.

119
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,190
Okay.

120
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,750
You go ahead first.

121
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,880
Is the pen good to use?

122
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,680
Minister...

123
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,180
Minister Wen, what...

124
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,640
What are you doing here?

125
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,560
An old comrade opened a noodle shop here.

126
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,160
We came for a bowl of noodles.

127
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,220
I saw you drawing from a distance,

128
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,770
so I came over to take a look.

129
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,690
You haven't answered my question yet.

130
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,730
What question?

131
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,480
The pen,

132
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,310
is it good?

133
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,950
It's good.

134
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,360
I've been using it a lot lately.

135
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,270
Did you draw this?

136
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,270
May I see it?

137
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,270
Just a casual sketch.

138
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,560
You like drawing people?

139
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,040
I think sometimes people,

140
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,290
in their natural, lively moments,

141
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,720
really move me.

142
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,040
I don't know art,

143
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,240
but I believe everything
in this world is connected.

144
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,560
Every piece of work

145
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,490
reflects the creator's
state of mind at that moment.

146
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,510
Am I right?

147
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,040
You draw very well.

148
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,750
You always support me.

149
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,570
Actually,

150
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,630
your support means a lot to me.

151
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,330
There have been many times when I felt

152
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,850
I couldn't go on anymore.

153
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,560
But then I think,

154
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,950
there's still someone like you,
a leader who's cultured,

155
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,610
well-mannered and selfless,

156
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,750
and I'd feel at peace.

157
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,690
At least there's still someone

158
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,159
who understands people like us.

159
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,150
Scholar,

160
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,030
I was wondering where you went.

161
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,940
Turns out here you are, hiding...

162
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,750
hiding such a beauty.

163
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,230
Don't talk nonsense!

164
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,660
That's not funny!

165
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,860
Do you know who she is?

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,840
Zhou Zhaoyuan I told you about,

167
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,610
and this is Ms. Yi Yi.

168
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,390
Apologize to her.

169
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,670
No need.

170
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,400
No, no.

171
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,840
I should apologize.

172
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,380
I'm sorry,

173
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,240
Ms. Zhou.

174
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,960
No, I mean,

175
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,980
Ms. Yi, right?

176
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,030
You know,

177
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,750
our comrades who worked underground

178
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,080
deserve great respect,

179
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
and their families

180
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,840
are even more admirable.

181
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,630
I'm sorry,

182
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,360
I spoke too rashly.

183
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,670
It's fine.

184
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,080
Well,

185
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,510
I'm Zhao Hangong,

186
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,310
Wen's comrade-in-arms.

187
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,680
We've been through
life and death together.

188
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,560
Hello.

189
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,630
Hello.

190
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,380
Hello.

191
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,240
Did you buy the gift?

192
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes, I did.

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,660
So let's...

194
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,630
Shall we...

195
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,240
How about

196
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,240
we go to my old comrade's noodle shop

197
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,440
for a bowl of noodles?

198
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,380
Have some noodles.

199
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,410
Yes.

200
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,770
It's quite special.

201
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,300
-Let's go together.
-The noodles are so good.

202
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,320
I'll... I'll go ahead.

203
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,240
I'll go first

204
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,770
to order.

205
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,850
Let's go.

206
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Let me take it.

207
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Sun's cooking

208
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,250
looks great.

209
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,150
Not bad.

210
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,270
Ms. Yi,

211
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,390
wait, you need to mix it first.

212
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,910
Mix it well before eating.

213
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,370
It tastes better that way.

214
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,910
Not like that.

215
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,870
Well,

216
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,630
let me help.

217
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,390
Come on.

218
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,620
You see,

219
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,750
with hot oil noodles,

220
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,360
mixing is the key.

221
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,150
You need to mix it hard.

222
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,790
It tastes better
when everything is fully blended.

223
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,400
Here.

224
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,510
-Thank you, Minister Wen.
-Try it.

225
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,240
After finishing the noodles,
have a bowl of soup.

226
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,750
What boils together, digests together.

227
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,610
Perfect match.

228
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:54,790
Okay.

229
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,480
Comrade Yi,

230
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,980
you don't mind

231
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,030
if I call you that, do you?

232
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,360
Go ahead, Comrade Zhao.

233
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,840
Alright then.

234
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,390
Actually,

235
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,310
confirming Comrade Zhaoyuan's identity—

236
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,670
Wen really

237
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,120
put in a lot of effort.

238
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,360
It wasn't easy at all.

239
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,630
Zhao,

240
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,480
can we not talk about this?

241
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,080
Eat.

242
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,320
Minister Wen,

243
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,790
let Comrade Zhao finish.

244
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,390
I'd like to know more about Zhaoyuan too.

245
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,920
I'm just telling the truth.

246
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,960
Wen

247
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,390
had us

248
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,480
investigate

249
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Comrade Zhou Zhaoyuan's identity.

250
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,910
We went to the local archives

251
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,570
and reviewed many documents.

252
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,910
Honestly,

253
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,480
without Wen's help,

254
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,680
confirming Zhaoyuan's identity

255
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,270
would have taken forever.

256
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,670
So you helped confirm Zhaoyuan's identity?

257
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,500
Actually, at first

258
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,150
I learned from you that

259
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,230
Comrade Zhaoyuan
had excellent artistic taste.

260
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,300
Later, I happened to chat with Fu Zihe

261
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,400
and found out

262
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,620
that he lived very frugally.

263
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,750
Once when they were
having a meal together,

264
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,750
he noticed

265
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,790
that Zhaoyuan's sock had a hole in it

266
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,390
which he had mended himself.

267
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,910
His sock had a hole in it?

268
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,120
I didn't even know that.

269
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,510
Also,

270
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,690
we learned that

271
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,240
among the high-ranking KMT officers,

272
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,270
there are many of our own comrades

273
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,270
who are frugal

274
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,840
and highly cultured.

275
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,350
Following that lead,

276
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,670
I found him

277
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,340
and proved that

278
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,750
your husband, Comrade Zhaoyuan,

279
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,750
was one of us.

280
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,160
I want to thank you on behalf of Zhaoyuan,

281
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,640
and for Qing and myself as well.

282
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,510
Eat now.

283
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,770
The noodles will get sticky soon.

284
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,340
Thank you.

285
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,430
I... I want some soup too.

286
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,790
Okay.

287
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,060
Here's for you.

288
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,120
Okay, thanks.

289
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,270
Perfect match indeed.

290
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:39,920
By the way,

291
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,950
Yuanyuan's birthday

292
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,840
is in a couple of days,

293
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,440
right?

294
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,250
How do you know?

295
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,320
My son told me.

296
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,240
Oh, right.

297
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,840
Isn't it just one day
apart from Huzi's birthday?

298
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,790
Now I remember.

299
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,720
That's true.

300
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,700
Then...

301
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,720
Let them celebrate together.

302
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,030
Yes, bring Huzi over

303
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,030
and let the kids celebrate
their birthdays together.

304
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,670
Yi,

305
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,720
would you like to join us?

306
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,240
Me?

307
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,270
Yes,

308
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,190
why don't you come along?

309
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,270
You know

310
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,050
my daughter Yuanyuan anyway.

311
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,380
Come celebrate her birthday.

312
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,010
Join us.

313
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,750
You already know each other.

314
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,500
Can you drive slower?

315
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,080
It's too bumpy.

316
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,550
Wen,

317
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
you didn't complain

318
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,780
when you used to ride in my car.

319
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,870
Slow down.

320
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,360
Slow down?

321
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,150
Alright.

322
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,300
I'll slow down.

323
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,200
Uh-oh. Broke down again.

324
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,270
Hold on.

325
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,750
Overheated, right?

326
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,410
It's definitely overheated.

327
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,200
Is it the car can't handle
so many people?

328
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,080
Maybe I should just bike back instead.

329
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,040
Don't worry.

330
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
The car overheating

331
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,000
has nothing to do with the extra weight.

332
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,400
It just needs to cool off.

333
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,450
What's wrong?

334
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,270
The spark plug wire snapped.

335
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,240
Can you fix it?

336
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,600
Can I fix it?

337
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,770
That's nothing.

338
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,030
Nothing.

339
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,550
He's excellent at fixing cars.

340
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,230
You'll see.

341
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,360
Comrade Yi,

342
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,520
don't underestimate my old buddy here.

343
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,340
This is a jeep captured from the Japanese.

344
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,870
This old buddy

345
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,510
has quite a history.

346
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,910
It served in
the War of Resistance Against Japan

347
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,240
and the Liberation War.

348
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,270
If not for its condition,

349
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,840
it would have joined the Korean War.

350
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,550
Really?

351
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes.

352
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,800
Look at these bullet holes.

353
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,870
It was hit by machine guns,

354
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,600
bombs,

355
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,750
and even ran over landmines.

356
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,030
Before

357
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,360
I came,

358
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,840
I already checked the car.

359
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,240
It's been repaired over 100 times.

360
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,440
Didn't expect

361
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,970
it would break down
at such a critical moment.

362
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,840
They say Communist cadres are capable.

363
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,750
I didn't expect a leader like you...

364
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,080
You're a leader, right?

365
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,000
I...

366
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,100
I'm a district secretary.

367
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,160
You could say that.

368
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,520
Didn't expect a leader could fix cars.

369
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,750
Fixing cars is nothing.

370
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,270
We've fought in battles

371
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,400
and killed enemies.

372
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,080
My only regret is

373
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,400
never

374
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640
serving in our country's

375
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,829
Navy or Air Force.

376
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,829
Otherwise...

377
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,760
Otherwise you'd want to fly planes

378
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,990
and repair warships?

379
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
Imagine me flying a plane—

380
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,829
that would be quite dashing.

381
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,050
What's so dashing?

382
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,829
How's the car?

383
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,770
Almost done. Just a moment.

384
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,760
Are you thirsty?

385
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,920
I'm fine.

386
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,480
Good.

387
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,400
Here,

388
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,750
look what I found.

389
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,510
Where did you get these?

390
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,270
Picked them from that tree over there.

391
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,510
I'm really thirsty.

392
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,480
There are only a few.
Are you really going to eat them?

393
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,720
I just...

394
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,000
Ladies first.

395
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,070
I'll just take one.

396
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,600
Didn't you say your teeth are sensitive
and afraid of sourness?

397
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,430
Right.

398
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,530
I'm afraid of sourness.

399
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,140
Right.

400
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,030
Right.

401
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,070
Here, try it.

402
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,790
Try it.

403
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,330
How's it?

404
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,110
Sweet.

405
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,270
Oh, I didn't wash it.

406
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,160
I usually eat these things

407
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,270
without washing them.

408
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:10,870
It's fine.

409
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
I don't wash them either.

410
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,480
Why's it still smoking?

411
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,410
It's about done.

412
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,720
Secretary Zhao,

413
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,240
I can't eat anymore.

414
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
You can have it.

415
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,350
I...

416
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,920
I'm afraid of sourness.

417
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,730
It's sweet.

418
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,640
You...

419
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,770
can eat it now.

420
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,910
Alright then.

421
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,550
Okay.

422
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,110
I'll go wash my handkerchief over there.

423
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,550
No need.

424
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,210
Let me do it.

425
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,760
Sweet.

426
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,360
Sweet.

427
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,450
I'll be right back.

428
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,070
Ms. Yi.

429
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,000
Ms. Yi.

430
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,720
Let me wash it.

431
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,750
No need. I'll do it.

432
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,750
Let me.

433
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,270
Really.

434
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,250
Give it to me.

435
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,550
Minister Wen!

436
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,310
Are you okay?

437
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,830
I'm fine.

438
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,930
Don't come over.

439
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:09,890
Stay back.

440
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
Sorry for the embarrassment.

441
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,880
Washing a handkerchief,

442
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,440
but ended up washing
my pants, socks, and shoes

443
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,290
all together.

444
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,210
At least the bucket's still here.

445
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,030
Don't.

446
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,270
Stay away, please.

447
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,720
I'll get up by myself.

448
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,680
Step back, please.

449
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,160
I'm sorry.

450
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,120
Alright.

451
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,590
If I had known this would happen,

452
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,720
I should've just taken it home to wash.

453
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,790
Comrade Yi,

454
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,200
do you know what I usually call him?

455
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,680
No idea.

456
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,720
Minister Wen?

457
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,680
Scholar.

458
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,810
A man of both pen and sword.

459
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,050
He can swim in rivers

460
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,250
and even climb trees.

461
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,750
Look—

462
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,730
bayberries.

463
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,000
I've never had such good bayberries.

464
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,050
And someone said...

465
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,030
they're sour.

466
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,480
These aren't for you.

467
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,880
Are they sour?

468
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,920
Eyes on the road.

469
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,110
I got it.

470
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,830
Don't you trust my driving?

471
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,870
By the way,

472
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,310
Scholar,

473
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,400
aren't your feet wet?

474
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,040
Why don't you

475
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,830
take off your shoes and dry them?

476
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,160
No one will laugh at you.

477
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,270
Ah, I see—

478
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,920
you're worried about

479
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,510
stinking up Ms. Yi, right?

480
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,300
Eyes on the road!

481
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,560
It's late and dark.

482
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,830
Someone's like a nagging wife,

483
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,300
even pinching me.

484
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,830
Quite strong.

485
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,640
Ouch!

486
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,510
That hurts!

487
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,160
Secretary Zhao, you sing so well.

488
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,200
Thank you.

489
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,100
Sing us another song, please.

490
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,920
Well, I'll really sing then.

491
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,270
Be careful not to lure the wolves out.

492
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,030
This road is rough. Let's go slowly.

493
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,070
Comrade Yi,

494
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,790
we soldiers aren't that particular.

495
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,790
Minister Wen's place

496
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,720
is even plainer.

497
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,750
You call this nice house plain?

498
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,080
Please.

499
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,990
Come in.

500
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,310
Look.

501
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,810
Quite fancy, isn't it?

502
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,510
Wen.

503
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,110
Scholar.

504
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,880
Look who's

505
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,030
here.

506
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,850
Minister Wen.

507
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,510
Welcome.

508
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,370
Please come in.

509
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,830
I brought some flowers.

510
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,350
Should we put them in water?

511
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,880
Sure. Do you have a vase?

512
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,270
A vase? Yes.

513
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,650
Hurry, find one.

514
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,110
This one will do.

515
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,140
Oh right.

516
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,120
And this one too.

517
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,070
Which looks better?

518
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,510
Back when we were in the army,

519
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,310
we often used this for flowers.

520
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,310
Let's use this one instead.

521
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,830
This one?

522
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,310
Good.

523
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,960
Let me do it.

524
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,110
I'll go to the kitchen

525
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,110
and take care of this.

526
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,030
Thanks, Zhao.

527
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,480
Without a woman in the house,

528
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,350
he just muddles through everything.

529
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,270
We'll make do.

530
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,690
Hurry.

531
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,320
Alright.

532
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,220
Come in, please.

533
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,640
Should I help in the kitchen?

534
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,480
No, no, no.

535
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,240
The kitchen is too small.

536
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,720
Can't fit that many people.

537
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Please have a seat.

538
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,370
Okay.

539
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,920
Is this where you usually work?

540
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,120
Yes, this is my study.

541
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,110
Have a seat.

542
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,480
Shall we listen to a record?

543
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,830
Sure.

544
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,990
Rachmaninoff?

545
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,110
Yes.

546
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,480
Are you okay?

547
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,070
I'm sorry.

548
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,040
Are you alright?

549
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,200
It seems your chair doesn't welcome me.

550
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
How could that be?

551
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,210
Are you okay?

552
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,230
I'm fine.

553
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,350
Well,

554
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,550
sit over here instead.

555
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,750
This chair is sturdy.

556
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,610
You have so many books.

557
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:17,820
Yes,

558
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
my personal collection.

559
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,940
Is this bookshelf sturdy?

560
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
Of course it is.

561
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,200
I'm sorry.

562
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,200
I should have

563
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,030
thrown the chair away long ago.

564
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,510
I thought I could fix it
and use it a bit longer.

565
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,670
Look, it's even given you trauma.

566
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,830
You know,

567
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,880
my childhood dream was to have many books

568
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,880
so I could read whichever one I wanted.

569
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,200
When I was little,
I thought that just having books to read

570
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
would be the happiest thing.

571
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,680
Yes,

572
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,000
of course it would be.

573
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,810
Did you buy all these books
after coming to Shanghai?

574
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,790
No,

575
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,720
well,

576
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,480
these thick ones on top

577
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:03,990
were

578
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,290
bought in Shanghai.

579
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,350
The ones at the bottom
were all brought from the army.

580
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,270
You carried books
even when you were in the army?

581
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,270
It became a habit.

582
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,240
From the very first day I enlisted,

583
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,000
I always stuffed
a few books in my backpack.

584
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,850
Let me get you some tea.

585
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,400
Thank you.

586
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,820
[Jean-Christophe]

587
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,830
This is the newly released

588
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,230
fourth volume of Jean-Christophe, right?

589
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,270
Yes.

590
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,030
This was Zhaoyuan's favorite book
when he was alive.

591
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,360
Sadly, he only made it
to the third volume.

592
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,680
Have some water.

593
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,880
Thanks.

594
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,160
I brought a picture book for Yuanyuan.

595
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,810
Where's Yuanyuan?

596
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,960
The children are playing upstairs.

597
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,420
They'll come down
when it's time for dinner.

598
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
Thank you.

599
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,110
Let's go downstairs
to play with the toy guns.

600
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,570
What do you say, Yuanyuan?

601
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,590
Looks like they're coming down.

602
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,280
Here are our two birthday kids.

603
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,930
Yuanyuan, look who's here.

604
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,300
Hello, Ms. Yi.

605
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,750
Happy birthday to you.

606
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,880
Here, this is my birthday gift for you.

607
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,100
You can read it with Huzi later.

608
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
This is Secretary Zhao's son, Huzi.

609
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,680
It's his birthday too.

610
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Hello, Huzi.

611
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,030
Happy day, Mrs. Yi.

612
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,500
What...

613
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,160
What are you calling her?
Who taught you that?

614
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,050
Um... well...

615
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,270
Who taught you that?

616
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,640
My dad.

617
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,340
When did I ever teach you that?

618
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,510
Don't talk nonsense.

619
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,510
Just call me Ms. Yi.

620
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,030
Yes.

621
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,830
Happy day, Ms. Yi.

622
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,830
Happy birthday to you too.

623
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,400
Changjiang,

624
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,900
this is Ms. Yi Yi.

625
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,590
Hello, Ms. Yi.

626
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,310
Hello.

627
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,790
This is my son, Changjiang.

628
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,920
Hello, Changjiang.

629
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,890
You must be in middle school now, right?

630
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,950
I'm in high school.

631
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,310
I board at school.

632
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,960
My sister stays at kindergarten.

633
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,200
We both come home once every 2 weeks.

634
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,830
Today is my sister's birthday,

635
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,830
so I took a day off.

636
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,410
Right.

637
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,070
I'll take them out to play with toy guns.

638
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,830
Okay, Yuanyuan?

639
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,590
Let's go!

640
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,440
Alright, go have fun.

641
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,680
Slow down.

642
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,440
Ms. Fang's here.

643
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,200
Hangong.

644
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,550
I'm taking the children out to play.

645
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,440
Okay.

646
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,200
Yuanyuan.

647
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,650
Yuanyuan, let me see.

648
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,740
How pretty.

649
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,070
Ms. Fang.

650
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,960
Hello, Chief.

651
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,160
Come here.

652
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,330
Louder—greet the Chief properly.

653
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
Hello, Chief.

654
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Hello, Ms. Chang.

655
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,480
Ms. Fang,

656
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,920
I need to talk to you.

657
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,470
Let's go to the study.

658
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,720
Come.

659
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,760
Okay.

660
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,720
Chang,

661
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,390
go help in the kitchen,

662
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,810
wash some vegetables and such.

663
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,520
Go on.

664
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,640
Alright.

665
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,410
You must be Ms. Yi.

666
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,550
Let's go to the kitchen together.

667
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,350
Okay.

668
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,440
Ms. Fang,

669
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,270
why did you bring Chang here?

670
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,030
I've already made it clear—

671
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,800
she and I aren't a good match.

672
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,030
Then why did you bring Yi Yi?

673
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,400
What's that supposed to mean?

674
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,440
We had an appointment.

675
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,480
Zhao Hangong and the two of us

676
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,360
decided to celebrate
the kids' birthdays together.

677
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,290
It'll be lively.

678
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,200
Lively?

679
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,440
Really?

680
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,070
That's good then.

681
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,440
You'd better not have
any ulterior motives.

682
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,770
Yi Yi is the kind of woman

683
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,030
you'd best keep your distance from.

684
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,440
Ms. Fang,

685
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,550
you're being too prejudiced against her.

686
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,590
What kind of woman is she?

687
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,270
Alright, let's not argue.

688
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,270
You're not dating her anyway,

689
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,780
right?

690
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,030
Right.

691
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,970
Just promise me.

692
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,080
You can go ahead with your work.

693
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,240
Ms. Yi and I will cook a couple of dishes.

694
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,010
That's very kind of you.

695
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,520
Alright then.

696
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,790
Can you cook?

697
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,070
A little bit.

698
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,080
Then crack a few eggs.

699
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,240
Okay.

700
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,450
Too slow. You need to be faster.

701
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,720
Your hands look so delicate.

702
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,750
You don't do much housework, do you?

703
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,590
Stop cutting.

704
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,200
You might cut yourself.

705
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,840
Your husband must have pampered you.

706
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,120
You're clearly used to being waited on.

707
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Have you ever listened to symphony?

708
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,610
Minister Wen likes it.

709
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I do too.

710
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,240
Like Johann Maninov,

711
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,030
Rachstrausky's waltz—

712
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,030
I can hum them all.

713
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,550
You mean Rachmaninoff

714
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,200
and Johann Strauss?

715
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,070
Yes.

716
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,000
Isn't that what I just told you?

717
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,510
You healthcare workers must have it tough.

718
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,090
How do you know I work at a hospital?

719
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,730
Did Minister Wen tell you?

720
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,030
No.

721
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,680
I see.

722
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,490
You smelled the Lysol on me, right?

723
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,570
Actually, I met Minister Wen on my own.

724
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,720
Director Fang's husband was hospitalized.

725
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,160
Minister Wen came to visit.

726
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,270
That's how we met.

727
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,810
Minister Wen

728
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,420
never mentioned me to you?

729
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,730
No.

730
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,970
That makes sense.

731
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,790
Personal relationships are

732
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,120
not something to discuss with outsiders.

733
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,530
I've heard Director Fang mention you.

734
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,780
To be honest, I feel sorry for you.

735
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,980
If I went through
what you did at your age,

736
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,840
I probably couldn't handle it.

737
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,650
Chang does a beautiful job.

738
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,980
In Minister Wen's kitchen,

739
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,940
she acts like she's in her own home.

740
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,800
Isn't that right, Ms. Yi?

741
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,030
You're not much help standing here.

742
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,320
Let's step outside and talk.

743
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,680
You don't have to.

744
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,010
Dinner's almost ready.

745
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,450
Just stay here.

746
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,830
You can still help out.

747
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,830
It's fine.

748
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,780
Director Fang,

749
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,440
I can go talk with you.

750
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,110
Is there a problem?

751
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,760
Ms. Chang,

752
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
stop for a moment.

753
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,960
Let's talk in the study.

754
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,550
Okay?

755
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,760
You know I'm not well-educated.

756
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,960
Whatever you want to say,
you can say it here.

757
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,560
Your kitchen is so spacious.

758
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,710
I really love kitchens.

759
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,110
I could stay here all day.

760
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,020
I'll wait for you in the study.

761
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,650
Come on.

762
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,030
Actually,

763
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,310
you should know
what I want to talk to you about.

764
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,480
I don't know, Director Fang.

765
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,540
What kind of relationship

766
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,390
do you have

767
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,920
or rather, expect to have

768
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,710
with Minister Wen?

769
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,360
I have no expectations, Director Fang.

770
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
I don't think you quite understand.

771
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,320
Minister Wen's

772
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,110
feelings and marriage

773
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,670
are restricted by many factors.

774
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,670
He cannot do whatever he wants.

775
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,280
Jiang, catch them!

776
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,110
Hangong!

777
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:18,480
Hurry up.

778
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,150
What's going on?

779
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,360
Take them out to play.

780
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,030
Okay.

781
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,880
I'm...

782
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,110
I'm talking about
serious matters here, okay?

783
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,000
Sorry to interrupt you.

784
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,400
Got you!

785
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,110
Where

786
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
was I just now?

787
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,280
You were saying his feelings and marriage

788
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,080
are restricted by many factors,

789
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,070
and he cannot...

790
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,000
Right.

791
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,070
He cannot do whatever he wants.

792
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,590
This isn't just about you

793
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,360
but applies to everyone.

794
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,550
Although you're not a Party member,

795
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,580
I hope you can be more honest.

796
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,110
You've read my diary.

797
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,690
I think I've been completely
honest inside and out.

798
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,780
About your diary,

799
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,870
the organization has
already apologized to you.

800
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,510
Can you please stop dwelling on this?

801
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,970
What I want to say is,

802
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,230
since you've read my diary,

803
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,480
you should understand

804
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,840
I don't have much time or energy

805
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,500
to think about other matters.

806
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,630
I just want to do my job well now

807
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,890
not worry about food and shelter,

808
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,550
and have a relatively stable
creative environment.

809
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,750
That's enough for me.

810
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,110
I don't expect much

811
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
from life.

812
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:26,920
You

813
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,320
don't need to make it hard

814
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,720
for yourself.

815
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,070
At your prime age,

816
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,440
you have the right to enjoy happiness.

817
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,510
The Communist Party
opposes feudal ethical concepts

818
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,670
like widowhood chastity.

819
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,360
Don't mind what Zhou says.

820
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,360
She's still young

821
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,420
and doesn't understand life.

822
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,590
So I hope

823
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,250
you'll start a family
if you meet a suitable man.

824
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,730
I'll keep an eye out for you too.

825
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,190
However,

826
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,020
I hope you can lower your standards a bit.

827
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,090
Thank you, Director Fang.

828
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,320
I hope you'll go back and think it over.

829
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,120
You may go now.

830
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,220
Let's go.

831
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,190
Comrade Chang.

832
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,960
You can call me Huijuan,

833
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,050
or just Juan if you prefer.

834
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,710
That's what everyone calls me.

835
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,840
Comrade Chang,

836
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,750
if I've done anything

837
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,630
that gave you the wrong idea,

838
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,670
I apologize.

839
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,480
I can tell you clearly today

840
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,440
that between us,

841
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,410
there won't be anything
beyond comradeship.

842
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,710
Do you understand?

843
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,480
Director Fang said you liked me

844
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,010
and you agreed to it.

845
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,090
Director Fang misunderstood me.

846
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,000
I never meant it that way.

847
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,070
I know.

848
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,920
My family is poor

849
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,480
and I'm not educated.

850
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,960
But isn't the Communist Party
for the poor?

851
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,400
Would a Communist leader
look down on someone like me?

852
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,670
You're a good comrade

853
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,930
and an excellent medical worker.

854
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,030
I respect you.

855
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,240
I've been working hard to study.

856
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,720
Lately I've been listening to symphonies—

857
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,320
I can even hum it now.

858
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,360
Then tell me,

859
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,610
what do I need to do to be worthy of you?

860
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,760
Comrade Chang,

861
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,280
we live in a new society.

862
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,480
No one should change themselves

863
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,670
just to suit someone else.

864
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,510
Do you understand?

865
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,150
No, that's not it.

866
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,510
You're not being sincere.

867
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,880
If I were educated and cultured,

868
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,930
would you still treat me this way?

869
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
Comrade Chang,

870
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,510
I believe

871
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,980
you'll find

872
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,940
a life partner who truly suits you.

873
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,430
What about Yi Yi then?

874
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,870
She's older than me.

875
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,170
and she's been married before.

876
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,290
She just had a few more
days of education than me.

877
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,560
What do you see in her?

878
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,940
Why are you crying?

879
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,930
Director Fang,

880
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,030
I know Chief Wen doesn't like me.

881
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,630
He likes women like Yi Yi.

882
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,990
Where's Yi Yi?

883
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,880
I sent her away.

884
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,880
Ms. Fang,

885
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,240
what are you doing?

886
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,030
Yi Yi is my invited guest.

887
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,670
She came for the child's birthday.

888
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,840
She didn't even take a single bite.

889
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,320
Do...

890
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,440
Do you think that's appropriate?

891
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,000
Forget about Yi Yi.

892
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,400
Her stubborn personality

893
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,190
and that so-called artist temperament

894
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,480
are all time bombs

895
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,360
in your future relationship.

896
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,900
You don't understand her.

897
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,690
She's not the way you say she is.

898
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,230
Besides, there's nothing like

899
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,030
what you're suggesting between us.

900
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,670
Fine.

901
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,070
Tell me the truth.

902
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,630
Do you have feelings for Yi Yi or not?

903
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,000
If not,

904
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,070
give me your word,

905
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,070
then you can rest assured

906
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,150
that I won't interfere

907
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,680
in Yi Yi's matters anymore.

908
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,710
But one thing—

909
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,300
you cannot...

910
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,440
you cannot lie to me.

911
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,920
Rumei's been gone for years.

912
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,700
Have you ever looked at
any other woman this way?

913
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,710
You think I don't know
what's on your mind?

914
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,110
I just don't understand.

915
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,570
What's so good about Yi Yi?

916
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,890
You two are completely incompatible.

917
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,380
Well, intellectuals have one good quality:

918
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,390
they care about reputation.

919
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,640
I've already

920
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,840
made things

921
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,480
completely clear to her.

922
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,670
Yi Yi knows what to do.

923
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,700
What did you say to her?

924
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,010
Madam,

925
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,200
is dinner ready?

926
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,600
I'm hungry.

927
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,230
Come in.

928
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,540
Ms. Yi.

929
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,120
Stayed up late again?

930
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,590
I heard

931
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,550
the light in your room

932
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,110
was on all night yesterday.

933
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:21,930
Oh right,

934
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,300
I forgot.

935
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,180
You don't like being supervised.

936
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,400
It's fine.

937
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,330
Do you need something?

938
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,280
There's an urgent task.

939
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,060
Our city has an upcoming
foreign affairs event.

940
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,230
Some important
foreign guests will attend,

941
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,090
along with foreign journalists.

942
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,030
The city leaders require

943
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,000
every cadre at the event

944
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,280
to wear a suit.

945
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,840
But there aren't any ready-made ones.

946
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,300
They must be custom-made.

947
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,000
The city leadership

948
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,710
has mobilized all technicians

949
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,070
and designers in the city.

950
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,190
Our workshop has been
assigned some work too.

951
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,720
Here's the personnel list.

952
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,000
Ms. Su,

953
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,640
I've never made men's clothing.

954
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,380
