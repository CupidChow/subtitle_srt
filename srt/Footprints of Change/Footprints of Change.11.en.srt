00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,440
This area looks good.

192
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,370
It's very clean.

193
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,120
This side too.

194
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,390
Come on, I need two people over here.

195
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,230
This is the old house where I grew up.

196
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
It was once the Lin family residence

197
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,290
and my aunt's hospital.

198
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,630
It's also where I work

199
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,120
and live now.

200
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,550
Now they want me to leave.

201
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,710
My last refuge

202
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,090
will soon be gone too.

203
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,010
Where can I go?

204
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,040
Do I really have to leave?

205
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,160
Will Zhaoyuan be able
to find me when he returns?

206
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,630
No.

207
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,650
I must stay in Shanghai.

208
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,450
[Ms. Yi, please move out
as soon as possible.]

209
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,060
I have nothing to worry about anyway.

210
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,670
Worst case,
I'll jump into the Huangpu River.

211
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,800
My wife and children

212
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
don't run any factories

213
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,480
and aren't capitalists.

214
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,680
The state will have to take care of them.

215
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,750
Go ahead and jump.

216
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,320
Who are you trying to scare?

217
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,440
Fan.

218
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,060
Yang.

219
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,010
Sit down.

220
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,160
Mind your attitude.

221
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,760
We didn't come here today

222
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,390
to argue, right?

223
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,070
Let's hear what Minister Wen has to say.

224
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,840
Mr. Fan.

225
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,270
I remember during the Five-Anti Campaign,

226
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,070
because of the back taxes issue,

227
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,790
you threatened to jump off a building.

228
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,840
That was Shanghai's tallest building.

229
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,720
I recall the police even came.

230
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,140
You remember that, don't you?

231
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,120
I don't remember.

232
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,920
I don't remember, Minister Wen.

233
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,830
Minister Wen.

234
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,600
You're a reasonable person.

235
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,000
I came from poverty.

236
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,480
I've worked hard my whole life

237
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,080
to finally gain some assets.

238
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,390
And now

239
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,670
you want public-private partnerships.

240
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,000
I just can't accept it.

241
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,920
Stop making excuses.

242
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,090
Where did your wealth come from?

243
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,600
From exploiting workers.

244
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,440
Now we're liberated.

245
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,200
You need to change your thinking

246
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,550
and earn your own living.

247
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,450
Public-private partnership

248
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,410
is the inevitable trend

249
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,830
and it's also providing a way out for you.

250
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,750
I might as well jump off a building then.

251
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,390
Jump!

252
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,320
You just won't listen to reason, will you?

253
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,910
Fan!

254
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,670
Yang Xue'an!

255
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,870
What are you doing?

256
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,330
I invited everyone here today

257
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,910
to speak freely.

258
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,440
We can't label people

259
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,970
just because they have different opinions.

260
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,960
Mr. Fan,

261
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
please calm down.

262
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:34,590
Come.

263
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,730
Please have a seat.

264
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,170
I've invited you all here today

265
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,670
to speak freely.

266
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,390
Don't hold anything back.

267
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,600
Share whatever thoughts you have.

268
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,360
Our policy

269
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,000
toward national capitalists like you

270
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,360
is to adopt a moderate,

271
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,310
compensated buyout approach.

272
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,670
It fully considers everyone's interests.

273
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,210
You can all think about it.

274
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,060
Comparing your business operations

275
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,320
and profits

276
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,630
in old China and in New China,

277
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,210
which period has been better for you?

278
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,940
New China is certainly better.

279
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,820
The Communist Party is good.

280
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,120
Before liberation,

281
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,440
the KMT made a mess of things.

282
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,370
It was impossible to make a living.

283
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,570
I support Minister Wen.

284
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,960
What does everyone think?

285
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,870
Yes, we support Minister Wen.

286
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,730
We support him.

287
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,010
I've invited everyone here today

288
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,700
because I hope

289
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,720
you'll all express your thoughts.

290
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,880
We'll solve each issue one by one

291
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,140
and implement solutions step by step

292
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,870
to give everyone peace of mind.

293
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,000
Minister Wen, this way please.

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,530
Mr. Fu, you've got a new car?

295
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes, Minister Wen.

296
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,120
To be honest with you,

297
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,200
this is the latest model,

298
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,090
the only one in all of Shanghai.

299
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,500
I can lend it to you for a few days,

300
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,480
so you can try it out.

301
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,870
Lend it to me for a few days?

302
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,160
Are you trying to bribe me?

303
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,210
No, no, not at all.

304
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,200
I heard you were in the military before

305
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,550
and really enjoyed driving.

306
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,480
It's just a loan,

307
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,320
not a gift.

308
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,550
Mr. Fu, you're very well-informed.

309
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,630
Who told you I can drive?

310
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,720
I forgot.

311
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,200
Fine.

312
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,120
I'll treat you to dinner sometime.

313
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,330
Seems you need to get to know me better.

314
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,630
Goodbye.

315
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,030
Minister Wen, let me see you out.

316
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,670
I won't lend it anymore.

317
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,270
Minister Wen! Minister Wen!

318
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,349
Yi! Yi!

319
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
Did you tear this?

320
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,810
Yes, I did.

321
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,690
You're so bold.

322
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,960
Who told you to tear it?

323
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,890
I'm not leaving.

324
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,680
Don't talk about it here.

325
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Let's go to my place to talk.

326
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,480
Hurry.

327
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,290
I just escorted two officials out.

328
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,350
If they won't let you stay, then move out.

329
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,220
I have so many vacant villas.

330
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,770
You can stay in any of them.

331
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,180
Zihe.

332
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,790
You're a CPPCC Municipal Committee member.

333
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,920
A leader
of the Industry and Commerce Association.

334
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,320
You...

335
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,350
Don't talk here.

336
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,400
Let's go inside to talk.

337
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,110
Hurry up.

338
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,590
You're too impulsive.

339
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,640
Calm down.

340
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,240
Didn't you say
Mayor Chen thinks highly of you?

341
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,260
Can you help me report this issue?

342
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,270
You really think

343
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,480
my words carry any weight

344
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,240
with those high-ranking officials?

345
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,000
Let me tell you.

346
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Not just me.

347
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,240
Even the most prestigious
business tycoons in Shanghai

348
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
couldn't help you

349
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
with this matter.

350
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,070
Isn't the Communist Party
supposed to serve the people?

351
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,470
Am I not one of the people?

352
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,720
That portrait
you painted for me last time, I...

353
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,720
What are you doing?

354
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,510
The staff downstairs
told me to move everything out.

355
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,720
It's too early for that.

356
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,790
Go tell your supervisors downstairs

357
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,720
that we haven't finished our business yet.

358
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,120
We're not moving out now.

359
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,150
We'll move according to schedule.

360
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you.

361
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,000
Thank you.

362
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,160
See that?

363
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,640
So jumpy.

364
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,890
Scared me to death.

365
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,970
Let me analyze this for you.

366
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,070
Me, a capitalist.

367
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,480
Zhaoyuan,
a reactionary government official.

368
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,510
You, a petty bourgeois.

369
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,570
You know
what petty bourgeois means, right?

370
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,960
A petty bourgeois intellectual.

371
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,380
Originally, you belonged
to the common people.

372
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,960
But unfortunately,

373
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,070
you happen to be the wife
of a KMT official.

374
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,270
That changes everything.

375
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,680
So you've become

376
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,960
distanced from the people.

377
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,820
I've heard Mayor Chen's reports.

378
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,970
He's a learned and capable man.

379
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,720
I don't believe they would
practice guilt by association.

380
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,680
Mayor Chen

381
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,740
is certainly an outstanding leader.

382
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,270
Including the one
who came to our club today,

383
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,310
Minister Wen.

384
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,330
They are all excellent officials.

385
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,270
The key issue is the people
implementing policies below them.

386
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,310
Their abilities vary greatly,
as you've seen.

387
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,880
You said Minister Wen is a good official?

388
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,680
Yes.

389
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,130
Where does he work?

390
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,170
I'll go find him.

391
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,110
Forget it.

392
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,160
Minister Wen
is such a high-ranking official.

393
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,400
How would he have time
to personally handle your small matter?

394
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,070
He would definitely
delegate it to his subordinates.

395
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,640
I still want to try.

396
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,400
Yi, please listen to me.

397
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,590
Leave Shanghai as soon as possible.

398
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,610
I have investments
in both Hong Kong and Singapore.

399
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,030
You won't get rich there,

400
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,110
but you'll have enough

401
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,440
to live comfortably.

402
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,080
I'm not leaving.

403
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
I appreciate your kindness.

404
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,110
But I need to stay here
and wait for news from Zhaoyuan.

405
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,310
To protect our country,

406
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,110
[August 1937, Shanghai suburbs]

407
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,880
to protect our loved ones,

408
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,400
today,

409
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,370
we're heading to the battlefield.

410
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,350
We might go to battle today

411
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,750
and not return tomorrow.

412
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,480
But as soldiers,

413
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,000
as sons of China,

414
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,630
we face death without fear.

415
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,080
I once personally
sent Zhaoyuan to the battlefield.

416
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,200
[August 1945, Chongqing]

417
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,060
Before he left,

418
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
he promised he would return.

419
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,000
And he kept his promise.

420
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,590
After the victory,

421
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,670
we reunited in Chongqing.

422
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,560
Yi!

423
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,750
Yi!

424
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,920
Zhaoyuan!

425
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,240
Afterwards,

426
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,590
we got married soon.

427
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,490
He told me then,

428
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,030
we would never be apart again.

429
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:40,920
Let's go take a look.

430
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,720
Wait a moment.

431
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,110
Mrs. Zhou.

432
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,020
Please have a seat.

433
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,510
Could you take another photo for us?

434
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,200
Sure.

435
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,270
Listen for my count.

436
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,680
3, 2, 1.

437
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,920
Smile!

438
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,750
Later,

439
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,440
he went on a mission.

440
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,590
The last time we met...

441
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,680
Zhaoyuan promised me

442
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that he would definitely come back.

443
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,010
I will wait for him here.

444
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,030
Yi.

445
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,000
Zhaoyuan has been missing for five years.

446
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,840
Five years.

447
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,140
If he were still alive,

448
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,170
no matter where he is,

449
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,370
he would have found a way to contact you.

450
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,480
Stop waiting.

451
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,270
Look at the state you're in.

452
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,070
I can't bear to see you like this.

453
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,920
Until I see his body,

454
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,010
I believe he's still alive.

455
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,160
I'll manage to get by.

456
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,720
[Shanghai Municipal People's Government]

457
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,270
Qing.

458
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,920
I wouldn't come to you
unless absolutely necessary.

459
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,200
Let's not talk here.

460
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,450
Yi Yi, why are you coming to me?

461
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,840
I want to ask

462
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,960
if you have any news about your brother.

463
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,220
I don't have a brother.

464
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,980
Even if you don't want to acknowledge it,

465
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,960
your records

466
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,160
will always show Zhou Zhaoyuan's name.

467
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,880
Who do you think you are?

468
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,000
What right do you
have to come to me?

469
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,960
Without you people,

470
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,070
my life would be peaceful.

471
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,160
Qing.

472
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,550
You know your brother as well as I do.

473
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,010
He has noble character

474
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,550
and is a hero
who fought against Japanese invasion.

475
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,680
He's not a bad person.

476
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,410
I never said he was a bad person.

477
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,590
You came to me

478
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,120
just to make me
feel miserable, didn't you?

479
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,920
Who are you looking for?

480
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,080
I'm here to report
a situation to the supervisor.

481
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,140
Here are my documents.

482
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,310
Come in.

483
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,180
My surname is Fang.

484
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,000
This is Mr. Yang.

485
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,240
He's also in charge of Fu Zihe's company.

486
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,640
He handles your case too.

487
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,010
You can discuss your matters with him.

488
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,040
Please sit down.

489
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,750
The union suddenly
notified me of my dismissal.

490
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,880
I don't understand.

491
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,660
I need an explanation.

492
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,590
About your situation,

493
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,140
the organization is aware of it.

494
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,070
However,

495
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,080
with the merger and restructuring

496
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,810
of the plant,

497
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
personnel changes are inevitable.

498
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,750
You don't need to worry too much.

499
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,400
Right?

500
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,930
Besides, someone like you...

501
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,640
What kind of person am I?

502
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,590
As the wife of a KMT official,

503
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,270
you're not short of money, are you?

504
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,880
You can live well without working.

505
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,810
What's the rush?

506
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,350
Although my husband
worked for the Nationalist government,

507
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,810
he was an honest official.

508
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,070
We don't own a house.

509
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,270
We've always been renting.

510
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,530
And we have no savings.

511
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,480
I've been working
ever since he disappeared.

512
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,720
Now you're taking away
my opportunity to work,

513
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,880
making me homeless

514
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,410
and unemployed, is that it?

515
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,670
I understand your concerns.

516
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,200
But Shanghai now

517
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,800
doesn't lack
intellectuals and technicians.

518
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,480
The Northwest needs people.

519
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,550
My personal suggestion is

520
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,160
that you

521
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,540
go work as a technician
at the wool mill in the Northwest.

522
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,670
How does that sound?

523
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,550
You want to drive me out of Shanghai?

524
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,030
Comrade Fang.

525
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,960
Let me ask you again.

526
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,290
What kind of person am I?

527
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,800
Am I not an intellectual?

528
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,280
Am I not someone
your Communist Party claims to unite with?

529
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,070
Even if my husband

530
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,640
once worked
for the Nationalist government.

531
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,510
But he was an honest official
and an anti-Japanese hero.

532
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,750
You don't get to decide who's a hero.

533
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,350
My husband nearly died.

534
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,000
The bullet is still in his body.

535
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,650
How dare you say he's not a hero?

536
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,750
If you keep pestering me...

537
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,790
-I won’t talk to you.
-You must apologize to my husband.

538
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,510
Why should I apologize?

539
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,200
Apologize!

540
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,160
Calm down.

541
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,680
Everyone calm down.

542
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,750
Ms. Yi.

543
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,400
Don't be so agitated.

544
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,510
Sit down.

545
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,120
Have a seat.

546
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,750
We truly don't know much

547
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,570
about your husband.

548
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,880
If he really is an anti-Japanese hero,

549
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,260
then I'll formally apologize
on behalf of the organization.

550
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,430
I want him to apologize.

551
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,880
Why should I apologize to you?

552
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,790
Listen to me.

553
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,430
But you and your husband
are separate matters.

554
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,160
Sending you to work in the Northwest

555
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,640
was just a suggestion from Mr. Yang.

556
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,690
You should trust
the Party and the organization.

557
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,250
You don't need to say more.

558
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,590
If you can't resolve this,

559
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,200
I'll go to your superiors.

560
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,270
If your superiors can't solve it,

561
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,590
I'll go to Mayor Chen.

562
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,660
If Mayor Chen won't see me,

563
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,060
then I'll go to Beijing.

564
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,320
I'll find Premier Zhou and Chairman Mao.

565
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,060
There must be someone
who will listen to reason.

566
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,420
Yi Yi, are you crazy?

567
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,440
Do you know where you are?

568
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,000
How dare you talk to Mr. Yang like that?

569
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,790
He's very fierce.

570
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,140
He will really arrest people.

571
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,610
But they shouldn't
talk about your brother like that.

572
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,760
Even then, it's not okay.

573
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,350
It's not okay.

574
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,070
Come in.

575
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,500
Excuse me.

576
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,060
Are you Director Fang's supervisor?

577
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,960
Yes, I am.

578
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,140
Here are my documents.

579
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,340
Please have a seat.

580
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,440
Please sit down.

581
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,350
May I sit?

582
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,750
Of course.

583
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,030
You're an artist,

584
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,530
a national talent.

585
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,170
Have some water.

586
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,310
Thank you.

587
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,660
Director Fang told me
about your situation.

588
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,110
So you know

589
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,170
they want to drive me out of Shanghai?

590
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,240
I think you've misunderstood them.

591
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,900
No one wants to drive you away.

592
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,590
Professionals like you,

593
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,570
especially

594
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,350
female professionals,

595
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,590
are highly valued.

596
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,960
Mr. Yang was just making a suggestion.

597
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,880
You see,

598
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,200
Shanghai is China's largest city.

599
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,080
It was already overcrowded
before Liberation.

600
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,620
Having too many excellent talents
like you concentrated here...

601
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,770
I just want to ask

602
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,590
if my husband wasn't an official
of the Nationalist government,

603
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,240
would you treat me this way?

604
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,400
This matter has nothing
to do with your husband.

605
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,240
We know that

606
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,640
although your husband was an official
of the Nationalist government,

607
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
he repeatedly

608
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,430
distinguished himself in battle
during the war against Japan.

609
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,090
He's a hero of the resistance,

610
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,270
a man worthy of respect.

611
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,100
After Japan's surrender,

612
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,560
he has no record of misconduct.

613
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,410
Thank you for saying that.

614
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,340
My husband is currently missing.

615
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,350
I'm waiting for him in Shanghai.

616
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,160
Don't worry.

617
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,270
No one will force you to leave Shanghai.

618
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,510
Are these your paintings?

619
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,160
Yes.

620
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,640
But have you considered?

621
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,920
What if...

622
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,030
I mean, hypothetically speaking,

623
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,690
if you were to leave Shanghai,

624
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,960
perhaps your artistic career

625
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,960
could expand significantly.

626
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,790
You don't understand what Shanghai

627
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,310
means to me at all.

628
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,970
All my happiness and suffering

629
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,960
are deeply connected to this city.

630
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,790
Indeed.

631
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,870
People like you

632
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,190
could never understand.

633
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,720
Where is Mayor Chen's office?

634
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,390
I need to see him.

635
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,930
Mayor Chen is away on business.

636
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,730
Then I'll wait for him to return.

637
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,180
I'll wait for justice.

638
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,000
Comrade Su.

639
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,330
I heard you had an argument with Mr. Yang.

640
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,680
Yes.

641
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,680
You're quite brave.

642
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,070
The organization knows
you have no relatives in Shanghai.

643
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,440
But arranging a new job for you

644
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,830
will take some time.

645
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,920
If you have any financial difficulties,

646
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,200
you can always
ask the organization for help.

647
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,800
I appreciate your kindness.

648
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,550
Yang.

649
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,150
Director.

650
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,510
I heard that you at the meeting

651
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,970
slammed the table
and argued with Minister Wen.

652
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,680
In front of so many people,

653
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,000
that was really inappropriate.

654
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,500
Yes.

655
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,010
Apologize.

656
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,130
Apologize to Minister Wen.

657
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,030
Minister.

658
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,040
At that time,

659
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,910
my words were inappropriate

660
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,650
and my behavior was excessive.

661
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,810
I apologize to you.

662
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,550
I'm sorry.

663
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,590
However,

664
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:26,870
Minister,

665
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,770
according to some union comrades,

666
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,720
these illegal capitalists

667
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,240
are showing signs of fleeing abroad.

668
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,820
They will likely transfer their funds.

669
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,960
If we don't stop them,

670
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,420
there will definitely be serious problems.

671
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,770
Transferring funds and fleeing abroad?

672
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Who are they?

673
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,510
As far as I know,

674
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,400
Fu Zihe, Mr. Fu,

675
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,160
Sun Wenjie, Mr. Sun,

676
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,550
Liang Wei, Mr. Liang,

677
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,030
Yang Liye, Mr. Yang,

678
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,110
and other bosses.

679
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,640
Is this information accurate?

680
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,500
As far as I know,

681
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,780
it is accurate.

682
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,720
You said union comrades told you this.

683
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,110
Which union comrades?

684
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,200
Some

685
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,820
union comrades reported it.

686
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,980
As for who exactly,

687
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,540
I don't recall.

688
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,150
Such an important matter,

689
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,929
how could you not remember?

690
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,080
How about this, Yang?

691
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,150
You should go to the union

692
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,110
and get them to clear it up.

693
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,960
Find out who said this

694
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,880
and get all the details.

695
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:23,510
Okay.

696
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,560
Minister.

697
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,969
I'll get to work now.

698
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,710
Did you see that?

699
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,110
Yang's prejudice against capitalists

700
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,639
is deeply ingrained in him.

701
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,780
He's not suitable
for his current position.

702
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,500
We should replace him
with a more experienced comrade.

703
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,710
That's a bit much.

704
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,200
Comrade Yang has a firm political stance.

705
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,150
He's also well-versed in theory.

706
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,010
He's quite suitable for this job.

707
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,670
During the Five-Anti Campaign,

708
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,470
he made such radical statements

709
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,760
that provoked some capitalists

710
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,830
and nearly caused a tragedy.

711
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,190
I can see that he

712
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,220
hasn't learned his lesson at all.

713
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,020
He had just transferred
from the military back then.

714
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,230
He was not familiar

715
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,120
with local government work

716
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,740
and had no experience.

717
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,800
He's much more experienced now.

718
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,150
But I know

719
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,550
his problem is that

720
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,030
he's too serious

721
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,480
and gets caught up in details.

722
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,760
But I think this kind of dedication

723
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,320
is actually good

724
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,570
and should be encouraged.

725
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,510
I know

726
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,360
you and the chief

727
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,110
both think highly of him.

728
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,920
Yes,

729
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,230
the bond between those two

730
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,440
was forged
through life-threatening situations.

731
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,760
Back when he had
just transferred to civilian work,

732
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,510
I told the local comrades:

733
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,250
This very man,

734
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,920
this passionate young man
who had never held a gun before,

735
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,440
saved the chief's life
on the battlefield.

736
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,710
The local comrades couldn't believe it.

737
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,400
So,

738
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,710
Pu,

739
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,280
don't underestimate young comrade Yang.

740
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,240
He truly has no selfish motives.

741
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,200
He is someone

742
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,590
who would sacrifice

743
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,710
his own life
for the revolution, a good cadre.

744
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,590
Look, even when
his mother was seriously ill,

745
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,050
he stayed at his post
and continued working.

746
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,440
What could you possibly

747
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,590
criticize about such a good comrade?

748
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,760
Ms. Fang,

749
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:35,670
work attitude and work ability
are two different concepts.

750
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,070
I think if you and the chief

751
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,870
truly want what's best for Yang,

752
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,110
you should send him
to factories and villages,

753
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,970
to train at the grassroots level.

754
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,920
His current position of authority

755
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,050
will actually harm him in the long run.

756
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,500
When you first joined
the revolutionary work,

757
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,150
you weren't as mature
and experienced as you are now.

758
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,400
Didn't you also grow step by step?

759
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,420
Our Party's cadres

760
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,280
are all cultivated
through practical experience.

761
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,490
You need to help him properly.

762
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,110
This isn't coming from me.

763
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,590
Chief Yan said so.

764
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,440
Alright.

765
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,150
Come to our home for dinner tonight.

766
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,280
I can't tonight.

767
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,880
I need to find Fu Zihe
and have a talk with him.

768
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,880
Yang has offended him,

769
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,770
and I need to clean up the mess.

770
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,780
Alright then, I'll be going now.

771
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,450
I'll visit Chief Yan another day.

772
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,280
Help him out.

773
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,480
Excuse me.

774
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,610
May I come in?

775
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,340
Did you paint
those pictures in the hallway?

776
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:08,920
Yes.

777
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,710
I'm really curious.

778
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,400
Your landscapes

779
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,830
have influences
from French Impressionist painters

780
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,900
like Monet.

781
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,850
But your figure paintings,

782
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,190
especially this one of the female worker,

783
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,520
also show influences from Soviet Realism

784
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,010
like Repin.

785
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,920
How did you manage
to incorporate both styles?

786
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,730
Repin was my husband's favorite painter.

787
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,630
He introduced me to his work.

788
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,670
I see.

789
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,920
Your husband

790
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,960
was a man of taste.

791
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,840
I'm guessing this piece,

792
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,150
by Rachmaninoff,

793
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,080
was also your husband's favorite?

794
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,000
Yes,

795
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,660
he loved Soviet Russian culture.

796
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,400
That's nice.

797
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,410
By the way,

798
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,000
regarding your husband's case,

799
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,920
the relevant authorities
are investigating.

800
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,230
I believe there will be results soon.

801
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,510
Thank you.

802
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,850
I didn't realize you appreciated art.

803
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,580
I apologize for my rudeness

804
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,110
earlier.

805
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,350
It's alright.

806
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,450
That's normal.

807
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,800
Because

808
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,590
you

809
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,280
don't know us.

810
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,230
Well.

811
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,230
I won't disturb you anymore.

812
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,230
Please continue.

813
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,110
Goodbye.

814
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,000
Goodbye.
