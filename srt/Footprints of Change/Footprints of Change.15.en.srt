00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,770
[Episode 15]

3
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,070
Thank you.

4
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,480
You're welcome.

5
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,850
What's your name, little girl?

6
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,400
My name is Yuanyuan, meaning
aid to North Korea against the U.S.

7
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,430
How old are you?

8
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,030
I'm 5 years old.

9
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,640
Where are your parents?

10
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,070
My dad is working.

11
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,630
I'm playing by myself.

12
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,530
Good girl.

13
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,190
Don't make any noise.

14
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,680
Take her home first.

15
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,070
I'll be there shortly.

16
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,870
Minister Wen.

17
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,490
Ms. Yi.

18
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,720
Yuanyuan.

19
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,630
Daddy.

20
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,130
Is this your daughter?

21
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,100
Yes, she is.

22
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,590
Did you say hello to the lady?

23
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,280
She did.

24
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,810
Yuanyuan, let's go home.

25
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,130
Daddy, I want a sketchbook.

26
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,210
A sketchbook? Okay.

27
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,210
I'll give you one.

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,240
That won't do.

29
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,800
This doesn't count as a bribe, right?

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,910
According to our rules,

31
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,170
this counts as a bribe.

32
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Let's go home first.

33
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,640
I'll bring you a sketchbook
when I come back, okay?

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,430
Okay, go home with me first.

35
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,440
Your daughter is adorable.

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,240
Your wife must have
such a noble character.

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,750
When Yuanyuan was too young to understand,

38
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,080
her mother passed away.

39
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,120
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,000
It's nothing.

41
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,400
Good.

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,440
This is the newly released

43
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,160
Jean-Christophe, Volume 4,

44
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,780
right?

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,960
This was Zhaoyuan's favorite book
when he was alive,

46
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,490
but unfortunately he only read up
to Volume 3.

47
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,290
Regarding Comrade Zhaoyuan,

48
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,030
I have something to give you.

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,610
Would you mind sitting for a while?

50
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,710
Of course not.

51
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,440
Here.

52
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,640
I know

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,290
this is somewhat cruel,

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,400
but I think it's necessary for you
to know about

55
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
the cause Comrade Zhaoyuan fought for.

56
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,870
These are

57
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,540
Comrade Zhaoyuan's interrogation records

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,620
and his final letter we found.

59
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,010
He loved you deeply.

60

[Pocket]

61
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,020
[This is the book Comrade Zhaoyuan read
when he was alive]

62
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,250
How long has it been?

63
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,430
Half an hour.

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,060
That long already?

65
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,870
When will the power come back?

66
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,159
Can you fix this problem?

67
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,290
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

68
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,990
I couldn't find the matches.

69
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,600
Comrade Zhou,

70
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,440
I'd like to discuss something with you.

71
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,830
I want to

72
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,740
take our relationship

73
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,610
to the next level,

74
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,600
a romantic one.

75
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,760
That's so sudden.

76
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,560
I need to think about it.

77
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,140
Okay.

78
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,480
I'll think with you.

79
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,600
Think about it now?

80
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,000
Why do you like me?

81
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,730
Because I'm a martyr's family member?

82
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,240
Not just that.

83
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,630
I've summarized two reasons.

84
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,830
First,

85
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,030
before Comrade Zhaoyuan's identity
was revealed,

86
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,750
you were able to draw a clear line

87
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,870
and work hard

88
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,800
to overcome difficulties.

89
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,560
I really admire it.

90
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,680
Second,

91
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,010
I think you're a kind person.

92
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,010
From my observations during this time,

93
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,560
I see you care about the people
and environment around you.

94
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,240
Some time ago,

95
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,580
when I was working frantically,

96
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,560
one night

97
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,560
I was on the verge of breaking down.

98
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,310
It was you

99
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,180
who brought me dinner.

100
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,600
You know what?

101
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,230
That meal you cook

102
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,530
was the most delicious one

103
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,000
I've ever had.

104
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,020
That was just cafeteria food.

105
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,720
Mr. Yang.

106
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,720
Sorry, we had another power outage.

107
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,830
Why is it always you?

108
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,030
Straighten your hat.

109
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,010
Straighten your hat.

110
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,080
Why do you always have power outages
at times like this?

111
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,270
I don't understand.

112
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,200
Let me tell you.

113
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,549
This is the most

114
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,630
difficult time for work.

115
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,830
Why do problems always happen with you?

116
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,670
You... let me tell you...

117
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,200
Look around.

118
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,750
Mr. Yang.

119
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,440
-Who is as fat as you?
-Mr. Yang.

120
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,030
Sir, thank you.

121
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,910
You can go first.

122
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,910
Excuse me, Mr. Yang.

123
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,480
Yes.

124
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,560
Could you stop getting angry all the time?

125
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,490
It's a bit scary.

126
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,880
Comrade Zhou.

127
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,270
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,670
But

129
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,550
what just happened makes me
even more certain

130
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,670
that you are a warm

131
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,130
and kind person.

132
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,840
Just now,

133
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,120
you were able to help that electrician

134
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,270
get out of trouble.

135
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,200
You know,

136
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,200
if you hadn't interrupted,

137
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,200
that man would have been in danger.

138
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,930
Your smile is beautiful.

139
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,030
I have canine teeth.

140
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,910
I'll take that answer as a yes,

141
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,280
Comrade Zhou.

142
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,250
Let's make progress together.

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,840
This is the evaluation list

144
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,970
that our department

145
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,600
is preparing to submit.

146
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,840
Four people meet the requirements

147
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,270
for years of service
and political criteria.

148
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,730
Here are their background check materials.

149
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,870
This list seems quite biased.

150
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,440
You mean Yang?

151
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,110
I think with his experience,

152
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,670
he should have been promoted long ago.

153
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,000
Let's leave it to the Party Committee
to discuss and decide.

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,470
I've asked all the committee members.

155
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,250
They have no objections.

156
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,050
You're the only one
who hasn't given your opinion.

157
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,600
I know

158
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
you're prejudiced against Yang,

159
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,080
right?

160
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,880
It's not prejudice.

161
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,170
It's criticism.

162
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,440
I really don't understand.

163
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,550
You're so patient with those capitalists,

164
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,270
wealthy ladies,

165
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,840
and petty bourgeoisie

166
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,440
and can see their strengths.

167
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,750
Why are you so harsh only on Yang?

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,790
Why?

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,510
Because he's not a capitalist.

170
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,000
He's not petty bourgeoisie either.

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,510
He's a member of Communist Party of China.

172
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,080
His every word and action
represents the Party

173
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,210
and the government.

174
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,550
Is it wrong for me to hold him
to higher standards?

175
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,600
Yes, I admit

176
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,440
that Yang can be radical sometimes

177
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,000
and has said some extreme things.

178
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,670
But he's improved a lot now.

179
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,790
For the sake of work,

180
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,150
he wasn't even present
when his mother passed away.

181
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,800
That's exactly what he did wrong.

182
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,000
Why didn't he go back?

183
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,240
Which part of the work here couldn't
function without him?

184
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,030
Then tell me,

185
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,080
among these candidates,

186
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,010
who has performed better than him?

187
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,380
We're selecting talent.

188
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,920
It should put quality before quantity.

189
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,030
We're not just filling quotas.

190
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,870
So you'd rather waste this position

191
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,330
than promote Yang, right?

192
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,390
Let me emphasize again.

193
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,690
I personally have no authority

194
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,630
to decide whether an official
gets promoted or not.

195
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,390
It's up to the Party Committee
to discuss and decide.

196
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,150
But you have the final say, don't you?

197
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,960
Be straightforward.

198
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,560
Do you agree to promote Yang?

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,800
I don't agree.

200
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,760
I've already stated my reasons.

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,030
All right, Ms. Fang.

202
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,290
Have some water first.

203
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,820
[Shanghai Municipal People's Government]

204
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,120
Come in.

205
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,870
Sir,

206
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,480
are you busy?

207
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,260
What is it?

208
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,440
For this department evaluation,

209
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,640
my name is on the list.

210
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,050
This is my personal statement.

211
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,470
I was hoping you could

212
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,860
give me some guidance.

213
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,270
A personal statement should be authentic.

214
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,690
You don't need others' opinions.

215
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,920
Yes.

216
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,230
A personal statement

217
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,920
does require authenticity.

218
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,360
However,

219
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,440
what one himself considers true

220
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,150
often differs from how others see it.

221
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,920
For instance,

222
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,270
last Sunday,

223
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,630
Commissioner Yan

224
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,050
invited me to his home.

225
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,080
He told me a story.

226
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,240
It was about

227
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,480
an ancient minister

228
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,670
who worked tirelessly to help his king

229
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,630
day and night.

230
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,440
Yet he was considered too diligent,

231
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,510
suspected of overstepping his authority.

232
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,790
Not only was he not promoted,

233
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,030
he was demoted

234
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,200
and exiled.

235
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,600
Don't you think

236
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,030
Commissioner Yan's story

237
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,550
is truly sigh-inducing, right?

238
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,360
Commissioner Yan still enjoys

239
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,790
discussing history with young people.

240
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,910
Sir,

241
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,670
I'm here

242
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,270
to

243
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,870
communicate with you

244
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,840
frankly,

245
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,480
so as to help you understand me better

246
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,360
and eliminate any prejudice

247
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,930
or bias you might have.

248
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,790
Please

249
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,090
give me this chance.

250
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,910
You say you want to communicate
frankly with me,

251
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,390
and to have an open dialogue.

252
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,650
But you start by labeling me,

253
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,770
assuming I have prejudice
and bias against you.

254
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,550
Do you expect me to wear this label

255
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,880
while talking with you?

256
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,200
Sir, am I

257
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,790
wrong?

258
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,840
Of course you are.

259
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,200
Think about it.

260
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,270
When you first came to our department,

261
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,070
I had high expectations for you.

262
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,340
I gave you so many opportunities.

263
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,320
But what did you do?

264
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,510
Now all the people in the commerce
and industry realm in Shanghai

265
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,040
have complaints about you.

266
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,380
Isn't it normal

267
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,210
that they

268
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,710
have issues with me?

269
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,430
If they don't,

270
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,360
it means

271
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,080
I'm in the same boat with them.

272
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:13,910
Yang,

273
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,030
with your current ideology,

274
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,890
you are not suitable for this job.

275
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,170
What do you mean?

276
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,960
For the public-private partnership

277
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,240
and capitalist transformation,

278
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,000
I've devoted all my energy.

279
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,030
I believe

280
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,460
I can make a difference.

281
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,450
I'm doing this

282
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,440
to protect you.

283
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,030
Do you understand?

284
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,910
I don't know.

285
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,800
I'm going to report this
to Commissioner Yan.

286
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,260
Okay.

287
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,360
Go ahead.

288
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,030
Go.

289
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,200
Why aren't you more enthusiastic?

290
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,080
Hello.

291
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,000
Go.

292
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,510
Don't go.

293
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,270
Why go?

294
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,600
Don't go.

295
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,870
Why not go?

296
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,600
We're already here, why not go?

297
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,630
It's useless talking to her. She won't go.

298
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,600
I know her.

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,660
How do you know if we don't try?

300
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,240
Really, don't go.

301
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,310
What are you doing?

302
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,570
Comrade Zhou Yunqing.

303
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,870
Even if she goes,

304
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,440
there will be so many people there,

305
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,480
including leaders and students,

306
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,870
even Minister Wen.

307
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,840
What if she embarrasses herself again?

308
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,040
You make a good point.

309
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,700
Minister Wen will be there.

310
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,030
No matter anything happens, Minister Wen
will solve it.

311
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,290
Why are you so worried?

312
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,050
Xiurong already said

313
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,840
she's petty bourgeois

314
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,080
and needs gradual reformation.

315
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,480
You can't rush it. You're too impatient.

316
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,420
Is Su Xiurong completely right?

317
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
Not necessarily.

318
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,190
Why do we have to listen
to you about everything?

319
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,780
Listen to me about everything? When?

320
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,280
Since we started
our romantic relationship,

321
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,210
have I eaten even a bit of green onion?

322
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,750
I give up.

323
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,160
Also, let me tell you,

324
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,160
I don't

325
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
like darkness.

326
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,240
Our building often has power outages.

327
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,390
I remind you every time

328
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,840
to bring matches.

329
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,620
Then why don't you bring them?

330
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,480
I brought candles

331
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,510
with me every day.

332
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,600
Why do you always like to quibble now?

333
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,910
Let me tell you.

334
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,000
You always use

335
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,870
such kind of expression

336
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,750
to achieve your goal.

337
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,360
It's not good.

338
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,480
What are you doing?

339
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,770
That's a huge mosquito.

340
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,390
Let me see.

341
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,790
What did we come here for?

342
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,550
To get her to join the event.

343
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,350
That's right.

344
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,840
What are you doing then?

345
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,510
Let's go.

346
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,360
Come on.

347
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,800
Right, you just use

348
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,600
such kind of

349
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,890
special tactics to demand

350
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,300
to achieve your goals. That's right.

351
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,240
You're here.

352
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,829
Qing.

353
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,260
Why are you crying?

354
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,000
Yi.

355
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,480
Next week is May Fourth Youth Day.

356
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,000
Our department is holding an event.

357
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,200
We'd like to invite you to talk about

358
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,960
Zhouyuan's glorious deeds.

359
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,210
Could you come?

360
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,300
This is good news. Why are you crying?

361
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,680
Ms. Yi,

362
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,480
I came today

363
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,010
mainly to apologize to you.

364
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,260
Regarding

365
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,640
the reformation
of bourgeois intellectuals,

366
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,310
I was indeed too impatient.

367
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,030
My words were a bit extreme.

368
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,920
It has caused...

369
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,400
Qing, come in and talk.

370
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,290
It has caused

371
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,940
disturbance to your life.

372
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,400
Sit here.

373
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,100
Yi.

374
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,060
Will you go?

375
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,710
Can you come?

376
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,720
I'll go.

377
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,830
Really?

378
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,930
Yes, really.

379
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,110
Mr. Yang.

380
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,640
Yi says she'll come.

381
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,440
Calm down.

382
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,550
Don't make noise.

383
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,030
This is a good thing.
Of course she can go.

384
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,510
Ms. Yi Yi,

385
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,030
for this speech,

386
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,550
there will be not only
teachers and students,

387
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,340
but also reporters.

388
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,160
So we

389
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,110
have prepared a speech for you.

390
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,830
Qing,

391
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
have you eaten?

392
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,740
Not yet.

393
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,160
Then I'll get you something to eat.

394
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,490
Sit here and wait for me.

395
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,360
Yi, don't trouble yourself.

396
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
The speech mainly covers

397
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,330
Comrade Zhaoyuan's

398
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,720
glorious deeds

399
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,400
and his

400
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,720
daily life details.

401
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,180
Yi ignored you, right?

402
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,510
It's nothing.

403
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,790
It's okay that she reads from the speech.

404
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,710
Come here.

405
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,110
Come over.

406
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,670
Eat more, please.

407
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,270
Everybody.

408
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,960
This is

409
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,310
the wife of martyr Zhou Zhaoyuan,

410
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,510
Comrade Yi Yi.

411
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,790
Now,

412
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,620
let's invite her to tell us about

413
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,070
the glorious deeds
of martyr Zhou Zhaoyuan.

414
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,000
Let's give her a round of applause.

415
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,480
Please.

416
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,690
Teachers and fellow students,

417
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,000
hello.

418
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,090
Just now, Ms. Qing

419
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,440
called me Comrade.

420
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,030
I really don't deserve such honor.

421
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,640
Zhou Zhaoyuan and I

422
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,030
were a couple,

423
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,150
but when he was alive,

424
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,070
I didn't know his real identity.

425
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,720
I didn't know

426
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,980
how to share with you his glorious deeds.

427
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,640
It wasn't until a knowledgeable leader

428
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,420
gave me
the last belongings of Zhaoyuan that

429
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,710
I finally understood
the meaning of the saying

430
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,510
"Without the Communist Party of China,

431
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,590
there would be

432
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,720
no new China".

433
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,200
These were Zhaoyuan's last words to me.

434
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,000
Dear Yi,

435
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,160
what I least wanted

436
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,790
was for you to read this letter.

437
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,400
To die for our country,

438
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,830
I have no regrets.

439
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,400
I couldn't sleep at night.

440
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,320
Watching you sleep so peacefully,

441
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,880
I feel it's so good,

442
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,680
and beautiful.

443
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,840
When I left,

444
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,270
Shanghai was still in April,

445
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,540
chilly in the mornings and evenings.

446
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,290
You love to look beautiful

447
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,190
and don't like wearing too many layers.

448
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,850
But at least don't catch a cold.

449
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,700
When I left,

450
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,990
you were still working on your designs.

451
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,680
Are the finished clothes ready now?

452
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,110
You must look

453
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,730
very beautiful in them.

454
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,710
Sadly, I'll never see that.

455
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,040
When reading and working at night,

456
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,940
don't stay up too late.

457
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,270
Rest well

458
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,240
so you'll have more energy.

459
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,900
Due to the nature of my work,

460
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,160
I couldn't leave you
any valuable possessions.

461
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,790
If you face any difficulties,

462
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,440
you can ask Zihe for help.

463
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,660
Please don't struggle alone.

464
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,000
Revolution

465
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,400
is my unwavering belief.

466
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,300
I have never regretted it.

467
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,550
So please don't grieve for me.

468
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,160
If there is a next life,

469
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,240
we will surely be together.

470
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,350
I go to the afterlife first.

471
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,030
Take care,

472
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,940
my love.

473
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,960
Zhou Zhaoyuan.

474
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,920
Thank you.

475
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,920
Not at all.

476
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,930
I was just passing by today.

477
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,030
I don't believe it.

478
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,180
I know you care about me

479
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,070
and worry I might break down.

480
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,700
You're doing very well.

481
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,370
What touches people most

482
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,750
is always sincerity.

483
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880
I'm reading those books you gave me.

484
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,430
Although it's a bit difficult for me,

485
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,370
I'm determined to finish them.

486
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
I also want to know

487
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,530
what exactly is attracting
and influencing Zhaoyuan.

488
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,110
Even though I don't fully understand,

489
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,440
I can feel that

490
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,400
it's something sacred and noble.

491
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,200
Welcome to

492
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,070
join us anytime, if you want.

493
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,950
With my personality,

494
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,970
I think I'd better not join you,

495
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,290
but be a witness and supervisor of
the ruling party.

496
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,460
Take care of your wound and get some rest.

497
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,730
Comrade Zhou.

498
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,750
Hello.

499
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,350
Mr. Yang.

500
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,590
Director.

501
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,690
Mr. Yang.

502
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,360
Hello, Director.

503
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,710
You're here.

504
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,590
Let's talk inside.

505
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,400
No, no.

506
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,350
We won't disturb Chief's rest.

507
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,210
It's like this.

508
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,370
I've seen you taking care
of Chief Yan these days

509
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,680
while managing your work.

510
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,800
It must be exhausting.

511
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
I wasn't sure what I could do to help,

512
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,750
so I made

513
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,930
two dishes.

514
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,020
Please try them.

515
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,190
What delicious food is this?

516
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,370
You're flattering me.

517
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,160
These past few days,

518
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,920
you haven't been guiding our work

519
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,820
and I've been feeling quite anxious.

520
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,530
So I

521
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,800
summarized a few points

522
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,510
about ideological improvements
I need to make.

523
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,170
I'd like to report them to you.

524
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,350
Guy.

525
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,410
I need to give you some advice.

526
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,320
Work and

527
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,550
health are both important.

528
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,220
Understood.

529
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:21,860
Did you get that?

530
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,570
I got it.

531
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,330
So you need to take care of
your health now.

532
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
Only with good health can you
do revolutionary work well.

533
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,400
Yes.

534
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,710
Remember that, okay?

535
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,400
I will.

536
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,290
Zhou.

537
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,130
Comrade Zhou.

538
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,440
Hello.

539
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,210
It's like this.

540
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,340
I...

541
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,430
I just read

542
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,030
your recorded documents.

543
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,930
There are some differences
with the materials I recorded.

544
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,930
Could I verify some things with you?

545
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,880
Did I make some mistakes?

546
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,590
No.

547
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,490
Well,

548
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,290
we can talk after eating

549
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,930
or talk while eating.

550
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,890
Here, take this.

551
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,400
Take it. Don't be shy.

552
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,270
He made this.

553
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,860
Try his cooking.

554
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,830
You're lucky

555
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,920
to try his cooking.

556
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,920
Also, different people

557
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,090
have different

558
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,740
tastes for the food.

559
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,150
Thank you, Director.

560
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,510
Director.

561
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,240
Have you eaten yet?

562
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,070
Don't be shy. I have some inside.

563
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,270
Eat. Don't be shy.

564
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,590
Okay.

565
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,270
Thank you.

566
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,840
I'll talk with her about work.

567
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,530
You two talk. I'll go check inside.

568
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,110
All right.

569
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,310
Take care, Director.

570
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:28,940
Go.

571
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,160
Comrade Zhou.

572
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,750
Director, I just mopped the floor.

573
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,110
It's slippery. Please be careful.

574
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,510
Got it.

575
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,720
So, it's like this,

576
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,750
when recording,

577
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,640
well...

578
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,110
well...

579
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,440
Sit down.

580
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,850
Director gave me food.

581
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:51,980
Yes.

582
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,310
I just mopped the floor.

583
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,770
I didn't do anything else.

584
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,920
Mr. Yang.

585
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,830
I'll eat then.

586
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,790
Go ahead.

587
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,410
It has green onions, right?

588
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,200
Yes.

589
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,790
I don't eat green onions.

590
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,680
I know.

591
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,400
There's another portion

592
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,660
without green onions.

593
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,560
You made a portion for me too?

594
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,450
Yes. I see you taking care of
the Chief

595
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,910
while juggling your work.

596
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
You've lost weight.

597
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,380
So I made a portion for you.

598
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,850
No green onions.

599
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,470
Eat up.

600
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,740
I'll eat then.

601
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,300
Eat.

602
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:43,720
It's delicious.

603
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,580
Good, isn't it?

604
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,620
Really tasty.

605
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,620
So you can cook too.

606
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,000
Yes.

607
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,400
I like cooking for myself when I'm alone.

608
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,800
I have a big appetite.

609
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,640
I think I didn't make enough.

610
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,730
Mr. Yang, you just said

611
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,100
there are some questions?

612
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,520
What questions?

613
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,530
For you.

614
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,790
A pen for me?

615
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,000
Yes. Actually, your records are fine.

616
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,640
But you need to practice your handwriting.

617
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,880
Whose handwriting should I practice?

618
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,400
Let me show you this.

619
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,720
This is my handwriting.

620
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,510
Actually, my handwriting

621
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,030
can be mistaken for several masters'

622
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,070
calligraphy.

623
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,240
But

624
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,770
I suddenly realized

625
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,590
if I only imitate others,

626
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,160
I would lose myself.

627
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,040
So,

628
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,840
I developed my own style.

629
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,920
That's amazing.

630
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,590
Can I learn from you?

631
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,200
Of course.

632
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,310
Let's eat first,

633
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,110
and after the meal,

634
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,770
we'll practice calligraphy.

635
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,460
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

636
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,620
This is for your calligraphy practice.

637
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,960
I can have the one with green onions.

638
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,090
Let's eat together.

639
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,620
You can cook too?

640
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,090
I live alone and enjoy cooking.

641
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,110
Really?

642
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,140
I should

643
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,750
learn how to cook too,

644
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,930
and learn from you.

645
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,440
Chang.

646
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:01,990
Yes?

647
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,290
Are you busy now?

648
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,960
Not at all.

649
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,760
Come, let's have a chat.

650
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,790
Sir, please have a seat.

651
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,440
No need.

652
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,510
It's just a few words.

653
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:10,960
I'll stand.

654
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,480
Please sit down.

655
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,130
If you don't sit, I won't dare to
talk to you.

656
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,060
Please sit down.

657
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,710
Alright, let's sit and talk.

658
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,730
Let me stand. It's fine.

659
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,200
You're standing while talking to me.

660
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,600
What's that supposed to mean?
Want me to look up to you?

661
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,270
No, no.

662
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Sit down and talk.

663
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,520
Comrade Chang,

664
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,310
stand up.

665
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,380
Let's talk standing.

666
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,660
We'll both stand and talk.

667
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,580
It's like this.

668
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,130
Ms. Fang

669
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,960
has told you everything, right?

670
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,880
Yes. She told me.

671
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,890
She said you're extremely busy with work,

672
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,720
and I completely understand.

673
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,720
You're a leader
with countless responsibilities.

674
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
That's normal.

675
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,680
Don't worry.

676
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,340
I definitely won't
interfere with your work.

677
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,160
Ms. Fang also said you don't like movies

678
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,690
but prefer symphony music.

679
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,160
I've never listened to symphony music,

680
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,200
but I bought a phonograph and records.

681
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,510
Now I listen every day after work.

682
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,480
I'm learning.

683
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,160
Ms. Fang told you these?

684
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,550
Ms. Fang also said

685
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,220
I'd learn to cook more dishes

686
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,100
to ensure your balanced nutrition

687
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,580
so I can take good care of you.

688
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,880
If Ms. Fang said all that,

689
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,790
I think it's necessary to tell you today…

690
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,650
Chang Huijuan,

691
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,270
the patient in bed 16 needs
your nursing care.

692
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,720
Sir, I'll go attend to my duties now.

693
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,640
After I finish my work,

694
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,040
I'll come back to report my thoughts
to you.

695
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,680
Ms. Yi.

696
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,110
Fen's first mother-in-law is here.

697
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,770
I just saw her at the entrance.

698
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,590
What do you mean by first mother-in-law?

699
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,720
Fen is remarried.

700
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,760
So her current mother-in-law
is the second one.

701
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,830
And the first mother-in-law is

702
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,230
from her first marriage.

703
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,510
What nonsense?

704
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,240
Fen's first husband died young.

705
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,510
He died just one month
after they got married.

706
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,180
Fen was a widow for about 7 or 8 years.

707
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,380
She finally found a decent man to marry.

708
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,640
Fen!

709
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,790
Run!

710
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,790
Where's Fen? Fen!

711
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,260
If our fellow villager hadn't told me,

712
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,920
I would've thought you were dead.

713
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,190
I even went to the temple
to pay for blessings for you.

714
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,130
-You went to Shanghai with another man?
-Ms. Tang.

715
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,720
-You shameless bastard!
-Where is Comrade Su?

716
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,320
Comrade Su went to a meeting.

717
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,310
Make them quiet down and sit.

718
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,830
What are you doing? Stop arguing.

719
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,630
Sit down now.

720
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,200
Listen to the leader.

721
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,240
Granny,

722
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,890
let's talk this through calmly.

723
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,720
Who are you?

724
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,770
This is our family business.

725
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,960
It has nothing to do with you.

726
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,880
Fen's marriage is completely legal.

727
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,540
It was approved by the committee.

728
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,460
Enough!

729
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,200
What do you mean by legal?

730
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,000
Fen already has a husband.

731
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,840
She's my daughter-in-law.

732
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,420
She belongs to our family.

733
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,680
Hasn't your son been
dead for 7 or 8 years?

734
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,550
She brought him bad luck
and caused his death!

735
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,610
Don't spread feudal superstitions.

736
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,240
When my son was one year old,

737
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,680
his father died.

738
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,260
I remained a widow my entire life.

739
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,000
You shameless woman,

740
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,880
you couldn't do the same.

741
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,960
She's not you,

742
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,310
nor is she Xiang Lin's wife,
the lamentable widow.

743
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,830
You're Xiang Lin's wife!

744
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,830
You're the unlucky woman!

745
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,790
How dare you push our leader!

746
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,400
Girls, get her!

747
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,320
You shameless.

748
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,440
You shameless.

749
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,920
Get her out of here! Out!

750
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,640
You shameless woman!

751
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,680
Take her out!

752
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,550
Alright, everyone, back to work.

753
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,010
You all go back to work too.

754
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:49,680
Fen,

755
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,730
are you okay?

756
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,200
Don't be afraid.

757
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,060
You've done nothing wrong.

758
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,110
Ms. Yi.

759
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,460
I'm fine.

760
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,740
Take a rest.

761
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,150
It's okay.

762
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,850
Editor-in-Chief Ji.

763
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,679
Minister Wen.

764
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,370
What a rare visitor you are.
Please sit down.

765
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:23,900
Alright.

766
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:24,570
Have a seat.

767
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,989
What brings you to my office?

768
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,030
Here, have some water.

769
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,949
No, well...

770
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,679
Sir, you're just pretending not to know.

771
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,400
Your capable assistant

772
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,590
is coming to our newspaper office.

773
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,510
Don't you know?

774
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,960
Yang Xue'an.

775
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,929
[We hereby send Comrade Yang Xue'an
to work at your office]

776
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,230
He's going to work there?

777
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,880
Yes.

778
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,760
It was arranged by the city leadership.

779
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,489
He'll be working as a reporter.

780
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,360
I see.

781
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,960
What kind of person is he?

782
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,140
He's dedicated and responsible,

783
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,200
highly motivated,

784
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,110
with good writing skill,

785
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,120
and is an excellent young cadre.

786
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,670
That's reassuring.

787
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,400
Now that he's so excellent,

788
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,260
how can you bear to let him go, sir?

789
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,150
Talent needs to circulate.

790
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,450
Don't you agree?

791
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,240
You're highly conscious, sir.

792
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,100
All right then.

793
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,000
When the official transfer order
from the city government arrives,

794
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,920
I'll send it to you.

795
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,590
Good.

796
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,630
I won't take up any more of your time.

797
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,470
I'll be going now.

798
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:23,950
Leaving already?

799
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,440
Yes, I'm off.

800
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,230
Would you like some water?

801
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:25,890
No, thanks.

802
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,670
Too much is going on at the newspaper.

803
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,070
All right.

804
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,550
Goodbye, sir.

805
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,400
Welcome to visit me often.

806
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,230
Sure, goodbye!

807
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,090
Okay, goodbye.

808
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,150
He's gone.

809
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,760
Does anyone have any potatoes left?

810
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,710
Give me a potato,

811
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,300
and I'll tell you a secret.

812
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,400
What is it?

813
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,190
Guess what?

814
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,510
Why is Ms. Yi

815
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,110
so worked up about Widow Fen

816
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,030
remarrying?

817
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,230
No idea.

818
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,150
Ms. Yi has been a widow
for several years now.

819
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,800
No less time than Fen.

820
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,840
Who would Ms. Yi fall in love with?

821
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,290
That silver-spoon Fu?

822
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,030
Ms. Su already said it's not him.

823
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,030
Of course it's not silver-spoon Fu.

824
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,000
He is so rich,

825
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,630
and has several concubines.

826
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,920
If he wanted some fun or an affair,

827
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,840
he'd go for a young girl.

828
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,960
What kind of man do you think
Ms. Yi would choose?

829
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,970
She would surely

830
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,710
want another high official.

831
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,320
But if she's now seeing a rickshaw puller

832
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,920
or some laborer, it wouldn't
be surprising.

833
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,520
You know what I mean, sisters?

834
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,410
Yes, indeed.

835
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,150
No wonder I always see her taking

836
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,040
Aniu's rickshaw at the entrance.

837
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:35,920
You saw that too?

838
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,000
I saw it as well.

839
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,780
Miss Yi Yi.

840
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,730
Seems you're all very interested
in my private life.

841
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,930
I heard you and Fen are
from the same hometown.

842
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,710
Not exactly.

843
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,350
I came to Shanghai very early.

844
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,960
How did Fen's former mother-in-law

845
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,590
know she was here?

846
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,300
Someone must have tipped her off.

847
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,280
What this person's intentions were,

848
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,190
I don't know.

849
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,480
But I can tell you all clearly.

850
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,150
This is the new China.

851
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,720
The old feudal ethics and morals

852
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,010
will surely be buried.

853
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,800
Those with ill intentions

854
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,290
will eventually face the consequences.

855
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:13,770
I...

856
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,670
I didn't mean that, Ms. Yi.

857
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,360
We...

858
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,300
we all like you very much.

859
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,350
I just gossip.

860
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,880
Ms. Yi,

861
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,690
you're not angry, are you?

862
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,850
Please don't be angry.

863
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,030
You're not going to fire me, are you?

864
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,000
You can't fire me!

865
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,510
I have elderly parents
and young children to support.

866
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,110
If you fire me, what will I do?

867
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,960
Ms. Yi,

868
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,140
if you really fire me,

869
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,000
I'll kill myself right in front of you.

870
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,110
What's all this noise?

871
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,840
Wen Manli,

872
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,440
what nonsense are you talking again?

873
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,510
Try to go die?

874
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,440
Ms. Su.

875
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Get back to work first.

876
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,080
We'll talk after the shift ends.

877
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,510
Stop.

878
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,980
What did you just say about Yi?

879
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,890
I'm asking you.

880
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,230
I... I...

881
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,890
Yi, what did she say about you?

882
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,880
Nothing.

883
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,610
I know your file very well.

884
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,630
I'll deal with you later.

885
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,990
Stop gossiping about Yi.

886
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,740
Let's go.

887
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,800
Alright, alright.

888
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,860
Finish your meal and get back to work.

889
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,590
Hello, Director Fang.

890
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,190
Hello, Director Fang.

891
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,590
Hi.

892
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,350
Minister Wen,

893
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,760
could you come out for a moment?

894
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,360
What is it?

895
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,760
Let's talk in your office.

896
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,110
I'm in a meeting right now.

897
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,030
Just two words.

898
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,110
Go ahead.

899
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,510
Has Old Ji contacted you?

900
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,980
If you don't want Yang to leave,

901
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,940
don't approve his transfer order.

902
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,770
The receiving institution has come to me,

903
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,470
and I knew nothing about it.

904
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,400
Is that normal?

905
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,400
Yang said you told him to leave,

906
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,220
so we naturally assumed you knew about it.

907
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,370
So you're saying

908
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,510
that you

909
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,160
don't want Yang to leave?

910
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,510
Actually, he doesn't want to leave either.

911
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,550
He's just pretending he wants to go,

912
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,600
hoping you'll ask him to stay.

913
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,040
He's overthinking this.

914
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,150
Alright, I understand.

915
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,320
I need to go to a meeting now.

916
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,650
I haven't finished yet.

917
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,320
Why would your factory accept

918
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,610
someone like Wen Manli?

919
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,090
I know her file very well.

920
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,510
She used to be a dancer at Paramount.

921
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,110
She has absolutely no feelings
for the new society.

922
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,840
People like her are just trash.

923
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,100
If we don't take care of her,

924
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,490
her family would end up on the streets.

925
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,240
New China is just established.

926
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,380
We should contribute to our country.

927
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,370
What about her spreading rumors?

928
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,640
Should we deduct her work points

929
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,530
and give her a demerit?

930
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,460
Fine, I'll handle this.

931
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,640
Don't be angry.

932
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,420
You two keep talking. I need to go.

933
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,090
Okay.

934
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,960
Yi.

935
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:05,880
You

936
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,910
need to be careful of her.

937
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,670
These rumors won't disappear

938
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,070
because you ignore them.

939
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,590
I don't want to waste time and energy

940
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,710
on such matters.

941
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,320
She can't hurt me.

942
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,350
When rumors

943
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,210
are repeated a hundred times,

944
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,810
they will become the truth.

945
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,360
You can't be that naive.

946
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,440
Qing.

947
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,070
You should go now. I need to work.

948
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:36,920
Yi.

949
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,840
I'm not leaving.

950
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,290
What do you mean?

951
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,600
I want to stay and keep you company.

952
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,540
What's wrong with you?

953
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,630
What do you mean?

954
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,740
You've seen the situation today.

955
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,230
I need to stay by your side
to protect you.

956
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,630
I'm afraid they'll smear your reputation.

957
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,330
Your workplace is far from where I live.

958
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,660
It's not convenient.

959
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,130
What's not convenient?

960
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,960
There are buses.

961
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,630
From now on, I'll come over
after work to keep you company.

962
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,760
We'll keep each other company.
You won't be lonely anymore.

963
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
Are you serious?

964
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,320
Of course I'm serious.

965
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,960
What's with that face?

966
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,390
You don't welcome me?

967
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,110
You know what I'm like.

968
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,740
I'm used to being alone.

969
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,610
Not used to living with others.

970
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,110
I...

971
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,460
Am I like the others?

972
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,630
I'm Zhou Zhaoyuan's younger sister.

973
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,670
I'm Zhou Yunqing.

974
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,720
Whose idea was this?

975
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,040
What do you mean?

976
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,070
Are you here to care for me

977
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,340
or to monitor me?

978
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,230
I don't understand what you're saying.

979
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,030
Did Mr. Yang send you to watch me?

980
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,840
Why are you so prejudiced against him?

981
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,360
He wants to protect you and care for you,

982
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,670
afraid others might ruin your reputation.

983
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,670
What reputation?

984
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,280
He just cares about you.

985
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,440
Is he caring about me

986
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,090
or afraid I'll affect you?

987
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,100
What are you saying?

988
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,110
You're being unreasonable!

989
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,190
I don't want you interfering
in my private life.

990
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,110
Is that too much?

991
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,190
Very much so.

992
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,400
Yi Yi.

993
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,880
You're a martyr's widow.

994
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,620
This identity isn't just yours.

995
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,440
You can't disgrace the martyr's name.

996
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,100
You can't be with another man.

997
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,320
Zhou Yunqing!

998
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,070
What?

999
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,530
How can you be so feudalistic?

1000
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,590
Even the factory women
are more progressive than you.

1001
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,440
You're talking nonsense!

1002
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,480
I understand now.

1003
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,030
Go back and tell Mr. Yang.

1004
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,440
Thank him for his good intentions.

1005
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,150
I'll protect my own reputation.

1006
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,840
Also,

1007
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,760
my affairs have nothing to do

1008
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,890
with you or Mr. Yang.

1009
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,030
If you two are worried I'll

1010
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,630
affect your bright futures,

1011
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,930
then distance yourself from me again.

1012
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,440
I won't.

1013
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,800
I'm not leaving.

1014
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,590
You won't leave?

1015
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,190
Yes.

1016
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,570
Then I'll go.

1017
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,450
Don't go.

1018
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,670
If you leave, I'll tear up
your manuscript.

1019
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,870
Tear it up if you want.

1020
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,590
I'm not leaving anyway.
