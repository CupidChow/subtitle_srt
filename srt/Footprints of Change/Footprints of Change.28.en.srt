[Episode 28]

3
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,430
Mr. Zhong.

4
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,920
I heard the housing allocation for
the apartment building has been announced.

5
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
They rejected me.

6
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,509
They gave it to Xiang Beichuan.

7
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,150
Why?

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
This is so unfair.

9
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,000
Everyone knows

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,530
I've been married for years

11
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,120
and finally expecting a child.

12
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,000
I desperately need that apartment now.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,400
Why give it to him?

14
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,830
He's not even married

15
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,040
and hasn't taught for over a semester.

16
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,190
Is it just because

17
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,790
he gave you all those shirts?

18
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,680
Fine.

19
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,600
I'm returning this to you now.

20
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,700
You said it was good quality.

21
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,870
It shrank after one wash

22
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,520
and doesn't even fit anymore.

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,240
Mr. Guo.

24
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,470
Silk shirts do shrink after washing.

25
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,560
Don't try to fool me.

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,690
You think I've never worn silk before?

27
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,050
Mr. Guo, wait.

28
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,310
How did you know
the apartment was assigned to me?

29
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,800
I don't even know about it myself.

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,630
That's right.

31
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,280
The housing list
goes through several rounds of selection.

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,290
The first round hasn't even started yet.

33
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,480
Who told you this?

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,430
Zhang from the boiler room

35
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,470
at our faculty's public bathhouse.

36
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,030
How could you believe Zhang?

37
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,750
He's just a boiler operator after all.

38
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,370
What's wrong with being a boiler operator?

39
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,700
He's been operating boilers
at our school for over 20 years.

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,190
This Zhang...

41
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,360
Anyway,

42
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,210
if I'm not on the list
for the apartment allocation,

43
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,870
no one else will get it either.

44
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,560
Mr. Guo.

45
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,880
Where are you going?

46
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,260
I'm going to ask Zhang for clarification.

47
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,180
Who is it?

48
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,920
Who's there?

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Huajing.

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,870
Why are you here?

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,400
Huajing, I heard you weren't feeling well.

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,760
I came to check on you.

53
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,680
Come in, please.

54
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,670
Have a seat.

55
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,680
How did you know where I live

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,470
and that I was sick?

57
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,150
Yan Jun told me.

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,070
I thought so.

59
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,310
Not many people know about my place.

60
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,630
Why would he tell you about this?

61
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,070
Huajing.

62
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,680
Do you have a cold

63
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,750
or a fever?

64
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,600
Is it serious?

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,510
It's not serious, just a minor cold.

66
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,240
I'm fine now.

67
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,460
Perfect.

68
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,310
I brought you some fruit.

69
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,750
Eating more fruit while you're sick

70
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,870
helps supplement your vitamins.

71
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,950
Thank you.

72
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,800
Good.

73
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,680
Have some water.

74
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,880
You're here

75
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,190
because you need something, right?

76
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,450
I don't need anything.

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,630
The other day I went to the mall

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,480
and saw a beautiful necklace.

79
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,890
I thought

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,080
it would suit you perfectly.

81
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,480
So I bought it right away.

82
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,330
It's for you.

83
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,090
Is it expensive?

84
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,050
Not expensive.

85
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,690
It looks beautiful.

86

[Amber necklace 1388]

87
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,210
And you say it's not expensive?

88
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,050
Do you want something from me?

89
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,480
I don't want anything from you.

90
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,320
I just think this necklace

91
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,340
looks especially beautiful on you.

92
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,880
Don't worry, Huajing.

93
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,060
Please accept it.

94
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,190
I really don't want anything from you.

95
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,200
All right.

96
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,070
Then I'll accept it.

97
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,350
I really like it.

98
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,720
Thank you.

99
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,480
Stay for dinner.

100
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,950
I'll skip dinner.

101
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,270
I have some work at the company.

102
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,390
I need to go back.

103
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,210
That's fine.

104
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I won't keep you then.

105
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,830
You know where I live now.

106
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,960
Come visit anytime.

107
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,760
No problem.

108
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll definitely come visit you often.

109
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,830
Huajing, eat more fruit.

110
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,830
Drink more water.

111
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
And get plenty of rest.

112
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,430
Sure thing.

113
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,870
Okay, I won't disturb you anymore.

114
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,930
I'll head back now.

115
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,800
Okay.

116
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,360
You don't need to see me out.

117
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,000
I can find my way.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,120
I won't see you out then.

119
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,380
Take care of yourself.

120
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,160
Take care.

121
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,870
Do you even act like a boss?

122
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,600
You're goofy

123
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,360
and out of it all the time.

124
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,490
You just took off in your little plane,

125
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,360
leaving me and Ye Xining behind.

126
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,680
A boss who doesn't act like one.

127
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,159
Now we're the ones acting like bosses,

128
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,820
cleaning up your mess all day.

129
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,430
Do you know how we sold that merchandise?

130
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,630
Piece by piece at Qipu Road,

131
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,560
selling day and night without rest.

132
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,920
If only I'd known you were running off.

133
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,659
We were worried something happened to you.

134
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,240
I was afraid you'd died
somewhere out there.

135
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,840
Not even a single phone call.

136
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,630
Thankfully, there was Mr. Yan.

137
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,870
That's the only reason
you can see us today.

138
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,050
Otherwise, we'd still
be stuck at Qipu Road.

139
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,270
But you know what?

140
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,430
That Mr. Yan

141
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,360
took half our merchandise.

142
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
You know why?

143
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,720
He's got a thing for Ye.

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,870
Otherwise, who would take half our goods?

145
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,000
Why would he be so nice to us, right?

146
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,760
The way he looks at Ye,

147
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,000
it's kind of...

148
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,870
You know what I mean.

149
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,240
Don't you get it?

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
What are you laughing at?

151
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,630
So flippant.

152
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,810
I'm telling you, this is serious.

153
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,659
You're really something...

154
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,600
Mr. Lu?

155
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,720
Ye.

156
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,920
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,190
Did you also think I ran away?

158
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,800
I did kind of think that way.

159
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,980
He didn't run away.

160
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,120
In fact, he

161
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,390
brought back
a big order from Eastern Europe.

162
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,120
What's this big order about?

163
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,840
Well, in Europe
they have this thing called...

164
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,510
Halloween.

165
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,070
Halloween.

166
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes, Halloween.

167
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,480
It's basically like

168
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,630
the Chinese Ghost Festival.

169
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,270
You understand?

170
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,670
It's that Western thing.

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,190
On that day, they dress up

172
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,480
in all kinds of strange costumes,

173
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,600
wear tall hats,

174
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
put on masks,

175
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,240
wear capes,

176
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,270
and clothes with skeleton patterns.

177
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,510
Then they go out and

178
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,270
run around in groups.

179
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,660
But making these costumes over there

180
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,920
is very expensive.

181
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,750
We can make them cheaper here.

182
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,600
So Mr. Lu secured this order

183
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,510
to make these costumes back home.

184
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,549
After they're made, we'll ship them back.

185
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,669
That's the whole thing, right?

186
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,669
What's it called?

187
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,150
OEM production.

188
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,240
Yes, OEM.

189
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,360
So these goods

190
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,150
are specifically
for the European Halloween.

191
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:44,970
That's right.

192
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,150
If we miss the Halloween deadline,

193
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,260
our losses will be enormous.

194
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,150
So,

195
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,840
in this matter,

196
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,910
the key is to win over Shan Huajing.

197
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,370
As long as customs clears us

198
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,930
without delay, everything will be fine.

199
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,670
Xining,

200
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,580
how's your relationship with Ms. Shan now?

201
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,910
Ms. Shan treats me very well

202
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,360
and has introduced me to many connections.

203
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,630
She can help me with small matters,

204
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,810
but with something this big...

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm not sure

206
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,600
if she'll help me.

207
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,770
So you're saying

208
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,480
this matter still has some risk.

209
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,390
Can we do it or not?

210
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,750
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

211
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,910
Let's do it.

212
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,480
We'll

213
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,810
trust you one last time.

214
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,360
Lu Guoyao,

215
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
if you mess things up again...

216
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,270
Yan Jun is waiting for us.

217
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,510
We can start working right now.

218
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,600
It's your call.

219
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,030
Alright.

220
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,150
Beichuan.

221
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,770
What's the matter, Mr. Guo?

222
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Professor Xiang.

223
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,480
I've confirmed with

224
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,370
Zhang from the boiler room.

225
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,500
The apartment will be assigned to you.

226
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,340
I believe what he said.

227
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,410
I just wanted to ask you

228
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,320
if you would consider
giving it to me instead.

229
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,290
Why should I give it to you?

230
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,120
Let me be honest with you.

231
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,390
My wife and I

232
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,470
have been assigned

233
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,480
to our school since graduation.

234
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,080
All these years of marriage,

235
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,780
we've been living in separate dormitories.

236
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,670
You know our salaries,

237
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,520
just that little money each month.

238
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,320
We simply can't afford
to buy commercial housing.

239
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,810
You're different.

240
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,530
You're not married yet.

241
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,720
You're an excellent young teacher

242
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,120
with many opportunities in the future

243
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,850
and many possibilities ahead.

244
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,330
When we got married,

245
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,240
my mother-in-law
didn't approve of her marrying me.

246
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
She thought I had no money, no house,

247
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,630
that her daughter
would suffer by marrying me.

248
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,420
Our baby is due soon.

249
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,240
If I can't get this apartment,

250
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,480
I'll lose all face with her family.

251
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,750
So please, Professor Xiang,

252
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,480
could you help me?

253
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,030
When our school assigns housing again,

254
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,160
I'll do everything to help you get one.

255
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,520
I may not be able to get that apartment.

256
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,790
Why?

257
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,840
Didn't you say you're the most experienced

258
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,970
and they'll definitely give it to you?

259
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,400
I gave it to someone else.

260
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,750
Who did you give it to?

261
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,890
I gave it to Guo Xiaoxu.

262
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,650
How could you be such a jerk?

263
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,790
Don't be angry.

264
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,390
I was wrong.

265
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,390
It's a big deal.

266
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,480
Before you make a decision,

267
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,200
you didn't even ask my opinion?

268
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,240
From now on, no matter what I do,

269
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,200
I won't discuss anything with you.

270
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,270
Tomorrow I'll take another man

271
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,800
to go shopping for clothes.

272
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,510
I know I was wrong.

273
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,350
I'm sorry.

274
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,210
Of course you should be sorry.

275
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,260
Just hurry up and eat your food.

276
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,400
Don't smack your lips.

277
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,090
Here, Section Chief Shan.

278
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,210
Let me toast to you.

279
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,960
I'd like to formally introduce her.

280
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,910
This is my dear sister, Miss Ye.

281
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,600
This is Director Liu
from the leather factory.

282
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,510
80% of leather jackets on the market

283
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,770
come from his factory.

284
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,630
If you need anything in this area,

285
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,560
just ask Mr. Liu.

286
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,780
Guaranteed quality at great prices.

287
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,510
Section Chief Shan's sister
is like my own sister.

288
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,320
Miss Ye,

289
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,360
whenever you need to stock up,

290
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
come directly to me.

291
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
We can negotiate a good price.

292
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,840
Come, cheers!

293
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,510
Sure, Sir.

294
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,240
Come.

295
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,480
Ms. Shan.

296
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,840
Where is Mr. Yan?

297
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,890
He said his stomach was bothering him.

298
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,950
He's avoiding drinks on the balcony.

299
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
I'll go check on him.

300
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,720
Okay.

301
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,270
Sir, I'm stepping out for a moment.

302
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,080
You all continue drinking.

303
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,960
Okay.

304
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,510
Mr. Yan,

305
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,510
is your stomach feeling better?

306
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,120
It's nothing.

307
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,910
I've just

308
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,050
been drinking too much lately.

309
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,210
You should drink more hot water then.

310
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,550
You've changed a lot.

311
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
What do you mean?

312
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,200
Back then, whenever you came
to occasions like this,

313
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,860
you would just sit there alone

314
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,840
without moving.

315
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,000
But now look at you,

316
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,240
chatting everywhere you go

317
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,570
and talking to everyone.

318
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,740
Not bad now.

319
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,790
I know Beichuan very well.

320
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,000
Back in college, the two of us

321
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,060
were best friends.

322
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,110
As for me,

323
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,490
I was quite poor back then.

324
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,960
When I went to the cafeteria,

325
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,240
I could only afford two vegetable dishes

326
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,970
and didn't dare order any meat.

327
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,030
Every time,

328
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,650
Beichuan would lend me his meal tickets.

329
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,840
What I'm trying to say is,

330
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,630
you've changed so much,

331
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
but Beichuan

332
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,290
has stayed exactly the same.

333
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,360
So,

334
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,550
doesn't this affect

335
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,720
your relationship?

336
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,920
It doesn't affect us at all.

337
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,790
I went to a bookstore the other day.

338
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,390
I read a book there

339
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,390
and it said

340
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
that in relationships,

341
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,030
objective circumstances

342
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,690
affect subjective feelings.

343
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,600
What does that mean?

344
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,250
It means

345
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,630
when one person changes

346
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,130
and the other doesn't,

347
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,570
it's very problematic.

348
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,500
This change refers to

349
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,320
when one person progresses

350
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,670
and the other doesn't.

351
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,440
Then these two people

352
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
are probably destined
to break up sooner or later.

353
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,170
I didn't expect you
to visit bookstores, Mr. Yan.

354
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,030
I don't buy into that theory.

355
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,560
I believe

356
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,790
that human emotions

357
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,030
are guided by subjective consciousness.

358
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,320
And my view on relationships

359
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
is idealistic.

360
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,960
Maybe.

361
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,760
Beichuan is idealistic too.

362
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,510
But from what I've observed,

363
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,840
among my friends,

364
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,840
once they get money, they change.

365
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,120
And once they change,
relationships fall apart.

366
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,910
Of course,

367
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,150
you and Beichuan

368
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,390
might be the exception.

369
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,780
I wish you both happiness.

370
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,340
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

371
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,670
Beichuan!

372
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,960
Xiang Beichuan.

373
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,600
Mr. Lu.

374
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,410
Long time no see.

375
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,080
It's been a while.

376
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,630
Have you eaten? Sit down and join me.

377
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,430
No, I haven't.

378
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,870
I just came down to order.

379
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,600
They'll send the food up later.

380
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,240
It's been so long.

381
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,640
Indeed, long time no see.

382
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,220
You've been doing well lately?

383
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,840
Very good.

384
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,630
How are you? Busy, I imagine?

385
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,750
Yes, busy.

386
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,620
I've been busy all day.

387
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,680
Finally got a moment to grab a bite.

388
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,840
That's tough.

389
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,880
How are things

390
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,790
with Ye?

391
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,010
We're doing great.

392
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,200
Good.

393
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,329
Ye is

394
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,910
quite a remarkable girl.

395
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,560
She did well when she was

396
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,640
working for the SOE.

397
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,270
And now in our private company,

398
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,160
she's like a fish in water.

399
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,910
She has this drive about her.

400
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,160
It's that kind of

401
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,750
fearless determination.

402
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,510
How do they say it in trendy terms?

403
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,660
She's someone

404
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,960
who can keep up
with the tide of the times.

405
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,510
Thank you for your help, Mr. Lu.

406
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,590
Not at all.

407
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,240
It's your girlfriend,

408
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,960
Ye, who has been helping us.

409
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Mr. Lu.

410
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,830
Is Ye still frequently going to customs?

411
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,860
Yes, she is.

412
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,780
Let me tell you.

413
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,640
Shan Huajing is such a difficult woman.

414
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,160
But now Ye has developed
an excellent relationship with her.

415
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,890
All of our customs-related business

416
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,090
is handled by Ye.

417
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,200
You're one lucky guy.

418
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,640
In the future,

419
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,680
you can just teach at the school

420
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,180
and work on your research.

421
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,750
All external matters
can be entrusted to Ye

422
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,310
without any concern.

423
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,170
Make sure you don't miss out

424
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,110
on such a good girl.

425
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,420
Would you like some water?

426
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,080
No, thanks.

427
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,240
Mr. Lu, please enjoy your meal.

428
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,880
I have some matters to attend to.
I'll be going now.

429
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,410
Alright.

430
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,200
Enjoy your meal.

431
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,310
Let me see you off.

432
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,200
No, no, no.

433
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,440
Go back to your meal.

434
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,200
Goodbye.

435
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,550
See you.

436
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,510
Goodbye.

437
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,830
Everyone's busy?

438
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,270
Busy.

439
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,650
Look at this.

440
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,400
Is it nice?

441
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,060
This hat looks good.

442
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:49,610
Nice.

443
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,490
This thing. Come on, try it on.

444
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,030
What is this?

445
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,860
I would look like Zorro with it on.

446
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,240
It works. Keep it on.

447
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,950
It looks better on
than off, right, Xining?

448
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,380
Wearing this blocks my eyes.

449
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,550
That's exactly why it looks good on you.

450
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,160
Ye.

451
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,070
Our containers are all ready.

452
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,550
How's it going?
Did you sort things out with customs?

453
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,590
Not yet.

454
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,650
I haven't talked to Ms. Shan about it.

455
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,000
Why haven't you talked to her yet?

456
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,790
Aren't you two getting along well now?

457
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,070
Calling each other sister and all.

458
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,960
Go talk to her.

459
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,600
It's not that simple.

460
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,550
I get it.

461
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,750
She keeps business
and personal matters separate.

462
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,030
Life is life, work is work.

463
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,170
How about this?

464
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,920
I'll give you two boxes of eggs.

465
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,160
Take them to visit her.

466
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,420
She doesn't need that.

467
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,830
She's been to all
the fancy restaurants in Shanghai.

468
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,720
Exactly.

469
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,790
She's a section chief, a big shot.

470
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,150
She's eaten
at every restaurant in Shanghai.

471
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,550
As if she'd want your eggs.

472
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,640
Well, my eggs are special.

473
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,270
They're the kind
women eat during postpartum recovery.

474
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,030
Is Section Chief Shan
in postpartum recovery?

475
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,000
They're free-range eggs!

476
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,350
You've eaten too many eggs yourself.

477
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,410
Alright, alright. Both of you, stop.

478
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,480
I'll go see her
in the next couple of days.

479
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,030
I'll talk to her properly
about this matter.

480
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,750
Ye.

481
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You need to hurry.

482
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:57,880
I know.

483
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,680
Mr. Yan.

484
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:09,990
Have a seat.

485
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,000
I heard you've returned
to teach at school.

486
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,090
Congratulations.

487
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,200
I came today to resign.

488
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,910
This is the 60,000 yuan
you advanced for me before.

489
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,200
Where did you get the money?

490
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,980
The commission you gave me before,

491
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,780
plus the writing fees I saved up,

492
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,080
it's exactly enough.

493
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,640
Professor Xiang, you're really impressive,

494
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
making so much money from writing.

495
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,880
Xiang Beichuan.

496
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,920
Don't you think you're being

497
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,930
a bit ungrateful?

498
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,660
When you were down and out,

499
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,000
I gave you a job,

500
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,030
provided food and housing,

501
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,790
and even paid you a salary.

502
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,640
While you were here,

503
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,810
despite not accomplishing anything,

504
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,590
I even gave you commission.

505
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,830
Now that you have a new job,

506
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,550
you're just walking away without a care.

507
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,810
Is that right?

508
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,200
To me, at most,

509
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,640
what we have is

510
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,640
simply a case of incompatible values.

511
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,240
Let's part ways peacefully.

512
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,590
Incompatible values?

513
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,610
That's true.

514
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,660
You, Professor Xiang, are

515
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,960
a scholar,

516
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,000
destined to become a writer.

517
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,670
While I'm just

518
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,140
a lousy boss.

519
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,780
A country bumpkin.

520
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,880
I'm not even worthy
of comparison with you.

521
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,480
Mr. Yan.

522
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,920
In the days to come,

523
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,380
I wish you and your company

524
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,740
smooth sailing

525
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,410
and great success.

526
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Then I also wish you

527
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,370
a bright future

528
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,600
and great achievements.

529
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,720
Goodbye.

530
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,400
I quit my job at Yan Jun's.

531
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,790
You should have quit long ago.

532
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,390
Focus on your creative work.

533
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
I'll support you.

534
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,380
No need.

535
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,160
I started a company with my senior.

536
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,890
We plan to work on cultural projects.

537
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,110
Will it make money?

538
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,830
Definitely not as much as you do.

539
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,960
Actually, for us,

540
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,640
making money
isn't the most important thing.

541
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
What we value more is

542
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,110
the influence of cultural projects.

543
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,750
Cultural projects don't need investment?

544
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,680
No costs?

545
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,640
Without money,
what kind of projects can you do?

546
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,700
Where will your influence come from?

547
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,830
Let's take it one step at a time.

548
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,090
When I make big money, I'll invest in you.

549
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,270
You're not good at business,

550
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,550
but it doesn't matter if you lose money.

551
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,440
Just be happy.

552
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,700
Ma'am, check please.

553
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,500
Okay, coming.

554
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,030
Why are you paying?

555
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,430
I'll pay. How much?

556
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,390
15 in total.

557
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,110
The amount is just right.

558
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,110
What are you doing?

559
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,000
Take it.

560
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:58,890
Let's go.

561
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,850
Your dishes are ready.

562
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,650
Oh, thank you.

563
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,400
Whose car is this?

564
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,240
It's so nice.

565
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,250
Do you know what brand this is?

566
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,490
It's a Mercedes, right?

567
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,900
This isn't just any Mercedes.

568
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,100
It's rare even in all of Shanghai.

569
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,830
It's the best model.

570
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,110
Do you know how much this car costs?

571
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,920
I don't know.

572
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,210
How come you don't know anything?

573
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,900
This is what I'm working toward.

574
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,490
Ms. Shan?

575
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,630
Ye.

576
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,330
What a coincidence!

577
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,480
Out for a walk with your boyfriend?

578
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,310
Yes, we just finished dinner.

579
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,560
That's nice.

580
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,060
What about you?

581
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,550
I just borrowed a car from a friend

582
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,960
for some errands these days.

583
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,560
So this is your friend's car?

584
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,230
Just a casual friend.

585
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,370
Alright.

586
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,510
I won't interrupt your romantic time.

587
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,870
Bring Xiang over to my place sometime.

588
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,310
Sure.

589
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,700
Great, I'm off then.

590
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,930
Take care, Huajing.

591
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,720
Goodbye.

592
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,440
Goodbye.

593
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,830
Look at Ms. Shan.

594
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,000
Even her ordinary friend
drives such a nice car,

595
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,330
and you still want me
to stay away from her?

596
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,590
I just think
there's something wrong with this person.

597
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,790
You should keep your distance from her.

598
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,040
Xiang Beichuan.

599
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,480
From now on, I won't tell you

600
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,680
anything about my work anymore.

601
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,360
I've calculated that

602
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,720
if we ship now,
we'll just make it in time.

603
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,240
Ye,

604
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,790
I'll need you to make a trip

605
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,320
to customs this afternoon.

606
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,020
If we don't ship now,

607
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,000
we'll miss Halloween.

608
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,160
I'll go see Ms. Shan soon.

609
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,910
She invited me to her home.

610
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,390
That's great!

611
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,880
As long as this shipment
goes out smoothly,

612
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,400
the company will have money
to pay everyone's salary

613
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,240
and bonuses.

614
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,830
Xining,

615
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,090
I'm counting on you for this bonus.

616
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,640
That's why everyone
says Xining's so capable.

617
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,160
When this young talent steps up,
she's worth two.

618
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,090
She'll go out there
and nail everything down, right?

619
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,880
Right.

620
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,910
Being invited to her home

621
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,480
means you two have a good relationship.

622
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,030
Not everyone
gets invited to someone's home.

623
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,920
Don't worry.

624
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,520
I'll have a good talk with her

625
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,680
and try to seal the deal.

626
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,310
Good.

627
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,230
Ms. Shan.

628
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,040
This is our company's
customs declaration form.

629
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,640
I saw you with Xiang the other day.

630
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,600
You two are still together?

631
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,390
You're really a good girl,

632
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,920
finding yourself
such a decent, reliable guy.

633
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,850
To be honest,

634
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,070
girls like you are

635
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,310
rare these days.

636
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,920
Thank you, Huajing.

637
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,180
Our company's shipment

638
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,240
has been stuck at customs.

639
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,680
I've asked around

640
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,880
and everyone says
you're in charge of this.

641
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,240
So I wanted to ask for your help

642
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,310
to see if you could
resolve this issue for me.

643
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,110
Is that so?

644
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,560
I'll look into it tomorrow.

645
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,850
Actually,

646
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,590
I'm not in charge
of specific matters anymore.

647
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,050
If I intervene too much,
my subordinates will complain.

648
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,400
Does your company have some paperwork

649
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,720
that's incomplete?

650
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,110
Customs is undergoing reforms now

651
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,130
and inspections are very strict.

652
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,400
Ms. Shan,

653
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,240
our company is small

654
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,570
and all our funds

655
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
are tied up in this shipment.

656
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,140
Plus there's a time constraint.

657
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,680
It must reach Europe before Halloween.

658
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,670
If it doesn't arrive in time,

659
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,410
all the money for this shipment

660
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,270
will go down the drain.

661
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,510
That would be the end of our company.

662
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,750
So,

663
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,880
Huajing,

664
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,210
could you please help me

665
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,790
and our company?

666
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,100
What you're saying is

667
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,960
that your company's financial pressure

668
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,160
is all on my shoulders now?

669
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,640
No,

670
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,200
that's not what I meant.

671
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,200
I'm not good with words.

672
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,030
I didn't mean that at all.

673
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,950
I just wanted to say,

674
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,860
Huajing, could you help me

675
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,650
just follow up on this a little?

676
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,990
Alright, I understand.

677
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,240
You can go now.

678
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,680
I won't bother you anymore.

679
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,280
I'll head back now, Huajing.

680
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,640
Huajing, you should rest.

681
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,620
I'll be going now.

682
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,100
Okay.

683
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,440
Who is it?

684
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,350
Mr. Yan.

685
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,640
Come in. Come in.

686
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,270
Have you eaten yet?

687
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,790
Not yet.

688
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,090
Please sit down. Let's eat together.

689
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,680
The bowl and chopsticks are clean.

690
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,740
Thank you.

691
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,200
Let me serve you some rice.

692
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,580
That's enough.

693
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,640
Try this.

694
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,620
Mr. Yan.

695
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm here to ask you about Shan Huajing.

696
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,560
What about Shan Huajing?

697
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,660
We have an important shipment

698
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,640
that's stuck at customs.

699
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,420
Ms. Shan won't approve it.

700
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,400
You know, Ms. Shan
has always been nice to me.

701
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,680
She treats me like a real sister.

702
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,930
But suddenly
she won't help with this matter.

703
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,400
I thought since you have
a good relationship with her,

704
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,920
could you ask her

705
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,400
if I did something wrong

706
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,480
or made some mistake?

707
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,880
Is this dish too salty for you?

708
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,640
Let me get you some water.

709
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,490
Or would you prefer a drink?

710
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,690
No need. It's perfect, not salty at all.

711
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,740
It's not that you did anything wrong.

712
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,160
Shan Huajing doesn't have
anything against you either.

713
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,770
It's just that many things

714
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,730
aren't what they appear to be.

715
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,690
Appearances can be deceiving.

716
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,800
People like Shan Huajing

717
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,070
don't work for free.

718
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,640
No pay, no service.

719
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,540
I understand.

720
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,280
How much should I offer?

721
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,250
Is the shipment you mentioned

722
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,920
the Halloween merchandise

723
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,380
you're sending to Europe?

724
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,410
That's quite a large shipment.

725
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,400
I think

726
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,270
you'll need to prepare at least 100,000.

727
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,070
That much?

728
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,750
I'll need to call Mr. Lu

729
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,320
to discuss this with him.

730
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,720
About delivering the money,

731
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,830
will you do it

732
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:19,850
or will Lu do it?

733
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,680
I'll do it.

734
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,870
I've always been the one
dealing with Ms. Shan.

735
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,730
If you're going to deliver it,

736
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,070
be careful.

737
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,640
Also,

738
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,160
if your company has any financial issues,

739
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,800
come to me. I can help.

740
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,230
Don't worry about it.

741
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,790
Once you've sold this shipment

742
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,440
and made a profit,

743
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,880
you can pay me back then.

744
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,740
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

745
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,790
Don't worry about it now. Let's eat.

746
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,350
After dinner,

747
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,750
you can still call Mr. Lu.

748
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
Besides, I think

749
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,900
this matter

750
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,260
won't be a big problem.

751
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,400
Eat up.

752
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,120
That's what Yan Jun said?

753
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,940
This woman is really greedy.

754
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,550
But there's only 50,000 yuan
left in the company account.

755
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,980
For the remaining 50,000,

756
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,240
I'll figure something out quickly.

757
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,070
Mr. Lu,

758
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,610
it's already too late.

759
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,590
Let's do this.

760
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,920
I'll take care of

761
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,570
the remaining 50,000.

762
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,630
Good.

763
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,130
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

764
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,170
I don't know anything.

765
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,510
I didn't hear anything.
Don't tell me about it.

766
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,850
I'm going to Qipu Road to sell pants.

767
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,510
You guys talk. I know nothing.

768
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,090
I'll hurry to the bank
and withdraw the money for you.

769
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,680
Here, take this, girl.

770
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,500
Here's your change.

771
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,240
All right.

772
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Come back if you need anything else.

773
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,260
Don't pass by without stopping!

774
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,750
Export-quality jeans and shirts!

775
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,409
Export-quality jeans and shirts here!

776
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,030
These are all premium goods for export.

777
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,360
Foreign merchandise!

778
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,670
You can't find these anywhere else.

779
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,400
Jiuling.

780
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,800
What brings you here, Beichuan?

781
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,670
I'm here with my students
for field research.

782
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,360
Are any of them like that girl
from the other day

783
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,190
who bought everything in sight...

784
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,630
No, no.

785
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,800
Not anymore.

786
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,350
I heard from Xining
that you're becoming a writer.

787
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,139
Are you writing novels?

788
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,840
So you're going to be a famous author.

789
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,000
Don't forget about me, okay?

790
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,630
How could I?

791
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,320
You might just walk by someday,

792
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,630
pretending you don't know me anymore.

793
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,960
-No way.
-And then even spit on me.

794
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,500
Jiuling.

795
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,230
You would never?

796
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,630
When you all become successful,

797
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,889
don't forget about me.

798
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,960
What success are you talking about?

799
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
Right now we're hanging by a thread.

800
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,230
Mr. Lu had a good plan.

801
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,000
He planned to finish this batch of goods

802
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,590
and ship them abroad before

803
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,360
the European Halloween.

804
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,630
But now

805
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,490
they're stuck at customs.

806
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,270
You know that woman,

807
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,800
Shan Huajing,
is so difficult to deal with.

808
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,400
I thought

809
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,030
that my two boxes of farm eggs

810
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,480
would be enough as a small gift.

811
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,190
But then Ye and Mr. Lu

812
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:15,920
gave me a hard time about it.

813
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,320
I didn't understand why.

814
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,610
Now I finally get it.

815
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,550
Come, take a look!

816
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,690
She looks down on our little gifts.

817
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,150
When I heard what those two

818
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,550
were planning to give today,
I was shocked.

819
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,430
What are they giving?

820
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,470
Money, of course.

821
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,260
They're giving her money?

822
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,840
How much?

823
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,820
No, I can't tell you.

824
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,510
If I tell you, aren't we accomplices?

825
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,840
We're not accomplices.

826
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
Tell me quickly, Jiuling. How much?

827
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,840
I'm already upset about it.

828
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,170
I might as well tell you.

829
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,030
Hurry up.

830
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,740
100,000 yuan.

831
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,540
100,000.

832
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,670
Well.

833
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,630
Don't tell anyone I told you.

834
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,960
Don't miss out, everyone!

835
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,350
What's wrong?

836
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,510
What's in your bag?

837
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,720
A few books for my friend.

838
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,630
Some books?

839
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,800
Let me check them for you.

840
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,550
No need.

841
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,360
I just picked up some novels.

842
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,620
I need to go now.

843
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,800
Wait.

844
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,980
You're going to see Shan Huajing, right?

845
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,510
It's illegal to bribe a public servant.

846
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,030
Didn't you help Yan Jun
do the same thing before?

847
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,400
I didn't know about it then.

848
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,440
Then you can pretend not to know now too.

849
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,280
Ye Xining,

850
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,670
please calm down.

851
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,000
Be clear-headed, okay?

852
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,320
I am perfectly clear-headed.

853
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,050
It's because I am clear-headed

854
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,800
that I don't want
the factory to close down.

855
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,190
Right now, Shan Huajing
is blocking this shipment

856
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:03,840
from leaving customs.

857
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,960
What am I supposed to do?

858
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,510
If the goods can't be shipped,
the factory will close.

859
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,590
All the employees will lose their jobs.

860
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,510
Can you take that responsibility?

861
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,550
But you can't use illegal means

862
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,030
to solve this problem.

863
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,190
Think about it carefully.

864
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,230
There must be legal and compliant ways.

865
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,230
I've already thought of
every possible solution.

866
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,800
You think I want to do this?

867
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,280
You're in your ivory tower.
You don't understand.

868
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,080
You have no idea

869
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,940
how complicated the business is.

870
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,030
Yes.

871
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,440
I don't know what business is like,

872
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,690
but I know the principles
of being a decent person.

873
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,500
Enough!

874
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,320
I really hate that arrogant
teacherly attitude of yours!

875
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,730
Always standing on your moral high ground,

876
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,030
lecturing me on
how to behave and what to do.

877
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,230
Would you stop it?

878
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,030
Aren't you being hypocritical?

879
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,090
I'm hypocritical?

880
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,450
Ye Xining.

881
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,830
Aren't you being hypocritical?

882
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,520
Ask yourself honestly.

883
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,030
You usually act

884
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,840
so close with Shan Huajing,

885
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,990
but is there really pure friendship

886
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,670
between you two?

887
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,840
Are you two really like close sisters?

888
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,230
She asks you for 100,000 yuan today,
and you give it to her.

889
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,630
What if she asks for 100 million tomorrow?

890
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,680
Would you give it to her?

891
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,510
What's it to you, Xiang Beichuan?

892
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,960
If she asks for a billion,
I'll give it to her too.

893
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,890
Whatever she wants, I'll give it to her.

894
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,400
You're just a university teacher.

895
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Your mouth is full of morality talk.
It's disgusting.

896
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,230
How much money
have you earned for us?

897
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,900
Have you earned enough for a car?

898
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,280
Or enough for a house?

899
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,030
Ye Xining.

900
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,000
I want you to look at yourself right now.

901
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
You said you hated Director Jin before.

902
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,550
You hated Yan Jun.

903
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,400
But what about now?

904
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,110
You've become just like them.

905
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,670
Where is your conscience? Your principles?

906
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,190
Have you thrown them away?

907
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,630
Are you crazy?

908
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,020
You can't go!

909
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,120
What are you doing?

910
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,510
I have to go!

911
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,320
Leave me alone!

912
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,890
Why are you here?

913
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,110
Ms. Shan.

914
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,880
I came to see you.

915
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,680
Alright, let's go upstairs
and sit for a while.

916
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,110
Come in.

917
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,830
No need to change your shoes.

918
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,920
Have a seat.

919
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
Did you come today

920
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,030
because customs is holding back

921
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,890
that shipment from your company?

922
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,710
No.

923
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,960
I wanted to treat you to dinner.

924
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,350
What would you like to eat? We can go out.

925
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,330
I'm on a diet recently.

926
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,610
I don't eat dinner.

927
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,950
You have such a great figure.

928
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,210
You don't need to diet.

929
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,630
Let's go out to eat.

930
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,480
Why do we need to go out?

931
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,150
Ye.

932
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,520
You're not as straightforward
as you used to be.

933
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,710
Ye.

934
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,880
You've been talking to me for so long,

935
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,230
and I still don't understand

936
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,690
what you're trying to say.

937
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,510
If you don't have anything else,

938
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,670
you should go now.

939
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,210
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

940
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,320
Huajing.

941
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,100
Actually, I came today

942
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,920
to bring you

943
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,630
some books.

944
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,500
They're some classic novels.

945
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,030
Who is it?

946
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,150
I'll get it.

947
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,510
Section Chief Shan.

948
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,920
I just want to have
a quick word with Xining.
