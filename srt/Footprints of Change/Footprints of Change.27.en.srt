00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,710
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,430
Hello?

4
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,680
What?

5
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,970
Could you speak louder?
I can't hear you clearly.

6
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,760
Mr. Lu went to a meeting in the town.

7
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,360
Tell me if you need anything.

8
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,590
What?

9
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,430
Manager Sun?

10
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,870
Manager Sun escaped?

11
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
What do you mean?

12
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,400
Well, our...

13
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,840
Our…

14
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,360
Our shipment

15
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,800
hasn't been paid yet.

16
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,770
Who's going to take responsibility
for this?

17
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,680
Please inform Mr. Lu

18
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,360
that due to this serious event,

19
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,960
headquarters will send someone

20
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,360
to sort it out.

21
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,240
All operations will be suspended
until the incident is solved.

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,430
We have no choice.

23
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,360
If you don't pay us,

24
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,630
how can our company continue to operate?

25
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,590
And to purchase the raw materials
for these shirts,

26
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,470
we're now in debt to the bank.

27
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,530
Hello?

28
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,150
Hello?

29
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,280
Mr. Lu.

30
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,060
Are you with Jiuling now?

31
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,680
Come back right away.

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,010
Something's happened.

33
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,130
Hurry up.

34
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,120
Mr. Lu.

35
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,610
Did you call the police?

36
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,110
Yes.

37
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,990
The police are looking for Manager Sun.

38
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,590
He took all the money
in the company's account.

39
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,220
How about contacting
that foreigner,

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,400
the one who wants the goods?

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,870
We can exchange the goods
with him directly.

42
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,280
The foreigner transferred all the money

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,329
to Manager Sun.

44
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,910
But Manager Sun took the money
and ran away.

45
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,079
That guy has lost confidence in this.

46
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,110
How could he cooperate with us?

47
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,370
What should we do then?

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,960
How about

49
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,150
setting up a stall at Qipu Road?

50
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,190
You idiot.

51
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
Qipu Road Market

52
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,430
is for young people.

53
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,610
It's full of college students.

54
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,700
I could cut some holes in jeans
and sell them.

55
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,329
But what about business shirts?

56
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,730
Cut holes in shirts, too?

57
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,210
You're really something.

58
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,150
Why do we keep losing money
when doing business with you?

59
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,480
Have you ever made any profit?

60
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,230
Ye wanted

61
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,680
to tell me about it back then.

62
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,560
But you stopped her.

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,960
You said, "Ye, don't tell her."

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,280
If you told me, I would have stopped it.

65
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,960
I told you to increase income
and reduce expenses.

66
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,600
Did you follow my words?

67
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,750
The factory is so big

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,320
with so many workers.

69
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,670
We don't have any orders.

70
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,200
How can those workers live?

71
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,880
How can they support their families?

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,070
You're not a factory director anymore.

73
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,190
Your company has to be responsible
for its own profits and losses.

74
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,950
But you're still taking care of others.

75
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,200
You can barely feed yourself in this way.

76
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,810
Don't blame me for being harsh.

77
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,070
We're relatives, and Ye isn't an outsider.

78
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,240
Ye has always been behind you,

79
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,310
cleaning up your mess.

80
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,910
Alright, alright, Jiuling.

81
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,780
This incident has happened.

82
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,480
Getting anxious and upset won't help.

83
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,010
It won't solve the problem.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,750
We should be

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
more optimistic.

86
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,490
Let's think of a solution now.

87
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,050
Right.

88
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,020
Ye is right.

89
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,280
I have many friends I know well.

90
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,670
I'll find them

91
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,970
and see if there are sales channels.

92
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,630
I'll leave the company to you.

93
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,280
What are you going to do?

94
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,140
I'm going to find sales channels.

95
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,810
Hey, Beichuan.

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,880
Recently,

97
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,950
I've read some of your articles.

98
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,040
You've improved,

99
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,620
especially in characterization.

100
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,750
It's very good.

101
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,550
Characters grow
from real-life experiences.

102
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,480
It seems

103
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,480
everything

104
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,770
needs to be considered dialectically.

105
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,480
This change for you

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,560
is a blessing in disguise.

107
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,790
Mr. Zhong.

108
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,540
I just scored

109
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,240
a lucky hit.

110
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,130
What's more, Beichuan,

111
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,320
I agree with your idea

112
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,800
of taking students

113
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,130
to meet all kinds of people
in the society.

114
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,070
Only in this way,

115
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,240
can they create more profound characters

116
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,040
when they return to class.

117
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,030
Thank you for your approval.

118
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,310
I believe creative work requires
immersion in life

119
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,310
and observation.

120
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,540
Guo.

121
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,730
What do you think

122
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,430
of Beichuan's idea?

123
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,450
Mr. Zhong.

124
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,870
I think it's an excellent idea.

125
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,970
Beichuan is smart

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,270
and always ahead of us.

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,510
He often comes up with

128
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,040
teaching methods that can
benefit students.

129
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,750
Perhaps you should also

130
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,360
take your students

131
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,720
to observe the outside world.

132
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,160
Yes.

133
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,150
Yes.

134
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,240
I absolutely will.

135
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,040
Good.

136
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,510
Jiuling.

137
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,290
Are we really going to sell the goods
to Yu Dacheng?

138
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,090
Yes.

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,040
Didn't you just discuss it
with him on the phone?

140
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,070
The price he offered is acceptable.

141
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,270
The price is okay.

142
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,250
But I'm afraid the dealer
is not reliable.

143
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,160
But we don't have any other options
right now.

144
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Just give it a try.

145
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
Yu Dacheng is not bad.

146
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,810
At this critical moment,

147
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,670
he's willing to offer this price.

148
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,360
We should not care about
who he sells the goods to.

149
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,490
He's paying in cash.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,659
We can't afford to lose money.

151
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,510
Okay.

152
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,890
Let's give it a try.

153
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,780
Everybody,

154
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,360
from today,

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,040
our class content

156
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,650
will undergo some changes.

157
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,270
I will take you all

158
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,990
to the Qipu Road Clothing Market

159
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,470
for field research

160
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,580
and sketching.

161
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,190
Everyone should not

162
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,830
just take a superficial look

163
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,970
but carefully observe

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,160
the characters you're going
to write about.

165
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,920
One week later,

166
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,150
I expect everyone
to submit your assignments.

167
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,520
Any genre is acceptable,

168
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,450
including essays, short stories, or poems.

169
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,070
Professor Beichuan is really nice.

170
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,680
Yeah.

171
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,560
I like his classes too.

172
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,390
And he will even take us to
the Qipu Road Market.

173
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,640
Then whose class don't you like?

174
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,140
Isn't it obvious?

175
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,870
Is it right to gossip about teachers?

176
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,270
Hurry up and get to class.

177
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,970
[36 Tactics]

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,130
This is the pink one.

179
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,430
And there's a light blue one.

180
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,600
Why are two pieces missing
from the light blue set?

181
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,870
Did you put them in that box earlier?

182
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,360
Here they are.

183
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,000
Bosses, food is here.

184
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,550
Let's eat something first.

185
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,390
Are they the same?

186
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,030
Sis.

187
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,290
Thank you. Thank you.

188
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,900
These are all dishes she likes.

189
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,410
These aren't dishes I like.

190
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,620
Well, what should we do?

191
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,480
Everyone dotes on their own wife.

192
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,670
Come on.

193
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,050
I'm just in the way.

194
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,910
You guys eat first.

195
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,250
Is there anything I can help with?

196
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,050
Why don't you seal that opening?

197
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,360
Okay?

198
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,690
No need to ask for my opinion.

199
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,690
Beichuan.

200
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,190
If everyone

201
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,190
at your school buys one,

202
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,200
all our goods

203
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
would be sold out, right?

204
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,360
Jiuling,

205
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,090
don't get this nerd in trouble.

206
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,240
Their school strictly forbids
this kind of behavior.

207
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,150
If they label him with workplace safety
violations,

208
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,080
he's doomed.

209
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,539
Workplace safety?

210
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,510
Come to work happy,

211
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,970
and go home safe and sound.

212
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,010
You meant campus business
activities, right?

213
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,680
Yes. I misspoke.

214
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,240
It's okay.

215
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,960
Jiuling, how about this?

216
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,450
I'll go with you to set up the stall
this weekend.

217
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,250
That won't work.

218
00:08:59,250 --> 00:08:59,930
See?

219
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,730
Aren't you busy writing your book?

220
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,020
You have no spare time.

221
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,880
Then how about this?

222
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,020
I'll spend my own money

223
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,620
and buy a hundred or so items.

224
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,900
You're still arguing.

225
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,440
Beichuan.

226
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,200
From now on,

227
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,770
you need to save money.

228
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,410
You need to save up

229
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,030
for a car,

230
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,790
appliances,

231
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,360
and a wedding.

232
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,270
No need.

233
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,330
I'll buy my own car and all that stuff.

234
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,360
So you mean

235
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,630
you want Beichuan to marry into
your family?

236
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,480
It's so easy to do so.

237
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,000
It depends on my willingness

238
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,090
and how he behaves.

239
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,960
Alright.

240
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,700
Is there anything else I can do?

241
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Go write your romance novel.

242
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,790
You're just making a mess here.

243
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,320
Then,

244
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,590
you eat first.

245
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,530
I'll go make some soup for you.

246
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,260
Thank you, Beichuan.

247
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,190
Beichuan is a nice guy
with a great personality.

248
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,590
He listens to everything you say.

249
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,270
That's because everything I say is right.

250
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,530
Oh my god!

251
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,720
You're

252
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,000
so self-admiring.

253
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Treasure him.

254
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:10,870
Jiuling,

255
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,150
he should be the one treasuring me.

256
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,750
I can't stand listening to this anymore.

257
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,440
It's unbearable.

258
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,270
What are you doing?

259
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,790
Just eat your food.

260
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,360
I'll eat too.

261
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,290
You like this dish. Let's share it.

262
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,690
I believe that your products

263
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,680
are of high quality.

264
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,940
How about this?

265
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,430
My buddies and I will take
this whole batch.

266
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,750
Mr. Yu.

267
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,030
You're truly a straightforward person.

268
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,320
No, no. You don't have to be so polite.

269
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,650
Just call me Yu Dacheng.

270
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,150
Now let's talk about the price.

271
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,480
Mr. Yu.

272
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,580
Didn't we already agree on a price?

273
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
Things have changed.

274
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,660
Plans can't keep up with changes, right?

275
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,750
Mr. Yu.

276
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,440
In business,

277
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,270
what matters most is credibility.

278
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,960
We've already signed an agreement.

279
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,360
How can you just change it?

280
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,320
Let me tell you something.

281
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,600
Don't try to fool me.

282
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,480
When we were already in this business,

283
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,080
you were nowhere to be found.

284
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,580
Use Mr. Lu to threaten me?

285
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,740
Let him talk to me himself.

286
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,950
Listen.

287
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,700
Sell this batch of shirts

288
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,910
at half price,

289
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,200
or let them collect dust
in your warehouse

290
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,410
and turn into garbage.

291
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,670
Garbage? How dare you?

292
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,590
If you can't sell them,
they're just garbage.

293
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,400
I want to sell you at half price!

294
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,200
Why are you shouting?

295
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,440
Our products are hot sellers
in Eastern Europe.

296
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,600
50% off? No way.

297
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,820
How shameless you are!

298
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,660
Ask others that

299
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,740
who still deals with Old Lu these days?

300
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,880
Only we few still treasure
our old friendship

301
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,120
and want to help him.

302
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,120
Hot sellers?

303
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,030
Let me tell you.

304
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,840
Anything that can't be sold is garbage.

305
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,030
Dare you say it again?

306
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,600
No, you...

307
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,440
Then don't buy it.

308
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,550
Why are you still standing here? Get out!

309
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,910
Get out!

310
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,000
Hey, harridans,

311
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,150
is this the way you do business?

312
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,150
Who are you calling harridans?

313
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,630
You.

314
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,600
Say it again.

315
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,340
Harridans.

316
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,270
What are you doing?

317
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:51,960
How dare you! Shameless!

318
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,510
How dare you hit me?

319
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,670
So many people are watching.

320
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,440
I have three men backing me up.

321
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,360
We have a whole workshop of men.
We are fearless.

322
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,240
Guys!

323
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,720
Grab your tools and fight against them.

324
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,600
Let's go!

325
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,130
Listen.

326
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,840
Wait and see.

327
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,100
I'll beat you to death!

328
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,650
What a way to run a business?

329
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,760
Get lost!

330
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,100
Shameless!

331
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,990
Mr. Zhong.

332
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,190
If you and your wife like these products,

333
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,330
please help promote them
among your friends and family.

334
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,330
Alright.

335
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,950
Mr. Guo.

336
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,530
I brought shirts for everyone
in the office.

337
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,590
This one is for you.

338
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Professor Xiang.

339
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,950
Why are you giving everyone shirts?

340
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,920
My partner's factory is having
difficulties lately.

341
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,780
Their shirts are selling poorly.

342
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,920
But don't worry.

343
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,070
These are high-quality shirts.

344
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,700
They were made for export
but now sold domestically.

345
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,750
Sandwashed Silk.

346
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,430
Mr. Zhong.

347
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,540
Did you take some too?

348
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,540
I took two.

349
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,080
Look.

350
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,790
This whole box of shirts

351
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,200
will cost at least two months
of his salary.

352
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,910
Someone who dates in this way

353
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,220
is rare these days.

354
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,580
That's what I should do.

355
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,740
Large and extra-large.

356
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,500
I want extra-large.

357
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,340
Okay.

358
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,830
Professor Xiang.

359
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,870
I saw some green ones in that box.

360
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,530
Can I exchange for a green one?

361
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,600
Sure.

362
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,460
Thank you.

363
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,030
Mr. Guo.

364
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,360
You said you wanted to change
to a green one.

365
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,820
There are no more green ones
in extra-large.

366
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,860
I think there are yellow ones
in extra-large.

367
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,480
Well.

368
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,030
Alright.

369
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,720
Good-quality shirts on sale!

370
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,910

Take a look, ladies!

373
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,660
Look, this is really good!

374
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,360
How long it will take

375
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,470
to sell them all?

376
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,550
Take a look!

377
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,630
Check out these shirts!

378
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,390
Have a look?

379
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,830
Buy one for your wife!

380
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,010
Mr. Yan!

381
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,000
Mr. Yan, what brought you here?

382
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,670
Mr. Yan.

383
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,720
Come see our shirts. Come on.

384
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,080
Take a look at our goods.

385
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,610
Is this market merchandise? No.

386
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,980
These are for export.

387
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,080
These are all for export. Take a look.

388
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,000
They're excellent. Come on.

389
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,720
Come on.

390
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,250
What happened to Lu Guoyao?

391
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,330
I've asked around.

392
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,240
Manager Sun is a fraud.

393
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,550
He swindled money from foreign investors

394
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,660
but he didn't give it to you.

395
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,970
Now he's gone.

396
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,940
I want some of these goods.

397
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,670
Really, Mr. Yan?

398
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,920
Oh my goodness.

399
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,000
Well, now

400
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,240
I'll have all these goods loaded for you.

401
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,710
You're a big help, Mr. Yan.

402
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,640
I'm not stingy. I'll give you a discount.

403
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,790
How about 1% off?

404
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,710
You're too shocked to speak, huh?

405
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,550
5% off.

406
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,050
I'm just joking with you.

407
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,340
How about this?

408
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,710
I'll give you 20% off.

409
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,350
Take half of the goods. Cash payment.

410
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,410
No credit allowed.

411
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,450
What are you doing?

412
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,950
-5% off. He didn’t say no.
-Okay.

413
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,080
Draft the contract.

414
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,200
Alright.

415
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,080
Mr. Yan is helping us
with the 20% discount.

416
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,830
We're in a difficult situation, right?

417
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,360
No.

418
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,310
How could you

419
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,730
sell all the shirts out?

420
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,730
Don't worry.

421
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,050
I never make deals that lose money.

422
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,910
I have channels

423
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,520
to sell them to Eastern Europe.

424
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,590
Look at Mr. Yan.

425
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,990
He has connections in Eastern Europe.

426
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,530
And then look at Mr. Lu.

427
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,120
He ran away.

428
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,360
He seemed like an honest person.

429
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,630
But look what he did.

430
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,000
He left two women here
to mind the store.

431
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,700
It's so frustrating.

432
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,680
Xining.

433
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,260
My offer still stands.

434
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,480
If you want,

435
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,520
you can come work for me anytime.

436
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,150
Mr. Yan.

437
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,010
How much salary are you offering?

438
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,030
I promised

439
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,250
3,000 yuan per month

440
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,790
plus bonuses and commission.

441
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,840
Deal!

442
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,670
Give us 6,000 yuan

443
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,950
and we'll both work for you.

444
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,550
Don't make decisions for me.

445
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,000
My priority right now

446
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,480
is to clean up this mess.

447
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,270
Right.

448
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,530
Clean up the mess.

449
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,960
Once we clean up this mess,

450
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,290
we'll come work for you.

451
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,360
You said you have channels
in Eastern Europe.

452
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,740
If I want to go to Eastern Europe,

453
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
I need to get an invitation letter.

454
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,630
How can I get it?

455
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,980
Don't worry. I'll handle it for you.

456
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,630
It must be expensive.
How much does it cost?

457
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,490
Not expensive.

458
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,270
It's just a piece of paper. Not expensive.

459
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh my! Just a piece of paper?

460
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,360
I know it.

461
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,670
That piece of paper

462
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
is worthy of 3,000

463
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,520
dollars.

464
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,000
Just a piece of paper?

465
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,030
That's easy for you to say.

466
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,680
Jiuling,

467
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,109
pack everything up

468
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,160
and deliver the package to my company.

469
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,880
Then,

470
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,960
I'll pay you in person.

471
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,550
Alright.

472
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,310
Okay.

473
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,270
When would be a good time for me to come?

474
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,000
If you make

475
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,200
me do it,

476
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,790
I could deliver it tonight.

477
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,859
But I think the best time would be

478
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,910
tomorrow morning.

479
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,670
Why?

480
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,710
Because when I deliver
these goods tomorrow,

481
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,550
we can start working in his company
right away.

482
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,550
Hold on, Jiuling.

483
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,470
Drink more water

484
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,470
and talk less.

485
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,870
Xining, I'll be going now.

486
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,330
I'll have her deliver the goods to you later.

487
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,480
Bye, Mr. Yan.

488
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,650
Be careful. The road is slippery.

489
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,580
How many shirts are left?

490
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,840
What are you going to Eastern Europe for?

491
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,710
To find Old Lu?

492
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,110
Eastern Europe is huge.

493
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,570
Where would I look for him?

494
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,480
Don't tell me

495
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,720
you're going to run away

496
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,200
just like him,

497
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,480
and leave me here.

498
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,840
Am I that kind of person?

499
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,120
But there is one problem.

500
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,590
This batch of shirts,

501
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,870
from raw materials to pattern making,

502
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,760
is aimed at the high-end market.

503
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,680
Mr. Yan is taking half of them.

504
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,270
We can't just sit here,

505
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,950
selling the rest
at a street stall every day.

506
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,160
Got it.

507
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,190
You want to sell goods to Eastern Europe.

508
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,920
I'll try to

509
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,850
expand the international market.

510
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,030
I've

511
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,590
noticed something.

512
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,720
What's that?

513
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,550
Does Mr. Yan

514
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,130
like you?

515
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,550
Men like Mr. Yan

516
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,010
can like many women at the same time.

517
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,640
Come on!

518
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,490
I don't think Mr. Yan likes me.

519
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,200
Jiuling,

520
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,570
drink more water

521
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,490
and talk less.

522
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,350
Oh my!

523
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,380
You two are really in sync now.

524
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,580
Write an application

525
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,310
and I'll submit it for you.

526
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,750
That's wonderful, Mr. Zhong.

527
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,050
Our school is finally caring about

528
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,380
the housing issues for us young teachers.

529
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,480
I,

530
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,110
Beichuan,

531
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,000
and Professor Liu

532
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,760
have been working for so many years.

533
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,160
We were worried we might not get a house

534
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,000
even by the time we retire.

535
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,160
Now the problem is solved.

536
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
We are going to live in the same building.

537
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,420
It will be convenient for us to have
academic exchanges and discuss work,

538
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
right, Beichuan?

539
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,430
But you have to hurry up.

540
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,400
These dormitory buildings
are in high demand.

541
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,120
Not everyone can get a room.

542
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,000
Then,

543
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,510
what is the housing allocation policy?

544
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,590
Is it based on seniority or

545
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,530
teaching performance?

546
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,720
I don't know.

547
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,240
It will be decided by school leadership.

548
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,110
Anyway,

549
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,880
act quickly.

550
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,590
By the way, Beichuan,

551
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,310
as for

552
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:52,920
our years of service,

553
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,720
which of us has been here longer?

554
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,770
No need to think about it.
I remember it.

555
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,030
I arrived one semester earlier than you.

556
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,310
Good-quality shirts on sale!

557
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,110
Jiuling.

558
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,050
What brought you here?

559
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,120
I finished my class.

560
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,160
I came over

561
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,790
to help you and Xining.

562
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,680
Xining isn't here.

563
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,510
She went out.

564
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,310
Don't leave.

565
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,830
You have no classes today, right?

566
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,070
Help me call out to customers.

567
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm a bit tired.

568
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,680
No problem.

569
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,350
Okay.

570
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,270
Come on!

571
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,160
How should I call out, Jiuling?

572
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,440
Follow me.

573
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,070
Factory overrun sale!
Authentic shirts and jeans for export!

574
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,070
Factory overrun sale!
Authentic shirts and jeans for export!

575
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,790
And then

576
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,700
you need to raise your voice at the end!

577
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,860
Factory overrun sale!
Authentic shirts and jeans for export!

578
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,480
Okay.

579
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:53,750
Yes.

580
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,310
Then I can relax now.

581
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,640
I'll have a rest.

582
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,980
You take it easy first.

583
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,730
Factory overrun sale!
Authentic shirts and jeans for export!

584
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,310
Professor Xiang,

585
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,320
why are you selling goods here?

586
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,050
I'm helping Miss Ye sell her products.

587
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,110
This stall belongs to their factory.

588
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,100
So Miss Ye is a street vendor.

589
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,040
Well then,

590
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,160
I'll help Miss Ye too.

591
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,550
I'll take

592
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,920
ten of these shirts.

593
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
Tong Tong, don't mess around.

594
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You can't wear ten shirts anyway.

595
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,430
I may not wear them all,

596
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,040
but I can give them as gifts.

597
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,000
Come on, boss.

598
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,580
Give me ten of those shirts.

599
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,550
How many?

600
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,270
Ten.

601
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,790
Oh my!

602
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,350
No, Jiuling.

603
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,030
Don't get them for her.

604
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,160
She's my student.

605
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,400
What's wrong with that?
Students also wear clothes.

606
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,260
Her family can wear these shirts,

607
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:42,790
right?

608
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,030
Your dad and mom,

609
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,750
grandpa and grandma,

610
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,880
and the whole family can dress
in matching outfits

611
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,350
and going on a spring outing.
How nice would that look!

612
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,750
Right?

613
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,810
-I’ll pack the shirts for you.
-Yeah.

614
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,980
These shirts would look great on you.

615
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,640
Sweetie,

616
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,590
look.

617
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,000
Look at my jeans.

618
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,030
These are the latest style with rips.

619
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,350
They're super trendy.

620
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,640
Professor Xiang has 5 or 6 pairs.

621
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,830
But he doesn't dare wear them to school.

622
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,270
Look.

623
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,240
Do you like it?

624
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,550
Alright then.

625
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,480
I'll help Miss Ye a bit more.

626
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,000
I'll take

627
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,400
five pairs of jeans.

628
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,700
This girl knows what she wants!

629
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,200
I'll pack them up for you.

630
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,030
For these jeans,

631
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,370
I'll charge you 85 per pair.

632
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,060
Professor Xiang pays the same price.

633
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,550
No need.

634
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,420
I want to pay the original price.

635
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,680
Sweetie, the original price is 110 yuan.

636
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,730
Then I'll pay 110 yuan per pair.

637
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,270
Thank you, dear.

638
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,020
Wait, Tong Tong.

639
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,550
Do you have that much money?

640
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,960
How much is it, boss?

641
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,730
1,050 yuan in total.
Just give me 1,000 yuan.

642
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,590
Help pack them.

643
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,350
What are you doing?
Stop staring at her.

644
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,310
I'm counting them for you.

645
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:43,720
One.

646
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,550
Two.

647
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,830
Three.

648
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:46,960
Four.

649
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,870
Wait a minute.

650
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,520
Where did you get all this money?

651
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,030
It's just some pocket money

652
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,960
from my family.

653
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,080
All packed up for you.

654
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,000
It's a bit heavy.

655
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,350
Take these two in this hand,

656
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,880
and this in your other hand.

657
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,890
Professor Xiang,

658
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,480
I've bought so many products.

659
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,030
Can you get off work now?

660
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,430
This is none of your business.

661
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,630
Go back to school now.

662
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,280
Come back in a few days
when I get new styles in.

663
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,750
I found something unusual.

664
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,260
There is nothing special.

665
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,980
She's just a student of mine.

666
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,100
Factory overrun sale!
Authentic shirts and jeans for export!

667
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,460
Professor Xiang, you truly live up
to your reputation.

668
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,320
We've all

669
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,800
read your manuscript.

670
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,790
Do you know how we felt

671
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,120
after reading it?

672
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,630
How did you feel?

673
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,680
Your writing

674
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,120
is like a vast ocean.

675
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,310
And we editors

676
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,550
are like small boats on that ocean.

677
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,550
We're

678
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,100
planning to serialize it

679
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,430
and publish it as a book.

680
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,150
Senior.

681
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,250
Please stop teasing me.

682
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,590
I'm serious.

683
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,900
Your article is great.

684
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,200
We're ready to publish it.

685
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,350
Well, that's

686
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,750
good news for me.

687
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,790
And I've just

688
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,350
gathered some new materials recently.

689
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,310
I'll add them in later.

690
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,030
Okay.

691
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,430
Is there a student in your department

692
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,300
named Tong Tong?

693
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,080
Yes.

694
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,000
She came to see me a few days ago.

695
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,920
She claimed to be very close to you.

696
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,160
She wrote a manuscript

697
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,890
and insisted that I publish it.

698
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,830
I couldn't refuse her.

699
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,920
So, I glanced through it.

700
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,380
But I couldn't get into it.

701
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,110
It was all about trivial romances

702
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,400
and extremely explicit.

703
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,070
You know

704
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,750
this kind of article isn't suitable
for our publication.

705
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,310
So, I rejected her.

706
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,920
You don't mind it, do you?

707
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,180
Of course I don't mind.

708
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,020
Let me tell you.

709
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,350
Tong Tong

710
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,550
is just one of

711
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,200
my ordinary students.

712
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,590
I thought you two were really close.

713
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,550
Not at all.

714
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,720
Aren't you going to return that call?

715
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,880
Someone's looking for you.

716
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,140
I'm a bit embarrassed.

717
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,160
I'll go return that call first.

718
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,960
Go ahead.

719
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,670
I won't be home for dinner today.

720
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,820
Go out and get something to eat.

721
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,920
Stop eating instant noodles.

722
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,320
It's bad for your health.

723
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,640
You're not coming back to eat?

724
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,750
Where are you going?

725
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,150
I'm going to see Ms. Shan.

726
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,070
Why are you seeing her again?

727
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,310
I'm doing business.

728
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,910
Of course I have to visit her.

729
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:41,790
I'm done talking.

730
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,850
I need to drive now.

731
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,310
Ms. Shan.

732
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,720
Ye,

733
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,440
why are you here now?

734
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,310
Off work?

735
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,530
I'm not here for work.

736
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,030
I have some personal matters
to discuss with you.

737
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,880
Are you free tonight?

738
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,270
I'd like to treat you to dinner.

739
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,070
Okay.

740
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,550
Next time, don't park your car
at our office entrance.

741
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,480
Got it, Ms. Shan.

742
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,280
Let's go.

743
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,010
Making noodles?

744
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,400
Have you seen Yin recently?

745
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,750
Didn't he go to America?

746
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,160
I just received a postcard

747
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,220
sent by him from Canada a few days ago.

748
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,790
He never made it to America.

749
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,310
He was stopped at the Canadian border.

750
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,350
He said

751
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,880
he would settle scores with me
after he came back.

752
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,480
Tell him to try messing with me.

753
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,610
That's ridiculous.

754
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,720
If he really comes back to confront you,

755
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,790
you should return his money.

756
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,590
Why should I give him a refund?

757
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,980
How about this?

758
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,380
If you two run into each other,

759
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,830
just tell him

760
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,440
to save up more money.

761
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,420
This year I'll guarantee
he gets to America.

762
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,750
If I run into him,

763
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,720
I'll advise him to give up on this idea.

764
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,440
Do whatever you want.

765
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,380
One less client won't hurt me.

766
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,700
I'm going out for a bit.

767
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,490
Close the door when you leave.

768
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,200
Wait, aren't you going to
turn off the power?

769
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,240
Turn it off for me.

770
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,350
Ms. Shan,

771
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,270
is it okay for you to have dinner with me?

772
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,790
I hope I didn't interfere with you
picking up your child from school.

773
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,400
My son lives with his grandmother.

774
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,880
Her place is close to the school.

775
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,410
It's convenient
for drop-offs and pick-ups.

776
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,560
Are you curious about my child's father?

777
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,440
No.

778
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,930
Ms. Shan, I am not...

779
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,330
I'm not that nosy.

780
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,390
We live in different cities.

781
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,350
He's in Beijing,

782
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,610
and I'm in Shanghai.

783
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,240
Just give me your ID card,
household registration book,

784
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,920
and all the visa-related documents.

785
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,070
That's all I need.

786
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
Thank you for helping me.

787
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,720
Which country are you going to again?

788
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,510
Hungary.

789
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,510
Ms. Shan,

790
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,310
this is for your services.

791
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,680
No need.

792
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,880
I can't let you help me for free.

793
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,400
I said no, and I mean it.

794
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,920
Ms. Shan, please take this money.

795
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,450
If you keep insisting,
I won't help you at all.

796
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,520
This is so embarrassing.

797
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,860
You're starting a company.

798
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,950
Consider this my investment in you.

799
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,350
When you make it big,

800
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,130
don't forget about my help.

801
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,960
Ms. Shan,

802
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,960
I'll work really hard

803
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,690
and won't let you down.

804
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,550
Cheers to you.

805
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,330
Wish you great success.

806
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
I'll drink first,

807
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,260
no pressure on you.

808
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,960
Xu.

809
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,240
Beichuan.

810
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,480
You're finally here.

811
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,000
What's going on?

812
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,550
Sit down.

813
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,320
I've been waiting for ages.

814
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,030
What's so urgent?

815
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,310
Listen to me.

816
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,290
Do you remember

817
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,240
you gave me those two shirts?

818
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,310
When I tried them on,

819
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,020
I found that the fabric, and the texture,

820
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,500
were amazing.

821
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,310
Even in this heat,

822
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,110
when I wore them,

823
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,110
they didn't stick to my skin
or feel stuffy.

824
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,570
They're incredibly cool.

825
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,750
I didn't even want to take them
off before going to bed.

826
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,790
My wife said

827
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,160
they're obviously real silk.

828
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,790
Yes,

829
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,920
they certainly are.

830
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,000
Mr. Guo,

831
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,550
you called me here so urgently

832
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,680
just for this?

833
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,750
No,

834
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,550
but it's related.

835
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,920
Today, the supervisor from

836
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,120
the girls' dormitory

837
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,640
came to find me.

838
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,530
She brought two shirts

839
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,750
identical to the ones you gave me.

840
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,470
Exactly the same.

841
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
When I looked at them,

842
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,780
I found the fabric,

843
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,000
and the brand

844
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,480
were all identical.

845
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,750
What's going on?

846
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,160
They complained to me

847
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,680
that someone in the girls' dormitory

848
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,030
sold

849
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,890
and peddled

850
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,500
this kind of shirt.

851
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,470
The shirts are selling well.

852
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,270
How much did you pay for these shirts?

853
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,070
35 yuan.

854
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,690
They're selling them
with a price of 200 yuan now.

855
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,660
The shirts are of high quality.

856
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,120
Indeed it is.

857
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,110
So what exactly happened?

858
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,080
I conducted a thorough investigation.

859
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,310
I also looked into the anonymous letter

860
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,480
but couldn't find anything.

861
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,880
I've carefully investigated this matter.

862
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,780
Tong Tong.

863
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,590
Tong Tong

864
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,800
insisted

865
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,940
that she got the products

866
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,870
from you.

867
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,380
She said she wanted to help
you sell your products.

868
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,660
She said you are having a hard time,

869
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,230
teaching classes during the day,

870
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,450
and setting up stalls

871
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,000
to sell shirts in your spare time.

872
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,210
She was talking nonsense.

873
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,840
Beichuan,

874
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,070
you know that

875
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,600
students selling commercial products

876
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,400
on campus

877
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,750
is a serious violation of school rules.

878
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,680
And as a teacher,

879
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,750
you encouraged

880
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,880
and instigated her

881
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,400
to help you with sales.

882
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,350
At the very least,

883
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,230
this could ruin your teaching career.

884
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,920
And in the worst case,

885
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,510
the police station might get involved.

886
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,960
But don't worry.

887
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,680
I've already covered this up for you.

888
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,650
I spoke with the dorm supervisor.

889
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,160
I said that Professor Xiang

890
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,510
is an outstanding young teacher,

891
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,970
and we can't let such a small mistake

892
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,280
affect his future career.

893
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,480
Right?

894
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,050
The dorm supervisor

895
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,270
and I were

896
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,400
very close when we were young.

897
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,160
So

898
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,590
she has promised me

899
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,590
no one else would

900
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,880
know this issue.

901
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,390
No one else?

902
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,960
Who else knows this matter?

903
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,640
Well,

904
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,920
you, me,

905
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,590
Tong Tong, and the dorm supervisor.

906
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,790
There won't be a fifth person who knows.

907
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,110
I understand. Go on.

908
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,400
Let's stop here.

909
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,830
Nobody else knows about this.

910
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,290
We won't spread it around.

911
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,670
I've also spoken with Tong Tong.

912
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,440
So you can rest assured.

913
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,890
This absolutely won't affect your career.

914
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,490
Thank you, Xu.

915
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,100
Don't say that.

916
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,270
We've been working together
for so many years,

917
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:07,920
right?

918
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,640
It's nothing.

919
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,040
Yes.

920
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,380
There's one more thing.

921
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,270
I went back and carefully checked

922
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,440
my teaching notes.

923
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,960
Last time I told you my seniority

924
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
was one semester more than yours.

925
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,940
I was wrong.

926
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,490
It's one semester and three months

927
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:28,820
and two days.

928
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,590
Did you burn yourself?

929
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm fine.

930
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,130
I heard your school
is allocating apartments.

931
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,260
How big will they be?

932
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,640
Young teachers like me can only
get dormitory-style units.

933
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,280
I used to think being a teacher
meant job security.

934
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,980
Now it seems pretty boring.

935
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,219
Not that great.

936
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,989
And the competition is fierce.

937
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,190
Getting one unit would be lucky enough.

938
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Frogs in a well.

939
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,690
What do you mean?

940
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,350
I wasn't talking about you.

941
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,969
I meant you competitors for housing.

942
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,370
They're narrow-minded.

943
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,400
Indeed.

944
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,150
Those of us,

945
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,840
in a way,

946
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,520
are like frogs in a well.

947
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,230
Are you upset?

948
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:45,219
Not at all.

949
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,540
Actually, being a frog in a well
isn't that bad.

950
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,920
It's not as exhausting as businessmen.

951
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,360
They're all running around like crazy.

952
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,070
Besides, doing business

953
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,280
isn't something everyone can do.

954
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,320
So,

955
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,840
don't work too hard.

956
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,920
What else can I do?

957
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,970
Who am I doing this for?

958
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,670
We can't live

959
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,380
in this shabby warehouse
and eating instant noodles forever.

960
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,510
Even if you get that apartment,

961
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,620
we'll have children someday,

962
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,230
and we need someone to take care of them.

963
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,320
When your parents

964
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,510
or mine come to help,

965
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,440
where will such a big family live?

966
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,450
Will there be enough space?

967
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,040
Do you think

968
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,200
people will change?

969
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,770
Everyone changes.

970
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,650
What about us?

971
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,950
We'll change too.

972
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,720
But I think

973
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,880
we'll change for the better.

974
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,320
Why aren't you keeping silent?

975
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,920
Are you suggesting
we'll change for the worse?

976
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,040
Xiang Beichuan.

977
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,380
If I change one day,

978
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,700
will you still love me?

979
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,500
Change into what?

980
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,890
Like Shan Huajing?

981
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,750
I won't love you.

982
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,720
Like Yan Jun?

983
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,110
That would be even worse.

984
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,180
Why do you have such an attitude?

985
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,440
You are irresponsible.

986
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,190
You keep saying you love me.

987
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,370
But I casually mention two names,

988
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,570
and you say you can't love me in this way.

989
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,670
How can I believe in your love for me?

990
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,880
How can I believe in your love?

991
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,210
I'll ask you one more time.

992
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,840
If someday

993
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,250
I change,

994
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,890
will you still love me?

995
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,830
Yes.

996
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,510
Really?

997
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,360
Really.

998
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,740
Then hug me.

999
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,110
Beichuan.

1000
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,230
Tell me.

1001
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,710
We won't change, will we?

1002
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,000
Beichuan.

1003
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,840
Who are you?

1004
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,950
Let me introduce you.

1005
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,760
This is my friend.

1006
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,050
His name is Yin.

1007
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,960
Yin.

1008
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,500
This is my girlfriend.

1009
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:48,960
Hello.

1010
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,510
You guys talk first.

1011
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,770
I'll go back to my room.

1012
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,420
Buddy,

1013
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,270
remember to knock next time.

1014
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,870
Why did you suddenly come?

1015
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,540
Beichuan.

1016
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,150
Can you take me to find Yan Jun?

1017
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,840
I can take you to see him.

1018
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,710
But you need to tell me

1019
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,970
why you want to see him.

1020
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,510
I gave him all the money I earned

1021
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,190
working as a laborer in Europe.

1022
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,050
He said he could get me to America.

1023
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,550
But this time I was stopped
as soon as I entered Canada.

1024
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,460
I've tried to visit him several times

1025
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,820
since I came back, but I couldn't.

1026
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,080
Does he know you're back looking for him?

1027
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,360
Yes.

1028
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,730
Jiuling.

1029
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,620
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1030
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,150
Mr. Yan, you busy man.

1031
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,990
I was indeed held up by something.

1032
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,940
Next time, no matter what time,

1033
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,740
I'll arrive an hour early, okay?

1034
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,240
Have you ordered food?

1035
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,780
Not yet.

1036
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,810
Waiter!

1037
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,240
Two iced Americanos

1038
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,710
and two small cakes.

1039
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,400
Hurry up!

1040
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,660
What's wrong with you?

1041
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,320
When your heart is occupied with someone,

1042
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,900
your brain stops working, huh?

1043
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,160
You forgot I don't drink cold beverages?

1044
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,770
Sorry, sorry.

1045
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,280
Um,

1046
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,880
please change those two iced Americanos

1047
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,110
to hot ones.

1048
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,400
Forget it.

1049
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,920
I have a lot to do today.

1050
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,850
You can drink them yourself later.

1051
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,450
I'm just wondering

1052
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,440
why you are so concerned
about Ye's matters.

1053
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,000
Don't you know she has a boyfriend?

1054
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,670
He's your classmate too.

1055
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,120
What do you want to do?

1056
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,580
Me?

1057
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,680
I won't put pressure on them,

1058
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,950
and never even thought about it.

1059
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,480
But sometimes,

1060
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,150
devotion

1061
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,480
can be one-sided, right?

1062
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,070
This isn't like you, Mr. Yan.

1063
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,510
In all the time I've known you,

1064
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,280
you've never

1065
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,080
treated any other girl this way.

1066
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,550
Humans

1067
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,070
always have some moments

1068
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,400
of sincerity.

1069
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,260
In our talk today,

1070
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,320
I need to reassess the true Mr. Yan.

1071
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,110
You're mocking me.

1072
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,840
Well.

1073
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,660
I bought you a new pair of shoes.

1074
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,510
Take a look.

1075
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,120
Alright.

1076
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,710
The visa

1077
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,550
will be ready in about 20 days.

1078
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,350
Sorry for the trouble.

1079
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,610
No need to be so polite.

1080
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,360
If you're busy with something,

1081
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,480
I can wait a bit longer.

1082
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,250
I have a lot to deal with today.

1083
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,390
I'll take my leave.

1084
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,910
Thanks for your gift.

1085
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,510
I'm off.

1086
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,440
Let me know if you need anything.

1087
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,070
Beichuan.

1088
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,080
Do you know this type of dog?

1089
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,320
Chihuahua.

1090
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,890
Is it expensive?

1091
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,280
Why do you ask?

1092
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,070
That girl I mentioned

1093
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,440
likes this kind of dog.

1094
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,630
When I have money,

1095
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,230
I want to buy one for her.

1096
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:18,050
You'll definitely make your wish
come true.

1097
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,260
Yan Jun.

1098
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,820
Why are you here?

1099
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,800
Mr. Yan.

1100
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,760
I gave you

1101
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,280
all the money I earned
in Europe as a laborer.

1102
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
You said you could get me to America.

1103
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,920
But this time when I got to Canada,

1104
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,590
they sent me back.

1105
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,110
I've tried to find you several times
since I got back,

1106
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,510
but you refused to see me.

1107
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,360
I heard that since you came back,

1108
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,440
you've been threatening to deal with me.

1109
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,510
Did you say that?

1110
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,710
I gave you all my money
but nothing got done.

1111
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,000
How are you going to solve it?

1112
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,670
I'm asking you that

1113
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,470
did you threaten to deal with me?

1114
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,800
Get out.

1115
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,760
Yan Jun.

1116
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,690
Let's talk this through.

1117
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,840
Yin has his own difficulties, too.

1118
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,510
You...

1119
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,120
You get out, too.

1120
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,190
Who allowed you to bring him here?

1121
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,190
Hello.

1122
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,920
This is Yan Jun.

1123
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,250
I heard that stock has been
doing really well lately.

1124
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,710
So how much money is in my account now?

1125
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,440
Okay. Great.

1126
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,790
I'll definitely show
my appreciation later.

1127
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,250
Absolutely, absolutely.

1128
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,190
Yin.

1129
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,250
That's all for now.

1130
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,690
What are you doing, Yin?

1131
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,760
No.

1132
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:12,730
No.

1133
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,000
What's he doing?

1134
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,670
Why are you hitting yourself with a cup?

1135
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,550
Mr. Yan.

1136
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:19,710
I…

1137
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,490
I didn't mean anything by it.

1138
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,710
I just want to go to America.

1139
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,950
Please help me.

1140
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,490
Wipe the blood with some tissue.

1141
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,750
Going to America isn't impossible.

1142
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
Listen.

1143
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,830
The situation over there has changed.

1144
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,160
The money I gave them before
isn't enough.

1145
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,760
If you really want to go to America,

1146
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,090
you'll need to pay more.

1147
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,670
How much?

1148
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,840
I'll check how much more is needed

1149
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,710
and tell Beichuan. You tell him.

1150
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,360
Mr. Yan.

1151
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,070
I've already given you all my savings.

1152
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,710
If that's not enough,

1153
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,880
I'll figure something out.

1154
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,280
I'll borrow from others.

1155
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,680
But I'm begging you.

1156
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,200
Please help me get to America. Please.

1157
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,110
No problem.

1158
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,110
Beichuan.

1159
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,070
I faint at the sight of blood.

1160
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,840
Take him to the hospital.

1161
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,590
-Let's go.
-And let the doctor check

1162
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,550
whether you need stitches or something.

1163
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,480
Cover your head.

1164
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:24,960
This way.
