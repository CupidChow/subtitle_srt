00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,720
[Episode 17]

3
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,950
Come in.

4
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,590
Minister Wen,

5
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,590
I'm here to take your measurements.

6
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,520
Alright.

7
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,360
Well...

8
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,600
Let's just do it here.

9
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,240
Okay.

10
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,360
Please raise your arms.

11
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,490
Just hold your arms straight out.

12
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,010
So many measurements.

13
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,020
Don't you need to write them down?

14
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
I keep them in my head.

15
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,930
Please put your arms down.

16
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,270
That's a lot of numbers to remember.

17
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,680
It's just one person's measurements.

18
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,810
I can remember them.

19
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,970
Come on. Keep up.

20
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,590
Minister, Director Fang said

21
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,360
we should take
the suit measurements here. Is that right?

22
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,840
Yes.

23
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,750
There are too many people.
Let's go to the conference room.

24
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,910
Okay. Let's go.

25
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,079
The conference room works too.

26
00:03:59,079 --> 00:03:59,520
Your measurements are done.

27
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,910
It doesn't matter where we do it.

28
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,440
Let's go.

29
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,890
Please have a seat.

30
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,680
May I?

31
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,880
Of course.

32
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,870
I'm really curious—

33
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,510
your landscapes

34
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,190
have a touch of the French impressionist
Monet,

35
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,610
but your portraits,

36
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,310
especially this one of the female worker,

37
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,240
show the influence

38
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,490
of the Soviet realist Repin.

39
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,640
How do you manage

40
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,970
to combine both?

41
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,780
Can you stop drinking this fancy stuff?

42
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,750
Can it even fill your stomach?

43
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
I drink it too.

44
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,050
It's delicious.

45
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,360
You live here now.

46
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,920
It's different
from where you lived before.

47
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,250
You must maintain good relationships
with your neighbors.

48
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,120
Your voice is too low. We can't hear you.

49
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,000
During the Eastern Jin Dynasty...

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,310
Later, the common people all began to use…

51
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,110
Minister Wen?

52
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
What brings you here?

53
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,630
Thank you.

54
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,730
I know

55
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,360
your sense of aesthetics is different

56
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,260
from theirs.

57
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,720
That's an objective fact.

58
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,560
But I think

59
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,960
you can guide them, right?

60
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,760
How did you know I'm not leaving?

61
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,240
I mean...

62
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,200
if you weren't leaving.

63
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,360
This pen…

64
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,960
I've used it for a while.

65
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,370
It feels good in the hand.

66
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,810
I want you to have it.

67
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,020
I hope you'll stay

68
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,360
and keep creating.

69
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,480
Minister Wen?

70
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,570
Are you just passing by?

71
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,920
Yes,

72
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,870
I am.

73
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,890
What book are you reading?

74
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,159
A biography of Van Gogh.

75
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,390
You won't like it.

76
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,310
Why not?

77
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,270
Van Gogh

78
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,659
was too sensitive.

79
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,110
Artists

80
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,820
are all too sensitive.

81
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,510
But for an artist,

82
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,560
sensitivity

83
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,160
isn't a bad thing.

84
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,470
Today,

85
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,390
I actually have something to tell you.

86
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,720
You don't need to say it.

87
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,070
Why?

88
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,920
You know what I'm going to say?

89
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,270
I do.

90
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,750
Director Fang already told me.

91
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,510
Don't worry.

92
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,140
I'll take good care of myself.

93
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,840
I'll work hard

94
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,200
and live well.

95
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,200
I'll be fine.

96
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,080
I know

97
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,480
you're strong.

98
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
No one

99
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,580
can easily change you.

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,730
Well then...

101
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,470
I'll head back now.

102
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,960
I'm leaving too.

103
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,690
Yi.

104
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,980
Let me introduce you.

105
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,810
This is Xu Ke,

106
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,120
my college professor.

107
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,660
He's a great poet, very talented.

108
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,460
This is my sister-in-law, Yi Yi.

109
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,550
Didn't you say you were going out

110
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,120
with your classmates today?

111
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,360
I heard you'd be there too,

112
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,690
so I asked to come along.

113
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,930
Do we know each other?

114
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,460
Qing told me all about you.

115
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,270
It's my honor to go on a spring outing

116
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,270
with you today.

117
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,700
Professor Xu,

118
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,730
go after her.

119
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,460
Your bike!

120
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,080
Your bike.

121
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,280
Professor.

122
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,510
Ms. Yi,

123
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,490
why aren't you joining us?

124
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,450
I'm fine just watching you from here.

125
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,670
June in Shanghai

126
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,370
is my favorite time of year.

127
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,300
Look at the sky,

128
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,720
the trees,

129
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,240
the wind,

130
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,510
the grass,

131
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,320
and the river.

132
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,150
When they all come together,

133
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,150
they stir something in my heart.

134
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,010
What about you?

135
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,870
My mood doesn't change with the seasons.

136
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,000
Qing told me a couple of days ago

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,330
that I'd meet you today,

138
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
so I wrote a poem especially for you.

139
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,750
I think our resonance as intellectuals

140
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,960
often lies in words.

141
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,070
Let me read it for you.

142
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,620
Spring rain

143
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
coaxes the peach blossoms to smile;

144
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,670
summer nights

145
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,150
send off the day's clamor;

146
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,280
autumn wind scatters
the sorrow of fallen leaves;

147
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,630
winter snow

148
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,730
drapes the earth in silver.

149
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,250
Yet there is one more sight—

150
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,110
a river

151
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,330
of gentle starlight—

152
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,390
that's the grace of your smile.

153
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,460
Your smile

154
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,970
lights up my day,

155
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,210
brighter than a thousand suns.

156
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,360
Your smile

157
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,200
lights up my day,

158
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,600
brighter than a thousand suns.

159
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,240
Ms. Yi,

160
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,730
this is for you.

161
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
Thank you.

162
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,870
I think my poem

163
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,920
is quite ordinary in technique,

164
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,600
but I believe

165
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,960
it's rich with emotion.

166
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,920
So it doesn't sound too bad.

167
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,240
What kind of emotion?

168
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,560
My admiration for you.

169
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,540
You don't even know me yet.

170
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,080
Why do you admire me?

171
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,120
So, what do you think?

172
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,380
He's talented, right?

173
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,790
It's yours.

174
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,110
You don't like it?

175
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
She probably doesn't like pink.

176
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,620
Secretary Zhao,

177
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,020
try this foreign liquor.

178
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,870
Secretary Zhao,

179
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,040
my Mercedes

180
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,670
drives pretty well, right?

181
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,510
Nowadays,
all the young girls in Shanghai love it.

182
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
What's it called?

183
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,120
Mercadas?

184
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,360
Mercedes.

185
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,000
Not bad.

186
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,480
When I press the pedal...

187
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
it feels so good.

188
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,910
It's like an arrow.

189
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,550
Just like when I used to

190
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,670
charge on horseback in battle.

191
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,510
As we say in my hometown,

192
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,360
it's

193
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,240
mighty fine,

194
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,960
durn good.

195
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,960
Durn good!

196
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,470
Here.

197
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,270
I still can't get used to
this foreign stuff.

198
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,000
Here.

199
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,610
We have Chinese wine here.

200
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,670
No wonder they say

201
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,800
you really know cars, Secretary Zhao.

202
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,600
As you know,

203
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,320
leaving a car parked for too long

204
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,870
is bad for the engine.

205
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,840
I don't drive

206
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,320
that Mercedes much.

207
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,600
Secretary Zhao,
please drive it a few more days.

208
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,120
Let's drink.

209
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,400
Here's to you.

210
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,770
Secretary Zhao,

211
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,090
with the courage this drink gives me,

212
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,670
let me speak frankly.

213
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,720
Go ahead.

214
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,510
I don't think

215
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,270
you seem like an official.

216
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,670
As a provincial party secretary,

217
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,480
you should enjoy

218
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,720
the treatment
that comes with the position.

219
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,790
Just look at the officials before you—

220
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,590
they were so full of themselves.

221
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,270
I've said too much.

222
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,480
Secretary Zhao.

223
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,230
Mr. Fu.

224
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,560
What you said is true.

225
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,480
Let me tell you,

226
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,850
this country was won by us.

227
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,560
Yes.

228
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,790
Back when we fought the Japanese,

229
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,990
we stayed for days and nights

230
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,720
in caves

231
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,390
and tunnels,

232
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,610
without a bite to eat.

233
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,430
So now if I eat and drink a little,

234
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,960
that's not too much to ask, is it?

235
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,150
Of course not.

236
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,570
Here's to you, Secretary Zhao.

237
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,750
Besides, I'm at least

238
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,290
the top official in the region.

239
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,390
Here.

240
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,910
One more drink.

241
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,390
That's enough.

242
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,910
After this drink,

243
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,910
I should be going.

244
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,670
Secretary Zhao,

245
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,870
this watch is so old.

246
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,550
Why are you still wearing it?

247
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,610
What are you doing?

248
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,200
This one

249
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,000
matches more

250
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,290
with that "Mercadas."

251
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,050
No, no.

252
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,320
Just listen to me.

253
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,200
Secretary Zhao.

254
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,030
This isn't appropriate.

255
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,690
Come on.

256
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,550
It goes perfectly

257
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,680
with that Mercedes.

258
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,140
The young girls

259
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
like it even more.

260
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,670
Come on, let's drink up.

261
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,600
Is that so?

262
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,270
Here's to you.

263
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,930
If you need anything, feel free to ask.

264
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,990
Alright, alright.

265
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,080
Yang,

266
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,910
after this meal,

267
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,170
we'll say our temporary goodbyes.

268
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,790
When you get there, you must work hard.

269
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:37,490
Yes.

270
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,270
Do your best.

271
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,240
Alright.

272
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,840
Goodbye.

273
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,390
Say goodbye to Minister Wen too.

274
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:42,670
Yes.

275
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,840
Goodbye, Minister Wen.

276
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,700
Director Fang,

277
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,600
no matter where I go,

278
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,200
I'll always be your student.

279
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,670
I won't let you down.

280
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,080
Minister Wen,

281
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,690
during this past time

282
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,940
working with you,

283
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,810
I really

284
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,490
caused you quite a lot of trouble.

285
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,460
I realize

286
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,000
I was too young

287
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,320
and always eager for quick results.

288
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,510
In my new position,

289
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,960
I'll be humble, patient,

290
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,109
self-reflective,

291
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,440
and diligent in my work.

292
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,589
And...

293
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,920
I also want to give you some advice.

294
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,750
You're always so busy with work.

295
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,410
Please remember to eat on time

296
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,609
and get enough rest.

297
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,690
Anything else?

298
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,550
That's all.

299
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,079
Thank you.

300
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,869
Work hard.

301
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,920
I'm leaving now, Director.

302
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,980
Let's shake hands.

303
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,430
Work hard.

304
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,030
Let's go.

305
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,000
Goodbye, Minister Wen.

306
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,920
Okay. Goodbye.

307
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,630
Goodbye.

308
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,510
Goodbye.

309
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,900
Wen Pu.

310
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,970
Wen Pu, where are you going?

311
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,440
Wen Pu.

312
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,810
What are you looking at?

313
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,690
This is Fu Zihe's car, isn't it?

314
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,960
I've ridden in it before.

315
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,360
I heard
it's the only Mercedes in Shanghai.

316
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,990
Strange.

317
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,310
The license plate is different.

318
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,780
The license plate is different?

319
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,260
[Shengli Garment Factory]

320
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,930
Yi.

321
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,920
Yi.

322
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,350
Let's have dinner together tonight.

323
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,280
Don't you have a date with Mr. Yang?

324
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,510
My date with Mr. Yang

325
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,640
won't conflict with your dinner
with Professor Xu.

326
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,440
Sounds good.

327
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,110
The Italian restaurant here
is very authentic.

328
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,770
I'd like to invite you, Ms. Yi.

329
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,730
No thanks, Professor Xu.

330
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,990
I still have work to do.

331
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,770
I'll treat you another day.

332
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,480
Professor Xu,

333
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,400
Yi has a strong personality

334
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,260
and was very much in love with my brother.

335
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,220
Be patient.

336
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,590
Give her some time.

337
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,980
You're exactly
how I imagined you would be—

338
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,440
intelligent,

339
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,790
gentle,

340
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,550
loyal,

341
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,000
and strong-willed.

342
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,410
Women like you are rare.

343
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,050
Are you free tomorrow?

344
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,840
Come to my studio.

345
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,110
I think we're a good match.

346
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
See you tomorrow.

347
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,700
Professor Xu,

348
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,410
don't go there empty-handed.

349
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,490
Bring a bottle of wine with you.

350
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,250
Great. I'm so happy.

351
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,520
Great! I'm so happy!

352
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,910
Great! I'm so happy!

353
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Truly talented.

354
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,940
Have some water.

355
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,120
Okay.

356
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,820
Minister.

357
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,410
Yang,

358
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,330
you're here.

359
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,950
We meet again.

360
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,200
Please, have a seat.

361
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,000
No, no.

362
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,000
Well, I...

363
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,550
I've never sat on a sofa before.

364
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,640
I'll take a chair.

365
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,680
Alright, you sit here.

366
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,000
Okay.

367
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'll get you some water.

368
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Minister, I'll do it myself.

369
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,720
No need.

370
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,960
You're a guest now.

371
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,010
Don't be polite. Sit down.

372
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,480
Well...

373
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,270
Alright then.

374
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,590
Alright.

375
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,120
I'll bring your water here.

376
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,370
Minister,

377
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,540
sorry for troubling you.

378
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,190
Well,

379
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,370
for this series of reports,

380
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,940
your department

381
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,070
will be the first stop.

382
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,550
Why?

383
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,710
Because I think

384
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,590
interviewing a leader like you,

385
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,640
a capable leader,

386
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,090
can set the tone

387
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,270
for the whole series.

388
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,740
Okay.

389
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,820
You're familiar with everyone here.

390
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,680
We'll fully cooperate with you.

391
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,190
Have a seat.

392
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,910
Sure thing.

393
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,510
Minister,

394
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,030
have you looked over
the interview outline?

395
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,750
Yes, I have.

396
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,070
We...

397
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,900
don't need to worry about the outline.

398
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,230
Let's just talk freely.

399
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,600
I know the boundaries.

400
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,150
Alright.

401
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,540
Go ahead with your questions.

402
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,290
What stage do you think

403
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,210
the socialist transformation of Shanghai's

404
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,240
industry and commerce is at?

405
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,430
[Shengli Garment Factory,
a Public-Private Partnership]

406
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,730
Everything you said is no different

407
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,310
from the central government's
guiding principles.

408
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,590
Do you think

409
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,680
I should answer differently from them?

410
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,310
No.

411
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,550
I just feel that

412
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,160
a competent leader like you

413
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,480
should have your own understanding
and interpretation.

414
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,030
My understanding and interpretation

415
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,790
were all in my previous answer.

416
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,190
Do you need me to repeat it?

417
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,800
No need.

418
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,590
You know

419
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,070
I'm a fast note-taker.

420
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,730
I'll review it later.

421
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,270
Minister,

422
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,240
I heard

423
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,880
you have a principle

424
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,480
that as a leader,

425
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,750
one should be worldly

426
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,480
yet ascetic.

427
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,960
This concept of "worldly yet ascetic,"

428
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,590
as I understand it, is a Puritan concept.

429
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,640
Do you

430
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,510
believe in this philosophy?

431
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,110
This question
isn't on the interview outline.

432
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,400
You don't have to answer it.

433
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,200
It's alright.

434
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,270
I can answer that.

435
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,110
Communists aren't Puritans.

436
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,460
"Worldly yet ascetic" is just a metaphor.

437
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,510
Not seeking personal gain
and serving the public with integrity

438
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,070
are what I demand of myself.

439
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,310
I believe in communism.

440
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,200
This stance

441
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,270
has never changed since the day

442
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,040
I joined the revolution.

443
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,110
But can you truly

444
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,770
serve the public with integrity

445
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,750
and not seek personal gain?

446
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,590
This is something

447
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,270
every Communist

448
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,750
should do and must do.

449
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,430
Good.

450
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:13,920
Mr. Yang.

451
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,700
Hello.

452
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,260
Hello, Mr. Yang.

453
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,930
Hello.

454
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,300
Mr. Yang.

455
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,260
How many times have I told you?

456
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,580
You've never worn your hat properly.

457
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,690
Put it on straight.

458
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,070
The hat itself is crooked.

459
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,930
Fix it!

460
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,670
Try to straighten it as best you can!

461
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,310
Besides, as an electrician,

462
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,330
why are you sitting here doing nothing

463
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,460
instead of working?

464
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,070
Are you sleeping?

465
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,570
You've been transferred.
Why are you still bossing me around?

466
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,640
Let me tell you,

467
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,990
I can now

468
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,070
not only supervise you,

469
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,650
but also everyone else here.

470
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,550
Understand?

471
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,350
Yes, Mr. Yang.

472
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,570
Get to work.

473
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,440
Hello, Mr. Yang.

474
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,900
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Yang.

475
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,800
Ms. Yi,

476
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,070
I don't sense any signs of cooking here.

477
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,760
Are we going out to eat?

478
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,300
Here's some water.

479
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,770
I asked you here today

480
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,720
because I have something to tell you.

481
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,790
I also have so much I want to tell you.

482
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,270
I wrote a poem

483
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,920
to express my feelings.

484
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,370
Let me read it to you.

485
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,610
A gentle breeze

486
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,440
blows softly.

487
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,480
The whole world seems to stand still.

488
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,540
Only the image of you in the photo

489
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,160
awakens the dawn of my heart.

490
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,530
I hope you understand the love in my eyes.

491
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,170
I'll wait in silence!

492
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,450
I'll wait in silence

493
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,450
for the moment our hearts connect.

494
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,130
Are you done?

495
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,510
I don't know what Qing has told you.

496
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,880
I don't like you.

497
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,220
Why?

498
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,510
No reason. I just don't like you.

499
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,830
Ms. Yi,

500
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,770
you don't need to hide your feelings.

501
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,560
Yunqing told me everything.

502
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,330
You and your husband were deeply in love.

503
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,720
No one can replace him.

504
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,970
I don't want to replace him,

505
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,270
and I won't disturb you.

506
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,790
I only ask that you allow me

507
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,310
to stay

508
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,720
by your side,

509
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,370
waiting patiently

510
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,960
until you've healed.

511
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,440
Thank you for your recognition.

512
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,600
But your feelings came out of nowhere.

513
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,330
I'm so confused.

514
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,970
You've only known me for a few days.

515
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,920
What do you like about me?

516
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,270
Do you even know me?

517
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,400
Well,

518
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,280
you don't have to understand someone
to like them.

519
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,550
Liking is an instinct.

520
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,590
You're an artist—you understand.

521
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,990
I'm sure you can feel the passion
of my love.

522
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,850
I'm sure you can feel the passion
of my love!

523
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,160
I... I can feel it.

524
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,640
But...

525
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,070
I don't like you.

526
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,070
It has nothing to do with my husband.

527
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,380
I simply don't like you.

528
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,770
You like someone else?

529
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,620
Yes.

530
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,060
I don't believe it.

531
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,850
That's impossible.

532
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,700
No, no. I don't believe it.

533
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,990
Professor Xu,

534
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,290
I respect you very much.

535
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,350
And I hope

536
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,890
you respect me as well.

537
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,400
I see.

538
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,790
So I'm the third wheel.

539
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,160
Ms. Yi,

540
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,880
I wish you

541
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,920
happiness

542
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,600
with the one you love.

543
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,930
Thank you.

544
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,310
Secretary Zhao, you're here.

545
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,960
Please have a seat.

546
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,680
Okay.

547
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,960
Sit.

548
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,850
-Where is the Scholar?
-I'll go get Minister Wen.

549
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,790
Minister Wen.

550
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:55,940
Coming.

551
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,000
Secretary Zhao is here.

552
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,400
Good. Thank you.

553
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,480
You can go now.

554
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,550
Here.

555
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,460
Is this all you're giving me to eat?

556
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,520
What did you bring?

557
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,350
Take a look.

558
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,590
Pig's head meat?

559
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,790
Mrs. San,

560
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,430
bring an empty plate.

561
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,250
Look.

562
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,370
I've prepared some homemade liquor.

563
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,880
We won't drink yours.

564
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,070
Today,

565
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,270
try mine.

566
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,900
What's the occasion for such good liquor?

567
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,110
What?

568
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,180
Do we need a special occasion
to drink good liquor?

569
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,600
Today we're celebrating my

570
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,030
complete transformation.

571
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,560
Complete transformation?

572
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,920
What kind of transformation?

573
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,000
Explain it to me.

574
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:52,980
Here.

575
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
Explain first.

576
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,680
So, tell me,

577
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,880
what's the good news?

578
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,080
Scholar,

579
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,720
I've been thinking.

580
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,750
Back then,

581
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,160
on the battlefield,

582
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,740
we survived bullets flying everywhere.

583
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,730
We literally crawled out
from piles of the dead.

584
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,080
Doesn't that count
as a complete transformation?

585
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,610
New China has been founded.

586
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,690
We won the war,

587
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,610
and our lives have gotten better.

588
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,280
We turned our lives around.

589
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,570
Doesn't that count as a transformation?

590
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,530
I guess so.

591
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,990
So,

592
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,310
let's celebrate.

593
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,920
Mrs. San.

594
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,670
Alright, you can go now.

595
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,300
Okay.

596
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,850
Alright.

597
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,160
Zhao.

598
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,350
Here's how I see it:

599
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,310
you and I

600
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,770
are both ordinary people

601
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,560
from ordinary backgrounds.

602
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,920
No matter

603
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,090
how much we change,

604
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,960
we won't become immortals.

605
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,640
Right?

606
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,930
But since you moved to the city,

607
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,830
you've changed quite a bit.

608
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,800
Your brand-name leather shoes

609
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,200
are so shiny.

610
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,000
That shirt must be
at least 100-thread-count,

611
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,730
made of high-quality fabric.

612
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,110
Sometimes

613
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,010
I even catch a hint of perfume on you.

614
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,320
I'm not wearing any perfume today.

615
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
Then when did you?

616
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,350
I've never worn perfume.

617
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,630
Maybe I smelled wrong.

618
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,740
Alright, alright.

619
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm here to have a drink.

620
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,960
Don't keep lecturing me, okay?

621
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,220
I'm not lecturing you.

622
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,070
What's wrong?

623
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,750
Now that life's better,

624
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,680
is it too much

625
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,070
if I enjoy

626
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,640
some good things?

627
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,040
Anyway, I'm telling you,

628
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,120
if anything happens,

629
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,310
you have to talk to me in time.

630
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,000
We've survived through hell together.

631
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,510
Whatever happens,

632
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,920
you must tell me,

633
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,000
okay?

634
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,770
Don't worry.

635
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,060
We're brothers who have  been through

636
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,120
life and death together.

637
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,550
What couldn't I tell you?

638
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,000
No matter what happens,

639
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,880
our bond will never change.

640
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,030
Try mine.

641
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,750
I'm good with this homemade liquor.

642
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,550
It's smooth.

643
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,960
So smooth.

644
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,010
Still tastes the same as back then.

645
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,470
Fine, don't drink it then.

646
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,160
You drink yours,

647
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,480
and I'll drink mine.

648
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,770
I had an argument with Yang Xue'an today.

649
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,160
Have you eaten, Qing?

650
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,590
Aren't you going to ask
why I argued with him?

651
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,720
I don't want to know.

652
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,610
Yang Xue'an said you were pursuing Wen…

653
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,050
Sun.

654
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:15,889
It's fine.

655
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,290
I'm just talking to Yi.

656
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:21,920
Come in.

657
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:24,639
I...

658
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,320
Come in!

659
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,600
Yang Xue'an said
you were pursuing Minister Wen.

660
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,440
I'm talking to you.

661
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,570
Please tell Yang Xue'an

662
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,679
that if he's only saying this nonsense
to you,

663
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,170
I advise him to stop.

664
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,230
If he's spreading rumors outside,

665
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,960
I'll sue him.

666
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,840
Do as you like.

667
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:50,960
I just want to ask you now:

668
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,810
do you have any

669
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,500
inappropriate relationship

670
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,800
with Minister Wen?

671
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,440
That has nothing to do
with you and Yang Xue'an.

672
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,990
There you go again with that attitude.

673
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,650
How is it nothing to do with me?

674
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,720
I'm telling you,

675
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,970
you can be with whoever you want,

676
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,730
but you cannot be with Minister Wen.

677
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,860
Who is Minister Wen?

678
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,990
A high-ranking leader,

679
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,050
a veteran revolutionary.

680
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,250
He's my direct superior,

681
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,850
my boss.

682
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,280
What does it mean if you are with him?

683
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,230
Have you thought about me?

684
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,280
How am I supposed

685
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,340
to hold my head high at our workplace?

686
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,380
It's an honor to have you here,
Minister Wen.

687
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,610
It's so lively and bustling here.

688
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,930
The location you chose

689
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,130
for your welfare factory is excellent.

690
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:52,890
Wen,

691
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,930
this land was specially approved
by the provincial committee.

692
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,640
Is that so?

693
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,390
This place is mainly

694
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,030
for accommodating

695
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,370
wounded soldiers and their families.

696
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,230
I plan to—

697
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:03,900
look—

698
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,630
grow some crops here,

699
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,220
and maybe raise chickens

700
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,180
and pigs.

701
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,440
Not bad.

702
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,920
When you run a factory,

703
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,190
you should make use
of local agricultural resources.

704
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,110
This place is quite far from the city.

705
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,220
You need to consider medical care.

706
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,400
What if someone falls ill…

707
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,130
I've been thinking about that.

708
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,730
Medical equipment

709
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,360
and staff

710
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,000
will be coming in soon.

711
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,860
See? We're thinking alike again.

712
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,630
You really did improve.

713
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,520
I improved?

714
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,070
Brother-in-law,

715
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,840
my car tire just got punctured.

716
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,780
Can I borrow your new car?

717
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,380
Who are you calling brother-in-law?

718
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,400
Secretary Zhao,
my tire just got punctured.

719
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,590
Let me use your new car.

720
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,670
Leave us now!

721
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Little brat.

722
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,360
He must have mistaken me for someone else.

723
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,480
Wen, take a rest.

724
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,760
Well...

725
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,590
Liu,

726
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,330
get Minister Wen a glass of water.

727
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:57,890
No.

728
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,550
Make him some good tea.

729
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,590
Take a break first.

730
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,590
I'll handle this.

731
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,690
Where did this brat even come from?

732
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,710
Working on Sunday?

733
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,150
You're working too.

734
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,560
Zhou said you two had a fight again.

735
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,910
Thanks for your concern.

736
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,440
Zhou and I fight all the time.

737
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,960
You can handle this once,
but not every single time.

738
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,510
You're a martyr's widow

739
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,550
and our chief designer.

740
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,030
Of course I care about you.

741
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,280
Besides,

742
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,730
this is a task Minister Wen's assigned me.

743
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,550
Mom.

744
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,280
Mom.

745
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,850
-Mom.
-Mom.

746
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,150
Why are you here?

747
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,550
And you brought your little brother.

748
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,660
Big Sister brought us here.

749
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,870
Mom, I'm hungry.

750
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,750
Miss, I'm hungry.

751
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,590
Come on.

752
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,040
Why don't you go to my place?

753
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,750
I'll make her some noodles.

754
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,590
Okay.

755
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,510
Thank you.

756
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,690
You always cause trouble for me.

757
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,480
Brother-in-law, stop it.

758
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,540
Look. What's this?

759
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,760
Don't call me brother-in-law.

760
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,030
Secretary Zhao, stop it.

761
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,230
Look what I have here.

762
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,360
You didn't come when you should have,

763
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,760
and now you're here
causing trouble for me.

764
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,010
Give it to me.

765
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,590
Secretary Zhao is not my brother-in-law!

766
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,630
My brother-in-law is not Secretary Zhao!

767
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,440
Shut up!

768
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,830
Get lost!

769
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,590
See you, Brother-in-law.

770
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,960
Well...

771
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,070
What...

772
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,820
What kind of person is he?

773
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,900
My car tire got punctured.

774
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,150
Brother-in-law?

775
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,980
He calls you brother-in-law?

776
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,960
Well...

777
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,850
He was just joking around with me.

778
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,410
I don't remember Jiang
having such a brother.

779
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,820
He's

780
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,250
a distant cousin of Jiang.

781
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,850
He's lazy, refuses to study,

782
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,840
and has nothing to do,
so they sent him here to me.

783
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,040
And now he's just making trouble for me.

784
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,070
Really?

785
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,330
Why would I lie to you?

786
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,360
This is a nice car.

787
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,460
A Mercedes, right?

788
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,350
I don't really know

789
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,300
what car this is.

790
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
Whose car is this?

791
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,440
That brat said it's his relative's car.

792
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,960
He drove it here for fun.

793
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,880
His relative?

794
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,150
I know this car.

795
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,710
You do?

796
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,320
Yes.

797
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,190
The owner is Fu Zihe.

798
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,440
This is the only Mercedes in Shanghai.

799
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,030
If he's related to Fu Zihe,

800
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,410
wouldn't that make you
Fu Zihe's relative too?

801
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,000
Well...

802
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,860
How could I possibly
be related to Fu Zihe?

803
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Alright.

804
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,720
You scout.

805
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,430
I knew I couldn't hide anything from you.

806
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,030
It's Fu Zihe's car.

807
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,460
He let me drive it for a few days

808
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,000
just to have some fun.

809
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,630
Zhao, you're so stupid.

810
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,150
You know very well

811
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,760
who Fu Zihe is.

812
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,070
Driving his car?

813
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,960
Don't you understand

814
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,320
what that implies,

815
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,190
Zhao?

816
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,440
It's not that serious.

817
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,000
My dear Scholar.

818
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,660
Fu Zihe

819
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,770
is a capitalist.

820
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,630
But don't you also socialize

821
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,080
with capitalists?

822
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,920
Did I ever say anything about that?

823
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,280
So it's okay when you do it,

824
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,880
but not when I do?

825
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,120
I keep my distance when I deal with them.

826
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,980
I only talk business with them,

827
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,960
never private matters.

828
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,760
And I never accept gifts.

829
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,770
That's my principle.

830
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,880
I just borrowed a car.

831
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,090
What's the big deal?

832
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,440
Don't try to brush this off.

833
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,320
This is serious.

834
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,880
So what?

835
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,230
Are you going to arrest me?

836
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,590
Why don't you just have me executed?

837
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,190
I don't have that authority.

838
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,760
Don't forget,

839
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,630
Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan
are a warning to us all.

840
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,090
I never thought you'd compare me

841
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,570
to Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan.

842
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,970
Do you really think
I'm that kind of person?

843
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,230
Zhao,

844
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,960
many veteran revolutionaries

845
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,190
survived the war years

846
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,320
but have fallen now.

847
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,400
You know this very well.

848
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,000
-Alright, alright.
-Right?

849
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,400
I've been thinking,

850
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,200
why did we fight the revolution?

851
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,630
Was it just to replace
those corrupt officials,

852
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,230
only to be toppled by others in the end?

853
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,660
Stop lecturing me here.

854
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,320
I'll return the car tomorrow,

855
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,000
okay?

856
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,720
I'll pump the tire,

857
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,820
fill the tank,

858
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,640
and then give it back to him.

859
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,280
I'll do whatever you say.

860
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,140
Is that enough?

861
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,590
You still

862
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,550
need to report it to the Party Committee.

863
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,150
What?

864
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,590
Report it to the Party Committee?

865
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,140
Yes.

866
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,200
I'm not going!

867
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,960
Why?

868
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,780
If you don't tell anyone,

869
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,910
who would ever know?

870
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:26,960
Who would know?

871
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,490
You drive around
in this stupid car every day.

872
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,550
Do you think nobody's noticed?

873
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,630
That's your weak spot,

874
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,090
and anyone could use it against you
anytime.

875
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,720
I'm still not going.

876
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,000
Let me tell you,

877
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,070
don't count on getting lucky.

878
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,320
You've made mistakes before.

879
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,450
Have you forgotten?

880
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,510
I'm still not going.

881
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
You're not?

882
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:52,740
Fine.

883
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,160
Where are you going?

884
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,440
Back to the city.

885
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,840
Are you going to walk back?

886
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,480
Yes!

887
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:01,970
I'll drive you!

888
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,630
I'll drive you in my jeep!

889
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,060
I'm not getting in!

890
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,480
Stubborn fool!
