[Episode 7]

3
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,350
Zhaoyuan.

4
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,000
Fine, Zhou Zhaoyuan, Zhou Zhaoyuan.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,120
I want to apply to military school

6
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,039
and serve on the front lines
against the Japanese.

7
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,820
That's great.

8
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,380
Then you're sure
to become an excellent soldier.

9
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,790
Don't laugh. I mean it.

10
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,150
I mean it, too.

11
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,590
If you need it,

12
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,530
I'll write you a recommendation letter.

13
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,520
Right now, all I want is to graduate
from middle school as soon as possible.

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,630
There was a man in the Song dynasty

15
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,810
who saw his crops weren't growing,
so he pulled them up

16
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,960
and went home exhausted.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,090
What does that mean?

18
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,630
Pulling up seedlings
to help them grow never works.

19
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,400
See?

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,450
You really should read more books.

21
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,150
I'm done with you.

22
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,800
Are you mad?

23
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:27,300
No.

24
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,350
I'll take you out for butterfly cookies.

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,670
Two boxes.

26
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,120
Okay.

27
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,980
Deal.

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,750
Let's go.

29
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,040
Thanks for helping me this time.

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,730
What do you mean?

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,770
It's a gift for your grand opening.

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,910
Have a seat.

33
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,550
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,079
I used to be selfish

35
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,750
and foolish,

36
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,630
always blind to my own faults.

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,730
Coming back to the old house

38
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,400
seeing it like this

39
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,240
makes me truly happy.

40
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,160
And seeing
your maternity hospital doing so well,

41
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,590
I'm genuinely

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,060
happy for you, too.

43
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,400
I mean it.

44
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,640
Since Mom is staying at your place,

45
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,840
you should take good care of her.

46
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,640
I understand.

47
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,070
Mom's staying with me

48
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,030
and is being well taken care of,

49
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,120
so don't worry.

50
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,850
Your sister-in-law

51
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,399
cooks three meals a day,

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,560
and all of them Mom's favorites.

53
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,070
When I have time,

54
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,960
I also take her out for walks

55
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,100
and chats.

56
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,430
Mom's really happy.

57
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,710
It's just that sometimes

58
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,640
she talks to herself,

59
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,600
saying she misses you a lot.

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,440
Why don't you go visit her

61
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,950
when you're not busy?

62
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,750
I'm really sorry.

63
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,830
This gift

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,430
isn't expensive.

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,770
Just think of it as a small token

66
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,950
of my appreciation for your grand opening,

67
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,600
okay?

68
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,270
Please take good care of Meina.

69
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,500
She's very delicate,

70
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,390
and since it's her first pregnancy,

71
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,750
please look after her.

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,040
Meina?

73
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,240
Shao Meina?

74
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,680
The relative
Sis brought over yesterday?

75
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,390
Yeah.

76
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,630
What's your relationship with her?

77
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,670
No, our mom

78
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,500
is really happy this time.

79
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,310
I mean...

80
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,530
Mom asked

81
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,070
if you could

82
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,360
waive that fee for her.

83
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,830
We're all family.

84
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,460
Can't you just waive the fee?

85
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,560
Sis,

86
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,720
what are you doing?

87
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,630
Siyun is here.

88
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,420
Her feet are swollen,
so I'm soaking them for her.

89
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,820
Come with me to my office.

90
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,750
You go ahead then.

91
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,600
When you come back,
peel two apples for me.

92
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,110
Get out of the way.

93
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,630
What are you looking at?

94
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,230
I'm not done washing my feet.

95
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
I'll help you.

96
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,600
Why are you so afraid of your sister?

97
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,730
Didn't you say this hospital is yours?

98
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,040
She's just helping you out, isn't she?

99
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,240
I'm not afraid of her.

100
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,900
She's my little sister.

101
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,430
I was being nice to her.

102
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,360
You're not lying to me, are you?

103
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,790
Why would I lie to you?

104
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,990
I've been running this hospital
for quite a while.

105
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,820
Why did you wash her feet?

106
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,830
All I can do

107
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,000
is take care of the Lin family.

108
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,430
You don't need to do things like that!

109
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,510
It's fine.

110
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,570
I can endure it.

111
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,750
You can endure it?

112
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,409
For how long?

113
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,480
For a lifetime?

114
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,800
I'll endure it...

115
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,300
for as long as it takes.

116
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,740
Mr. Cheng.

117
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,440
One of the few optimists.

118
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,820
I'd like to ask you a favor.

119
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,650
Some of my student friends

120
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,450
want to join
the volunteer army in the northeast.

121
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,630
Wu Xiaoshan?

122
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,350
Yes.

123
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,480
Sure,

124
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,390
I'll make the arrangements.

125
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,360
Thank you.

126
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,570
I'd like to ask you a favor, too.

127
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,550
We urgently need a batch of medicine

128
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,880
and medical equipment.

129
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,240
Here's the medicine list and the deposit.

130
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,270
I only have one month

131
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,600
to gather and send them
to the front lines.

132
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,840
It's not easy to find
such a large quantity

133
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,610
of medicine and equipment.

134
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,400
I'll figure something out.

135
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,530
Keep the money.

136
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,970
I'll cover the cost.

137
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,840
That's a lot of money.

138
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,190
Consider it a token of my appreciation.

139
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,080
Fine.

140
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,110
I'll contact you

141
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,200
in a month.

142
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,350
Take care.

143
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,630
Cheng Ao, Cheng Ao.

144
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,250
Come and eat.

145
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,200
You're back.

146
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,510
Why didn't you tell us in advance?

147
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,910
I wanted to surprise you.

148
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,410
Go get Master.

149
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,360
Okay.

150
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,270
Come try my pickled cabbage pork stew.

151
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
This pot, half a pig,

152
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,840
and a few pounds of pickled cabbage—

153
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,950
I carried them all back
from the Northeast.

154
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,630
Here.

155
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,030
Did you go to the Northeast to be a chef?

156
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,030
Of course not.

157
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,750
I only cook for family.

158
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,630
Dad.

159
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,200
You're back.

160
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,240
You're only back because
you squandered all your money, right?

161
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
No, that's not it.

162
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,150
Call her Mom.

163
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,630
Mom.

164
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,490
It's your turn.

165
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,460
Madam Yanhong.

166
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,550
This is Dalun.

167
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,550
But don't believe

168
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,350
a word he says.

169
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,790
This is Cheng Ao,

170
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,360
our family's great lawyer.

171
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,840
Father, you're really something.

172
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,870
I just got back,

173
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,180
and suddenly
there's another little brother.

174
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,650
You're still
so full of energy at your age.

175
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,650
Enough nonsense.

176
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,550
Say it. Why are you back this time?

177
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,150
I came back to look after you.

178
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,650
I can't afford that kind of care.

179
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,870
Seriously,

180
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,160
I came back

181
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,990
with a government job this time.

182
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,270
Wherever you work,

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,800
don't cause me any more trouble.

184
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,400
Don't worry.

185
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,540
It's good to have you back.

186
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,840
How were things
with the Japanese in the Northeast?

187
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,200
Cheng Ao, what are you talking about?

188
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,870
How could I ever have dealings with them?

189
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,270
Dad taught us from childhood

190
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,070
never to deal with the Japanese.

191
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,010
Dad, I've always kept that in mind.

192
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,320
So, what did you cook?

193
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,060
Let me see.

194
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,680
Have a seat, Yanhong.

195
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,600
Dalun,

196
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,600
have the brothers sit and eat.

197
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,020
Everyone, come sit and keep eating.

198
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,840
Cheng Ao,

199
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,580
I was gone for just a while,

200
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,400
and now I have another brother?

201
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,840
How would I know?

202
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,960
It's my first time seeing her, too.

203
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,430
How do you know it's a boy?

204
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,350
I've actually looked into this.

205
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,030
If the belly is pointy, it's a boy.

206
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,490
If it's round, it's a girl.

207
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,020
Hurry up.

208
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,600
Coming.

209
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,920
Here, Father.

210
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,080
Here, Mom.

211
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,020
Thank you.

212
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,710
Thank you, my dear.

213
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,240
Dad.

214
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Why not sit there?

215
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,680
I just got back,
so I wanted to sit close to you.

216
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,580
Aren't you hot?

217
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,030
This jacket's yours now.

218
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,120
Is it good?

219
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,430
Did you rob a salt vendor or what?

220
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,240
Try it yourself.

221
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,030
Yeah, it seems a bit salty.

222
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,910
Just a bit?

223
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,800
Don't drink too much.

224
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,280
[Sinan Maternity Hospital]

225
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,030
Who are you?

226
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,990
I'm Lin Jinghan's daughter.

227
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,630
Oh, it's you.
Lin Jinghan told me about you.

228
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,320
I brought you some food.

229
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,450
Did you make all this yourself?

230
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,750
There are vegetables, meat, and soup.

231
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,550
Go ahead, eat.

232
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,260
You're so thoughtful.

233
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,260
My dad said

234
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,690
we should treat you well.

235
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,240
Things were better before.

236
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,200
At least this house was still ours.

237
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,480
What did you say?

238
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,410
When Grandpa was alive,

239
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,030
our family was very wealthy.

240
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,600
Later, my grandpa passed away,

241
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,000
and my dad ran up a lot of debt,

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,460
so this house was mortgaged
to his creditor.

243
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,640
He used all the money
from selling the house to pay off debts.

244
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,000
Not a single penny was left.

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,790
He still hasn't paid off the bank loans.

246
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,790
My dad's broke.

247
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,480
He's got nothing but debt.

248
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,390
You're saying Lin Jinghan's broke?

249
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,790
Isn't this hospital his?

250
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,270
This hospital isn't my father's.

251
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,630
It belongs to my aunt.

252
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,230
It has nothing to do with him.

253
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,390
He still owes the money
for your hospitalization.

254
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,080
Dad.

255
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,250
What are you doing here?

256
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,360
I came to bring her food.

257
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,310
Food's here. I'll get going.

258
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,880
Come, sit here.

259
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,330
What did she come here for?

260
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,110
Your daughter just told me

261
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,660
that you're broke,

262
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,940
and this hospital isn't yours either.

263
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,400
Was she telling the truth?

264
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,170
Of course not!

265
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,670
She lied to you.

266
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,970
That kid never tells the truth.

267
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,080
Jinghan, be honest with me.

268
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,480
I'm with you,

269
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,120
carrying your baby

270
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,460
because I love you for who you are,

271
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,390
not for your money.

272
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,510
Even if you're broke,

273
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,720
it doesn't matter.

274
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,250
We can still earn together.

275
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,080
But I hope the one I love

276
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,720
tells me the truth

277
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,880
and doesn't lie.

278
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,390
I'll tell you the truth.

279
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,950
Promise you won't get mad?

280
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,660
Sure.

281
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,290
Couples should be honest with each other.

282
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:32,990
Yes,

283
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,890
I did lie to you.

284
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,440
But wasn't that because I love you?

285
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,010
I...

286
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,800
I just...

287
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,110
I was just afraid that in my state,

288
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,150
I'd lose you.

289
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,680
I'm not having this baby!

290
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,890
I never should've married
a woman like you.

291
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,240
Sis,

292
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,829
I don't pity you.

293
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,210
I care about you.

294
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,859
I know you want to be
a good daughter-in-law to the Lin family,

295
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,790
and a good mother to your children.

296
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,089
But sometimes, when it's necessary,

297
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,680
you need to be selfish

298
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,080
and think more about yourself.

299
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,280
I understand what you mean.

300
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,840
I've thought about that too.

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,290
Whenever Lin Jinghan acts ridiculously,

302
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,940
I really want to take my kids

303
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,440
and leave the Lin family
without looking back.

304
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,720
But where could I go?

305
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,640
Back to my parents' home?

306
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,400
I can already picture the villagers

307
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,250
drowning me with their gossip.

308
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,110
I can hardly support myself.

309
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,920
I can't let my kids suffer with me, can I?

310
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,810
It's not that you can't—

311
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,690
you just don't dare.

312
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,830
You still have me.

313
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,830
Mom, I avenged you.

314
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
What do you mean?

315
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,930
You'll see when we get there.

316
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,460
Let's go.

317
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:14,820
Hurry up.

318
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,530
Why is your nose bleeding?

319
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,590
Yi's soup is good.

320
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,110
I just had a few sips.

321
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,110
Are you okay?

322
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,990
I'm fine.

323
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,280
Then let me tell you something.

324
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,960
Go ahead.

325
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,040
I already covered the medical bills

326
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,450
from the past few days.

327
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,960
But the hospital shareholders said

328
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,510
if you don't pay the rest,

329
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,570
they'll sue you.

330
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,600
You could even be detained.

331
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,130
Don't bring that up with me.

332
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,770
My baby's not even born yet.

333
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,370
Why should I pay the rest now?

334
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,720
Besides,

335
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
don't treat family like outsiders.

336
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,440
We're family.

337
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,550
Asking me for money

338
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,600
only hurts our feelings.

339
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,640
Auntie, you already tried talking to him.

340
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,570
My dad just won't listen. Let's go.

341
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,380
Wipe your nose.

342
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,480
What should we do?

343
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,480
Are they really going to detain you?

344
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,960
Actually,

345
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,500
our house is pretty comfortable.

346
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,320
Why don't we just go home?

347
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,880
Besides,

348
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,860
If I get detained,

349
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,110
no one will take care of you.

350
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,730
You still need care after childbirth.

351
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,160
Sometimes you put up with the small stuff
for the bigger plan.

352
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
How did I marry such a useless man?

353
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,560
Honey...

354
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,320
Do you want me to slap you again?

355
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,370
Let's pack up.

356
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,790
Stay right there.

357
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,310
Zeng Dalun.

358
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,920
Why are you back?

359
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,430
When did you get back?

360
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,290
I just got back.

361
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,570
Hold on. Why are you dressed like that?

362
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,110
Shouldn't you be in a long gown

363
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,170
with a bunch of sidekicks behind you?

364
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,000
You came here today—

365
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,010
Did you get yourself into trouble again?

366
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,890
That mess with Xiu last time—

367
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,450
you caused such a big scene!

368
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,400
Your father's been
cleaning up after you every day.

369
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,660
You're the eldest son of the Zeng family.

370
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,610
Can't you give your family a break?

371
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,910
So tell me, what is it this time?

372
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,940
Let's see if I can help.

373
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,870
No need.

374
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,750
I found a job.

375
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,880
With your status,
you don't need to find a job.

376
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,510
Just don't cause your father more trouble.

377
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,440
I'm working for Mr. Dai now.

378
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,510
Mr. Dai?

379
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,270
Which Mr. Dai?

380
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,880
How many Mr. Dais do you think there are?

381
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,610
Dalun,

382
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,200
it's been ages

383
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,570
since we last met.

384
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,590
How about this?
Tomorrow night, dinner's on me.

385
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,720
Let me throw you a welcome party, okay?

386
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,160
Hello, this is Pingzheng Law Firm.

387
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,620
Hello?

388
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,240
This is Shen Yiqun.

389
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,830
What's wrong?

390
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,720
Do me a favor.

391
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,310
Set up a dinner for me and Zeng Dalun.

392
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,800
Why do you want to have dinner with Dalun?

393
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,320
Don't ask why.

394
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,400
Just set it up for me.

395
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,670
I'll have someone send you
the address tomorrow.

396
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,150
Alright, got it.

397
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,700
[Registration Counter]

398
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,480
I never thought

399
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,790
you'd actually open a hospital
on your own.

400
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,250
And it's doing quite well.

401
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,740
That's thanks to Mrs. Shen's foresight.

402
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,270
I planned to leave without a word,

403
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,330
but then I thought,

404
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,070
I should come and see you one last time.

405
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,110
Where are you going?

406
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,200
I'm going abroad to study.

407
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,000
That's great.

408
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,330
What will you study?

409
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,160
Aren't you going to ask me?

410
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,510
What are you going to study?

411
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,640
I'm going to New York to study finance.

412
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,080
You should work hard.

413
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,080
When I'm back from the U.S.,

414
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,720
I'll buy your hospital.

415
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,830
Goodbye, Lin Siyun.

416
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,120
I thought she'd study medicine.

417
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,720
Why?

418
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,670
To follow in your footsteps.

419
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,110
You're so outstanding.

420
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,140
Every girl in Shanghai

421
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,270
sees you as a role model, right?

422
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Didn't you notice

423
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,180
she didn’t even look at you just now?

424
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,420
Do you know why?

425
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,350
Why?

426
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,460
Cheng Ao,

427
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,010
you've lost your charm.

428
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,670
Mom, if you keep living in that house,

429
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,440
Dad and his mistress will drive you crazy!

430
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,160
Why don't you come work with Auntie?

431
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
Look at Mrs. Chen—she can't even read

432
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,560
but she's learning
to be a midwife with Auntie.

433
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,830
Mom, don't you see?

434
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,640
Dad never treated us
as decent human beings.

435
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,100
He sold me to the Zhu family

436
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,700
just to pay off his gambling debt.

437
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,580
And now he's even making you
take care of his mistress,

438
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,640
which triggered your heart disease!

439
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,440
Mom, my little brother's still so young.

440
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,550
We all need you.

441
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,720
Dr. Lin,

442
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I have something important to ask.

443
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,170
That's quite a lot.

444
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,920
These medicines and equipment
are hard to get,

445
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,480
and they're all under quota limits.

446
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,330
The amount you're asking for is so large.

447
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,520
Even if I gave you
the hospital's entire stock,

448
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
it still wouldn't be enough.

449
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,590
How about this?

450
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,690
I’ll find a way.

451
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,410
I'll order more under the hospital's name.

452
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,240
I only have one month

453
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,100
to gather this batch of medicine.

454
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,940
Your hospital alone
definitely won't cover it.

455
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,590
If I go to the national hospital,

456
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,390
it surely will raise suspicion.

457
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,680
So I'm thinking of
going through foreign hospitals,

458
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,850
like the missionary hospital
or the Red Cross hospital.

459
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,890
Do you have connections there?

460
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,440
I know people at both.

461
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,790
But the quantity
you're asking for is huge.

462
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,670
You'd better come up
with a convincing reason.

463
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,550
Why are you buying

464
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
so much medicine?

465
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,960
Getting medical supplies is obviously

466
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,090
for saving lives and doing good deeds.

467
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,520
What good deeds?

468
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,270
I can't tell you right now.

469
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,480
You're asking me for a favor,
and you won't even tell me that?

470
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
I'll tell you when the time is right.

471
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,310
What's wrong with you?

472
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,710
Asking for a favor,
but only telling half the story.

473
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,070
What's wrong with you?

474
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,490
You're way too curious.

475
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,390
I'm not curious

476
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,820
about everyone, okay?

477
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,490

478
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,160

481
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,240
♪ If destiny's chains can't be broken ♪

Anyway, about that medicine,

484
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,960
♪ Then I'll spend my life with you ♪

485
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,750
I can't help you.

486
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,950
Go find someone else.

487
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,100
You wouldn't do this to me.

488
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:22,680
♪ What we've loved, what we've said ♪

489
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,000
Yes, I would.

490
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,130
Blocking the sun for me
won't change my mind.

491
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,310
♪ Won't be swept away by wind or rain ♪

495
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,880
Are you free tomorrow?

496
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,460
I'm busy.

497
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,000

498
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,880

♪ What we've loved, what we've said ♪

to go with someone else then.

501
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,660

Lin Siyun.

507
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,280

00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,480

509
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,970
You're here.

510
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,900
You got here pretty early.

511
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,720
Since I'm having dinner
with my two best brothers,

512
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,180
of course I had to come early
to set things up.

513
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,520
Cheng Ao,

514
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,200
since you invited us,

515
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,480
you should take the main seat.

516
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,130
Sit.

517
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,640
Dalun,

518
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,670
come and sit here.

519
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,430
Give me your glass.

520
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:35,890
Alright.

521
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,280
My two brothers,

522
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,880
I'm a few years older than you two,

523
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
so let me say a few words first, okay?

524
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,310
I came early,

525
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,500
so I went ahead and ordered the dishes.

526
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,030
There are meat and vegetables,
quite a feast.

527
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,510
Cheng Ao, for this first glass,

528
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,570
don't drink it yet.

529
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,880
I want to toast Dalun.

530
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,680
Dalun,

531
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,070
you've been away for quite a long time.

532
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,790
You must've suffered a lot

533
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,070
and faced some hardships out there,

534
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,750
right?

535
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,200
But now you're back,

536
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,540
and we're here to welcome you home.

537
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,170
Cheers.

538
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,550
Cheng Ao, let me tell you.

539
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,480
Dalun's done well in his study.

540
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,110
He came back with real accomplishments.

541
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,920
Now he's working for Mr. Dai.

542
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,160
Trust me,

543
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,590
in two years at most,

544
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,520
Dalun will definitely be

545
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,400
the top leader in our department.

546
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,510
By then,

547
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,540
I'll serve you with all I've got.

548
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,180
Alright, it's time to eat.

549
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,550
Let's raise our glasses

550
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,000
and make a toast.

551
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,070
Cheers.

552
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,790
Shen Yiqun.

553
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,920
I really hate you.

554
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,950
You should know that, right?

555
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,200
I really had no idea.

556
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,110
Did I do something wrong

557
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,960
that upset you?

558
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,320
Tell me and I'll change.

559
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,530
Cheng Ao.

560
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,310
Don't you find him annoying as well?

561
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,310
Let's eat.

562
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,030
Shen Yiqun.

563
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,000
Look how hypocritical you are.

564
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,640
You always tell people
what they want to hear.

565
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,520
Especially when you meet someone,

566
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,380
you always put on that fake smile.

567
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,770
It's disgusting.

568
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,270
It makes me sick.

569
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,030
You know what?

570
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,480
You're nothing but a hypocrite.

571
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,200
Do you think you deserve to dine with me?

572
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,880
Who do you think you are?

573
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,000
Stand up.

574
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,790
Go take a piss

575
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,210
and take a look at yourself.

576
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,510
Were you even born a human?

577
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,110
Dalun.

578
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,110
You don't want to eat properly, huh?

579
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,710
Then let me treat you to something else.

580
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,610
You brought the military police
to dine with me?

581
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,440
No,

582
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,510
Cheng Ao, don't get the wrong idea.

583
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,720
We're brothers.

584
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,510
I trust you completely.

585
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,440
But him?

586
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,580
He's not worthy.

587
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,920
Zeng Dalun.

588
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,170
You still don't know your place.

589
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,960
You've only been
in the Shanghai circle for a few years,

590
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,890
and you're already this arrogant?

591
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,080
A gang has its rules,
and a family has its own laws.

592
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,420
In terms of seniority,

593
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,280
you're nowhere close to me.

594
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,820
Take him out.

595
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,080
Teach him a lesson.

596
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,270
Alright, alright.

597
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,430
Dalun, apologize to him.

598
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,150
Do you think this is acceptable?

599
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,080
You're really tough.

600
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,870
When you act tough like this,

601
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,080
it actually scares me a little.

602
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,980
I can't just let a tiger
return to the mountain.

603
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,750
So...

604
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,140
you'd better not leave.

605
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,060
Kill him.

606
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,710
It doesn't take two guns to kill one man.

607
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,590
Come on.

608
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,880
Tell your men to do it.

609
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,630
Come on.

610
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,420
Come on!

611
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,680
Dalun,

612
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,370
let's go.

613
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,940
You didn't bring
the military police this time?

614
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,360
It was my fault

615
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,490
for bringing you two together for a meal.

616
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,410
I'm sorry.

617
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,780
I just hope you're not mad.

618
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,480
Wait a minute.

619
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,150
This is the first time

620
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,080
I've ever drunk like this for a man.

621
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,110
The last time I drank like this,

622
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,110
I was 20 years old.

623
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,330
I drank like that for a girl.

624
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,710
She was going to study abroad,

625
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,440
and I rode my bike to see her off.

626
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,760
Where are you going?

627
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,090
I'm going to see a movie.

628
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,280
Sis,

629
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,670
I really didn't expect

630
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,330
Yi could convince you and Mom.

631
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,220
I'm quite surprised.

632
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,150
She's your mother's eldest grandchild.

633
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,480
Don't you know her well?

634
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,320
Siyun.

635
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,700
I don't know anything about this.

636
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,150
Can I really make it?

637
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,590
Sis,

638
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,070
don't be nervous.

639
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,890
I'll teach you step by step.

640
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,410
Siyun,

641
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,400
thank you.

642
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,810
Don't be formal with me.

643
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,550
Alright, I won't be formal then.

644
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,510
I'll definitely try my best to learn.

645
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,030
Let's go

646
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,760
Let's go.

647
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,040
Dalun, what happened to your hand?

648
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,120
It's nothing.

649
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,150
I got injured during a mission.

650
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,150
It's good that it's nothing serious.

651
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,800
I have something to tell both of you.

652
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,280
We've recently received intel

653
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,680
that the Communist Party

654
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,470
is planning several
large-scale operations in Shanghai.

655
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,880
I want both of you to investigate it.

656
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,000
You must find out

657
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,800
exactly what they're plotting.

658
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,550
Director,

659
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,070
I've received intel on this too.

660
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,230
The moment I got the message,

661
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,510
I sent people to investigate.

662
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,440
I believe we'll have results soon.

663
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,320
Jin.

664
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
This is a list

665
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,040
of Communists I've recently captured,

666
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,190
including some pro-Communist people.

667
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,510
Recruit those we can,

668
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,600
and for the rest,

669
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,590
arrest them all.

670
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,200
Those who resist publicly,

671
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,590
kill them all.

672
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:11,410
But...

673
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,600
do not reveal your identity.

674
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,400
Yiqun,

675
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,970
Dalun's been working
at the periphery for us.

676
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,610
You two must stay united

677
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,960
and work diligently together.

678
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,090
The organization is fair
with rewards and punishments.

679
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,950
Director, rest assured,

680
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,110
we'll work hard

681
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,330
and stay united.

682
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,250
Good. Cheers.

683
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,540
[Light Theater]

684
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,400
About that batch of medicine
you mentioned last time,

685
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,930
I've thought of a solution.

686
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,480
Sichuan is currently

687
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,230
suffering from famine and plague.

688
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,720
We can hold a charity fundraiser

689
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,560
for the disaster victims
under the hospital's name.

690
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,140
First, we can actually help the victims.

691
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,330
Second, it gives you a cover

692
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,030
to collect the medicine
and equipment you need.

693
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,740
You can blend in legitimately

694
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,070
without arousing suspicion.

695
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,200
I thought of that too.

696
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,680
With such a large demand,

697
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,590
a charity fundraiser is the only option.

698
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,070
And with this excuse,

699
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,870
we can also contact
the local Red Cross hospital.

700
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,960
They must have

701
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,090
a large quantity of this type of medicine.

702
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,230
We're on the same page.

703
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
That solves the supply problem.

704
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,670
But with the current drug controls,

705
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,480
have you figured out how to

706
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,010
move them from Shanghai
to your destination?

707
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,480
Not yet.

708
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,560
Let's watch the movie first.

709
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,280
Someone's following us.

710
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,250
Don't look.

711
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,080
It could be one of Zeng Dalun's men.

712
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,230
Cheng Ao,

713
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,080
your hands are sweating.

714
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,430
There's no Zeng Dalun's people
here at all, right?

715
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:36,610
Maybe I was mistaken.

716
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,320
It's nice holding hands
while watching a movie like this.
