[Footprints of Change]

00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,759
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,039
How did you know that woman?

4
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,800
Just mind your own business.

5
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,600
You can't act like that,

6
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
my dear minister.

7
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,380
That's not very gentlemanly of you.

8
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,840
A female comrade

9
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,570
brought you noodles,
and you wouldn't even eat them.

10
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,280
She wanted to treat you to dinner,

11
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
and you pulled a face

12
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,970
even longer than mine.

13
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,030
Enough.

14
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,800
I've given you enough respect already.

15
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,730
I'm warning you—

16
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,590
this Huang Lingling

17
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,120
doesn't seem simple at all.

18
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,200
Our army just entered the city.

19
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:23,190
There are plenty of women like her

20
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,400
from the old regime.

21
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,470
Why don't you just say

22
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,400
that Huang Lingling's a KMT agent?

23
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,480
Fine, so my kindness counts for nothing.

24
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,000
From now on,

25
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,650
I won't get involved in your messes.

26
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,220
You really don't need to.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,860
Are you back to your old habits again?

28
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,560
You just got to Shanghai

29
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,340
and you're already dazzled?

30
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,750
What?

31
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,750
You just had to bring that up,

32
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,560
didn't you?

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,600
You know what?

34
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,520
From now on,

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,110
I won't get involved
in your love life at all.

36
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,240
You'll just be alone

37
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,900
for the rest of your life.

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,560
Yi Yi.

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,910
Yi Yi.

40
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:36,880
Come down.

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,130
They said you were sick,

42
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,850
so I came to check on you.

43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,710
Don't be so nervous.

44
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,630
I'm not here on behalf of myself.

45
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,290
I'm here on behalf of the organization...

46
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,960
to check on you.

47
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
I'm not nervous.

48
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,970
I've got nothing left anyway.

49
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,970
If you want to hate me,

50
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,920
then go ahead.

51
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,550
If you want me to feel sorry

52
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,680
or guilty,

53
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,780
then you're wrong.

54
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,190
I owe you nothing.

55
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,630
Those things you wrote,

56
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,070
if I hadn't seen them, it'd be fine.

57
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,720
But I did,

58
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,920
and I had to report it.

59
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,250
That's discipline.

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,680
I don't hate you.

61
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,430
I just feel a little pity for you.

62
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,950
Why do you feel pity for me?

63
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,659
You're just pretending
to be something you're not.

64
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,510
Lucky for you, Minister Wen

65
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,510
is educated

66
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,570
and broad-minded.

67
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,510
If it were anyone else,

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,090
who knows how they'd handle
someone like you.

69
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,240
I've delivered the organization's regards.

70
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,300
I'll get going now.

71
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,430
Medicine!

72
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,750
Didn't you have stomach problems before?

73
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,880
Zhaoyuan used to...

74
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,460
You know how to cook it, right?

75
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,040
Slow simmer, remember.

76
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,070
Thank you.

77
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,159
The organization has reviewed your case

78
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,040
and decided to deal with it
through criticism and education.

79
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,030
You need to write a self-criticism report,

80
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,960
then it won't go on your record.

81
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,159
Thank you, Ma'am.

82
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,680
But,

83
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,630
don't think you're in the clear

84
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,090
just because this is over.

85
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,040
You must actively participate in

86
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,159
the political study sessions
organized by the trade union.

87
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,720
As an intellectual from the old era,

88
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,920
if you want to keep up with the new times,

89
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,280
you need to change your attitude,

90
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,360
and firmly stand

91
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,600
with the working class.

92
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,620
Thank you, Ma'am.

93
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,130
But I don't have a unit now.

94
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,620
The organization has arranged
a job for you.

95
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,470
Anhua Workshop
has established a night school.

96
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,180
You'll be responsible

97
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,600
for teaching the cultural courses there.

98
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,560
This job

99
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,430
will also help you
have a deeper understanding

100
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,070
of the workers

101
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,870
and benefit from their assistance.

102
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,930
Your appointment letter.

103
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,659
Here you are.

104
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,720
Take it!

105
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,930
Aren't you going to say thank you?

106
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,480
Say "Thank you, Ma'am."

107
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,790
Thank you, Ma'am.

108
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,560
Ms. Yi.

109
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,310
I know all about your situation.

110
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,570
I just want to tell you—

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,090
don't lose hope.

112
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,390
I have no hope left.

113
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,090
Mine is already shattered.

114
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,250
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,060
I'm complaining again.

116
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,180
It won't happen again.

117
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,130
Actually,

118
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,330
the moment you chose to
hand over your diary,

119
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,220
you should've known this could happen.

120
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,210
Did I have any other choice?

121
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,290
Of course you did.

122
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,610
You could have

123
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,020
refused to hand it over

124
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,370
or destroyed it.

125
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,310
I handed over my diary

126
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,510
because I felt I had nothing to hide.

127
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,120
And I believed that...

128
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,820
eventually, some leader would understand.

129
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,870
Your personality

130
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,720
made you choose the hardest path

131
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,950
for yourself.

132
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,030
Do you know what's hardest for me?

133
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,000
Your dignity.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,120
Your privacy.

135
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,100
I know these things are...

136
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,830
more precious than life itself

137
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,710
to an intellectual.

138
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,539
Am I right?

139
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,410
The new China has only been
established for 5 years,

140
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,140
and there's so much to rebuild.

141
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,600
Some things

142
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,150
we haven't done well,

143
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,170
and some cadres have been insensitive.

144
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,170
These are objective facts.

145
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,660
But overall,
the new China is making good progress—

146
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,930
it's positive and upbeat.

147
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,720
So,

148
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,760
you need to be more optimistic,

149
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,790
alright?

150
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,910
For those of you doing great things,

151
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,320
the times and history

152
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,480
may allow you to make mistakes.

153
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,540
No mistakes should be allowed.

154
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,510
We must avoid them as best we can.

155
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,940
I heard from Fu Zihe

156
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,000
that thanks to your persistence,

157
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,050
I wasn't given harsh punishment,

158
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,570
nor was it recorded in my file.

159
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,890
Thank you.

160
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,200
That was

161
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,430
the organization's decision.

162
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,460
Then thanks to the organization.

163
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,750
Director.

164
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,840
I'll take this call then.

165
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,500
Go ahead.

166
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,870
Hello.

167
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,960
Mr. Yang isn't here.

168
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,510
What?

169
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,840
Zhou,

170
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,070
I retrieved these files for you.

171
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,230
What's wrong?

172
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,110
Director,

173
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,290
Mr. Yang's mother has passed away.

174
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,530
Don't tell him yet.

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,790
Mr. Yang.

176
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,480
Director.

177
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,350
What's wrong?

178
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,590
Well,

179
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,410
Mr. Yang,

180
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,400
there was a call from your home.

181
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:19,800
Mom!

182
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:21,730
Mom!

183
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,000
I failed you, Mom.

184
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,470
Mom... I didn't get
to see you one last time.

185
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,330
Lad.

186
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,530
Young lad.

187
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,730
Your mother wouldn't blame you.

188
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,910
She'd surely be proud of her son.

189
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,980
Do you hear me?

190
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,390
Good lad.

191
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,960
My heart aches...

192
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,030
Zhou.

193
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,650
Zhou.

194
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,960
Take him to the station.

195
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,480
Just use the unit car.

196
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,190
After the first
seven days of mourning...

197
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,980
Yang, once that's over,

198
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,720
finish your family matters
and then come back.

199
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,150
Sisters,

200
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,730
our workshop's night school
officially starts today.

201
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,670
The leadership has appointed Ms. Yi

202
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,600
as our teacher.

203
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,670
She'll teach us reading, writing,
and cultural courses.

204
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,930
Everyone, let's give her a warm welcome.

205
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,100
Before we begin the class,

206
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,080
let's first share our own stories.

207
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,630
Let's talk about our lives

208
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,320
before and after Liberation.

209
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,870
Who wants to go first?

210
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,440
-Me!
-Me!

211
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,610
I didn't expect you all
to be this enthusiastic.

212
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,020
Then let's have Qiu speak on our behalf

213
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
and share with everyone.

214
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,390
That way Ms. Yi
can get to know everyone better.

215
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:27,870
Come on.

216
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,840
Well,

217
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,800
when I was 10 years old,

218
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,670
my parents starved to death.

219
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,240
After that, my uncle
sold me to an opera troupe.

220
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,250
He used the money from selling me
to pay for my parents' burial.

221
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,440
At the troupe, I worked every day

222
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,670
yet still got beaten.

223
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,920
I didn't learn anything useful.

224
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,720
Later,

225
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,910
the troupe leader sold me again

226
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,200
to a wealthy old lady as a maid.

227
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,840
The old lady beat me,

228
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,840
pinched me, and yanked my hair every day.

229
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,290
I was covered in bruises.

230
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,990
If it weren't for the Communist Party,

231
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,720
I would've died 100 times.

232
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,670
Xiurong,

233
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,830
only in the new society

234
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,990
did I finally feel like a human being.

235
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,520
I love working here.

236
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,550
I love my sisters.

237
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,840
I love Xiurong.

238
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,480
I love Ms. Yi, too.

239
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,320
Qiu,

240
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,150
don't be sad.

241
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,840
Those bitter days are over!

242
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,000
Right, sisters?

243
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,200
-Yes.
-That's right.

244
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,670
Now let's have Ms. Yi begin the class.

245
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,220
Come here.

246
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,570
Why aren't you saying anything?

247
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,600
Today I'll talk about
tie-dye craftsmanship.

248
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,800
Your voice is too low!
We can't hear you.

249
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,680
Ms. Yi, please speak up.

250
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,000
That's right!

251
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,910
Tie-dye craftsmanship

252
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,840
is part of
our traditional hand-dyeing techniques.

253
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,110
It can be traced back as early

254
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,120
as the Eastern Jin Dynasty.

255
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,790
Later, people began
applying this technique.

256
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,590
Minister Wen?

257
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,440
What brings you here?

258
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,080
Welcome, welcome.

259
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,790
I heard

260
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,640
Ms. Yi would be teaching today,

261
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,900
so I came to take a look.

262
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,680
Well,

263
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,700
how's the class going?

264
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,670
Ms. Yi,

265
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,270
you're not nervous, are you?

266
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,000
I remember back in Yan'an,

267
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,660
the first time I gave a speech,

268
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,680
facing that sea of people,

269
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,390
I was nervous too.

270
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
It'll get better gradually.

271
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,810
Minister Wen, since you're already here,

272
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,720
why don't you say a few words too?

273
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,960
No, this is a classroom,

274
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,069
not a meeting room.

275
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,550
You should be listening

276
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,440
to Ms. Yi, not me.

277
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,030
Please, say a few words.

278
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,349
We want to learn cultural courses,

279
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,270
and we also want to hear from you.

280
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,810
Alright, I'll just say a few words.

281
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,750
The old society turned people into ghosts,

282
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,340
and the new society
turned ghosts back into people.

283
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,510
Without the Communist Party,

284
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,040
there would be no new China.

285
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,600
Sisters,

286
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,160
fellow workers,

287
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,980
one day I hope

288
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,750
I can call you all

289
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,330
comrades.

290
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,310
Bravo!

291
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,100
I want to ask a question.

292
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,390
What did we fight for

293
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,030
and shed blood for?

294
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,680
It was to build a new world.

295
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,000
In this new world,

296
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,950
there will be no oppression.

297
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,270
All the oppressed

298
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,210
will rise up and become their own masters.

299
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,350
Everyone will no longer live in poverty.

300
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,880
In this new world,

301
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,270
every person

302
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,160
will have the dignity they were born with.

303
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,610
This is the goal we're fighting for.

304
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,150
Thank you, everyone.

305
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,590
Alright.

306
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,230
Ms. Yi,

307
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,330
please begin your class.

308
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,810
Who is it?

309
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,620
Ms. Yi.

310
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,200
Ms. Yi.

311
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,170
Nanny Zhang.

312
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,650
I finished it,

313
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,280
but forgot to bring it to you.

314
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,690
This dress is so well made.

315
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,490
You finished it so quickly.

316
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,240
Thank you.

317
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,440
You're welcome.

318
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,030
Ms. Yi,

319
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,440
are you going to be a great writer now?

320
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,230
I found a job.

321
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,010
I'm teaching night classes at a workshop.

322
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,340
I'm preparing lessons.

323
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
By the way, Ms. Yi,

324
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,030
I actually came here today

325
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,510
to discuss a business plan with you.

326
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,960
Look,

327
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,720
this dress is so well made.

328
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,630
It would surely sell well on the market.

329
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,830
Why don't you make clothes at home,

330
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,480
and I'll go find sales channels for you?

331
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,920
We could make money together.

332
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,180
Wouldn't it be great to share the profit?

333
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,900
I don't have time.
I need to prepare my class.

334
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,580
Well then,

335
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,670
how about you take 70%, and I take 30%?

336
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
Take care. I won't walk you out then.

337
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,140
If you're not interested,

338
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,420
I'll find someone else to partner with.

339
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,240
Today, I want to talk about

340
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,160
the history of women's clothing in China.

341
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,540
I'll skip the distant caveman era.

342
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,830
They probably just wore animal skins.

343
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,910
Let's start with the Qin Dynasty.

344
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,900
Does anyone here
know about the Qin Dynasty?

345
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,250
What about the story of Lady Meng Jiang
weeping down the Great Wall?

346
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,400
-Yes.
-Yes.

347
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,580
Lady Meng Jiang lived
during the Qin Dynasty.

348
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,180
Their clothing back then

349
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
should've looked like this.

350
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,980
The fabric at that time

351
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
was similar to

352
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,050
what rural people still weave today.

353
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,380
Back in the Qin and Han periods,
black was considered noble.

354
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,510
It's very different
from the situation today,

355
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,720
where red and yellow are favored.

356
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,510
Zhou,

357
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,110
did you know?

358
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,030
Yang actually grew up in the countryside.

359
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,480
His mother

360
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,770
was just an ordinary peasant woman.

361
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,240
Their life back then was extremely hard,

362
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,810
and they were literally
living hand to mouth.

363
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,580
Later,

364
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,400
his father passed away.

365
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,000
So basically,

366
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,730
his widowed mother raised him by herself.

367
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,890
They went through so much suffering.

368
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,600
Then the Communist Party came.

369
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,750
They overthrew the landlords
and distributed land to the peasants.

370
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,960
From then on, they lived a better life.

371
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,200
And then, what happened?

372
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,110
Well, he joined the army, right?

373
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,640
After he joined the army,
he took up his post.

374
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,640
Just look at him—

375
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,110
he has always been working hard
and always striving to improve.

376
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,590
No wonder Mr. Yang was

377
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,200
so focused and dedicated in his work.

378
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,590
Speak of the devil!

379
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,110
Who is it?

380
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,710
Director.

381
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,960
Mr. Yang's back.

382
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,720
He's back?

383
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,480
Comrade Zhou.

384
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,200
He's back.

385
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,920
Director.

386
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,310
I'm back.

387
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,300
How's everything?

388
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,910
Why did you rush back?

389
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,030
Did you finish everything at home?

390
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,920
Yes, it's all taken care of.

391
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,320
I want to get back to work.

392
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,530
No need to rush back to work.

393
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,640
Right now, the city's

394
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,130
focusing on rectifying
neighborhood affairs.

395
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,660
It might involve
quite a few business people.

396
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,200
And the city also requires us to cooperate

397
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,240
with Neighborhood Working Committee

398
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,030
under the
Political and Legal Affairs Commission.

399
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,330
This job suits you.

400
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,040
Later, show him

401
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,030
the Neighborhood Committee files.

402
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,660
Sure.

403
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,730
You’ll be in charge
of this neighborhood rectification.

404
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,870
I guarantee I'll complete the mission.

405
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,500
Good.

406
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,270
Mr. Yang,

407
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,110
are you really ready to work now?

408
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,960
Comrade Zhou,

409
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,610
bring me the files.

410
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,400
Right away.

411
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,540
Please.

412
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,240
I miss this place so much!

413
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,840
Are you sure you're alright?

414
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,550
Mr. Yang, you came to work so early!

415
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,010
I didn't sleep last night.

416
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,030
Surprised?

417
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,440
Have you had breakfast?

418
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,160
Not yet.

419
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,190
I've got a cucumber here.

420
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,480
Thanks.

421
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,030
You can have it.

422
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,350
I was just getting hungry.

423
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,280
Go ahead and eat.

424
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,440
Have you had breakfast?

425
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,750
I haven't eaten yet.

426
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,010
It's fine. Go ahead and eat.

427
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,290
Let's eat together.

428
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,830
Thanks.

429
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,010
Do you only have a cucumber for breakfast?

430
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,790
No. I had corn yesterday.

431
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,510
The neighborhood

432
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,080
submitted some materials,

433
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,880
saying that someone's
disrupting the market.

434
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,920
You came at the right time.
Let's go together.

435
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,070
Let's bring that person in.

436
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,830
Right now?

437
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,350
Yes.

Let's go now.

Let's go.

440
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,270
Mr. Yang, wait a moment.

441
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:07,920
Hold on, Mr. Yang.

442
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,880
Mr. Yang, just a second.

443
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,810
What's going on?

444
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,710
I forgot something.

445
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,180
Alright, let's go.

446
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,930
I thought it was corn.

[Xiangyangli Residents' Committee]

448
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,980
Mr. Yang, Comrade Zhou.

449
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,990
Please have a seat.

450
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,030
No need. Let's discuss work first.

451
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,460
Last night,

452
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,750
I reviewed the report you submitted.

453
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,350
In your report, you mentioned that,

454
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,270
lately, there have been
Yiguandao activities in this area.

455
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:34,880
Yes,

456
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,110
I've reported the specifics.

457
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,830
Yiguandao's leader is using small favors

458
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,350
to recruit members and expand the network.

459
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,750
From what I can tell,

460
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,990
many people

461
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,450
have infiltrated the residents' committee.

462
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,650
Our committee was just established

463
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,640
and has appointed many people
from various backgrounds.

464
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,440
Their backgrounds are complex,

465
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,190
and they're highly adaptable.

466
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,730
We need to target these people,

467
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,250
and crack down on them.

468
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,410

00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,880
please take notes.

472
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,310
Mr. Yang, you're still here.

473
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,810
Why are you here this late?

474
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,240
I thought you were still working overtime.

475
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,910
I was worried you'd be hungry,
so I brought you some food.

476
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,040
You brought me food?

477
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,300
Let me see.

478
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,630

488
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,110

Answer me! Are you taking private jobs?

00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,050
It's a sewing machine.

00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,290
Why would I be nervous?

568
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,010
Isn't this exactly
what being nervous looks like?

569
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,290
It's so typical.

570
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,010
Where did you get the sewing machine?

571
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:25,740
Did you steal it?

572
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,160
Did your family lose a sewing machine?

573
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,290
Just ask what you want to ask directly!

574
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,640
When did you meet

575
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Zhang Guihua?

576
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,030
When I moved here;
Comrade Su introduced us.

577
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,150
What did I just say?

578
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,160
Just answer

579
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,670
what you're asked.

580
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,480
Why did you bring up irrelevant people?

581
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,860
What do you mean by irrelevant people?

582
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,620
My personnel file is still at the factory.

583
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,250
Comrade Su is my leader.

584
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,650
Does she sound irrelevant to you?

585
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,810
You recognize it, don't you?

586
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,910
Take a good look at it yourself.

587
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,080
This is

588
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,270
a sample dress you made for Zhang Guihua.

589
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,120
Zhang Guihua took it
to sell on the market.

590
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,240
You disrupted the market

591
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,440
and made huge profits.

592
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,370
What do you mean?

593
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,320
Yes, I made this dress.

594
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,780
I gave it to her as a gift.

595
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,240
Why did you give her a gift?

596
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,960
What was your intention?

597
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,240
She asked me to make this dress!

598
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,240
Yes,

599
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,510
I wanted to keep good relations
with my neighbors.

600
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,640
Is that not allowed?

601
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,800
You wanted to keep
good relations with neighbors?

602
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,800
Is Zhang Guihua here?

603
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,040
Bring Zhang Guihua in.

604
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,420
-Where's Zhang Guihua?
-Zhang Guihua.

605
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,200
Coming! Coming!

606
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,790
Excuse me, guys, please make way.

607
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,830
Oh my.

608
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,240
Mr. Yang.

609
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,290
Take a look at her. Do you know her?

610
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,350
She's an old friend of yours, isn't she?

611
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:50,940
Come on.

612
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,660
Repeat what

613
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,040
you just told me,

614
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,330
so she knows exactly

615
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,300
what deal you had with her.

616
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:57,930
Say it.

617
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,260
Mr. Yang, well,

618
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,810
let me explain this for you.

619
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,810
Actually,

620
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,950
I didn't want to help her at first.

621
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,970
She asked me to sell that dress for her.

622
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,780
I felt soft-hearted and agreed.

623
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,680
I didn't make any money from it.

624
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,060
What are you talking about, Nanny Zhang?

625
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,790
How could you make up such lies?

626
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,840
When did I ever ask you
to sell this dress?

627
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,120
I made this dress,

628
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,880
because you asked me to make it for you!

629
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,590
You...

630
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,170
You need to show evidence
when you say something like that.

631
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:21,940
What evidence?

632
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,200
How can you say such nonsense?

633
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,880
Who's talking nonsense?

634
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,790
She is!

635
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,350
Listen to me.

636
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,610
Although Zhang Guihua

637
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,180
made mistakes before,

638
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,820
she's still trustworthy.

639
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,240
The comrades can vouch for her, right?

640
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,070
How can you prove she's telling the truth?

641
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,300
Then how can I prove
you're telling the truth?

642
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,380
You just said

643
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,610
she's a leader of Yiguandao.

644
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,880
Then... what about you?

645
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,320
What's your position?

646
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,950
I'm asking you—

647
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,400
do you have anyone backing you?

648
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,200
Explain it clearly to everyone.

649
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,590
If you say I have someone backing me,

650
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,980
then the organization is my backing.

651
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,240
I put my trust in the organization!

652
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,050
Minister Wen once said

653
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,920
the organization
wouldn't let a bad person go

654
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,640
and would never wrong a good person.

655
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,220
But Minister Wen doesn't represent

656
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,240
the organization and the government.

657
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,000
Then tell me,

658
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
is what Minister Wen said

659
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,240
right or wrong?

660
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,450
Excuse me.

661
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,070
Make way, please.

662
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,110
You...

663
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,030
Mr. Yang.

664
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,570
Did you all hear that?

665
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,930
This woman

666
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,570
has committed illegal acts,

667
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,770
but refuses to admit them.

668
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,090
She's from your unit,

669
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,710
isn't she?

670
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,940
Her personnel file
is at your unit, isn't it?

671
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,410
You must take full responsibility!

672
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,780
Your unit must be held accountable.

673
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,830
Come. Stand here.

674
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,670
We'll continue the investigation,

675
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,400
until we get to the bottom of it.

676
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,710
Zhang Guihua confessed that

677
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,980
you made a business plan with her.

678
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,510
You were responsible
for designing and making clothes,

679
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,710
while she sold them on the black market.

680
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,610
She also said all the ideas were yours,

681
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,190
and that she only agreed reluctantly

682
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,760
after you persuaded her.

683
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,580
Is what she said true?

684
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,820
I was thinking,

685
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,969
since you didn't have a job

686
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,230
or income before,

687
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,150
making some clothes to get by

688
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,310
is something we can understand.

689
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,110
But...

690
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,230
when it comes to

691
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,150
making a business plan...

692
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,440
that's absolutely unacceptable!

693
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,409
I didn't make any business plans.

694
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,840
Before the case is clarified,

695
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,170
your classes will be suspended.

696
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,690
If you have any difficulties in life,

697
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,510
Ms. Yi,

698
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,090
you can ask the organization for help.

699
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,110
I have no difficulties.

700
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,690
This place is just unbearably hot!

701
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,400
I told you,

702
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,230
I have several vacant villas

703
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,360
that you can move in anytime,

704
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,920
but you insist on staying here.

705
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,110
It's stuffy and hot.

706
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,840
You know I sweat easily.

707
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,110
I just changed into this new outfit,
by the way.

708
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,760
If you have something to say, just say it.

709
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,290
Today,

710
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,320
I went to the working committee
to ask about your case.

711
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,870
The person in charge said

712
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,870
this rectification campaign

713
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,400
has dealt with
a large number of bad elements.

714
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,230
That Zhang Guihua from your neighborhood

715
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,960
has already been sent back to her hometown

716
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,090
to undergo reform
under local government supervision.

717
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,150
She also mentioned your case,

718
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,480
said it's quite complicated.

719
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,550
They plan to send people
to your mother's home in Chongqing

720
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,810
to investigate your family background.

721
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,420
Got it.

722
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,120
And Minister Wen...

723
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,510
at such a critical moment,

724
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,970
he went on a business trip!

725
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,520
You also think Minister Wen
cares about me as an individual?

726
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,520
I thought he sympathized with you.

727
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,760
Minister Wen is a leader.

728
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,630
He cares about the fate of

729
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,430
intellectuals as a collective.

730
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,960
If he were truly just

731
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,160
sympathizing with me as an individual,

732
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,250
that would make me truly hopeless.

733
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,550
Yi, listen to me.

734
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,050
We should leave Shanghai.

735
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,360
First, let's avoid people
like Yang Xue'an.

736
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,320
Let's go back to Chongqing.
I have friends there

737
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,320
who can set you up with a decent job.

738
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
You know me.

739
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,320
Alright then.

740
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,650
Since you’ve decided
not to leave Shanghai,

741
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,760
if you need any help,

742
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,920
come to me anytime.

743
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,080
Sis.

744
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,120
Sis.

745
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,420
Sis.

746
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,010
Sis!

747
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:31,820
Zhaoyuan...

748
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,540
is not a KMT member!

749
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,230
Where is he?

750
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,100
That's good news.

751
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,880
Sis.

752
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,360
Zhaoyuan

753
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,120
joined the Communist Party

754
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,960
while he was
in the KMT army during the war.

755
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,760
He's not a KMT member!

756
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,700
He's an underground Communist.

757
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,480
Ms. Yi Yi.

758
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,710
After a thorough

759
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,480
and careful investigation,

760
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,400
the organization has confirmed
that your husband, Comrade Zhou Zhaoyuan,

761
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,470
was a loyal member of our Party.

762
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,480
Is he still alive?

763
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,260
He was betrayed by a traitor
before the liberation.

764
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,670
Comrade Zhou Zhaoyuan

765
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,840
was killed by the reactionary government.
He died heroically.

766
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,230
His glory and his legacy

767
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,150
have been passed on to you.

768
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,380
You must be strong.

769
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,880
You must carry on his spirit.
