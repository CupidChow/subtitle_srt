[Episode 20]

3
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,330
I've made some stylistic changes
this time.

4
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,330
Look at the draft.

5
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,640
I can see that.

6
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,770
It's so beautiful.

7
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,400
Great Designer Yi!

8
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,570
Great Designer Yi!

9
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,229
Hello, hello.

10
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,229
Getting off work?

11
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,510
Hello, hello.

12
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,330
Comrade Xiurong, you're here too.

13
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,820
Feels like forever since I last saw you.

14
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,150
Now, I'm working as a reporter

15
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,430
for the newspaper.

16
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,360
Since our workshop is

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,820
a pilot for state-private joint ownership,

18
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,230
I'm particularly interested in
learning about

19
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,870
the people here—

20
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,430
ordinary workers,

21
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,560
labor representatives,

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,240
capitalists,

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,300
and also designers

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,650
and artists like you.

25
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,160
And where...

26
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,760
where does your design inspiration
come from?

27
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,120
What do you want to know?

28
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,030
Well, for example,

29
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,310
when I just came in,

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,030
I saw you

31
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,620
admiring your work.

32
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,130
It's gorgeous.

33
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,970
This is an attempt to
blend Chinese and Western styles.

34
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,040
Chinese and Western styles...

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,280
Then,

36
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,360
what does this mean?

37
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,090
This comes from the flying apsaras dance
from the Dunhuang murals.

38
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,370
Right, right.

39
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,920
Reporter Yang, have you been to Dunhuang?

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,960
Dunhuang.

41
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,960
Dunhuang...

42
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,840
I-I'll go chat with the workers,

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,430
the fellow workers.

44
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,650
I'll have... have a quick chat with them.

45
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,910
You carry on, carry on.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,030
Newly made?

47
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,340
It's very well done.

48
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:15,960
Yi.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,329
Does Minister Wen know

50
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,050
that Reporter Yang is here
to interview you?

51
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,450
What does this have to do
with Minister Wen?

52
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,200
He could help review it for you.

53
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,530
Xiurong,

54
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,290
I don't want any special privileges,

55
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,050
and I don't want people to find a reason

56
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,180
to criticize Minister Wen through me.

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,560
I take responsibility for everything I do.

58
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,020
Even if you think this way,

59
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,840
others will still think
you have privileges.

60
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,700
I can't control what others think.

61
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,079
I only make sure I do my own part well.

62
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,240
Does your work have a mix of styles?

63
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,590
Does your work have...

64
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,310
Let me show you this one.

65
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,170
A blend of Chinese and Western...

66
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,240
Hello?

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,210
I'm not disturbing you
while you're on duty, am I?

68
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,730
I thought you would say,

69
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,310
"I'm not disturbing your rest, am I?"

70
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,960
You wouldn't be resting at this hour.

71
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,080
Neither would I.

72
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,050
How are your designs coming along?

73
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
Do you need my advice?

74
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,630
No.

75
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,720
Why?

76
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,060
Looking down on this layman?

77
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,430
Of course.

78
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,030
Laypeople can't guide professionals.

79
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,900
Comrade Wen Pu.

80
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,630
Yes, Ma'am.

81
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
I order you to stop staying up late

82
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,390
and go to bed now.

83
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,090
I'll follow your order, Ma'am.

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,140
You should rest early too.

85
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,270
Good night.

86
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,500
Good night.

87
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,010
Yi!

88
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:49,950
Yi!

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
-Here, Xiurong.
-Yi!

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,020
Look at this article quickly.

91
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,600
Here.

92
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,040
The article

93
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,560
doesn't mention your name,

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,600
but the factory leaders

95
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
called me.

96
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,270
They think the designer
mentioned in the article

97
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,430
is you.

98
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,970
These aren't my final drafts.

99
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,950
How did they end up
in Yang Xue'an's hands?

100
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,040
How did you handle your drafts?

101
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,840
I gave them to the pattern makers

102
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,050
so they could make samples for me to see.

103
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,010
Then they must've made a mistake.

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,070
They must have mistaken these

105
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,680
for your final designs.

106
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,160
I'm going to find Yang Xue'an now.

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,690
No, I have to ask him myself!

108
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,560
How could he use my discarded drafts?

109
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,850
How could he write it up like this?

110
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,560
If Yang Xue'an did this on purpose,

111
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,310
would arguing with him help?

112
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,830
Then who can defend me?

113
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,409
Go to Minister Wen.

114
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,360
He's a leader

115
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,409
and an old revolutionary.

116
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,070
-I'm sure he can...
-I repeat!

117
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,310
I will not drag others down
for something I did myself.

118
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,190
Is Minister Wen "others"?

119
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,850
Xiurong, look at this headline.

120
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,760
"New Trends in Class Struggle."

121
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,020
This is a big deal!

122
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,720
Yi.

123
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,650
This article does come across
as a bit radical.

124
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,190
But you're someone
who has weathered great storms.

125
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,190
Don't be nervous.

126
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,600
It's not that I care

127
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,310
what others say about me.

128
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,560
They can say whatever they want.

129
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,950
But my actions now

130
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,360
no longer represent just myself!

131
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
I understand.

132
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
How about this:

133
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,620
I'll go talk to the factory leaders again.

134
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,420
Is that okay?

135
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,270
Just...

136
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,070
please don't say anything rash
or do anything impulsive,

137
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,750
okay?

138
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,870
Just wait for me here.

139
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,220
I'll be back soon.

140
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,170
Wait for me here!

141
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,150
Hello?

142
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,230
Hello.

143
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,090
I know all about the news report.

144
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,550
I'm afraid of getting you involved.

145
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,310
I'm going to talk to Yang Xue'an myself.

146
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,360
Don't be nervous,

147
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,760
and don't overthink it.

148
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,950
Go to the water town

149
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,030
and lie low for a while.

150
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,230
Leave this matter to me.

151
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,750
What about you?

152
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,750
Don't worry.

153
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,990
I'll handle everything.

154
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,820
Comrade Zhou,

155
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,120
I was planning to
talk to the factory leaders,

156
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
but I don't think it would help much.

157
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,310
This issue has already spread to
the city level,

158
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,240
so I asked you to come.

159
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,680
Let's figure something out together.

160
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,070
What can I do?

161
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,160
How could Yang Xue'an do something
like this?

162
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,600
Isn't he your boyfriend?

163
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,270
Yi?

164
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,310
Yi!

165
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,750
Yi!

166
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,830
Where has she gone?

167
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,270
Here's a note

168
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,270
and a letter.

169
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,270
"Comrade Xiurong,

170
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,950
in response to various opinions
about my design drafts,

171
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,920
I need to step out of the design room

172
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,180
to find more materials and inspiration
in society.

173
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,060
Please give me some time.

174
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,360
As long as the factory leaders trust me,

175
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,870
I will persist in completing my designs."

176
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,640
There's also a letter.

177
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,810
She wants me to pass it to Minister Wen.

178
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,870
She must be afraid of
implicating Minister Wen.

179
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,600
For heaven's sake,

180
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,880
she hasn't done anything wrong.

181
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,850
What is there to be afraid of?

182
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,850
Exactly.

183
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,720
Xiurong, what are you doing?

184
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,270
Hello?

185
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,490
Please connect me to the city government.

186
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,490
Xiurong, don't make the call.

187
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,480
She definitely doesn't want
Minister Wen to know,

188
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,810
and that's why she left.

189
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,800
You intellectuals are just too concerned
with keeping up appearances.

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,330
Who is Minister Wen anyway?

191
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,390
If he's afraid of
being implicated by others,

192
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,250
then he wouldn't be Minister Wen.

193
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,750
Hello?

194
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,320
Yes, yes.

195
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,260
Minister Wen, I was just about to
call you.

196
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,640
Okay, okay.

197
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,650
Minister Wen will be here shortly.

198
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,960
Minister Wen, this way.

199
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,150
This way, please.

200
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,700
Please.

201
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,940
This is a letter from Yi Yi for you.

202
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,960
Open the door.

203
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,380
Aren't you afraid someone might hear us?

204
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,210
Open the door.

205
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,880
Don't be so nervous.

206
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,000
Please sit down.

207
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,430
Minister Wen.

208
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,240
Here's a stool.

209
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,720
You can sit while you read.

210
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,250
No need. I'm fine standing.

211
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,350
Then let me...

212
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,670
pour you some tea?

213
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,400
Would you like some?

214
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,170
[I'll take care of myself. Don't worry.]

215
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,070
What did my sister-in-law say?

216
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,980
Don't worry.

217
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,270
She'll be fine.

218
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,290
She will take care of herself.

219
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,120
Minister Wen.

220
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,790
Oh right,

221
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,030
look.

222
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,510
These are Designer Yi's
latest design drafts.

223
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,150
Reporter Yang's article

224
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,770
used her discarded drafts.

225
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,600
I know Designer Yi.

226
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,120
She's just a simple designer

227
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,270
who wants to make these export products

228
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,870
beautiful and elegant

229
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,910
to satisfy foreign buyers.

230
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:40,910
Look,

231
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,310
these lines really capture
the beauty of our Chinese style.

232
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,670
I heard she drew inspiration from
the Dunhuang flying apsaras murals.

233
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,270
Xiurong,

234
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,370
the report this time

235
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,670
also interviewed your factory's
Chief Designer Tang.

236
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,470
Many of the quotes were from him.

237
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,450
Does he have a lot of influence?

238
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,050
Regarding this matter,

239
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
I've verified with Designer Tang.

240
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,050
There was indeed a reporter named Yang

241
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,110
who called him.

242
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,120
However,

243
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,130
he wasn't familiar with the situation

244
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,330
and gave some vague answers
to the reporter's questions.

245
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,070
Reporter Yang

246
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,870
clearly didn't look into things carefully
this time.

247
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,480
His thinking is too arbitrary

248
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,550
and rigid!

249
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,910
He always tries to

250
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,240
make everything into something serious!

251
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,240
Minister Wen,

252
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,730
this matter has had quite an impact.

253
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,770
Even the city's foreign trade officials
have inquired about it.

254
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,650
Really?

255
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,620
Some people don't bother to
learn the facts.

256
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,680
They just spread whatever they hear.

257
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,630
Minister,

258
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,240
what about my sister-in-law?

259
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,090
It's okay.

260
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,550
This matter

261
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,840
can get more people involved in

262
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,040
the discussion about cultural exchange
between China and the West.

263
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,120
It's a good thing.

264
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,910
It also increases
your factory's visibility.

265
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,870
How is that a good thing?

266
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,000
The more people discuss it,

267
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,240
the worse it gets for my sister-in-law!

268
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,920
Minister Wen.

269
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,350
You're really going to let this happen?

270
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,280
Relax.

271
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,390
When this matter is
brought before the masses,

272
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,350
the truth will become clearer
through debate.

273
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,820
What if it doesn't?

274
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,240
Minister Wen,

275
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,870
we're counting on you regarding Ms. Yi.

276
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,730
She'll be fine.

277
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Sir,

278
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,750
-I'd like an order of fried tofu puffs.
-Hello.

279
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,680
Coming right up!

280
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,960
Miss, here you go.

281
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,320
Thanks. Here's the money.

282
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,920
What were you thinking,
writing this article?

283
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,910
Did you get

284
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,910
Yi Yi's consent before publishing this?

285
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,030
You took her discarded drafts

286
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,000
and made such a big deal out of them,

287
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,240
writing such a provocative headline!

288
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,750
Do you realize

289
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,630
this could have serious consequences?

290
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,630
Can you calm down?

291
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,430
If you can calm down,

292
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,140
we can talk.

293
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,120
-What are you looking at?
-If you can't calm down,

294
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,040
I'll leave now.

295
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,790
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,720
Am I not calm enough?

297
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,180
I'm asking you questions.

298
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,630
First,

299
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,460
my work

300
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,840
doesn't require anyone's approval.

301
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,440
Second...

302
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,750
I don't care
if those drawings were discarded

303
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,720
or official.

304
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,790
The fact that she drew them

305
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,040
proves there's something wrong
with her thinking.

306
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,360
She has reactionary thoughts.

307
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,560
What I'm doing now is trying to save her—

308
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,970
pulling her back from the edge of danger!

309
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,570
Xue'an,

310
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,100
what's wrong with you?

311
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,630
There's something seriously wrong
with your thinking right now!

312
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,630
You're being too radical, you know that?

313
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,200
Look...

314
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,390
Look, Minister Wen and Director Fang

315
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,840
didn't say anything about this matter...

316
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,320
Don't mention Minister Wen to me.

317
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,030
They didn't say anything!

318
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,890
Don't mention Minister Wen to me!

319
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,310
I used to work
in the Anti-Capitalist Office.

320
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,470
I put all my passion and effort into it.

321
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,870
He looked down on me!

322
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,440
He was biased against me

323
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,180
and transferred me away from my position!

324
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,790
I could have had a bright future!

325
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,390
And you?

326
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,550
As my girlfriend,

327
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,380
have you ever spoken up for me?

328
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,630
Have you ever considered things
from my perspective?

329
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,260
For the sake of that job back then,

330
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:08,990
my mother...

331
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,870
You want to talk about your mother, right?

332
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,240
Yang Xue'an,

333
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,320
you brought this up yourself.

334
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,870
Leave my mother out of this.

335
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,670
When your mother was sick,

336
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,390
critically ill,

337
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,150
you didn't even go back to see her!

338
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,070
Leave my mother out of this!

339
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,030
Do you regret it or not?

340
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,550
Leave my mother out of this!

341
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,030
Do you regret it or not?

342
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,480
You have no right!

343
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,960
Do you regret it?

344
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,020
You have no right to reopen my wounds!

345
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,040
Zhou Yunqing.

346
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,130
Before...

347
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,660
when you agreed to date me,

348
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,190
I thought you valued me as a person.

349
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,200
Now I understand.

350
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,730
You were only interested in
my position back then.

351
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,170
You were attracted to my power!

352
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,230
You were in love with my power, not me!

353
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,130
Turns out you're actually quite insecure.

354
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,930
I always thought
you were full of confidence.

355
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:11,690
Get lost!

356
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,630
Minister Wen.

357
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,240
-Minister Wen.
-Come in.

358
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,910
Minister Wen.

359
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,720
What can I do for you?

360
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,520
Minister Wen,

361
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,120
I brought Yang here today

362
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,490
to apologize on behalf of the newspaper.

363
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,680
W-We're sorry.

364
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,080
Have a seat.

365
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,610
No, we won't sit, Minister Wen.

366
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,940
We don't deserve to sit.

367
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,550
We're too embarrassed to sit.

368
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,720
I've heard from readers

369
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,500
that Yang's article was somewhat biased

370
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,200
and stirred controversy.

371
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,280
We're sorry.

372
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,510
Yes, Minister Wen.

373
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,630
It was my negligence at work.

374
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,690
I apologize to you.

375
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,850
Would it be acceptable
to make amends this way?

376
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,270
We'll publish another article
in the newspaper's name,

377
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,180
stating that I, Yang Xue'an, failed

378
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,740
to properly review the clothing design

379
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,870
and hereby formally apologize
to Ms. Yi Yi.

380
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,800
Would that work?

381
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,740
I suggest

382
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,200
we explore this topic further.

383
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,950
Invite authorities from various fields

384
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,920
to discuss

385
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,120
the exchange and interaction
between Chinese and Western cultures.

386
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,960
An open discussion?

387
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,510
Wouldn't that cause

388
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,970
even more harm to Ms. Yi Yi?

389
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,080
I suggest we still apologize,

390
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,320
sincerely apologize.

391
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,780
I have faith in the masses.

392
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,410
I believe even more that the truth
will only become clearer through debate.

393
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,940
Editor-in-Chief Ji.

394
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,720
I'm leaving this in your hands.

395
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,790
Yes, Minister Wen.

396
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,160
Comrade Yang,

397
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,150
I also look forward to
your excellent follow-up reports.

398
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,450
Okay.

399
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,440
We'll be going now, Minister Wen.

400
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,180
Go ahead.

401
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,089
We'll head back first.

402
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,720
What's Minister Wen really up to?

403
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,680
Scholar.

404
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,630
If one day I run into trouble,

405
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,570
will you help me?

406
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,510
Of course, I will.

407
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,650
But it depends on what kind of trouble

408
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,180
and whether I can be of help.

409
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,580
Lend me some money to cover a shortfall.

410
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
How much?

411
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,000
10,000 yuan.

412
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,480
Are you kidding me?

413
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,920
Do you think I'm made of money?

414
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,720
See? See?

415
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,980
I knew you couldn't help me.

416
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,880
I was just kidding.

417
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,480
I just wanted to test you.

418
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,340
Well, well. Getting cunning now, huh?

419
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,800
You've learned to test me.

420
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,440
You know what?

421
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,270
If you're really in trouble,

422
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,540
I have some money saved up.

423
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,160
I can have Mrs. San
bring it to you tomorrow.

424
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,230
Forget it.

425
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,730
You don't have much money yourself.

426
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,550
Oh, right, you told me

427
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,680
you have a classmate
who's a leader in the Northeast, right?

428
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,880
Yes, Liu Tao.

429
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,440
He's the regional party secretary.

430
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,130
Why?

431
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,720
How's your relationship with him?

432
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,520
Pretty good.

433
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,580
We were roommates in college,

434
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,750
and we've kept in touch all these years.

435
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,620
Could you introduce us?

436
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,060
Why do you want to meet him?

437
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,670
Well...
with this construction project of mine,

438
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,100
all those materials and supplies

439
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,280
are shipped from the Northeast.

440
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,390
I was thinking if I knew such a leader,

441
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,750
maybe I could...

442
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,210
Could what?

443
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,940
You know, when the time comes, I could...

444
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,270
What are you getting at?

445
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,930
I'm telling you,

446
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,160
don't get any funny ideas.

447
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,400
We absolutely cannot do anything

448
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,750
that violates principles or discipline.

449
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,840
Look how serious you get.

450
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,000
I knew you couldn't help me.

451
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,110
Just...

452
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,030
Forget it.

453
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,680
Tell me,

454
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,160
are you in some kind of trouble?

455
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,760
No.

456
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,720
Really?

457
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,960
What trouble could I possibly have?

458
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,620
You can't hide things from me.

459
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,690
What would I be hiding from you?

460
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,830
Alright, alright. I'm hungry.

461
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,760
Have Mrs. San cook me some noodles.

462
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,440
What time is it?

463
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,040
Mrs. San went to bed long ago.

464
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,160
I'll make you some noodles.

465
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,490
And I'll throw in an extra egg for you.

466
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,010
Help yourself to some tea.

467
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,580
[Comrade Wen Pu,]

468
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,140
[it's 8 o'clock in the evening now.]

469
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,970
[What are you doing right now?]

470
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,000
[You're definitely not telling
bedtime stories to Yuanyuan.]

471
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,930
[I know.]

472
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,790
[You're probably busy working again.]

473
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,110
[You probably haven't had dinner yet.]

474
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,400
[You promised me]

475
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,880
[you'd eat meals on time.]

476
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,910
[You need to keep your promise.]

477
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,480
[Oh, and

478
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,110
you should drink less coffee when working at night.]

479
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,200
[It's bad for your health]

480
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,660
[and affects your sleep.]

481
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,110
[There aren't many residents
in this town.]

482
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,040
[It's lively during market days,]

483
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,550
[but once the sun sets,]

484
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,350
[it gets frighteningly quiet.]

485
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,750
[After some time,]

486
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,930
[I'll go back.]

487
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,840
[As soon as I return,]

488
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,650
[I'll come see you right away.]

489
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,480
[Don't worry about me.]

490
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,750
[Take good care of yourself.]

491
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,190
Just right.

492
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,510
Scholar.

493
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,110
You're really impressive.

494
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,440
Well...

495
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,410
This whole matter about Yi Yi

496
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,970
caused such a big stir,

497
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,680
yet you calmly and quietly

498
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,900
managed to handle it.

499
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,530
Have you thought about

500
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,110
what if the public opinion

501
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,000
had shifted in Yang Xue'an's favor?

502
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,260
What would you do then?

503
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,790
You went to the leadership, didn't you?

504
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,580
No, that's not it.

505
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,430
That's not like your personality.

506
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,520
So it was your own accurate judgment,

507
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,760
wasn't it?

508
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,400
Impressive.

509
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,620
Impressive. Truly impressive.

510
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,790
Tomorrow,

511
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,920
I'm going to see her.

512
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,070
Then I'll be your driver.

513
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,310
Young lady, this color looks nice, right?

514
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,570
Why don't you try it on?

515
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,350
Okay.

516
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,080
Here, take a look.

517
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,080
Thank you.

518
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,880
This color is lovely.

519
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,390
It suits you. Makes you look so elegant.

520
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,270
Beautiful, very beautiful.

521
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,830
Young lady, you're just too gorgeous.

522
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,160
Here.

523
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,720
Take this mirror and see for yourself.

524
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,040
Okay.

525
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,170
Isn't it beautiful?

526
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,350
Honestly, you're stunning.

527
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,440
You're absolutely stunning, young lady.

528
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,320
Alright.

529
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,450
Everyone is watching us.

530
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,710
Let them watch.

531
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,400
I want to hold you a little longer.

532
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
Okay, I'll listen to you.

533
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,360
Have you gained weight recently?

534
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,350
No.

535
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,020
Your arms are fuller than before.

536
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,670
Your stomach's gotten a bit rounder too.

537
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,380
Really?

538
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,550
Young lady, don't just grab and run!

539
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,400
You haven't paid yet!

540
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,750
I'm sorry.

541
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,550
-I'm sorry.
-I'll pay, I'll pay.

542
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,350
Seriously...

543
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,270
We're so sorry.

544
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,060
10 yuan.

545
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,240
Okay, okay.

546
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,370
Here.

547
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,310
That's enough.

548
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,440
Sir, you're very lucky.

549
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,810
Yunqing.

550
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,280
You're here.

551
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,070
Yes.

552
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,000
I didn't know you'd be so late,

553
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,850
so I had a bit to drink myself.

554
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,960
You know I don't usually drink.

555
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,440
I asked you to come today

556
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,200
because I wanted to apologize to you.

557
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,790
That day,

558
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,790
I was indeed too harsh with my words.

559
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,550
And then

560
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,640
I scolded you.

561
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,590
I'm sorry.

562
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,050
I've reflected on it,
and I apologize to you.

563
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,240
Just

564
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,700
think of today as us

565
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,240
going out to eat together.

566
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,110
I ordered some dishes you love.

567
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,730
We wouldn't normally splurge

568
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,930
on dishes like these.

569
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,880
And this baijiu too.

570
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,110
I just had some.

571
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,000
This baijiu is aromatic.

572
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,720
It's good.

573
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,780
It cost me half a month's salary.

574
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,510
Come on.

575
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,500
Let's have a drink together.

576
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:12,960
Come on.

577
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
I don't want to drink.

578
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,510
I want to talk to you
while we're both sober.

579
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,800
Are you sober right now?

580
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,930
Of course I'm sober.

581
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,880
Okay.

582
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,230
I want to break up with you.

583
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,920
Yunqing.

584
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,390
Look, I told the chef not to put

585
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,340
chopped green onions on this dish.

586
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,030
You know, sometimes dishes

587
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,410
taste better without green onions,

588
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,660
a different kind of flavor...

589
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,790
Looks like you're not sober enough.

590
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,720
And this meat...

591
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,790
You must love this meat. Usually you...

592
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,070
I think
you're still not clear-headed enough.

593
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,640
I didn't want to come today.

594
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,640
But I thought I should come

595
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,370
and make things clear with you.

596
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,030
During this period,
I've been thinking about us.

597
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,360
It all feels like a blur.

598
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,280
Maybe all of this between us
was just a misunderstanding.

599
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,000
I already apologized to you.

600
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,730
If it's because that day

601
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,350
I was too harsh

602
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,440
and scolded you,

603
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,300
you can scold me back.

604
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,510
If that's not enough,

605
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,680
you can even hit me.

606
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,310
It's not because you scolded me.

607
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,110
Then why?

608
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,550
Because we're not right for each other.

609
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,110
How are we not right for each other?

610
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,910
In what way are we incompatible?

611
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,510
Was I not good
when I taught you calligraphy?

612
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,840
Was I not good
when I taught you how to cook?

613
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,840
I know you don't like green onions.

614
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,730
Since then, I've never added green onions

615
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,610
to any dish I've made.

616
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,610
But you know what?

617
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,260
I actually like green onions!

618
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,910
Waiter!

619
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,090
Add some green onions to this dish

620
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,090
and cook it again.

621
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,930
You'll regret this.

622
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,830
Let's sit here.

623
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,560
Sure.

624
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,650
Waiter, a pot of tea.

625
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:45,830
Thank you.

626
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,470
Thank you.

627
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,750
Here.

628
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,350
It smells so good.

629
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,350
These past few days,

630
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,550
the newspapers have been discussing

631
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,280
your design drafts intensely.

632
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,250
Do you know that?

633
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,700
There aren't any Shanghai newspapers here.

634
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,570
This matter has become very serious now.

635
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,740
You should know about it.

636
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,120
I brought you a newspaper.

637
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,950
Take a look.

638
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,950
I'm afraid to read it.

639
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,150
What are you doing?

640
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,300
Sit down first.

641
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,720
Come on.

642
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,000
No matter how serious something is,

643
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,240
you have to face it.

644
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,790
Take a look.

645
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,110
This article.

646
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,390
Come on.

647
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,710
[Inheritance and Innovation: Promoting
Dunhuang Culture in Fashion Design]

648
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,980
What do you think about what he wrote?

649
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,050
What do you think about what he wrote?

650
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:51,860
I think

651
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,040
he wrote it very well.

652
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,590
It's well-reasoned

653
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,480
and redirects all those baseless

654
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,940
and exaggerated opinions

655
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,790
into

656
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,000
an academic discussion.

657
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,150
Don't you think?

658
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,620
You ordered him to write it this way?

659
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,380
I didn't.

660
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,550
But the matter is resolved now.

661
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,550
Put away your newspaper
and drink your tea.

662
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,240
Yes, Ma'am.

663
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,050
Wait.

664
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,470
Let's celebrate with tea instead of wine.

665
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,570
What a pity.

666
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,310
There is

667
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,790
an opera troupe performing in town
tonight.

668
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,830
They sound amazing.

669
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,360
I've watched their performance
once before.

670
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,310
It's alright.

671
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,920
If you want to hear opera,

672
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,250
Hangong sings well.

673
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,360
Hangong.

674
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,430
Sing one of your best folk songs.

675
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,890
Come on, don't be so coy.

676
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,100
Yes, Secretary Zhao,

677
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,830
I really love hearing you sing.

678
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,320

Xiurong.

689
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,030
Yi, you're back.

690
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,200
These are gifts I bought

691
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
for your children in the water town.

692
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,230
You bought one for each of my 5 children?

693
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,640
Yeah, gender equality.

694
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,680
These must be expensive. How much?

695
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,810
Let me pay you back.

696
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,390
Don't be so formal with me.

697
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,810
I heard from Minister Wen

698
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,200
that you kept speaking up for me
during the debate.

699
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,330
I'm really touched.

700
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,950
I was just telling the truth.

701
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,420
I really dislike Yang Xue'an.

702
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,630
Did the factory leaders tell you?

703
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,630
Your work made it to the first round.

704
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,510
Really?

705
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,780
That's wonderful.

706
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,240
It wouldn't have made the shortlist
without your input.

707
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,130
This is Wen Pu.

708
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,210
Do you have any news about the matter

709
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,540
I asked you to look into?

710
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,380
I asked around for you.

711
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,540
Zhao's matter isn't that simple.

712
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,990
He's been behind on payments
to that factory for ages.

713
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,390
Recently, that factory started
the state-private partnership.

714
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,120
The audit found many problems.

715
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,270
Among them, the accounts
between them and Zhao

716
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,550
are very unclear.

717
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,060
What else?

718
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,530
I don't know the specifics.

719
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,470
You should go to Zhao quickly.

720
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,400
He knows best what he's done.

721
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,990
I have a meeting soon.

722
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,750
I have to go.

723
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,550
Operator?

724
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,870
This is Wen Pu.

725
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:34,230
Minister! There's a call from the city.

726
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,570
They're requesting your presence
at an urgent on-site meeting.

727
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,100
Alright.

728
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,120
Operator? Hello?

729
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,800
The car is already waiting downstairs.

730
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,380
Okay.

731
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,410
Let's go.

732
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,400
Yi!

733
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,130
I want to talk to you about something.

734
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,190
What is it?

735
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,490
I broke up with Yang Xue'an.

736
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,550
Are you sad?

737
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,190
I'm not sad.

738
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,410
Minister Wen, you're finally back.

739
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,920
Secretary Zhao's wife is here.

740
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,490
She says she's been calling you
all afternoon

741
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,590
but couldn't get through.

742
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,850
She's waiting inside.

743
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,670
Jiang? Jiang.

744
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,340
Political Commissar, you're finally back!

745
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,200
Alright, please sit down.

746
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,680
Calm down. Take your time.

747
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,310
Sit down.

748
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,720
I was afraid this would happen!

749
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,840
See? It happened today.

750
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,100
I knew it.

751
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,480
I just knew it!

752
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,400
Slow down.

753
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,130
Come on, sit down. Calm down a bit.

754
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,380
My man owes them 10,000 yuan!

755
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,320
I never even dreamed of

756
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,440
such a large amount of money!

757
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,770
How can we ever pay that back?
10,000 yuan!

758
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,810
If we can't pay it back,

759
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,660
does that mean Hangong will have to
go to prison?

760
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,940
I've asked that regional party leader...

761
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,870
Please sit down first. Please sit.

762
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,070
How did he end up owing so much money?

763
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,140
I only know

764
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,510
that he's been...

765
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,710
keeping a pretty young mistress
in Shanghai.

766
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,410
I heard

767
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,690
she used to be some kind of socialite.

768
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,290
She really knows how to please men!

769
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,150
I don't know when,

770
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,150
but she got my husband hooked on her.

771
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,330
Women like her

772
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,230
never have enough!

773
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,800
Hangong rented her

774
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,530
a very, very expensive garden villa
in Shanghai.

775
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,480
She even did—what do you call it—

776
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,080
some speculative business.

777
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,310
Ended up losing everything!

778
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
That money all came from my husband!

779
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Sir, you know it.

780
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,570
Hangong never had that kind of money!

781
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,160
He took on those projects

782
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,680
all for that pretty young woman!

783
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,430
What should we do?

784
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,600
Well,

785
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,500
all that money's what Hangong

786
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,770
stole from the state.

787
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,410
A total of 10,000 yuan.

788
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,550
Where am I supposed to find that money?

789
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,900
Our family has no money!

790
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,080
All our relatives are even poorer
than we are!

791
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,400
What are we going to do?

792
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,420
Alright.

793
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,430
Jiang, here's what we'll do.

794
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,600
You should go home first.

795
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,070
I'll figure something out.

796
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,130
Let me look into the situation first,

797
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,660
and I'll let you know
as soon as I have any news.

798
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,280
Don't worry too much. Go home first.

799
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,550
Your children need you at home.

800
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,350
Go home first.

801
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,230
Minister Wen,

802
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,930
Hangong is

803
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,920
the only son for three generations.

804
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,800
Please,

805
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
take this matter seriously.

806
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,830
Don't worry. I'll think of a way.

807
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:20,780
Jiang!

808
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,800
Please get up! Get up!

809
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,400
On behalf of our whole family...

810
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,150
Please get up!

811
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,550
My husband...

812
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,630
Get up, get up.

813
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,110
Get up!

814
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,150
When there are problems,
we find solutions.

815
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,840
Go home now.

816
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,190
We'll repay your kindness.

817
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:32,970
Alright, alright.

818
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:33,360
Thank you.

819
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,110
Go back first. Go back.

820
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,530
Operator, please connect me
to Minister Wen's home.

821
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,080
Sorry,

822
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,150
Minister Wen's line is busy.

823
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,360
Thank you.

824
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,270
That's the whole situation.

825
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,440
In short, it's a serious matter.

826
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,070
Anyway,

827
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,550
we need to
cover this deficit first, right?

828
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,880
He owes that much money.

829
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,920
Please help figure something out.

830
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,360
I've been calling everyone else

831
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,110
in the division I can reach.

832
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,160
I have to go now.

833
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,650
I'll wait for your news.

834
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,960
I have a long-distance call
from G-Guangzhou coming in.

835
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,120
It might be Ziliang.

836
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,060
Okay, okay.

837
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,440
Hello?

838
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,470
Ziliang.

839
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,760
I'm sorry

840
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,000
for calling so late.

841
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
Here's the thing.

842
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,510
Um...

843
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,810
Zhao Hangong is in trouble.

844
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,430
He owes a lot of money.

845
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,590
Public funds, of course.

846
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,320
So we need to...

847
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,860
we need to cover this deficit first.

848
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,180
I've already contacted Huang Kuisheng.

849
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,630
Do you have Jiaxing's contact information?

850
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,690
Give me the number.

851
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,550
Alright, I've noted it down.

852
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,410
How much money can you help raise?

853
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,030
It's really urgent.

854
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,880
Great. Great.

855
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,710
I'll wait for your news then.

856
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,070
Okay, okay.

857
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,710
I'll call Jiaxing now.

858
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,320
Where is he?

859
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,360
Tianjin.

860
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,560
Alright, I'll call this number.

861
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,160
Okay, I'll wait for your news.

862
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,560
It's extremely urgent.

863
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,190
Well?

864
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,560
I've borrowed money from
all the old comrades-in-arms

865
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,800
from our old division.

866
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,260
Altogether, I've gathered over 5,000 yuan.

867
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,600
I've had them wire it all to Jiang,

868
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,360
who is keeping it for now.

869
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,260
I'm asking how you are doing.

870
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,280
Zhao really acted foolishly.

871
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,190
As a leading cadre,

872
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,320
he's received
so many years of Party education,

873
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,780
yet he made such a mistake!

874
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,850
He must take responsibility
for his actions!

875
00:41:59,230 --> 00:41:59,800
Ms. Fang,

876
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,590
you and the Chief

877
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,130
have watched us grow and develop.

878
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,460
You both know Hangong well, right?

879
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,070
At heart, he's different from

880
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,800
Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan,

881
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,800
right?

882
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,400
I know that.

883
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,590
He's just lustful.

884
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,140
He can't resist beautiful women.

885
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,280
And now his whole life is ruined
because of it.

886
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,280
So I was wondering

887
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,900
if you could tell the Chief

888
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,230
to give him a chance to redeem himself.

889
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:28,830
Let him...

890
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,090
What I mean is...

891
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,380
I should borrow more money for him

892
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,560
and collect more funds.

893
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,190
Don't do this to yourself.

894
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,370
He made the mistakes.
Don't punish yourself over it.

895
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,290
Does Yi Yi know about it?

896
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,710
She doesn't know.

897
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,240
That's right.

898
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,450
This is a Party matter,
and she's an outsider.

899
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,800
I just want to tell you

900
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,590
not to bring these emotions home.

901
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,190
Yi Yi is not Rumei.

902
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,030
Someone like Yi Yi,
a petty-bourgeois intellectual,

903
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,590
is fragile and sensitive.

904
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,580
She won't understand you.

905
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,520
Then how about this, Minister Wen?

906
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,710
I'll go back

907
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,630
and ask Yan.

908
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,730
See if he can also borrow some money

909
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,840
f-from his comrades-in-arms

910
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,040
to help Zhao Hangong.

911
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,470
That would be wonderful.

912
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,530
Thank you, Ms. Fang.

913
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,130
And thank the Chief for me.

914
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:37,550
Don't mention it.
