[Episode 12]

3
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,440
Minister Wen, please.

4
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,280
Thanks.

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,060
She's listening to that music again.

6
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,400
You know her husband well?

7
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,640
We were just high school classmates.

8
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,539
You could say that.

9
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
He's the only one in the ROC government

10
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,920
that I could call a friend.

11
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,310
Minister Wen，

12
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,590
he's a good man.

13
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,520
Is that so?

14
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,750
I just came from her place.

15
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,009
She said her husband

16
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,190
liked Soviet literature.

17
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,190
I was wondering

18
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,380
among ROC government officials,

19
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,210
are there many who like Soviet literature?

20
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,400
Very few.

21
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,750
Let me tell you something.

22
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,400
Don't take this the wrong way,

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,200
Minister Wen.

24
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,400
When I first met you,

25
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,320
I often felt confused.

26
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,030
You two don't look alike,

27
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,810
but I always felt that

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,470
the two of you

29
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,270
had something in common.

30
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,910
I don't know why.

31
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,150
Why's that?

32
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,430
It's the way you act,

33
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,579
and your character, things like that.

34
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,520
I can't explain it clearly.

35
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,910
Let me share a little story with you.

36
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,750
They say the Communists value frugality,

37
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,760
while the KMT is all corrupt, right?

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,120
But once,

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,560
Zhaoyuan and I went for Japanese cuisine.

40
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,120
When he entered the room

41
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,000
and took off his shoes,

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,150
I saw this huge patch on his sock.

43
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,120
I laughed so hard at him.

44
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,110
Later I said,

45
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,910
I'll just give you a stack of socks.

46
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,710
And he told me,

47
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,030
Zihe, don't mention this to anyone.

48
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,840
It's so embarrassing.

49
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,590
I wouldn't gossip about it.

50
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,910
Anyway, what I'm trying to say

51
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,710
is that

52
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,910
he doesn't really seem like an official.

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,970
He's just very genuine.

54
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,740
That's why I'm willing to be close to him.

55
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,250
An ROC government official

56
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,770
wears a patched sock.

57
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,920
By the way,

58
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,150
during that meeting,

59
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,560
about Comrade Yang Xue'an's attitude,

60
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,890
was everyone's reaction quite intense?

61
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,329
Well...

62
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,470
Mr. Fu,

63
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,730
I hope

64
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,810
you can use your own approach

65
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,110
from your perspective

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,740
to explain it to everyone.

67
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,000
Can you do that?

68
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,900
Don't worry, Minister Wen.

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,310
Good.

70
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,400

Fresh vegetables.

72
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,010
Zhaoyuan,

73
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,070
I've moved out of the old house

74
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,260
into a garret

75
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,990
like where you lived as a child.

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,610
Tell me,

77
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,710
can I wait for you to return here?

78
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,480
Miss Yi.

79
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,950
Comrade Su.

80
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,710
Can you get used to living here?

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,770
Didn't Mr. Fu arrange accommodation for you?

82
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,200
He did,

83
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,630
but I didn't go there.

84
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,830
Comrade Su,

85
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,159
how did you know I live here?

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,270
Our neighborhood committee

87
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,510
notified Comrade Su.

88
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,390
There's a newcomer in our neighborhood.

89
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,790
We always need to investigate thoroughly.

90
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,830
The Zhang family's Nanny is your neighbor.

91
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,430
Miss Yi used to work with us.

92
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,680
She's currently awaiting rearrangement,

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,410
and temporarily staying here.

94
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,720
Miss Yi,

95
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,160
during your stay in Shanghai,

96
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,290
you can ask her for help with anything.

97
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,630
Although you don't work with us any more,

98
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,290
as long as you're in Shanghai,

99
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,310
we will take responsibility for you.

100
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,110
I understand.

101
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,410
If there's nothing else,

102
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,740
I'll head upstairs now.

103
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,890
Don't leave yet.

104
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,600
I have more words to say.

105
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,800
Comrade Su,

106
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,030
you can rest assured.

107
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,240
The residents in our neighborhood

108
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
have a very high level of vigilance.

109
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,480
Just last year,

110
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,390
we even caught a Kuomintang spy.

111
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,310
We even received an award for it.

112
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,430
Miss Yi,

113
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,270
while you're living here,

114
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,530
we will look after you.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,750
Your husband was in the Kuomintang, right?

116
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,190
I heard he went to Taiwan.

117
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,570
Why didn't you go with him?

118
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,190
What are you doing here?

119
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,390
He went to Taiwan?

120
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,610
I didn't even know he went to Taiwan.

121
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,740
How do you know that?

122
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,170
Su, look at this.

123
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,600
She hasn't even properly moved in yet,

124
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,120
and she's already so hot-tempered.

125
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,370
How am I supposed to

126
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,300
look after you as your supervisor?

127
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,190
I remember you told me, Su,

128
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,480
about someone called Mr. Fu.

129
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,780
It's said he's a boss.

130
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,160
He must be wealthy.

131
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,330
Why aren't you living with him?

132
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,600
With your looks,

133
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,430
let me tell you,

134
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,690
those big bosses would surely fancy you.

135
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,790
Zhang's Nanny,

136
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,090
we shouldn't gossip about such matters.

137
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,890
I'll go upstairs first.

138
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,390
Miss Yi,

139
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,650
you should leave Shanghai.

140
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,760
I'm not leaving.

141
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Who is it?

142
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,920
Are you Mrs. Zhou?

143
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,600
Mr. Fu recommended us to come here.

144
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,480
Please come in.

145
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Mr. Fu said

146
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,260
that your clothes are very fashionable

147
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
and insisted we come and take a look.

148
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,370
These are all samples.

149
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,470
Feel free to look around.

150
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,680
And these too.

151
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,210
This one looks nice.

152
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,170
Yes, it would look especially good on you.

153
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,810
It suits you perfectly.

154
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,480
Mrs. Zhou,

155
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,480
did you make all these yourself?

156
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,159
Yes, I did.

157
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,040
They look fantastic.

158
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,920
And the fabric is excellent too.

159
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,070
I have some

160
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,800
fashion magazines from Paris and New York.

161
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,860
You can take a look.

162
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,510
If you like any of the styles,

163
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,770
I can make them for you.

164
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,870
My sister-in-law

165
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,800
bought this exact one in Paris.

166
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,190
Mrs. Zhou, can you really make it?

167
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,370
Of course I can.

168
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,950
Mrs. Zhou,

169
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,380
are you sure?

170
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,250
How about this?

171
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,070
Leave your fabric here,

172
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,870
and when I finish,

173
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,360
you can take it if you're satisfied.

174
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
If you're not satisfied,

175
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,890
I'll pay you for the fabric.

176
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,560
If you're happy with everything,

177
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,290
please give the money to Mr. Fu.

178
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,040
He's always helping me out,

179
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,600
and I'd like to thank him.

180
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,940
You want this, right?

181
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,419
The Zhang family's Nanny.

182
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,000
Miss Yi, you're home.

183
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,120
You have visitors.

184
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,770
Two of my classmates are here.

185
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,270
I've already spoken to Uncle Shui.

186
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,080
Hello.

187
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,520
What do you use this sewing machine for?

188
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,720
I do some sewing and mending sometimes.

189
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,790
I must say the clothes are so well made.

190
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,580
The design, the choice of fabric,

191
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,600
the style.

192
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,480
Just imagine our daughter

193
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,080
wearing clothes made by you.

194
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,740
How beautiful she would look!

195
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,480
If she wore a little princess dress,

196
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,240
just thinking about it

197
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,360
makes me so happy.

198
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
What do you think?

199
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,510
Just imagine

200
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,360
that innocent little girl

201
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,910
wearing such a beautiful dress.

202
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,840
How lovely that would be!

203
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,960
When I have time,

204
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,830
I'll make one for you.

205
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,510
Thank you so much.

206
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,750
But let me make it clear.

207
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,630
Making clothes is one thing,

208
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,950
but that's separate from

209
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,590
our responsibility for you.

210
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,180
We must look after you every day you're here.

211
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,150
When I finish,

212
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,280
I'll bring it to you.

213
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,600
Great, thank you.

214
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,440
Okay, I'll let you get back to your thing.

215
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,480
I'll be going now.

216
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,670
It's so dark in here.

217
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,600
And my eyesight isn't good either.

218
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,390
Keep looking.

219
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,370
I think this one looks quite nice.

220
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,610
It has a great appearance.

221
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,960
I can make this too.

222
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,630
Really?

223
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,530
Is that true?

224
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,240
Great!

225
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,840
Then I'll take this one.

226
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,550
Okay.

227
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,030
Yang.

228
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:15,870
Director.

229
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,660
You should be off work now.

230
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,870
Director,

231
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,550
I'll just

232
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,120
finish this bit of work before going home.

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,670
Be careful

234
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,670
not to wear yourself out.

235
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,270
Yes.

236
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,480
Now

237
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,670
the public-private partnership and

238
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,240
capitalist transformation just started.

239
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,200
Everything is difficult at the start.

240
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,910
I promise

241
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,940
with the cases assigned to me,

242
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,670
I definitely won't make any mistakes.

243
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,480
Good.

244
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
How is your mother doing?

245
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,910
If necessary,

246
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,590
I've spoken with Minister Wen,

247
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,320
and he offered

248
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,030
to buy you a train ticket

249
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,230
and approve leave for you to go home.

250
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,840
Thank you and minister.

251
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,390
I'd

252
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,070
better not waste more time.

253
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,800
I've decided

254
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,230
to finish all this work

255
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,080
and then go home right away.

256
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,760
Good. Go home early then.

257
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,230
- Don’t worry. - I’m leaving.

258
00:10:59,230 --> 00:10:59,830
Take care.

259
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,200
Okay.

260
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,200
Who is it?

261
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,480
Ms. Yi Yi,

262
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,750
Minister Wen is here on behalf of

263
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,480
the organization to visit you.

264
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,290
Coming!

265
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,210
Careful, mind your head.

266
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,260
Okay.

267
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,150
Can you stop drinking this nonsense?

268
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,570
How can this fill your stomach?

269
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,520
I drink it too.

270
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,510
Minister,

271
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,850
you're different.

272
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,230
You drink it to stay alert

273
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,490
when working at night.

274
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,000
Zhou, there's a fruit vendor

275
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,630
at the alley entrance.

276
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,080
Go buy some apples.

277
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,070
Okay.

278
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,630
This is from the leader for you.

279
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,260
It's a compilation of national documents

280
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,320
on bourgeois reformation policies.

281
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,080
Please study it carefully.

282
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,670
Take it.

283
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,630
Minister, I'm going now.

284
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,450
Go ahead.

285
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,840
I'm fine.

286
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,480
I own no house,

287
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,310
no land,

288
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,830
no treasures,

289
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,530
yet I'm still labeled bourgeois.

290
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,300
We let you read these documents

291
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,500
so you can understand

292
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,080
the Party and government policies.

293
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,890
No one is trying to label you.

294
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,200
You're being too sensitive.

295
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,260
I'm not sensitive.

296
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,790
I'm used to it.

297
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,750
My room is a bit small.

298
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,580
Please, have a seat here.

299
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,500
No need.

300
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,200
I'll stand for a moment.

301
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,150
Would you like to try some coffee?

302
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,780
Sure.

303
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,940
Good, thank you.

304
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,840
It's good.

305
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,840
Now that you leave here,

306
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,440
do you still listen to music?

307
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,150
Of course not.

308
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,120
These walls are thin.

309
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,550
If I cough,

310
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,210
the whole hallway can hear it.

311
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,800
I quite enjoy listening to Pingtan now.

312
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,150
I wonder if you like it too?

313
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,150
I do like it,

314
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,360
very much.

315
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,810
But

316
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,890
I'm from the north,

317
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,750
so I don't understand it well.

318
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,010
I'll learn gradually.

319
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,810
It gets very hot here in summer.

320
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,000
Why

321
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,390
did you choose to live here?

322
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,510
I had no choice.

323
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,200
My savings

324
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,390
only allow me to live here.

325
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,640
Actually, compared to garden villas,

326
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,480
I find these garret rooms more grounding.

327
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,240
It's like

328
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,620
I've already hit rock bottom,

329
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,680
so I can't fall any further.

330
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,010
Don't be so pessimistic.

331
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,550
The organization

332
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,330
is working to solve your employment issue.

333
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,270
I'm not pessimistic.

334
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,070
I truly think these rooms are quite nice.

335
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,320
Great writers,

336
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,630
great artists,

337
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,250
and many revolutionaries have lived here.

338
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,360
An elder once told me,

339
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,400
those who have lived in these rooms

340
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,130
and managed to move beyond them

341
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,080
are the true Shanghainese.

342
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,940
You seem to

343
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,660
care a lot about being Shanghainese.

344
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,550
No,

345
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
what I care about is one's identity.

346
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,820
Actually, I'm a bit vain too.

347
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,960
The great writer Lu Xun

348
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,920
wrote about garret rooms.

349
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,640
That's right.

350
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,380
The Qiejieting Essays.

351
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,790
I believe your current situation

352
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,960
is only temporary.

353
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
The organization

354
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,480
will definitely find

355
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,740
suitable work for you.

356
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,030
We won't waste talent.

357
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,920
You need to trust us.

358
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,940
I trust you, Minister Wen.

359
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,790
What I say

360
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,280
doesn't represent just myself.

361
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,210
I represent the organization.

362
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,000
But the organization is abstract.

363
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,640
Common people like us

364
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,310
only see individuals.

365
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,650
Minister,

366
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,780
the apples are here.

367
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,880
Good.

368
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,160
Zhou,

369
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,829
please have a good talk with Ms. Yi,

370
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,859
especially the policies

371
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,660
about educated intellectuals.

372
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,030
I have a meeting.

373
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,960
I need to go now.

374
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,120
Minister Wen,

375
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,230
let me walk you out.

376
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,560
Please be careful.

377
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,790
♪ The moon sinks low ♪

378
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,750
♪ The crows cry in the frosty sky ♪

379
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,850
Beyond Suzhou’s walls,

380
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,710
stands the Cold Mountain shrine.

381
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,090
At midnight, temple bells drift softly

382
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,280
to my boat in time.

383
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,540
It seems you were being modest earlier.

384
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,200
You do understand, don't you?

385
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,950
I can handle simple ones,

386
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,430
but nothing too complex.

387
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,660
Ms. Yi,

388
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,420
living here is different

389
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,550
from your previous environment.

390
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,870
You must keep good relations

391
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,070
with your neighbors.

392
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,160
Have you met the neighborhood committee?

393
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,210
Are they treating you well?

394
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,210
Yes, I have.

395
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,440
They've all been very nice to me.

396
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,240
Don't worry.

397
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,920
That's good.

398
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,490
I need to go to a meeting now.

399
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,830
You stay.

400
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,720
Goodbye.

401
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,400
Goodbye.

402
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,810
What are you doing?

403
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,370
I didn't mean to.

404
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,400
I thought it was a novel.

405
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,470
You read my diary without permission.

406
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,130
Yes.

407
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,030
I did read it.

408
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,050
I meant to.

409
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,010
I never thought your thinking

410
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,940
would be so negative and backward.

411
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,710
My diary is written for myself,

412
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,140
not for others to read.

413
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,580
But these are your thoughts!

414
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,260
Reactionary thoughts are also reactionary.

415
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,310
Say something.

416
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,950
What do you want me to say?

417
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,330
Let me tell you.

418
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,750
I won't report you.

419
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,080
But you need to confess.

420
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,570
You must turn yourself in.

421
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:09,750
Go.

422
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,200
You go.

423
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,920
I knew it.

424
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,890
Someone like you

425
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,880
will never make any progress.

426
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,770
[Shanghai People's Government]

427
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,030
Come in.

428
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,550
Minister,

429
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,480
Director,

430
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,960
you wanted to see me?

431
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,440
Comrade Yang,

432
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,920
this train leaves in three hours.

433
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,940
Pack your things quickly

434
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,840
and go home.

435
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,160
Your work

436
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,240
has already been assigned to others.

437
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,960
Minister,

438
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,030
there is lots of work lately.

439
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,030
I'll leave after I finish.

440
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,090
Work is important,

441
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,550
but your mother needs you more right now.

442
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,290
Go back.

443
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,000
I've already spoken with Director Fang.

444
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,200
I want to finish my work before leaving.

445
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,330
Once somethings happen, it's too late

446
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,260
to make up for it in a lifetime.

447
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,440
Go home.

448
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,270
Yang,

449
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,200
Minister Wen is right about this.

450
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,840
You should go home first.

451
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,030
Yang is really

452
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,430
a selfless and promising talent.

453
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,240
Wenpu,

454
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
why do I feel

455
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,940
he's just like you when you were young?

456
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,380
Like me when I was young?

457
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,780
I've forgotten what I was like when I was young.

458
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,580
Just like him.

459
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,640
Ms. Yi,

460
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,090
what's the matter?

461
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,200
Director Wen,

462
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,370
Director Fang,

463
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,480
this is my personal diary.

464
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,410
It's about daily life

465
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,770
and personal thoughts.

466
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,320
Comrade Zhou Yunqing found my diary.

467
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,830
She thinks I have reactionary thoughts.

468
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,490
She wants me to turn myself in.

469
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,070
So here is my diary

470
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,350
and I ask you to review it.

471
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,920
Ms. Yi,

472
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,140
we will definitely read your diary.

473
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,180
You can go back first.

474
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,010
We'll give you an answer later.

475
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,160
No.

476
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,410
I'm afraid once I leave this room,

477
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,050
I'll become someone everyone condemns.

478
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,160
I'm scared.

479
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,810
I want both leaders to read it now

480
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,240
and give me an answer right away.

481
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,350
Ms. Yi.

482
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,030
All right.

483
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,880
Please sit here and rest.

484
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,530
We'll give you an answer after we finish.

485
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,420
Please sit down.

486
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,480
Zhou, Zhou.

487
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,750
Mr. Yang.

488
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,550
What's wrong?

489
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,190
I just peeked at Yi Yi's diary.

490
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,480
Diary?

491
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,880
Tell me more.

492
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,740
What did it say?

493
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,180
Comrade Zhou,

494
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,800
let me ask you.

495
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
What kind of work

496
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,550
are we doing now?

497
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,090
Bourgeois reformation.

498
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,880
As for Yi Yi,

499
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,160
as a typical petty bourgeois intellectual,

500
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,010
her issues are not trivial.

501
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,710
You must report truthfully.

502
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,890
I'm going back to the office.

503
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,090
We can talk on the way.

504
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,690
Let's go.

505
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,680
Let's go.

506
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,720
We must report Yi Yi's issue

507
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,030
to Director Fang right away.

508
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,110
Mr. Yang, it's not that serious.

509
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,920
I'll go with you.

510
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,510
Well.

511
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,480
Minister, Director.

512
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,190
Minister.

513
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,590
Director.

514
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,070
Zhou,

515
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,870
Yi Yi has brought the diary.

516
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,520
See if this is the one.

517
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,330
She brought it here?

518
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,350
Yes.

519
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,810
Everything's here.

520
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,540
Are you sure?

521
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,590
Yes, I'm sure.

522
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,640
She must have thought you read her diary

523
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,680
and would report to the organization,

524
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,410
so she confessed immediately.

525
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,930
This person is quite calculating.

526
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,260
If she were that calculating,

527
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,480
she could have simply not shown the diary.

528
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,270
After all, Zhou has no proof,

529
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,000
right?

530
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,480
Yang,

531
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,240
weren't you supposed to go home today?

532
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,400
Your train leaves in two hours.

533
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,440
You should go.

534
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,640
You don't need to worry about it anymore.

535
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,240
Minister,

536
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,070
this is my job

537
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,110
and not finishing it would be negligence.

538
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,000
I'll leave after I finish.

539
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,700
Very good.

540
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,590
You stay then.

541
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,790
Fu Zihe

542
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,920
and Yi Yi's case

543
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,720
is under Yang's responsibility.

544
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,250
Let's discuss it together.

545
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,070
Minister Wen, I remember you have

546
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,590
a meeting with visitors from Beijing

547
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,230
this afternoon, right?

548
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,580
You should go ahead with that.

549
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,240
I'll take care of things here.

550
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,100
Take the diary.

551
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,880
Ms. Yi,

552
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,280
please sit here.

553
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,680
I have

554
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,440
a few questions for you.

555
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,110
Don't be nervous,

556
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,440
but you must tell the truth.

557
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Tell the truth.

558
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,440
Yes.

559
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,200
I heard

560
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,740
your husband was retreating to Taiwan,

561
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,120
but you insisted on staying in Shanghai.

562
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,790
Why?

563
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,030
I'm not sure.

564
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,880
I don't know.

565
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,440
Let me ask you.

566
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,630
Your diary says

567
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,400
living

568
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,510
like an ant

569
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
without dignity,

570
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,750
No dignity.

571
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,530
What does this mean?

572
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,160
Is this how you feel about New China?

573
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,270
I have no complaints about

574
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,270
New China or the Communist Party.

575
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,730
But I do have issues with certain leaders.

576
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,240
I'm frustrated

577
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,880
about my situation.

578
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,670
Issues with the leaders?

579
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,310
What issues can you have with leaders?

580
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,640
You used the word ant

581
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,110
to describe your current situation.

582
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,030
Is this just ordinary frustration?

583
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,880
Ms. Yi Yi,

584
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,590
I hope you'll tell the truth

585
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,190
and cooperate with our work.

586
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,400
I don't know what you want me to say.

587
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,600
Please stand up to answer my questions.

588
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,370
Director Fang,

589
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,830
this person is being very uncooperative.

590
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,640
Alright.

591
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,810
You can go home for now.

592
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,570
Leave the diary here.

593
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,070
We will investigate

594
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,010
everything thoroughly.

595
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,960
Minister Wen.

596
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,550
Minister Wen.

597
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,270
Hello.

598
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,480
What are you doing here?

599
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,760
How did the discussion go?

600
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,640
No, Minister Wen,

601
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,800
we've clarified Yi Yi's situation.

602
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,980
She went home first.

603
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,880
What?

604
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,240
Minister,

605
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,590
I'd like to report something to you.

606
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,160
Sure, go ahead.

607
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,750
Yi Yi's stepfather doesn't earn much.

608
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,520
Her mother is in poor health.

609
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,260
She has two younger brothers at home.

610
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
They haven't even finished school.

611
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
If she's sent home as a reactionary,

612
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,140
what will happen for the rest of her life?

613
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,270
You

614
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,030
still care about her,

615
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,880
don't you?

616
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,570
Zhou,

617
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,680
all humans have family bonds,

618
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,720
friendship and love too.

619
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,790
It's normal.

620
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,460
You care about her.

621
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,410
It shows you're kind-hearted.

622
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,440
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

623
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,270
Thank you, Minister.

624
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,430
Do you have a good relationship

625
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,490
with your brother?

626
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,390
No.

627
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,260
Zhou,

628
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,740
we know your situation very well.

629
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,310
Our department is quite important.

630
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,680
The fact that you were allowed to join

631
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,770
shows that we trust you, right?

632
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,200
I thank the organization.

633
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,190
Minister,

634
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,880
before liberation,

635
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,270
actually, we had a good relationship.

636
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,830
He wasn't like an official at all,

637
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,110
more like a soldier,

638
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,350
and an intellectual.

639
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,050
He's more than ten years older than me.

640
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,710
My brother has always been

641
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,540
very caring toward me.

642
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,210
Among the people your brother dealt with,

643
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,350
was there anyone you still remember well?

644
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,880
Minister,

645
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,720
he didn't really have any friends.

646
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,400
Nobody ever came to our home.

647
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,180
Actually,

648
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,950
there was someone...

649
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,940
Yi Yi was in Hong Kong at that time.

650
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,510
He asked me to send a book to someone.

651
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,990
The person's surname was Jian.

652
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,160
I remember because it's a rare surname.

653
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,070
My brother told me

654
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,200
that this book delivery

655
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,480
must not be mentioned to anyone,

656
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,930
not even to Yi Yi.

657
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,290
So I didn't tell anyone.

658
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,770
Jian?

659
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,830
Spelled as J-I-A-N?

660
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:03,990
Yes.

661
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,630
How old was this person?

662
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,960
What did they look like?

663
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,350
Minister,

664
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,340
I really don't know anything else.

665
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,760
Have I done something wrong?

666
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,110
No.

667
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,420
That's all.

668
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,290
Come in.

669
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,680
Yi, are you okay?

670
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,930
Why are you here?

671
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,560
Come on, get in my car. Hurry.

672
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,930
You'd better keep your distance from me.

673
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,730
I don't want to drag you into this.

674
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,820
Don't say that.

675
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,310
We're friends, aren't we?

676
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,040
Besides, I've asked Minister Wen about it.

677
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,750
Your situation

678
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,140
is nothing serious at all.

679
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,250
Just subordinates making a fuss.

680
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,480
Miss Yi.

681
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,480
Um, Miss Yi.

682
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,920
Let's talk later.

683
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,420
Comrade Su, goodbye.

684
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,440
Miss Yi,

685
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,550
Mr. Yang called

686
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,210
and asked me to pick you up.

687
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,440
Also,

688
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,610
although you no longer work here,

689
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,190
your personnel file is still with us.

690
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,520
You should attend political activities.

691
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,540
What do you mean?

692
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,710
This afternoon,

693
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,440
the Party branch is having an activity.

694
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,570
You should come too.

695
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,520
Let the worker sisters help you.

696
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,320
Help me?

697
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,980
Help with what?

698
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
How can they help?

699
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,480
Mr. Yang says

700
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,600
you still have many negative emotions.

701
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,960
You should express them,

702
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,890
so everyone can give you guidance.

703
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,280
Of course,

704
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,590
if you have any difficulties in life,

705
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,390
they'll help you solve them too.

706
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,640
Let's go,

707
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,800
right now.

708
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,700
What's wrong with you?

709
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,180
We're leaving, ma'am.

710
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,430
Are you feeling very uncomfortable?

711
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,690
It's nothing serious.

712
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,600
How did you suddenly get sick?

713
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,430
Just my chronic stomach problem acting up.

714
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,090
Comrade Su, you can go now.

715
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,080
You live alone and now you're sick.

716
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,110
You need someone to take care of you.

717
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,400
Oh, right.

718
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,970
Your mom and brother are in another city.

719
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,230
Why don't you go home to recover?

720
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,480
I won't leave Shanghai.

721
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,030
I'm not forcing you to leave.

722
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,110
I mean well.

723
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
I just thought your family

724
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,340
could take care of you for a while.

725
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,720
I'm really fine, Comrade Su.

726
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,310
Please go.

727
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,790
Fine, I'll leave then.

728
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,120
The water's boiling. Have some hot water.

729
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,590
Listen, with your stomach pain,

730
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,580
don't just keep sitting there.

731
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,380
Go lie down on the bed for a while.

732
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,720
Zhou,

733
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,330
sit down.

734
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,130
Tell us your feeligs after reading this.

735
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,890
Minister.

736
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,070
I won't say anything more.

737
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,270
I've already said enough at the door.

738
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,240
Sit down first.

739
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,200
I want you to talk about

740
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,740
how you felt after reading the diary.

741
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,110
You can speak.

742
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,040
Actually, from my personal perspective,

743
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,710
I can understand Yi Yi.

744
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,670
She's a petty bourgeois intellectual.

745
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,070
Her thinking is rather fragile.

746
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,280
Sometimes

747
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,670
she has negative emotions.

748
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,800
It's quite normal for her to complain.

749
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,400
Comrade Zhou Yunqing,

750
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,330
you're too naive in your thinking.

751
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,960
This is a serious matter of class stance.

752
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,080
Don't be so vague.

753
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,690
I already said I won't talk about it.

754
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,550
Why are you crying?

755
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,670
I'm not.

756
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,150
No, I immediately

757
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,880
reported to you about Yi Yi's diary

758
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,480
as soon as I found out.

759
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,960
This is work, not a game.

760
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,830
Sit down.

761
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,590
Minister,

762
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,190
Director,

763
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,510
regarding

764
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,110
Yi Yi's case,

765
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,110
I have my own opinion.

766
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:53,790
I'd like to

767
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,880
say a few words.

768
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,030
The new China has just been established.

769
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,400
All kinds of criminals

770
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,220
are appearing in various forms.

771
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,440
I believe

772
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:07,920
Yi Yi's diary...

773
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,510
Yang,

774
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,250
a diary, by definition,

775
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,220
is for recording personal events

776
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,070
and expressing private emotions.

777
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,860
It's not meant to be read by others

778
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,660
and has no propaganda effect.

779
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,380
I believe in your own diary,

780
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,430
you also record negative emotions.

781
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,510
Should we also take that out

782
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,910
for everyone to discuss?

783
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,610
I've read Yi Yi's diary.

784
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,630
It's not that bad.

785
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,630
Minister Wen is right.

786
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,840
Very reasonable.

787
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,230
We shouldn't casually label people with

788
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,030
political issues

789
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,490
or counter-revolutionary charges, right?

790
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
I think

791
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,460
Yi Yi should just write a self-criticism for this matter,

792
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,570
and it won't go into her permanent record.

793
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,100
That's settled then, okay?

794
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,010
If you have things to do, go ahead.

795
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,670
Look.

796
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,630
Those files of yours aren't processed yet.

797
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,690
You go ahead first.

798
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,710
What's wrong with you?

799
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,790
I've told you so many times.

800
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,280
When you talk and work,

801
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,760
can't you use your brain?

802
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,230
Why can't you remember?

803
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,730
You're too childish

804
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,550
and too inexperienced.

805
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,720
Um...

806
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,080
The new tea has arrived.

807
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,210
Commissioner Yan got some for you.

808
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,510
It's in my office.

809
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,440
Don't forget to take it after work.

810
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,890
Did you hear me?

811
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,030
Zhaoyuan,

812
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,800
you know what?

813
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,020
Looking from this window,

814
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,880
I can see our old home.

815
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,490
All these years since you left,

816
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,760
I often wonder,

817
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,620
if I had stopped you then,

818
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,510
would I have avoided all this criticism?

819
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,070
Could we have lived

820
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,670
an ordinary life?

821
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,220
I deliver documents to Minister Wen.

822
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,490
Who are you?

823
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,800
I'm Minister Wen's superior.

824
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,730
Greetings, sir.

825
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,800
Just put the documents on the desk.

826
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,320
Okay.

827
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,030
Liu.

828
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,520
Minister Wen,

829
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,300
I gave the documents to your superior.

830
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,050
My superior?

831
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,230
This gentleman here.

832
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:23,670
Alright.

833
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,360
Okay, I understand.

834
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,810
You may go now.

835
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,250
Okay.

836
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,150
What?

837
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,550
I can't be your superior?

838
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,830
Idiot.

839
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Smartass.

840
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,850
Get up. Don't sit in my chair.

841
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,540
Go sit on that sofa over there.

842
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,060
The minister's office is magnificent.

843
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,960
Sit down.

844
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,820
Why didn't you tell me before you came?

845
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,560
Why show up out of nowhere like this?

846
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,360
With you, I need to act suddenly.

847
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,680
Otherwise you'd have time to prepare.

848
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,570
What's the matter?

849
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,030
What terrible tea is this?

850
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,110
It tastes awful.

851
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,340
Next time I'll bring you some good tea.

852
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,550
Be grateful to have any tea at all.

853
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,630
Don't be so picky.

854
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,100
It tastes just fine to me.

855
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,440
You're here on a business trip?

856
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
Yes, on business.

857
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,790
And I have something important

858
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,480
to report to Minister Wen.

859
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,820
What important matter?

860
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,350
You'll have to treat me to dinner first.

861
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,320
We can discuss it over the meal.

862
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,960
Don't let me guess.

863
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,760
I have to buy you dinner too?

864
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,470
Of course.

865
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,920
Aren't I your

866
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,350
guest?

867
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,150
Hurry up.

868
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,070
Hurry what? I'm still on duty.

869
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,100
Wait for me at the restaurant downstairs.

870
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,250
After I finish my work,

871
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,590
I'll come right over when I'm off.

872
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,650
I'll treat you to dinner.

873
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,360
My treat.

874
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,440
Fine.

875
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,440
Great news!

876
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,920
Good.

877
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,680
Chief,

878
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,390
what kind of person is our Minister Wen?

879
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,530
I need to know a bit about him in advance.

880
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,530
Don't worry.

881
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,400
Minister Wen is charming and elegant,

882
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,670
handsome and talented.

883
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,510
He's cultured when needed

884
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,880
and strong when required.

885
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,740
You'll definitely be satisfied.

886
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,600
Good.

887
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,680
Minister Wen is here.

888
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:20,640
Zhao.

889
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,030
Wen.

890
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,930
You have a guest.

891
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,190
Let me introduce.

892
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,870
Miss Huang Lingling.

893
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,590
We can't call her Miss,

894
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,920
Comrade Huang Lingling.

895
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,120
This is Minister Wen.

896
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,710
Hello, Chief. Pleased to meet you.

897
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,170
Hello. Please have a seat.

898
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,480
Sit down.

899
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,190
Good.

900
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,190
Good.

901
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,150
Look,

902
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,560
we've ordered all your favorites.

903
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,630
You two are such important leaders.

904
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,880
Why choose such a small restaurant?

905
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,720
If the hygiene isn't up to standard,

906
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,120
and you get sick,

907
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,520
that would be terrible!

908
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,540
Comrade Huang,

909
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,060
where do you usually eat?

910
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,920
Over on Nanjing West Road, there are

911
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,920
several nice Western restaurants.

912
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,640
Next time I'll treat you to a meal there.

913
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,120
Actually, we're

914
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,280
used to being frugal,

915
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,940
especially our Minister Wen.

916
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,440
You see, we've been near death

917
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,030
so many times.

918
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,320
We're really not used to

919
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,670
those foreign dishes.

920
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,550
That's no problem.

921
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,950
There are also Chinese restaurants there.

922
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:33,800
Good.

923
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,530
Next time I'll find a chance

924
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,020
for us to get together.

925
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,170
Is your watch accurate?

926
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,170
The watch? Very accurate.

927
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,600
Extremely accurate.

928
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,810
Miss Huang, you don't know.

929
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:50,840
This watch was a gift from Minister Wen.

930
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,880
This is the most

931
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,430
valuable and precious gift

932
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,190
I've ever received in my life.

933
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,320
I wear it day and night.

934
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,690
It's what you call,

935
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,650
what's the phrase...

936
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,460
close as internal organs.

937
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,300
This watch isn't that valuable.

938
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,160
I bought it at a secondhand stall.

939
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,440
The parts were all rusted then.

940
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,760
I fixed it myself.

941
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,780
I hope it's accurate.

942
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,240
Accurate. Very accurate.

943
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,130
And what was that phrase you used earlier,

944
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,900
close as internal organs?

945
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,790
You meant 'close to the skin', right?

946
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,710
Right, it's close to my skin.

947
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,850
Don't misuse phrases.

948
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,630
Let's eat.

949
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,670
Wrong words, talking nonsense.

950
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:36,880
Huang,

951
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,850
I also ordered a plain noodle soup.

952
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,100
Could you go check on it?

953
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,110
I'll go see.

954
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,360
Go hurry them up.

955
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,710
How is it?

956
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,550
She's from south.

957
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,030
Highly educated and artistic.

958
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,600
What do you mean?

959
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,010
Introduce her to me?

960
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,230
Stop pretending.

961
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,230
Stop being so picky.

962
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,480
She's good enough.

963
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,800
Do you even know her?

964
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,840
How did you even meet

965
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,960
a woman like that?

966
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,940
Alright, alright.

967
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,020
Let's eat quickly,

968
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,210
and leave as soon as we're done.

969
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,630
Like a dog biting Lv Dongbin,

970
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,280
you don't recognize good intentions.
