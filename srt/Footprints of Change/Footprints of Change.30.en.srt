[Episode 30]

3
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,590
Beichuan.

4
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,870
How are you feeling now?

5
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,770
How should I put it?

6
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,080
Just like Shanghai's weather.

7
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,930
Sunny one moment, rainy the next.

8
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,240
You know what?

9
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,910
If you take my advice,

10
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,620
I suggest you keep your public position.

11
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
If you're working
in the cultural industry,

12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,120
holding a university teaching position
is something you can proudly present.

13
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,520
Just look at all those
so-called celebrities.

14
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,930
Every one of them
has a university professor title.

15
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,640
Why?

16
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,060
Don't you know me by now?

17
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,310
I just hate trouble.

18
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,280
You always call it troublesome.

19
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,250
Don't come to regret it later.

20
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,370
And that Tong Tong.

21
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,280
She's definitely got issues.

22
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,060
She's already in her twenties,

23
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,160
her values should be established by now,

24
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,680
yet she acts like a teenager.

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,870
What is she thinking?

26
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,360
Doesn't she know
how much harm she's causing you,

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,820
or how it affects herself?

28
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,870
I asked about this for you.

29
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,250
We have a neighbor next door,

30
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,030
who's now a very successful lawyer.

31
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,400
You can sue her for this.

32
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,990
If you can't teach her a lesson,

33
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,840
let the legal system

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,100
educate her properly.

35
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,240
I just

36
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,250
treat her as a naive young girl.

37
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,960
She has no shame.

38
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,440
Should I have no shame too?

39
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,270
Xiang Beichuan, you know,

40
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,750
your greatest charm

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,710
is swallowing your pain.

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,010
Impressive.

43
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,190
If this

44
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,600
happened to Yan Jun,

45
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,160
that girl would have been
dead 800 times over.

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,250
Speaking of Yan Jun.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,250
Our project has been approved.

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,990
But government funding is limited.

49
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,250
We'll have to raise most of it ourselves.

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,730
You have a good relationship with Yan Jun.

51
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,930
Why don't you ask him?

52
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,030
He's doing well now.

53
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,120
He's a big boss.

54
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,370
If you want to ask, go ahead.

55
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,960
In my experience,

56
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,640
working with him is really frustrating.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,150
Don't be at odds with money.

58
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,610
Even heroes can be
defeated by financial problems.

59
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,050
How about this?

60
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,400
Come with me.

61
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,870
If you're uncomfortable, I'll talk to him.

62
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,310
After all, I'm not as close to him.

63
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,430
You two have a closer relationship.

64
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,430
Think about it.

65
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,280
Junior.

66
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,520
Senior.

67
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,710
Sorry, are

68
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
we late?

69
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:16,720
No.

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,920
It's just that

71
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,920
when I have meetings

72
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,980
I prefer to arrive ten minutes early.

73
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,700
I've ordered coffee
for you. Please sit down.

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,630
I haven't added anything to the coffee.

75
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,480
Try it.

76
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,190
If it's too bitter,

77
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,720
I can add some sugar for you.

78
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,140
Thank you.

79
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
Junior.

80
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,480
No.

81
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,830
Mr. Yan,

82
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,070
have you looked at the project proposal

83
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,040
I sent you last time?

84
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,120
What do you think?

85
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,120
I've read it.

86
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,210
First of all,

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,190
I think it's great

88
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,630
that you two
are starting a business together.

89
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,950
That's excellent.

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,270
But about that proposal,

91
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,310
since we're alumni,
I'll be straightforward.

92
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,110
I don't think it will make money.

93
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,140
Here's the thing, Mr. Yan.

94
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,830
Well,

95
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,760
the cultural industry

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
does have lower profit margins.

97
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,750
But what we're aiming for

98
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,390
is long-term benefits.

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,390
For example,

100
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,510
consider this:

101
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,270
these novels will become

102
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,160
intellectual property in the future.

103
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,670
If we think more boldly,

104
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,040
they could be adapted
into films or TV series.

105
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,120
So from a long-term perspective,

106
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,010
the prospects are quite promising.

107
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,270
Perhaps you could

108
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,830
reconsider it.

109
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,480
Long-term...

110
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,120
Senior.

111
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,720
Capital comes with costs.

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,820
Of course, I'm not saying I won't invest.

113
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,760
I have a business partner recently

114
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,540
and I need to discuss it with her.

115
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,150
You know her.

116
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,190
Here. Xining.

117
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,170
Xining, what brings you here?

118
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,050
Long time no see.

119
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,740
Let me introduce her once more.

120
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,040
Ye Xining, Miss Ye.

121
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,750
Her business is doing very well now.

122
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,960
Her company is bigger than mine.

123
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,530
We're investing
in some projects together now.

124
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,160
That's great!

125
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,390
We're all friends here.

126
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,390
Right, Beichuan?

127
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
Say something.

128
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,070
Look at him getting nervous again.

129
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,870
He goes quiet when he's nervous.

130
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,640
Xining,

131
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,950
have you read the proposal?

132
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,750
I have.

133
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,050
What do you think?

134
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,840
I think it's excellent.

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,600
But

136
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,840
we've seen so many projects,

137
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,430
and I think

138
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,480
it seems like

139
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,830
they all have
higher returns than this one.

140
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,630
Why should we invest in this one?

141
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,000
Maybe it's a feeling,

142
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,240
or perhaps more

143
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,140
of a sentimental attachment.

144
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,470
What if we lose money?

145
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,310
If there's a loss, so be it.

146
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,040
If we lose money,

147
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,409
I'll take responsibility.

148
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,680
This is on me anyway.

149
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,350
It has nothing to do with you.

150
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,800
Compared to Xining,
I seem so small-minded.

151
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,430
I'm just

152
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,160
shortsighted,

153
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,310
only seeing money.

154
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,510
No, no, not at all.

155
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,050
Yahui.

156
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,430
Shouldn't you bow to Xining?

157
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,360
Well, um...

158
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,250
Well,

159
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,920
I'll use coffee instead of alcohol.

160
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,510
As for the bow,

161
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,920
let's skip that.

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,630
Then,

163
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,530
Beichuan.

164
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,330
Let's do this

165
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,330
together.

166
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,940
Let's toast to Miss Ye.

167
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:28,860
Come on.

168
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,000
Over here.

169
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,909
Here, Miss Ye.

170
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,360
I'm sorry. I have something to attend to.

171
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,310
You guys chat.

172
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,490
Let's keep in touch.

173
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,040
Beichuan.

174
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,130
The two of you continue talking.

175
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,590
I have something to do as well.
I'll go first.

176
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,409
Xiang Beichuan!

177
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,830
Who said you could leave?

178
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,560
Are we done talking about this?

179
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,870
We're not done yet. You left first.

180
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,530
What's that supposed to mean?

181
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
I thought we were done discussing this.

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,040
We're not done.

183
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,120
You and Yan Jun are playing good cop,

184
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,510
bad cop. Do you think that's clever?

185
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,270
Yes, it is.

186
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,580
Haven't I been good to you?

187
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,270
That worthless business plan of yours

188
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,920
is bound to make any investor lose money.

189
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,750
Then don't invest.

190
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,920
Why shouldn't I invest?

191
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,870
Then invest.

192
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,310
What's with your attitude?

193
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,110
What attitude should I have?

194
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,870
You tell me.

195
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,909
Was I supposed to stand up
and bow to you too?

196
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,960
Yes, you were.

197
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,809
Get on your knees.

198
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,559
Apologize to me.

199
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,289
How dare you say
there's something wrong with me?

200
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,000
Can you just let me off the hook?

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,840
No.

202
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,260
Why should I let you off?

203
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,670
Whatever you say goes.

204
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,630
I should do whatever you say.

205
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,550
You always call the shots.

206
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,120
Why are you so domineering?

207
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,390
Look in the mirror.

208
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,730
You're describing yourself.

209
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,540
I get it now.

210
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,120
You're saying I'm domineering.

211
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,230
You're saying
I put pressure on you, right?

212
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,790
Then you should look in the mirror too.

213
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,030
You're so selfish.

214
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,600
You only love yourself.

215
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,300
Let's just be friends then.

216
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,980
Fine.

217
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,120
From today on,

218
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,560
we'll stay out of each other's way.

219
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,270
We can be friends if possible.

220
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,030
If we can't be friends,

221
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,670
then let's not be anything at all.

222
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,480
Got it.

223
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,480
Good.

224
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,040
It's a deal.

225
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,630
Have you been to this restaurant before?

226
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,440
No, I haven't.

227
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,270
I think the sweet and sour ribs here

228
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,390
are better than the ones at Red Mansion.

229
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,120
Try some.

230
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,490
Excuse me!

231
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,750
I'll have the sweet and sour ribs

232
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,910
and three of your specialty dishes.

233
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,910
Yes, sir.

234
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,800
Xining.

235
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,030
I heard that

236
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,650
your grandfather used to be a minister.

237
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,650
How did you know?

238
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,480
Well,

239
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,870
last night I was

240
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,720
drinking with some business friends.

241
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,320
They all run big businesses.

242
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,000
We got to talking.

243
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,840
They said the current city leaders

244
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,620
used to work under your grandfather.

245
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,510
They want to see if

246
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,550
they could use your connection

247
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,120
to help them acquire some land.

248
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,520
I heard the profits are quite substantial.

249
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
What do you think?

250
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,270
What do you think?

251
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,200
I refused.

252
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,450
You really know me well.

253
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,390
That's why we're so like-minded.

254
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,440
Besides,

255
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,210
I won't let you do

256
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
anything dangerous.

257
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,440
And also,

258
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,030
money is good,

259
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,240
but it depends on how you earn it.

260
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,550
We've learned from past mistakes.

261
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,100
I've actually felt
quite embarrassed about it.

262
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,720
But we're both growing,

263
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,320
both you and me.

264
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:29,940
Right?

265
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,000
I heard from Yahui that

266
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,890
you're teaching
at Jiaotong University now.

267
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,530
I'm in the Civil Engineering Department.

268
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,150
Professor Xiang.

269
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,240
Before I came here,

270
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,170
my cousin showed me your writings.

271
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,860
It was like meeting you through your words
before meeting in person.

272
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,500
Well,

273
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,910
I'm embarrassed.

274
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,080
Actually, I'm no longer
teaching at the university.

275
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,390
You don't have to call me Professor.

276
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,360
I'll still call you Professor Xiang.

277
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,620
It feels more natural.

278
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,640
Alright,

279
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,850
whatever feels comfortable for you.

280
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,080
It's my first time here too.

281
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,870
Same here.

282
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,780
Beichuan.

283
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,390
You know one another?

284
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,320
They're

285
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,010
my ex-girlfriend and my college classmate.

286
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,250
Professor Ni,

287
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,750
shall we go to another restaurant instead?

288
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,480
Because of the ex-girlfriend?

289
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,710
She

290
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,820
is a bit unstable.

291
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Who is that woman?

292
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,560
Beichuan's girlfriend.

293
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,030
Xiang Beichuan

294
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,470
has a girlfriend now?

295
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,140
You didn't know?

296
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,730
No, I didn't.

297
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,080
You had just gone to Hungary for

298
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,510
about a week,

299
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,990
and they got together.

300
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,340
Are you serious?

301
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,630
No, it's not true.

302
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,390
Just kidding.

303
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,080
I'm just joking.

304
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,480
Don't take it seriously.

305
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,960
Where are you going, Xining?

306
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,750
Xining?

307
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,030
Xiang Beichuan!

308
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,030
I hate you!

309
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,830
I'll

310
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,600
throw you to your death.

311
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,020
Well, Yin. What are you doing here?

312
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,750
You've been following me?

313
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,920
You went to the exhibition
yesterday morning.

314
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,880
Then to a café in the afternoon.

315
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,150
In the evening, you went to a hotel

316
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,910
on Huanghe Road.

317
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,200
You didn't go home.

318
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,680
This morning you went to Qipu Road.

319
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,080
Are you crazy?

320
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,360
I told you to come to the company
in a few days

321
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,890
and I'll refund your money.

322
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,390
Every payment at the company
has to follow a process.

323
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:05,990
Following

324
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,480
me

325
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,240
like this won't help at all.

326
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,150
Give me the money now.

327
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,030
Who carries that much cash around?

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,130
This is all I have. Will this do for now?

329
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:26,960
Not enough.

330
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,360
Take it or leave it.

331
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,160
Forget it if you don't take it...

332
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,080
You really are

333
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,270
pushing your luck, aren't you?

334
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,390
Trying to snatch my cell phone?

335
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,630
You have no shame.

336
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,910
Just you wait.

337
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,670
Wait for what?

338
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,180
Just you wait.

339
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,240
Wait for what?

340
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,110
Just you wait.

341
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,270
I'll wait.

342
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,350
Ma'am.

343
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,380
Let me make a call.

344
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,260
Is this Professor Ni?

345
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,150
Hello, this is Xiang Beichuan.

346
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,550
Professor Xiang.

347
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,810
A friend gave me two movie tickets.

348
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,440
Would you like to go with me?

349
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,960
Which day?

350
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,150
Today.

351
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,560
Is that convenient?

352
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,510
What time?

353
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,150
The tickets are for 7:15 p.m.

354
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,700
Okay.

355
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,510
Great.

356
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,530
I'll wait for you at the entrance
of the cinema at 7.

357
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,280
Alright.

358
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,180
See you soon.

359
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,270
Thank you, Ma'am.

360
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,460
Coming.

361
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,550
Are you going out?

362
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,920
Yes.

363
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,530
Where are you going?

364
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,880
To see a movie.

365
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,040
By yourself?

366
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,680
With someone.

367
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,150
Do you really have to go?

368
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,030
I must.

369
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,500
What time is the movie?

370
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,830
7:15.

371
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,750
It's already 6:30.

372
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,590
I have a watch.

373
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,510
It's too late.

374
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,400
There's still time.

375
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,770
Why do you live in this partition room?

376
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,260
None of your business.

377
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,310
Psychologists say

378
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,440
mentally ill people prefer

379
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,070
small, dark spaces.

380
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,710
You're the one
who's mentally ill, aren’t you?

381
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,270
You hate me?

382
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,160
I don't.

383
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,400
Why not?

384
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,140
Hatred is an emotion.

385
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,930
There's no emotion between us anymore.

386
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,860
Xiang Beichuan,

387
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,020
you're so petty.

388
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,920
We've been through tough times together.

389
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,020
At the very least, we're friends.

390
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,590
Miss Ye.

391
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,200
You think we're friends,

392
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,600
so that makes us friends?

393
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,680
Is everything in this world
just what you think it is?

394
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,750
In your mind,

395
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,920
am I just a fool?

396
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,160
We really can't be friends?

397
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,750
We can't.

398
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,650
Give me a reason.

399
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,400
No reason.

400
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,310
No reason is, in itself, an explanation.

401
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,960
Either

402
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,640
you still hate me,

403
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,640
or

404
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,310
you still love me.

405
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,610
You just said you don't hate me,

406
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,020
so you must still love me.

407
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,790
It's all about that woman, isn't it?

408
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,680
As soon as I left,

409
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,440
you got together with her.

410
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,860
You turned the page
faster than flipping a book.

411
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,900
Really living up to your profession.

412
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,630
I was never in your heart, was I?

413
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,930
Is she very gentle and virtuous?

414
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,880
You must be very comfortable with her.

415
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,880
She revolves around you, looks up to you.

416
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,140
That's the kind of woman you want, right?

417
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,790
You're actually wearing the shirt,

418
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,920
pants, and shoes I gave you,

419
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,410
and going to the movie with her?

420
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,980
You should take them all off

421
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,710
and go naked.

422
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,170
When you treat her,

423
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,070
you take her to a restaurant.

424
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,700
Why didn't you
ever take me to restaurants?

425
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,690
All those hard times I spent with you.

426
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,310
Eating noodles in that tiny storage room.

427
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,000
You think I enjoyed those noodles?

428
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,460
And you take her to movies.

429
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,270
Why her?

430
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,960
I love movies too.

431
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,140
Your place here is quite nice.

432
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,570
Even has a balcony.

433
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,200
I bet you've spent many nights here

434
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,000
watching the stars and the moon.

435
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,590
Telling her all your stories.

436
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,590
While you two were here being romantic,

437
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,920
what was I doing out there?

438
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
I was working hard to make money.

439
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,920
Do you know what my life abroad

440
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,510
has been like?

441
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,540
I couldn't even get a hot meal every day.

442
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,780
I hated the foreign food.

443
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,500
What are you doing?

444
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,920
Why are you closing the door?

445
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,350
I'm not finished talking.

446
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,440
Open it.

447
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,640
Open the door!

448
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,440
Xiang Beichuan!

449
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,310
You punctured my tire?

450
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,680
Yes, I did. So what?

451
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,480
If I'd known you were
going to the movies with her,

452
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,140
I would've punctured you too.

453
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,960
Who am I making money for?

454
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,640
For us to have a better life.

455
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,840
If you're so capable,

456
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,320
then earn it yourself. Can you?

457
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,470
I've never even held another man's hand.

458
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,920
Yet you've been
with this woman for so long.

459
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,600
How could you do this to me?

460
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,380
I'll show you what movies are.

461
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,080
[Youth Film Theater]

462
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,730
Professor Ni.

463
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,550
Professor Xiang.

464
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,550
I'm sorry.

465
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,880
I got held up by something.

466
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,400
Let's hurry inside.

467
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,310
But it's already halfway through.

468
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,840
Why don't we come next time?

469
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,200
Alright.

470
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,440
In that case,

471
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,980
let me treat you to a meal.

472
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,120
I've already eaten.

473
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,730
How about we go for a walk?

474
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,930
Sounds good.

475
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,140
Xining.

476
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,270
Professor Xiang.

477
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,090
How many girlfriends have you had before?

478
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,310
Yes.

479
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,980
What do you mean?

480
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,750
I'm sorry.

481
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,670
I've been to several places today

482
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,980
and I'm a bit tired.

483
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,460
So where are you living now,
Professor Xiang?

484
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,920
I live in a partition room.

485
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,660
Are you considering
moving somewhere else in the future?

486
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,700
Not for now.

487
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,480
It's quite nice living there

488
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
and comfortable.

489
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,720
How many years did you
work at the university?

490
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,000
Five years.

491
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,220
Then you should have been
allocated housing, right?

492
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,800
The school was going to allocate one,

493
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,160
but I gave up my spot.

494
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,820
People like you are quite rare these days.

495
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,400
But since you've chosen

496
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,130
to start a company with my cousin,

497
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,030
it means you must
want to make something of yourselves.

498
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,780
Those dormitory-style buildings

499
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,380
are no great loss anyway.

500
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,070
Professor Ni.

501
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,180
I'm really sorry,

502
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,790
but I suddenly have an urgent matter

503
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,990
and need to leave now.

504
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,020
How about this?

505
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,520
Next time, it's my treat.

506
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,270
Whatever you want to eat, I'll pay.

507
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,200
I'm truly sorry.

508
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,240
Excuse me.

509
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:21,840
Goodbye.

510
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,920
Don't worry.

511
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,010
I've already called to turn myself in.

512
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,530
I told the police

513
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,050
that I'll wait for them right here.

514
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,270
Yahui,

515
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,380
have you contacted a lawyer?

516
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,040
Yes.

517
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,640
The lawyer said my voluntary surrender

518
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,360
might reduce my sentence.

519
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,240
But it could still be

520
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,750
over ten years in prison.

521
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,260
I never thought

522
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,900
that one day

523
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,870
I would come back here again.

524
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,910
I thought I'd never return.

525
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,830
Xining,

526
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,100
do you know

527
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,540
what I love most about this place?

528
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,980
It's this big window.

529
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,400
I love how the sunlight
shines through here.

530
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,480
So back then,

531
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,680
when I knew this would become

532
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,960
my bridal chamber,

533
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,170
I felt like

534
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,480
I was the happiest person in the world.

535
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,160
I'm so tired.

536
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,080
I miss my parents.

537
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,070
Huang Yahui.

538
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,540
The girl you saw that day

539
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,880
is not my girlfriend.

540
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,970
That was also our first meeting.

541
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,990
She's just someone I was set up with.

542
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,510
She's Sheng Yahui's cousin.

543
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,590
I'm sorry.

544
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,530
I broke your window

545
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,170
and made a big hole in it.

546
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,720
I'm really sorry.

547
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,720
Professor Ni.

548
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,280
Hello, Professor Xiang.

549
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,270
Am I late?

550
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,160
No, not at all.

551
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,070
I'm really sorry about yesterday. I...

552
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,670
It's fine, Professor Xiang.

553
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,520
Professor Xiang,
what would you like to drink?

554
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,940
I usually drink tea.

555
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Professor Xiang.

556
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,110
This is a coffee shop.

557
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,990
They probably don't serve tea.

558
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
I'm really sorry.

559
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,160
Coffee is fine too.

560
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,750
Although we haven't met many times,

561
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,400
you seem to have apologized
quite a lot, Professor Xiang.

562
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,880
I'm sorry about that.

563
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,970
Professor Xiang.

564
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,510
From our few interactions,

565
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,950
I can tell you're a very sincere person.

566
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,270
But I feel that

567
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,030
you might have many things

568
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,760
that you haven't resolved yet.

569
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,210
We haven't known each other for long.

570
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,920
I don't want to add any pressure on you.

571
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,070
Why don't we

572
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,420
put our relationship on hold for now?

573
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,550
When you've peacefully

574
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,550
dealt with everything in your life,

575
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,340
we can see if we
want to develop this further.

576
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,150
What do you think?

577
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,960
No problem.

578
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,960
Alright then.

579
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,350
Professor Xiang.

580
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,730
Hope to see you again next time.

581
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,230
Goodbye.

582
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,300
Goodbye.

583
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,970
[Mr. Yan Jun's Birthday Party]

584
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,440
Mr. Yan.

585
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,870
Wait a moment.

586
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,990
Happy birthday.

587
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,350
Thank you.

588
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,550
Everyone else came so early.

589
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,440
Why are you so late?

590
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,240
Trying to make a grand entrance?

591
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,130
I'll drink as punishment. Happy now?

592
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,650
Come, sit here.

593
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:44,900
Guys.

594
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,000
Could you move over there for a drink?

595
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,830
We need to talk.

596
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,480
Sure.

597
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,570
I'll drink up.

598
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,110
Did you know Shang Yunfei was arrested?

599
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,640
When did that happen?

600
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,530
Just a couple days ago.

601
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,100
His case has been
going on for quite a while.

602
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,610
He got what he deserved.

603
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,330
How long do you think

604
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,810
he will be sentenced for?

605
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,920
The amount in his case is substantial.

606
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,700
His sentence probably won't be short.

607
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
There's something I need to ask you.

608
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,570
Did you tell Ye Xining

609
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,940
that I was dating that female teacher

610
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,790
and had been for quite a while?

611
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,200
Yeah.

612
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,030
What's wrong?

613
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,640
Where did you
get the idea I was dating her?

614
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,310
What's your relationship
with Ye Xining now?

615
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,270
Nothing.

616
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,670
If there's nothing between you,
what's wrong with me joking around?

617
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,640
If you two were together,

618
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,000
what I did would be inappropriate.

619
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,110
But you're not together,

620
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,370
so what's the problem?

621
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,460
I'm just asking.

622
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,590
Do you still want to be with her?

623
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,400
No.

624
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,510
Are you sure?

625
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,030
I'm sure.

626
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,330
I'm going to the bathroom.

627
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,990
Take your time drinking
and enjoying yourself.

628
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,590
You're here, Xining.

629
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,350
Mr. Yan.

630
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,650
I'm sorry I'm late.

631
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,650
Happy birthday.

632
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,650
Thank you.

633
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,770
Beichuan is here too.

634
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,610
He's inside.

635
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,920
He came too?

636
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,230
Let's go in.

637
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,050
Wait a moment.

638
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:16,100
I'd like to have
a quick chat with you first.

639
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,510
What's your relationship
with Beichuan now?

640
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,370
Actually, I don't know

641
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,110
what we are anymore.

642
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,280
So can you two

643
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,070
still be together?

644
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,600
That mainly depends on him.

645
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,670
Seems you still care about him a lot.

646
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,050
As business people,

647
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,320
we can be domineering sometimes

648
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,850
because we make more money.

649
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,810
So maybe many things at home,

650
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,610
like food and clothes,
are actually paid for by us.

651
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Over time,

652
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,850
the other person might feel

653
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,340
a bit inferior.

654
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,960
Inferiority leads to sensitivity.

655
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,820
Sensitivity leads to arguments.

656
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,930
And that's not good in the long run.

657
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,840
If

658
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,480
you two really want to stay together,

659
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,280
I hope

660
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,590
Xining, you could tone down

661
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,720
your dominance a bit.

662
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,930
Things would be much better that way.

663
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,530
Of course, I'm not saying
Beichuan is perfect.

664
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,920
Beichuan

665
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,530
is always standing still.

666
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,960
Not like us who

667
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,670
can keep up with the times.

668
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,400
But I think

669
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,840
keeping up with the times refers to work

670
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,760
and career,

671
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,400
not love.

672
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,170
Beichuan has always stayed the same,

673
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,000
which means he's very traditional.

674
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,550
That's actually quite good.

675
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,400
For example, when you come home every day,

676
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,660
there might be someone

677
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,580
who has prepared dinner
and is waiting for you.

678
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,750
If you found someone like me,

679
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,630
out partying every day

680
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,440
and making a mess,

681
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,100
you wouldn't stand it either.

682
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,600
So what I'm saying is,

683
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,190
if you two

684
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,080
really want to be together,

685
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,640
then both of you need to change.

686
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,900
Of course,

687
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,400
if you two ultimately

688
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,920
can't make it work,

689
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,920
then I hope

690
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,610
it won't affect you too much.

691
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,920
You can still focus on your work.

692
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,280
We can work together

693
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,540
and make a lot of money.

694
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,280
1 million, 2 million, 5 million.

695
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,510
It's all possible.

696
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,730
I'm going to Canada later this year.

697
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,730
I heard the down there is excellent.

698
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,280
If you'd like,

699
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,500
we could go together.

700
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,060
I'll book two tickets,

701
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,810
first class.

702
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,900
That way the journey won't be tiring.

703
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,190
And my English isn't good.

704
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,300
You could help translate for me
when we're there.

705
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,360
You'd be a big help.

706
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,030
Alright, I've said
everything I wanted to say.

707
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,230
You should go in now.

708
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:35,770
Okay.

709
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,200
I'll go in and sing for a while.

710
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,180
I need to use the bathroom.

711
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,750
Go ahead.

712
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,850
Beichuan.

713
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,920
Yin?

714
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,810
What are you doing here?

715
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,620
I stabbed Yan Jun.

716
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,910
What did you say?

717
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,990
I stabbed Yan Jun.

718
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,720
I've settled the score.

719
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,250
You stabbed

720
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,330
Yan Jun?

721
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:03,720
Hello?

722
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,130
Is this the police?

723
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,440
Yan Jun.

724
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,590
Yan Jun!

725
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,530
Are you okay?

726
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,780
Call an ambulance quickly!

727
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,800
What's happening here?

728
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,410
Ye Xining,

729
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,930
go get an ambulance quickly!

730
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:17,860
Are you alright?

731
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,070
Wait, where are you hurt?

732
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,870
Hang in there!

733
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,800
He's been stabbed.

734
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,130
Go get an ambulance now!

735
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,470
Has anyone called the police?

736
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,800
Um, how do I call for one?

737
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,010
Find a public phone
or ask someone for help.

738
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,840
Hurry and get an ambulance!

739
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,230
Go!

740
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,710
Okay.

741
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,320
Are you okay?

742
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,550
Help!

743
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,590
Hang in there!

744
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:33,920
Help!

745
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,800
Please hold on.

746
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,630
[One week later, Inpatient Department]

747
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,460
What bad luck.

748
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,540
I should have listened to you.

749
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,930
I never thought this guy
would be so vicious.

750
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,290
Left me with a huge hole.

751
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,810
Well. You were behind this, weren't you?

752
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,840
I haven't even had my stitches removed.

753
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,500
How could you be so heartless?

754
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,900
Yan Jun.

755
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,570
This is heaven teaching you a lesson.

756
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,500
I hope in the future

757
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,900
you can be
a businessman with a conscience.

758
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,420
From now on, every week...

759
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,050
I mean, every month.

760
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,800
I'll donate money to the orphanage.

761
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,600
You'll help me with this, right?

762
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,440
Mr. Yan.

763
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,190
Mr. Yan.

764
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,150
Mr. Lu.

765
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:32,860
Xining.

766
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,930
You look well.

767
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,030
We've all been worried about you.

768
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,230
Seeing you recover so well

769
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,490
puts our minds at ease.

770
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,320
This is what they call

771
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,410
surviving a great disaster

772
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,210
brings good fortune afterward.

773
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,090
I came by car.

774
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,280
Let me give everyone a ride.

775
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

776
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:48,980
Mr. Lu.

777
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,190
I'll take my bike.

778
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,230
You go ahead then.

779
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,160
Alright.

780
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,330
Leave him to me.

781
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,140
Goodbye.

782
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,760
Take it slow!

783
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,890
Xiang Beichuan.

784
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,110
Don't you have anything to say to me?

785
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,990
Fine.

786
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,460
If you have nothing to say to me,

787
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,060
I have something to tell you.

788
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,890
About what happened

789
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,570
a year ago with the switch,

790
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,960
I owe you a thank you.

791
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,330
Thank you.

792
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,420
It's all in the past.

793
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,190
I hope you'll

794
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,420
be well in the future.

795
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,840
You too.

796
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,050
I never thought

797
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,670
that the laughter among our old friends

798
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,630
would be so short-lived.

799
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,170
Yin's stabbing

800
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,130
also exposed
all of Yan Jun's past misdeeds.

801
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,720
He was convicted of bribing officials,

802
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,750
lost everything,

803
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,350
and sentenced to several years in prison.

804
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,070
Oh my god.

805
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,330
Why are you here?

806
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,440
Why do you look so exhausted?

807
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,590
I need to rest for a bit.

808
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:40,570
Oh my!

809
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,960
What's going on?

810
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,590
Ye Xining

811
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,070
just called me

812
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,960
and asked if I'm free tomorrow

813
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,280
to take her to the airport.

814
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,810
I asked where she was going,

815
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,630
and she said back to Hungary.

816
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,300
I asked when she'd be back,

817
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,440
and she said not anytime soon.

818
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,510
Oh, right.

819
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,130
She left you a twin-tub washing machine

820
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,250
because your partition room is damp

821
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,550
and clothes won't dry properly.

822
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,130
I just went to get it for you.

823
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,630
As I understand it,

824
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,890
the twin-tub washing machine

825
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,670
has one tub on the left

826
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,130
and one on the right.

827
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,760
The left one washes

828
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,070
and the right one spins dry.

829
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,870
The spin dryer is quite special.

830
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,690
You've never heard that sound, have you?

831
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:22,440
No.

832
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,070
When that spin dryer starts,

833
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,960
it's extremely loud.

834
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,230
Very noisy.

835
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,390
So it's settled.

836
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,550
You'll come to my place
to do laundry at night,

837
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,320
and if I get hungry,

838
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,120
I'll come over for some noodles.

839
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,800
The one on the left

840
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,190
is for washing.

841
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,480
The one on the right

842
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,410
is for spinning.

843
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,060
My mom has one of these.

844
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,440
I must say this thing works really well.

845
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,120
It only has one drawback.

846
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,010
It's too noisy.

847
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,760
Once it starts spinning,

848
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,350
it just keeps going.

849
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,410
It's so noisy here.

850
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,270
Where are you going?

851
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,590
You stay here.

852
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,340
I need to go out for a while.

853
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,890
Why are you here?

854
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,320
I'm here to do laundry.

855
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,230
Laundry?

856
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,640
Don't you have a washing machine here?

857
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,600
Sheng Yahui

858
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,110
already sent the washing machine
to your place.

859
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,170
I didn't know that.

860
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,130
What do you really want to talk about?

861
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,880
Can you please stay?

862
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,380
Why should I?

863
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,200
I don't want you to leave.

864
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,300
The flight tickets are already booked.

865
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,700
Tickets can be refunded.

866
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,710
If that doesn't work,

867
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,740
I'll pay you back the difference.

868
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,880
Do you think we're right for each other?

869
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,120
Yes.

870
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,360
I don't think so.

871
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,690
You wouldn't be able to handle

872
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,110
someone with my personality.

873
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:51,920
It's okay.

874
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
I can improve.

875
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,190
I can learn.

876
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:58,550
I can adapt to you.

877
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:59,600
Xiang Beichuan,

878
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,280
you can't do it.

879
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:04,600
You're just not the type
who can put up with me.

880
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,000
Why don't we give it a try?

881
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,690
We've been trying for so long.

882
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,370
I don't want to change myself.

883
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,420
What you like

884
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,480
