00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,729
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,229
Hungry?

4
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,830
Haven't had dinner?

5
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,580
I'm not in the mood.

6
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,010
Guess the talk didn't go well.

7
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,160
Tell me about it.

8
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,520
They really have no idea

9
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,180
about the Japanese
strength and capabilities.

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,860
Do you think...

11
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,270
my dad was really
killed by the Japanese?

12
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,480
We've got plenty of men,

13
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,750
but we're no match for the Japanese.

14
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,290
Pistols are no match for machine guns.

15
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,800
That warlord Zhang in the northeast—

16
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,930
wasn't he powerful?

17
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,970
Didn't he still get killed
by the Japanese bomb?

18
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,190
Now Master just

19
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,710
got a new son late in life.

20
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,190
In his mind, he's still

21
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,080
some hot-blooded young guy.

22
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,070
We need to splash some cold water on him

23
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,030
to distract him.

24
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,350
Once his energy is diverted,

25
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,110
he won't have time
for the workers' strike.

26
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,680
How do we do it?

27
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,190
No way.

28
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,880
That's my brother.

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,480
"Boiling beans on beanstalks—

30
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,730
the beans weep, burned by their own kind."

31
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,940
I'll take all of these.

32
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,200
Wrap them up for me.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,860
Madam Yanhong.

34
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,870
Siyun.

35
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,870
Waitress,

36
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,070
bring me your most expensive necklace.

37
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,720
Who is this?

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,380
This is my sister-in-law.

39
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,240
Madam Yanhong.

40
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,320
Bring me another expensive one.

41
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
Here, Siyun.

42
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,340
This is for you.

43
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,800
The other one is for your sister-in-law.

44
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,750
You've helped me a lot

45
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,360
with my baby's matters.

46
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,380
Thank you, Madam Yanhong.

47
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,780
I can't accept this gift.

48
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,030
I provided medical treatment.

49
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,120
Mr. Zeng has already
paid the consultation fee.

50
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,390
That's not the same.

51
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,950
Even though he's paid you,

52
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,829
this is my gift.

53
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,829
Please take it.

54
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,200
It's not that expensive.

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,060
I really can't.

56
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,160
I will keep

57
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,460
your baby in mind.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,320
Alright, I won't force you then.

59
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,870
Once my baby's born,

60
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,270
I'll prepare a proper gift for you.

61
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,860
You must accept it then.

62
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,520
Siyun,

63
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,630
let me tell you,

64
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,870
all those little ailments I had before,

65
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,830
they've vanished.

66
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,750
I guess that's what they call
"good news brings good health."

67
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,810
Congratulations.

68
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,040
I know what you're thinking.

69
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,680
That I only married the old man for money.

70
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,790
Or what else?

71
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,310
Of course I'm in it for the money.

72
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,640
Isn't it good to be rich?

73
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,630
With money,

74
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,510
I can buy whatever I want.

75
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,920
My child and I

76
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
can live a good life.

77
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,130
That's why

78
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:01,980
a woman

79
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,500
has to be shrewd.

80
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,680
I didn't have a choice.

81
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,950
So if I had to choose—I'd choose money.

82
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,190
Siyun,

83
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,920
do you think my baby

84
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,430
will be a boy or a girl?

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,160
That I can't tell.

86
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,990
Can traditional medicine predict it?

87
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,460
I don't know.

88
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,120
What if it's a girl—

89
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
does that mean less money for me?

90
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,750
Forget it. I won't think about it.

91
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,770
I'll just burn incense every day

92
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,520
when I get back to pray for a boy.

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,240
Alright, I should go now.

94
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,880
Take good care of yourself, Madam Yanhong.

95
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,680
Okay, I won't see you out.

96
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,270
My belly is getting bigger.

97
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,159
I need to buy more new clothes.

98
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,120
Let's go, Sis.

99
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,409
It was this necklace just now, right?

100
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,380
Siyun,

101
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,120
it's such a nice necklace.

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,520
Why didn't you accept it?

103
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,000
Taking gifts from others is a burden.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
It doesn't feel easy.

105
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,770
Then here's an idea.

106
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,010
Next time you

107
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,870
treat those rich ladies,

108
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,080
take me with you.

109
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,380
You might feel awkward, but I don't.

110
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,780
I'll accept them for you.

111
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,190
Dr. Lin! Dr. Lin!

112
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,680
Come with me quickly!

113
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,140
Madam Yanhong's not good!

114
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,170
What happened?

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,900
Madam Yanhong,

116
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,720
what's wrong?

117
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,830
My belly hurts.

118
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,480
I just bled.

119
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,310
Do you think I'll be alright?

120
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,000
Fu,

121
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,060
call a car.

122
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,950
We're going to the hospital.

123
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,510
Okay.

124
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,600
Sis, I'll accompany
Madam Yanhong to the hospital.

125
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,630
You call the hospital

126
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,190
and tell them to prepare for surgery.

127
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:40,600
Also,

128
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,940
notify Cheng Ao to come to the hospital.

129
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,659
Alright.

130
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,800
Relax.

131
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,310
Give the patient a blood transfusion.

132
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,190
Call the anesthetist.

133
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,450
Get ready for surgery.

134
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,120
Am I going to die?

135
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,640
No.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,890
Don't be nervous.

137
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,800
Take deep breaths.

138
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,160
We'll give you blood.

139
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,420
Once the anesthetic's in, it won't hurt.

140
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,870
Director,

141
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,390
maybe you should step out.

142
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,850
People outside
are insisting on seeing you.

143
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,220
I'll step out for a moment.

144
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,620
I'll be right back
to perform your surgery.

145
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,070
Dr. Lin.

146
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,070
Siyun,

147
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,240
what's going on?

148
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,040
When I was at the department store today,

149
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,670
I ran into Madam Yanhong.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,310
She suddenly felt unwell.

151
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,070
After examination, we found out

152
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,270
she's showing signs of miscarriage.

153
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,070
But...

154
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,270
she was fine
when she left home this morning.

155
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,870
How could this happen?

156
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,470
She's still hemorrhaging.

157
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,870
The situation is critical.

158
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,000
What about the baby?

159
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Answer him!

160
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,330
I'm sorry, Dr. Lin.

161
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,290
Please go ahead.

162
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,260
We can only save

163
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,340
either the baby or the mother.

164
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,720
Yanhong.

165
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,040
Save the mother.

166
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,930
Wait.

167
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,000
Dr. Lin,

168
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,820
save the baby instead.

169
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,450
Here's a small gift.

170
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,530
Thank you for your help.

171
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,210
Director, her blood pressure is dropping.

172
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,120
Almost unmeasurable.

173
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,360
If we force delivery,

174
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,510
we might not be able to save the mother.

175
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,130
[Emergency Room]

176
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,770
Is it a boy or girl?

177
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,880
Madam Yanhong's condition

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,120
has stabilized.

179
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,030
What about the baby?

180
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,150
The baby...

181
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,700
didn't make it.

182
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,390
What did I just tell you?

183
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,710
I am a doctor.

184
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,600
I had no choice.

185
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,490
Didn't you say there was a choice?

186
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,600
Father.

187
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,320
Get out of the way!

188
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,150
Something's wrong here.

189
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,020
We need to investigate first.

190
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,850
Move!

191
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,170
Take him away!

192
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,200
Get out of here!

193
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:01,900
Father!

194
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,950
Father, I beg you.

195
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,000
Father, don't shoot.

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,190
Father!

197
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,060
Father, you can't shoot!

198
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,890
Father!

199
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,030
Father, you can't kill her!

200
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,460
Father!

201
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,770
Father!

202
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,670
Father!

203
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,220
Father!

204
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,960
Father!

205
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,270
Father!

206
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
Father!

207
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,550
Cheng Ao,

208
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,930
from today on,

209
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,270
your 20-year relationship
with our Zeng family

210
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,630
is over.

211
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:42,890
Are you okay?

212
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,390
I'm fine.

213
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,190
Yanhong will recover, right?

214
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,990
She's not even 20 yet.

215
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,860
Her body should recover quickly.

216
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,870
She can have children again.

217
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,750
That's good.

218
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,410
What are you sorry for?

220
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,620
You didn't do anything wrong.

221
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,150
If it were me,

222
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,450
I would've chosen the same.

223
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,180
I just find it all
so sudden and bewildering.

224
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,270
Dalun suddenly

225
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,970
started working with the Japanese.

226
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,900
My father

227
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,240
suddenly cut ties with me.

228
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,870
I used to think

229
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,030
I could handle many things,

230
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,480
face all kinds of situations.

231
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,590
♪ The stars shimmer in the sky ♪

232
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,580

234
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,010

235

I don't know...

236
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,420
I just don't know what to do.

237
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,590
♪ Waiting for dawn to come again ♪

238
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,420
♪ You and I, caught in troubled times ♪

239
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,960
♪ Tangled in this world ♪

240
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,030
When I first returned to China,

241
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,960
♪ If destiny's chains can't be broken ♪

242
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,360
my dad had just passed.

243

♪ Then I'll spend my life with you ♪

244
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,370
I've also trusted the wrong people

245
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,210
and been deceived.

246
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,590
When I wanted to open a hospital,

247
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,790
♪ What we've loved, what we've said ♪

248
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,390

♪ Won't be swept away by wind or rain ♪

250
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,150

I've been upset—

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,960
♪ What we've suffered, what we've missed ♪

253
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,160

♪ Shapes the loneliness of our parting ♪

255
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,510
Besides,

256
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,360
back then,

257
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,090
you were always there supporting me.

258
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,750
♪ What we've loved, what we've said ♪

00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,800

♪ The bonds of this life that never fade ♪

261
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,510

Siyun,

270
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,600
when are you free

271
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,960
these next few days?

272
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,360
When are you free?

273
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,200
What's up?

274
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,920
I want to treat you to dinner.

275
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,960
My treat—you set it up.

276
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,190
I'm busy.

277
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,840
Do you know who contacted me?

278
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,600
Zeng Dalun.

279
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,850
He's doing really well now.

280
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,320
And what's that

281
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,910
got to do with me?

282
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,270
You're close with Cheng Ao,
and he's close with Dalun.

283
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,000
Help me set up

284
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,400
a dinner with him.

285
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,790
If I could work with him,

286
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,480
wouldn't our family be better off again?

287
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,880
You know,

288
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,920
Zeng Dalun is quite influential now.

289
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,640
He's very close with the Japanese.

290
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,359
With the current situation

291
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,740
being so tense,

292
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,030
if I could connect
with the Japanese through Zeng Dalun,

293
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,840
wouldn't that be
double insurance for our family?

294
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,850
I understand better than anyone

295
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,650
what it means
to adapt to changing circumstances.

296
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,280
Please leave immediately.

297
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,050
If you don't leave now,
I'll call the police.

298
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,440
You know me well enough.

299
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,590
Dalun,

300
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,960
the investigation into Communist supplies

301
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,750
is now in its final stage.

302
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,720
Most of Shanghai's docks
have been checked.

303
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,680
Now I want to inspect your family's dock.

304
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,720
Our dock?

305
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,160
No way.

306
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,270
My father isn't pro-Communist.

307
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,800
He only hates the Japanese.

308
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,240
Dalun,

309
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,680
your opium trafficking

310
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,270
has been reported to the higher-ups.

311
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,500
Cooperating with Shen Yiqun this time

312
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,890
is your chance to make amends.

313
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,000
Cooperate?

314
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,480
Why should I cooperate with Shen Yiqun?

315
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,740
Who does he think he is?

316
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,750
I've done

317
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,790
more work for the Revival Society

318
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,850
than he has lately.

319
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,550
Dalun,

320
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,880
it's good for young people
to have passion.

321
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,680
But politics isn't just about fighting.

322
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,630
What matters most is brains.

323
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,000
I understand.

324
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,400
So according to you,

325
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,790
the deputy director position
is basically Shen Yiqun's?

326
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,030
Not necessarily.

327
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,790
You might still have a shot.

328
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,270
What's crucial now is whether we can seize

329
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,270
that shipment of medicine
the Communists are moving out of Shanghai.

330
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,590
If you can track down this shipment,

331
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,250
the deputy director position

332
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,790
should be yours.

333
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,600
Just bear with it for now.

334
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,400
Having you work with Shen Yiqun

335
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,200
is also what our superiors want.

336
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,630
Thank you for your guidance, Director.

337
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,010
That's more like it.

338
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,300
Remember this,

339
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,120
the grievance

340
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,490
is just a temporary thing.

341
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,550
I have high hopes for you.

342
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,310
Do your best.

343
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,830
I'll get to it.

344
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,320
Go on then.

345
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,720
Cut back on smoking.

346
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,600
Thank you, Director.

347
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,140
Jin,

348
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,750
set up a meeting with Mr. Sada for me.

349
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,750
Tell him

350
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,180
I need to see him urgently.

351
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,640
Seems Director Liu's words
can't be trusted.

352
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,310
I've never trusted him anyway.

353
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,510
So, what's your plan?

354
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,680
Take this carton of cigarettes.

355
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,780
Thank you, Young Master.

356
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,590
Mr. Sada,

357
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,440
we've worked together for a long time—

358
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,720
from the Northeast to Shanghai.

359
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,520
Our business dealings
have always gone smoothly.

360
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,450
That's true.

361
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,760
Let's drink to our friendship.

362
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,270
I have an idea

363
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,240
that not only keeps our business going,

364
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,700
but also strengthens
my cooperation with the Empire of Japan.

365
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,070
Mr. Zeng,

366
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,250
we've been friends for years.

367
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,320
Of course I'd welcome deeper cooperation.

368
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,210
But may I ask,

369
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,400
how exactly do you plan

370
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,240
to achieve this?

371
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,510
Shen Yiqun and I

372
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,960
are competing for
the deputy director position.

373
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,550
You know what kind
of person Shen Yiqun is.

374
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,070
He has always been anti-Japanese.

375
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,000
If he becomes the deputy director,

376
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,440
it would certainly

377
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,100
be all harm and no good for you.

378
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,590
But if it's me,

379
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,940
the Kuomintang's door

380
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,420
would be your back door.

381
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,550
Whatever intelligence you need,

382
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,920
I can easily provide.

383
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,590
That's thoughtful of you, Mr. Zeng.

384
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,390
Since you've spoken so frankly,

385
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,530
we will definitely help you win

386
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,810
this position.

387
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,750
I will do my utmost.

388
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,110
Mr. Gu,

389
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,610
you wanted to see me?

390
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,790
The contact I usually work with
has been arrested.

391
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,270
The situation is extremely urgent.

392
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,200
Both the medicine and myself
need to be transferred.

393
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,240
I'll make arrangements.

394
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,960
Be careful.

395
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,170
It's so late.

396
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,730
I just finished a meeting.

397
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,990
The meeting was about

398
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,590
deploying forces throughout the city
to eliminate the Communists.

399
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,720
Our principle is
to capture them alive if possible,

400
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,320
but shoot to kill
at the slightest resistance.

401
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,080
Why are you telling me this?

402
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,220
You know this person well, don't you?

403
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,100
He's on our elimination list.

404
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,940
Once he's captured...

405
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,830
I don't know if you're familiar

406
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,490
with our torture procedures,

407
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,540
but no one can withstand them.

408
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,240
Within 3 days, he will definitely reveal

409
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,770
everyone connected to him.

410
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,410
Aren't you afraid saying this

411
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,030
will get you in trouble?

412
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,110
I have no choice.

413
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,270
Here are two steamer tickets.

414
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,980
Take Siyun and leave Shanghai.

415
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,910
Go to Chongqing.

416
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,160
I'll think about it.

417
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,510
Cheng Ao,

418
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,010
just think it through.

419
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,150
Make your decision quickly.

420
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,050
I'm leaving.

421
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,810
Why such a hurry?

422
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,200
Stay for a drink.

423
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,240
Another time—

424
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,840
once things settle down.

425
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,400
[Law Firm File]

426
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,950
Why did you suddenly ask me to meet here?

427
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,730
When I'm working,

428
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,850
it's all so fake.

429
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,590
After so many years in politics,

430
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,110
meeting different people every day,

431
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,850
saying different things to everyone,

432
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,920
sometimes I don't even know

433
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,440
if what I'm doing is right or wrong.

434
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,840
It's just so exhausting.

435
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,170
This place is nice.

436
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,550
It helps me relax.

437
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,990
Have you ever thought

438
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,400
it's your own ambition

439
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,290
that's turned you into this?

440
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,370
My ambition is big, yes.

441
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,100
But who doesn't have ambition?

442
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,720
I've tried to control it—

443
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,680
but I can't.

444
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,070
This is for you.

445
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,790
A gift.

446
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,070
I bought a house in Chongqing
for you and Cheng Ao.

447
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,200
I've seen the house. It's really nice.

448
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,920
You love dogs, right?

449
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,830
The yard is perfect for that.

450
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,420
And don't feel pressured.

451
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,880
Both your names are on the deed.

452
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,200
You know what I mean.

453
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,030
I'm suggesting that you could

454
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,560
leave Shanghai for a while.

455
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,900
It's so dangerous now,
bullets flying every day.

456
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,560
What if one day a bullet, bang!

457
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,640
I'm not saying it would hit you.

458
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,400
But what if it hits Cheng Ao's head?

459
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,800
That would be terrible. I'd be devastated.

460
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,000
No one is get shot.

461
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,030
That's good.

462
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,440
What's good?

463
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,000
You're so good to Cheng Ao.

464
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,440
Take it.

465
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,380
I can't accept this house.

466
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,800
Why not?

467
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,640
Why should I?

468
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,960
Does Cheng Ao know about this?

469
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,110
I just went to see him.

470
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,830
I told him about it.

471
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,550
He knows.

472
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,920
Alright, I'm not teasing you anymore.

473
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,960
I didn't buy this house for you two.

474
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,310
I just helped you pick it.

475
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,590
I paid on your behalf.

476
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,880
Just now in Cheng Ao's office,

477
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,270
he already paid me back.

478
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,680
And honestly, it's pretty expensive.

479
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,540
I might not even afford it myself.

480
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,940
Cheng Ao treats you

481
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,840
really well.

482
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,430
Now you can accept it, right?

483
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,440
I've had a lock specially made.

484
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,790
Here's the key.

485
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,070
When things settle down someday,

486
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,160
I'll come visit you in Chongqing.

487
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,200
But promise me—

488
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,060
save me a room.

489
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,750
Don't turn me away when I come.

490
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,320
Alright, you go home first.

491
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,910
I'll stay here a bit longer.

492
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:00,830
Wait.

493
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Be happy!

494
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,830
Shen Yiqun!

495
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,010
Who should not be hurt?

496
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,830
Cheng Ao.

497
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,630
Young Master,

498
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,980
we didn't find Cheng Ao's medicine.

499
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,690
That's impossible.

500
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,710
Search!

501
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,390
Yes, sir!

502
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,430
Dad.

503
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,510
Zhi,

504
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,660
where did you

505
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,020
get this deed from?

506
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,680
I'll count to three.

507
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,480
One—

508
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,920
Two—

509
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
I'll tell you.

510
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,740
Zhi has confessed that

511
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,680
Zeng Dalun gave her money

512
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,720
and a property deed

513
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,560
to put abortion medicine

514
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,720
into Madam Yanhong's chicken soup.

515
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,990
I see.

516
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,310
You may go now.

517
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,980
Dr. Lin,

518
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,110
please have a seat.

519
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,110
The other day,

520
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,380
you were frightened.

521
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,450
I'm truly sorry about that.

522
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,240
Lately, I've been thinking about

523
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,440
Cheng Ao

524
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,330
and Dalun when they were children.

525
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,870
Those two boys

526
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,000
always loved running around
in the courtyard

527
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,240
back and forth,

528
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,950
never sitting still.

529
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,960
A child’s nature shows the adult to come.

530
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,550
Dalun has

531
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
been mischievous since childhood.

532
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,960
As for Ao,

533
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,310
he has always been very steady.

534
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,200
Dr. Lin,

535
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,790
can you forgive me?

536
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,400
Here's a small gift from me.

537
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,680
Please don't refuse it.

538
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,420
Take it.

539
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,340
It's from Father.

540
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:19,960
Dad,

541
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,980
I did it,

542
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,840
but it was to protect you.

543
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,480
Dad,

544
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,350
have you seen Cheng Ao?

545
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,920
Do you want him dead too?

546
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,880
Dad,

547
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,110
how could I?

548
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,460
You and Cheng Ao
are the closest people to me.

549
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,000
Ao has a shipment of goods.

550
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,040
If you give me that shipment,

551
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,510
I will get promoted.

552
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,440
By then, what's mine

553
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,730
will be yours and Cheng Ao's too.

554
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,400
Go!

555
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,360
I'll say this one last time.

556
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,100
No dealings with the Japanese.

557
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,030
The medicines and equipment
are all packed.

558
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,430
Ready to depart anytime.

559
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,840
Mr. Cheng,

560
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,760
I hope one day

561
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,360
you will join us.

562
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,310
Those with determination

563
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,350
will eventually find their path

564
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,670
toward the right goal.

565
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,260
Take care once you leave Shanghai.

566
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,840
Mr. Cheng,

567
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,030
farewell.

568
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,190
Cheng Ao,

569
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,060
if there were more people like Mr. Gu,

570
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,040
our country would have hope, wouldn't it?

571
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:38,960
I believe so.

572
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,860
We must strive to be like him.

573
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,680
On August 13th, 1937,

574
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,810
the Battle of Shanghai broke out.

575
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,410
Sinan Maternity Hospital

576
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,900
has been used during the war,

577
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,300
receiving injured soldiers and refugees.

578
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,690
[Our Forces Strike Back,
Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses'

579
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,370
[Shanghai Suburbs, August 1937]

580
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,720
To protect our homeland,

581
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,960
to protect our families—

582
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,920
today

583
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,730
we march to the front.

584
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,400
Maybe today we fight,

585
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,200
and tomorrow we never come back!

586
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,380
But as soldiers,

587
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,510
as sons of China,

588
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,920
we do not fear death.

589
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,320
Trained for 1,000 days,

590
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,880
used in one moment—

591
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,960
now

592
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,840
it's our turn to fight!

593
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,550
Left face!

594
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,960
Quick march!

595
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,780
Director, more wounded are coming in.

596
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,660
What do we do?

597
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,030
Put them in the main ward.

598
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,030
Clean their wounds,
disinfect and bandage them.

599
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,630
Gather those who need surgery.

600
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,030
I'll come over as soon as I finish here.

601
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,760
Understood.

602
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,950
I'm really smart, you know.

603
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,590
Do you know what these mirrors

604
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,550
are for?

605
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,390
In a couple of days,

606
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,800
when Japanese planes come,

607
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,260
we'll place these mirrors

608
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,130
at the most important
National Army positions—

609
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,890
grain depots,

610
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,340
command posts,

611
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,630
and arsenals.

612
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,040
When these mirrors reflect light,

613
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,320
the Japanese planes

614
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,040
will hit their targets with precision.

615
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,000
This glass is quite sturdy.

616
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,670
Go break it.

617
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,510
Okay.

618
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,880
Nobody move!

619
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,480
Get down!

620
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,550
Stop right there!

621
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,550
Dad,

622
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,440
I'm negotiating with the Japanese,

623
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,840
trying for a ceasefire.

624
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,850
They've agreed.

625
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,070
As long as the National Army

626
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,530
withdraws from Shanghai,

627
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,630
they promised to treat our people well.
