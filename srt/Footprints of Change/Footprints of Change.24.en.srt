00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,830
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,539
You've been working hard lately.

4
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,550
This is your commission.

5
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,039
10,000 yuan.

6
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,560
I can't take this money from you.

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,790
I still owe you 60,000.

8
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,540
Besides, didn't you say yourself

9
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,480
that you lost money on the jeans deal?

10
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,330
I did lose money.

11
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,800
I gave Lu 120,000.

12
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,910
When Ye Xining
replaced the batch of jeans,

13
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,170
I paid another 60,000.

14
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,610
But losses are the boss's problem,

15
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,120
not the employee's concern.

16
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm now

17
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,600
trying to follow

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,910
international

19
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,560
big company

20
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,710
standards in how I operate.

21
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,079
And you just said

22
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,210
you owe me 60,000.

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,700
Right, with this 10,000,
that makes 70,000.

24
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,680
So to you,

25
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,370
you're only worth 70,000?

26
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,760
As long as we two brothers stick together,

27
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,430
I believe 700,000,

28
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,560
or even 7 million

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,420
is possible in the future.

30
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,030
Look how good things are now.

31
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,510
Business is booming.

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,010
Can't you feel it?

33
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,579
I can even smell it.

34
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,790
And I've recently realized something.

35
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,370
In business,

36
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,590
you need to be

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,870
a kind small-timer

38
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,570
or a ruthless big shot.

39
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,790
Get it?

40
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,640
Let me be honest with you.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
From what I've observed,

42
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,540
right now you're
just a ruthless small-timer.

43
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,380
No, you are!

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,400
Enough.

45
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,470
I'll go now.

46
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,510
Get some rest.

47
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,000
Hope you become
a kind big shot soon.

48
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,750
I can't do that.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
Hope I'm not disturbing you.

50
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,000
Not at all.

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,480
I'm doing aerobics.

52
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,690
Just working on my legs.

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,240
Didn't you say before

54
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,560
that you pawned your grandma's watch

55
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,950
to pay back Huang Yahui?

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,000
Here's 10,000 yuan.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,829
Take it first.

58
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,150
Redeem it as soon as you save enough.

59
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
Where did you get this money?

60
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,900
Don't you still owe Yan Jun money?

61
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,340
This is the commission Yan Jun gave me.

62
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,750
Why are you grinning like that?

63
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,600
Take it.

64
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,750
I don't need it.

65
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,680
I've already redeemed that watch.

66
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,800
Keep it for yourself.

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,730
Just make me
some extra noodles in the future,

68
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,010
with more meat,

69
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,570
and some vegetables I like.

70
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,510
Okay.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,130
I'll leave you then.

72
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,409
Wait a moment.

73
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,780
Thank you.

74
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,900
They're all dry.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,660
I hung them up to dry
and folded them afterwards.

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,970
Then I'll add an egg
to your noodles next time.

77
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,410
Deal.

78
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,600
Come do laundry more often.

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,310
Sure.

80
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,600
I'll be going now.

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,260
No problem.

82
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,220
Did my exercise disturb you?

83
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,020
No, not at all.

84
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,930
Keep going.

85
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,070
Good night.

86
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,770
Bye.

87
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,560
Bye.

88
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,680
These raw denim jeans

89
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,200
are all made
from the best imported fabric.

90
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,190
They've all been ruined by the rain.

91
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,360
It's heartbreaking.

92
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,680
Why don't we

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,810
donate them to charity?

94
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,840
Right.

95
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,409
Those kids in the mountains,

96
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,070
if each of them wears one of these,

97
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,670
it would look quite strange.

98
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
I have an idea.

99
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,190
Let's do this.

100
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,750
Let's dry these jeans.

101
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,390
Then sell them.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,680
I've noticed those young people

103
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,160
at the dance hall downstairs all wear

104
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,560
those light-colored jeans

105
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,220
with all those rips and tears.

106
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,000
So let's sell to them.

107
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,690
We can give these jeans

108
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,710
a complete redesign.

109
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:11,870
Mr. Lu,

110
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,890
do you know

111
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,360
any experts in stone washing
and acid washing?

112
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,750
We could consult with them

113
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,950
about the washing process techniques.

114
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,190
No problem.

115
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,240
They're all old friends.

116
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,990
I'll take care of it.

117
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,840
That's great.

118
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
But the three of us aren't enough.

119
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,800
Jiuling, quickly notify the workers

120
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
to get ready for work.

121
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,560
Prepare sandpaper and files.

122
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,870
Then I'll go find

123
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,000
some washed denim styles for reference.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,460
You're really something.

125
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
Wasn't this my idea?

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,750
I just said I had an idea.

127
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,870
Aren't we saying the same thing?

128
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,720
How did it suddenly
become your achievement?

129
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,890
Why are you taking credit?

130
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,550
Who's taking credit from you?

131
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,360
Mr. Lu,

132
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,190
tell me,

133
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,040
whose idea was this?

134
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,690
Wasn't I the one who suggested it?

135
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,750
Did you suggest it?

136
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,350
I didn't hear that.

137
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,390
I was listening to Ye the whole time.

138
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,310
Ye,

139
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,390
please explain your idea in more detail.

140
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,830
What I meant was

141
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,190
we could redesign their style.

142
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,450
For example, some could be straight-leg,

143
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,590
and others could be tapered.

144
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,280
You two are really something.

145
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,870
I'm only here
because the factory is in trouble.

146
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,800
If the factory improves even a little,

147
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,310
I won't bother with you two anymore.

148
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll leave immediately.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,590
Even if you beg me, I won't come back.

150
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,660
Who acts like this?

151
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Come on, try on these clothes for me.

152
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,020
What is it?

153
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,040
Dunhill?

154
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,140
So you know about Dunhill?

155
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,200
This coat is quite expensive, right?

156
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,390
Don't worry about the price.

157
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,680
I'm curious how you know about Dunhill.

158
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
I don't just know Dunhill.

159
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,110
I also know Montagut.

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,430
As a university teacher,
I can't afford it,

161
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,030
but I've seen
students' parents wearing them.

162
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,090
Alright, enough talk.

163
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,950
Try it on for me.

164
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,000
Bro.

165
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,159
Look at where I live.

166
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,159
There's even a dog cage next to me.

167
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,360
If I wear Dunhill,

168
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
it doesn't match this environment.

169
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,360
These clothes aren't for you
to wear in this room.

170
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,270
They're for when you
come with me to meet clients

171
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,160
or when we go to the dog kennel.

172
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,950
What's the difference?

173
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,280
The difference is huge.

174
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,480
The same dog,

175
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,600
if you wear your current clothes,

176
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,680
is worth 5,000.

177
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,800
But if you wear Dunhill,

178
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,660
the dog is worth 15,000.

179
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,630
Stop talking and put it on.

180
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,290
Come with me to the dog kennel.

181
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,240
So,

182
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,040
they say you were raised by dogs.

183
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,040
So we're going to see
your real father now?

184
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:29,990
You're right.

185
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,320
I was raised by dogs.

186
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,789
But you're raised by me.

187
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,090
We're going to see your grandfather.

188
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,510
Hurry up and change.
Come with me to the kennel.

189
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,240
No more talk.

190
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,390
This color is really tacky.

191
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,870
How can the most popular style be tacky?

192
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,680
Do you even know how much it costs,

193
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,840
and you call it tacky?

194
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,570
You're such a country bumpkin.

195
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,550
Once you put it on,
your value instantly changes.

196
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,510
In Shanghai nowadays,

197
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,220
who dares to wear this
without 100,000 in savings?

198
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,950
That'd be me.

199
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,180
After you put it on,

200
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,330
hurry up and earn back
the money for this suit.

201
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,450
I'm serious.

202
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,890
Say "welcome" to me. Let me hear it.

203
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,770
Welcome to hell.

204
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,030
Lead the way.

205
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,750
Let's go.

206
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,750
Good.

207
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,870
Very good.

208
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,460
Ye,

209
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,700
you've really come up with a great idea.

210
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,430
This is what we call
turning trash into treasure.

211
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,770
This idea

212
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,990
isn't just mine.

213
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,960
Jiuling deserves some credit too.

214
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,030
You

215
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,030
did alright.

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,720
Miss Ye,

217
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,150
please continue.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The current situation is

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,720
that the factory can no longer afford

220
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,630
the shelf rental fees
for these jeans in department stores.

221
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,790
So our next step

222
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,400
is to figure out
how to open up sales channels.

223
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,250
I know some dealers.

224
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,770
I'll give them a call.

225
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,240
They should have channels

226
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,370
to help us sell off this batch quickly.

227
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,960
I have another idea.

228
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,800
Let's set up a street stall.

229
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,200
I used to sell things
at street stalls all the time,

230
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,060
so I'm familiar with how it works.

231
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,000
We can sell at the Qipu Road Market.

232
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,060
There are lots of young people there,

233
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,390
so it'll be easier to sell our products.

234
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,080
Miss Ye,

235
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,680
you've come up with another great idea.

236
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,030
Oh my!

237
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,690
What was that?

238
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,800
You don't think Miss Ye's idea is good?

239
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,090
I shouldn't even bother with you two.

240
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,240
I shouldn't be giving you advice at all.

241
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,390
I talk too much.

242
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,320
I'll just watch your factory fail.

243
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,040
Jiuling,

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
don't be upset.

245
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,350
I know you've been working hard.

246
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,790
All these ideas

247
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,790
came from you too, right?

248
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,810
So tell me,

249
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
at Qipu Road,

250
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,430
what are the advantages
of setting up a stall there?

251
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,750
Setting up a stall at Qipu Road

252
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,360
has one major advantage:

253
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,180
there are many schools in that area,

254
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,310
and many schools means many students.

255
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,550
So this way, the whole...

256
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,080
Oh right.

257
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,440
I need to quickly call
some of my dealer friends.

258
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,700
You two keep chatting.

259
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,200
Later the teachers and students
will all come to buy.

260
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,030
It will form a stable customer base.

261
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,390
And also,

262
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,790
that area is already
a well-established market.

263
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,920
We'll pick the most central location.

264
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,670
We'll just put these...

265
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,080
Jiuling.

266
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,750
I left my cup in the office.

267
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm going to get some water.

268
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,510
We'll just put all these things

269
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,360
on display

270
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,440
and start promoting.

271
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,150
All these young people

272
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,270
will come flocking in.

273
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,670
We'll give them a discount then.

274
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,550
Students will bring each other,

275
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,150
one after another.

276
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,010
They'll just keep coming, right?

277
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,870
This Qipu Road Market

278
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,510
is definitely our best

279
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,110
place for setting up a stall.

280
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,040
Sales there are definitely
not less than in shopping malls.

281
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,630
These clothes are good.

282
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,320
The jeans are decent.

283
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,920
These jeans are pretty good.

284
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,080
They look quite trendy.

285
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,140
Want to take a look?

286
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,150
How much are they?

287
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,320
90 yuan each.

288
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,690
They're high-waisted
and make you look slimmer.

289
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,420
Give us a discount, Miss.

290
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,350
We're students.

291
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,400
85. I'll sell them to you for 85.

292
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,850
85.

293
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,960
How about 70?

294
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,630
I can't sell them for 70.

295
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,810
Take a good look. The fabric is excellent.

296
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,880
It's still too expensive.

297
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,260
Aren't they

298
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,190
the same as the ones I'm wearing?

299
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,740
Aren't they?

300
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,910
They're all distressed style.

301
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,000
Let me check the material.

302
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,270
This is quite soft

303
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:56,720
and stretchy.

304
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,250
These are exactly the same!

305
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,510
Miss, how much are these?

306
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,440
Mine are 90.

307
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,200
How much?

308
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,000
90.

309
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,600
That's so cheap!

310
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,440
I bought mine at the mall for 180.

311
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,600
Ma'am, you paid too much.

312
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,090
When did you buy them?

313
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,200
About a week ago.

314
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,240
If you'd bought them yesterday,

315
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
you could still return them.

316
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Don't worry.

317
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,150
I'll tell you what,

318
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,200
I'm going to return mine right now.

319
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't worry about it.

320
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,320
And save me a size 3 of these jeans.

321
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,910
For 90, right?

322
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,240
Sure thing!

323
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,550
Don't sell them to anyone else.

324
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,670
This is such a bargain!

325
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,930
I'll save them for you.

326
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,550
Miss.

327
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,220
Sis.

328
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,760
Will you still sell them for 85?

329
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Yes, 85.

330
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,740
Then I'll take one.

331
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,570
I'll take one.

332
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,600
If you like how it fits,

333
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,870
recommend it to your classmates

334
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,360
and bring them here to shop.

335
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,870
Alright, Sis.

336
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,500
I'll give you all a price of 85.

337
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,360
Thank you, Sis.

338
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,030
Here's your change.

339
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,760
Your change.

340
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,450
Welcome to come by.

341
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,450
Introduce us to your classmates.

342
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,940
Why are you back?

343
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,150
Why wouldn't I come back?

344
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm so thirsty.

345
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,200
You're comfortable standing here,

346
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,510
protected from wind and rain.

347
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,360
While I'm out in the blazing sun,

348
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,290
running back and forth like crazy.

349
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,440
Customers're coming.

350
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,670
How much are these jeans, Miss?

351
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,270
90.

352
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,270
I just bought these jeans.

353
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,870
I just got them from her shop.
Look, I'm wearing them.

354
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,080
Look at the elasticity.

355
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,670
It's perfect.

356
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,390
Wear these to the disco.

357
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,320
You'll look great.

358
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,230
If you both buy,

359
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,550
I'll charge 85 each.

360
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,600
How much? But I paid 90 for mine.

361
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,000
It's for two people buying together.

362
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,790
Okay, okay.

363
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,410
Next time you have to
sell to me for 85 too.

364
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,790
How many times have you counted it?

365
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,550
You're going to wear out the money.

366
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,880
Mind your own business.

367
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,880
I'll count my money
until my hands cramp up.

368
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,850
I'm happy. I want to.

369
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,720
I'm satisfied. I'm pleased.

370
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,980
I earned this money.
You have no say in it.

371
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,010
I've lost track of how much is here.

372
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,270
Look what you've done. You're annoying.

373
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,660
Go answer the door.

374
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,630
Who is it?

375
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,030
My father told me to tell Jiang Jiuling

376
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,230
that she has no shame.

377
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,170
Who was that?

378
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,160
That person said you had no shame.

379
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,910
Careful.

380
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,300
Miss Ye.

381
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,670
You've been working hard lately.

382
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,080
Not at all.

383
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,010
Let me toast you.

384
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,390
Recently,

385
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,720
I found a dealer from Beijing

386
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
named Yu Dacheng.

387
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,000
He has agreed

388
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,860
to take a large batch of our goods.

389
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,790
The unit price

390
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,390
is 65 per piece.

391
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,510
Is that acceptable to you?

392
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,300
That's too harsh. 65?

393
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,880
It's basically giving them our cost price.

394
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,240
Yes.

395
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,270
Then I'll talk to him again

396
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,630
to see if we can get 70.

397
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,630
Mr. Lu.

398
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,030
You don't need to
negotiate with him anymore.

399
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,080
Today, Jiuling and I set up a stall

400
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,080
and sold 50 pairs of jeans.

401
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,440
And we sold them for 85 to 90

402
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,220
per piece.

403
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,860
50 pairs?

404
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,240
We've decided to set up stalls

405
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,820
at various universities,

406
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,750
spending a week at each school

407
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,030
to sell everything within a few weeks.

408
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,270
Your skills are really impressive.

409
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,530
Let me toast you again.

410
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,840
On behalf of the company

411
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,960
and all of us,

412
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,230
thank you.

413
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Thank you.

414
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,670
I'll drink first to show my respect.

415
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,870
Please drink slowly.

416
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,819
Mr. Lu.

417
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,480
Jiuling is your relative,

418
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,270
isn't she?

419
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,579
She's my distant cousin.

420
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,400
Miss Ye.

421
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,880
Mr... Mr. Yan?

422
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,200
Mr. Lu, you're dining here too?

423
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,800
Beichuan.

424
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,640
Mr. Lu.

425
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,920
May we join you?

426
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,990
Mr. Yan has already sat down.

427
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,450
Beichuan, have a seat too.

428
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll pay for the meal today.

429
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,200
No need.

430
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,240
I'll pay.

431
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,520
Let me pay.

432
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,810
I insist on paying.

433
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,940
Then let Mr. Lu pay.

434
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,400
Let's thank Mr. Lu.

435
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,310
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

436
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,310
Don't mention it.

437
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,160
Beichuan.

438
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,270
Today

439
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,510
I'm mainly treating

440
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,640
Miss Ye.

441
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,070
Miss Ye

442
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,270
has made tremendous contributions
to our business.

443
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,790
What impressive thing

444
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,000
has Miss Ye done?

445
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,400
Miss Ye sold

446
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,090
50 pairs of jeans in just one day.

447
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,590
Let me tell you, at 50 pairs a day,

448
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,790
in less than 20 days

449
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,920
our entire inventory will be cleared.

450
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,550
Then my jeans

451
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,960
will definitely rot in the warehouse.

452
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,750
What should I do?

453
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,480
I can't ask Miss Ye

454
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,140
to help me sell my jeans, can I?

455
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,030
Beichuan.

456
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,450
Why don't you learn from Miss Ye?

457
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,720
See if you can sell 50 pairs a day.

458
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,790
You can't, can you?

459
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,410
Mr. Lu.

460
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,070
I really envy you.

461
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,180
Look,

462
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,520
you have someone like Miss Ye

463
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
who is not only beautiful

464
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,640
but also extremely capable.

465
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,570
Look at our guy here.

466
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,160
This one, when he's out there,

467
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,550
has extremely low emotional intelligence.

468
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,440
He's terrible at dealing with people.

469
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,780
Every matter he handles,

470
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,780
I end up having to clean up after him.

471
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,170
And internally,

472
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,720
those dog names I asked you to memorize,

473
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,120
have you learnt them all?

474
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,100
You definitely
haven't memorized them either.

475
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,200
Mr. Lu.

476
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,650
How about this?

477
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,690
Let Miss Ye work for me for a while.

478
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,750
Beichuan, why don't you
go work for Mr. Lu for a while?

479
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,680
Would that work?

480
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,960
No, that won't work.

481
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,240
Mr. Yan.

482
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,480
Beichuan is your classmate, right?

483
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,830
Yes, he's my classmate.

484
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,290
How can you talk
to your classmate like that?

485
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,110
Beichuan.

486
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,420
Your boss talks to you like this,

487
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,420
aren't you upset?

488
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,590
I'm not upset.

489
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,310
See?

490
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,550
Beichuan has such a good personality
and temper.

491
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,700
You have such a good employee.

492
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,030
You should be grateful.

493
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,200
Come on, drink up!

494
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,460
Well.

495
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,140
I was just joking.

496
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,480
Why are you taking it seriously?

497
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,160
I'll drink.

498
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,480
I'll drink, I'll drink.

499
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,080
Beichuan.

500
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:01,250
[Fuxingzhai]

501
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,270
Mr. Yan, we've arrived.

502
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,200
Mr. Yan?

503
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,270
Yan Jun.

504
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,760
Yan Jun, wake up.

505
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,590
Miss Ye.

506
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,790
Tonight

507
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,750
I won't escort you back to your room.

508
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,310
Are you drunk?

509
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,890
Let Xiang Beichuan take you back.

510
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,900
But

511
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,440
you need to be careful.

512
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,160
Xiang Beichuan is not a good person.

513
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,070
He was expelled from school

514
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,670
because he had inappropriate relationships

515
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,590
with female students.

516
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
He always crosses boundaries.

517
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,820
He took female students into the woods.

518
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,750
Stop talking nonsense, will you, bro?

519
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,440
Shut up.

520
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,070
Let him finish.

521
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,980
Look,

522
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,040
he looks quite honest.

523
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,510
That's what they call

524
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
"Appearances are deceptive.

525
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,160
A fair face may hide a foul heart."

526
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,590
He's just a hypocrite.

527
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,920
Our teacher, Mr. Zhong,

528
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,920
even called me

529
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,790
and asked me to mentor him.

530
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,380
I don't even know how many
female students he's done this with.

531
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,480
He is

532
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,920
nothing but a black sheep

533
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,670
of the teaching profession.

534
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,550
Let's go.

535
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,160
Quite impressive.

536
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,280
Why is this light broken again?

537
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,160
Miss Ye, be careful not to trip.

538
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,880
Let me help you.

539
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,960
Don't come near me.

540
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,350
I'm afraid you'll take advantage of me.

541
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,450
Why would I take advantage of you?

542
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,510
From what Mr. Yan said today,

543
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,760
staying with you

544
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,180
in this darkness

545
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,200
is dangerous.

546
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
Why do you believe him instead of me?

547
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,510
You can ask around at our school.

548
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,000
I've been an outstanding
teacher every year.

549
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,060
I won't ask around.

550
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,870
I only believe what Yan Jun said.

551
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,880
Then let me

552
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,350
describe to you

553
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,210
what actually happened that day.

554
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,780
I was preparing lessons in my office.

555
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,310
There was a very ordinary female student

556
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,400
who brought her essay for my feedback.

557
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,030
I even complimented her,

558
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,310
but she ran out with her assignment

559
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,650
crying as she went.

560
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,130
Why was she crying?

561
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,320
Did you put your arm around her?

562
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,440
I didn't put my arm around her.

563
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,310
You hugged her.

564
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,110
How could I possibly hug her?

565
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,920
Then you kissed her.

566
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,720
I really didn't kiss her.

567
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,440
She took her assignment
and walked out crying,

568
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,790
then told everyone at school

569
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,830
that I harassed her.

570
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,510
Who knows what you two did in that room?

571
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,120
Well,

572
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,290
the key point is

573
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,200
there was nobody else
in the office at that time.

574
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,260
Who are you people?

575
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,030
What are you two arguing about

576
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,440
in the middle of the night?

577
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,750
Whether you're fighting
or talking about divorce,

578
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,830
take it outside.

579
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,920
Don't do it here.

580
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,790
Sir, I'm sorry.

581
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,550
We're trying to sleep.

582
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,480
He's just like this.

583
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,590
He talks very loudly

584
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,680
and doesn't mind his behavior in public.

585
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,510
I'm sorry, Sir.

586
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,840
We disturbed your rest.

587
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,940
Excuse me.

588
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,720
Look.

589
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,110
What were we just talking about

590
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,110
that made him think we were married?

591
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
This is exactly the same

592
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,680
as what happened to me before.

593
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,880
I really couldn't explain myself.

594
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,030
Yu Dacheng, that dealer,

595
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,890
actually surprised me this time.

596
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,040
His offer is quite reasonable.

597
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,400
We'll sell him some jeans first

598
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,950
to get some cash back.

599
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,850
Then I'll find a way

600
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,660
to get a loan.

601
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,350
But...

602
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,920
When dealing with

603
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:51,960
Yu Dacheng,

604
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,490
we still need to be careful.

605
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,640
I'm sorry.

606
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,130
Got stuck in traffic and arrived late.

607
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,620
Ye.

608
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,170
What's that smell?

609
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,080
I didn't drink.

610
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,200
Jiuling.

611
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,330
Next time drink something
with higher alcohol content.

612
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,460
When you drink low-proof alcohol,

613
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,920
the smell lingers all day the next day.

614
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,450
39 proof is considered low?

615
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,850
What did you talk about this morning?

616
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,590
Mr. Lu said he met
an old friend this morning.

617
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,000
It was Mr. Chen from
Shanghai Silk Factory.

618
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,310
They have a batch
of sand-washed silk fabrics,

619
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,590
and we decided to buy all of them.

620
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,350
Ye,

621
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,500
don't tell her.

622
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,590
That's what she gets for being late.

623
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,810
Tell me about it.

624
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,550
Ye, don't listen to him.

625
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,920
Go on. So we're going to
buy them all, then what?

626
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,520
How are we going to sell them?

627
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,160
Fine, don't tell me then.

628
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,070
But I have one principle:

629
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,770
given our factory's current situation,

630
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,350
we can't increase expenses anymore.

631
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,550
We can only cut costs.

632
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,330
I need to freshen up.

633
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,150
I'm going to see Yan Jun.

634
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,100
Hey, Dummy.

635
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,110
Miss Ye.

636
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,040
What's up?

637
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I'm here to see Yan Jun.

638
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,930
I need to ask him something.

639
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,660
Yan Jun went out for business.

640
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,390
Is there anything I can tell him for you?

641
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,640
Didn't you mention before

642
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,000
that Yan Jun's company
and Ocean Department Store

643
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,200
had worked together?

644
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,510
Ocean Department Store

645
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,400
is having an anniversary celebration soon.

646
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,030
Our factory

647
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,400
is producing a batch of shirts.

648
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,880
We want to promote our products there.

649
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,070
Could he help us get in?

650
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,660
I heard him mention it.

651
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,750
He said the department store's
anniversary this year

652
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,150
will be on a larger scale.

653
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,340
They want to attract more businesses

654
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,160
and lower the entry requirements.

655
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,000
That's great!

656
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,110
We're interested and we'd be a good fit.

657
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,000
Sure, I'll let him know.

658
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,700
Great.

659
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,640
What are you looking at?

660
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,790
Smart pets?

661
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,640
You made this, right?

662
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,000
Not bad, Dummy.

663
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,920
You did a good job.

664
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,440
So many types of dogs.

665
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,200
Let me tell you something.

666
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,640
When you encounter something unpleasant

667
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,830
or troubling,

668
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,510
do you know what you should do?

669
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,440
What should I do?

670
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,440
Just talk to these dogs of yours.

671
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,400
And they'll answer you.

672
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,680
Miss Ye, are you hungry?

673
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,590
We have imported dog food here.

674
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,200
I could grab you a handful to snack on.

675
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,790
Who are you calling a dog?

676
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,470
No, that was just a joke.

677
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,920
By the way,

678
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
could you sometime

679
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,450
give me a photo of yourself?

680
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,440
What for?

681
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,720
To print on this.

682
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,700
You're still calling me a dog.

683
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,060
That was also a joke.

684
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,750
If you want to print me on this,

685
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,440
you'll have to pay me.

686
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,100
Deal.

687
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,030
Put me behind this Bichon.

688
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,440
Place my photo here?

689
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,640
Is that appropriate?

690
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,880
You're becoming naughty, Dummy.

691
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,400
No, no.

692
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,000
I just made two jokes.

693
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,790
You're quite fierce.

694
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,680
Do you have a favorite here?

695
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,160
So far, it might be...

696
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,480
Probably that big dog.

697
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,680
Then I'll put my photo on that one.

698
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,830
Sure, I'll save a spot for you.

699
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,780
You're actually taking me seriously.

700
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,970
Let me get you a soda.

701
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,720
The following outfits

702
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:36,980
[Ocean Department Store
1st Anniversary Fashion Show]

703
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,790
are newly designed
spun-silk sand-washed shirts

704
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,160
by Guoyao Garment Trading Company.

705
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,160
The fabric uses the latest technology.

706
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,510
Please enjoy the show. Let's welcome.

707
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,340
Miss Ye.

708
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,630
This is great!
Where did you find these models?

709
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,000
Was this your idea?

710
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,440
Of course.

711
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400
Mr. Yan, I need to thank you

712
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,440
for getting us
into Ocean Department Store.

713
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,840
I can't let you lose face.

714
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,010
This makes me look so good.

715
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,590
Mr. Lu.

716
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,950
This modeling team must cost a fortune.

717
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,270
Nothing ventured,

718
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,200
nothing gained.

719
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,890
Look how well this turned out.

720
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,590
Even if you venture, you still won't gain.

721
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,450
You're just throwing money away.

722
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,000
Stop running your mouth here.

723
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,200
Our money has already been

724
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,070
spent.

725
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,310
Just wish everyone the best.

726
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,050
When did I not wish everyone well?

727
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,580
I'm just worried about
the company's losses.

728
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,660
We had a meeting last time.

729
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,880
The meeting already made a decision.

730
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,480
We'll follow that decision.

731
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,920
I'm not going against the decision.

732
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,550
Aren't I sitting right here now?

733
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,350
Then get out.

734
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,250
Mr. Lu.

735
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,820
Look at the first row on the right.

736
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,510
Two men in black suits.

737
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,310
The one on the right

738
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,350
is Mr. Sun, the manager
from the foreign trade agency.

739
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,310
Next to him is a Hungarian businessman.

740
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,400
After the show ends,

741
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,590
let's talk to them.

742
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,400
Okay.

743
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,590
Miss Ye.

744
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,790
We still believe in you.

745
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,040
It's just this order...

746
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,790
I'm still a bit anxious about it.

747
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,040
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

748
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,850
I'll take care of it.

749
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,590
Take it easy.

750
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,160
Thank you, Ye.

751
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,440
Let's go.

752
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,300
Where is Mr. Yan?

753
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,590
This is our company business.
Why should he be here?

754
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,590
He's asking for the model's number.

755
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,230
You've got your eye on him?

756
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,040
Mr. Lu told you to talk less.

757
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
Stop chattering.

758
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,510
Hello. Nice to meet you.

759
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,110
Nice to meet you.

760
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,640
Hello.

761
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,970
Hi.

762
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,570
Please.

763
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,150
Thank you.

764
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,310
These shirts are part of
our company's new collection,

765
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,750
just showcased on the runway

766
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,200
by the models.

767
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,440
I wonder if you two are interested

768
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,310
in our shirts.

769
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,640
These shirts are the new styles
produced by their company.

770
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,770
Are you interested?

771
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,790
The fabric quality is excellent.

772
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,430
This lady is also beautiful.

773
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,650
I'm very interested.

774
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,470
Mr. Adam is very interested
in your shirts.

775
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,560
The facbric is great.

776
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,290
And you are very beautiful too.

777
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,210
Thank you for the compliment.

778
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,030
I'm glad you're interested in

779
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,960
our silk-spun sandwashed shirts.

780
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,400
Actually, this style

781
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,130
is very popular
in the American market right now.

782
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,230
These styles are popular
in Europe and America.

783
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,460
Can they produce them in large quantities?

784
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,210
Can you produce them in large quantities?

785
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,110
No problem at all.

786
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,830
No problem.

787
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,170
It depends on how many pieces you need

788
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,200
or what your budget is.

789
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,630
No problem. What's your budget?

790
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,480
I need shirts worth about $100,000.

791
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,370
Can you do that?

792
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,760
We need shirts totaling $100,000.

793
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,130
Can you handle that?

794
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,000
No problem.

795
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,030
Absolutely no problem.

796
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,720
Let's talk while we drink

797
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,050
and discuss your specific requirements.

798
00:31:59,220 --> 00:31:59,910
Hurry!

799
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,400
Let me do it.

800
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,400
Mr. Zhong.

801
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
Are the investigation results out?

802
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,000
The school still
cares about young teachers.

803
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,640
It's just a suspension without pay.

804
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,720
They didn't pursue
legal action against you.

805
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,450
They've been quite fair to you.

806
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,950
Suspension without pay?

807
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,680
Yes.

808
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,100
How many girlfriends do you have?

809
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,640
What do you mean?

810
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,830
The school received several anonymous
complaint letters

811
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,010
claiming you have romantic relationships
with multiple female students.

812
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,140
That's impossible.

813
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,080
This is absolutely a rumor.

814
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,920
I'm puzzled too.

815
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,110
Did you offend someone?

816
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,720
Beichuan is definitely
not that kind of person.

817
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,320
And how can anyone
believe anonymous letters?

818
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,360
Who wrote these anonymous letters?

819
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,510
How can someone be so cruel?

820
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,110
This is clearly defamation.

821
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,180
Have you ever been alone
with a female student

822
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,420
in a room?

823
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,880
Alone with a female student in a room?

824
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,600
Of course I have.

825
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,400
In our office,

826
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,480
in the reference room
of the school library.

827
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,680
I have to tutor female students
with their homework.

828
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,270
I can't just kick them out.

829
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,550
That's true.

830
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,920
I understand now, Beichuan.

831
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,400
I think this must be about Tong Tong.

832
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,450
I remember once
when I came back to the office,

833
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,250
I saw Tong Tong
running out of here crying.

834
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,590
Since then,

835
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,860
many students have been secretly

836
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,040
gossiping about you and Tong Tong.

837
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,110
Come in.

838
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Professor Xiang.

839
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,360
What's wrong, Tong Tong?

840
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,020
I have an article

841
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,730
that I'd like you to review.

842
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,350
Okay, leave it here.

843
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,550
I'll look at it later.

844
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,640
I'd like you to look at it now.

845
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,600
This is an article I want to submit
to the school newspaper.

846
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,750
I'd like your feedback.

847
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,510
It's not long,

848
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:13,889
just 5,000 words.

849
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,560
The beginning is well-written.

850
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,110
Could you please review all of it?

851
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,150
I feel that the middle part,

852
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,880
especially toward the end,

853
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,810
isn't quite satisfying to me.

854
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,989
Please give me
some suggestions for improvement.

855
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,810
Tong Tong, it's like this.

856
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,360
I have some work to finish right now.

857
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
When I'm done,

858
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,969
I'll take my time
to review it properly, okay?

859
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,170
Then you can continue with your work.

860
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,820
I'll read it aloud to you.

861
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,710
The youthful days,

862
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,360
with grassy playgrounds,

863
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,470
tree-lined paths, and classrooms

864
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,280
-Tong Tong.
-full of the scent of books…

865
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,910
Tong Tong.

866
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,480
I don't think you need to read it all.

867
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,540
I already told you,

868
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,230
once I finish my current work,

869
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,960
I'll review it properly later.

870
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,350
Professor Xiang, what's wrong with you?

871
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,480
I ask you to review it, but you won't.

872
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,080
I offer to read it,
but you don't want to listen.

873
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,920
What are you so busy with anyway?

874
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,850
As a teacher,

875
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,470
shouldn't your students
be your top priority?

876
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,150
Tong Tong.

877
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm not putting students second.

878
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,680
I really do have work
that needs to be done.

879
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,750
Don't you want me
to give you honest feedback?

880
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,670
I need to read it properly.

881
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,670
Professor Xiang.

882
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,840
Do you look down on me?

883
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,780
Do you think I can't write anything good?

884
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,070
I-I don't look down on you.

885
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,190
You're just one of my regular students.

886
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,440
Of course I treat you
the same as everyone else.

887
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,230
I don't care.

888
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,100
I want you to review it now.

889
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,640
Look, Tong Tong,

890
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,440
we can't be unreasonable like this, okay?

891
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,230
After I finish my current work,

892
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,590
I'll review it properly for you.

893
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,190
Okay?

894
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,050
Tong Tong,

895
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,160
well...

896
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,860
What's happening?

897
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,440
Mr. Guo.

898
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,150
Tong Tong,

899
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,480
what's going on?

900
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,840
Hello, Mr. Guo.

901
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
Goodbye, Mr. Guo.

902
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,040
What's wrong with Tong Tong?

903
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,720
I don't know.

904
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,550
She just suddenly got like this.

905
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,840
I saw she was crying.

906
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,960
It's baffling.

907
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,070
Mr. Zhong.

908
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,710
I'm really being wronged here.

909
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,740
And this situation...

910
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,280
It's really hard to explain.

911
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,480
We just resolved
the issue with Shang Yunfei.

912
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,680
And now another female student pops up.

913
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,480
Do you think there's something wrong
with how I interact with people?

914
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,280
Beichuan.

915
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,270
You absolutely don't need to
question your character.

916
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,150
There's definitely
nothing wrong with your conduct.

917
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:01,800
Mr. Zhong.

918
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,190
I must speak up
about this matter with Beichuan.

919
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,030
Otherwise, let's go see
the principal right now.

920
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,840
We'll explain everything clearly to him.

921
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,760
Going to the principal will only backfire.

922
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,070
Is this something to celebrate?

923
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,800
Besides,

924
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,660
do you want to drag
the students into this too?

925
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,690
Look,

926
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,400
go home and calm down first.

927
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,920
Let the department figure out a solution.

928
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,440
Yes, Beichuan,

929
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,750
listen to Mr. Zhong.

930
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,460
Go home and collect yourself.

931
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,400
Mr. Zhong,

932
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,000
none of us have classes tomorrow morning.

933
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,760
Let's gather all the faculty
from our department tomorrow morning.

934
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,440
We can discuss this together

935
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,320
and find a solution for Beichuan.

936
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,960
Alright.

937
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,320
Fine.

938
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:42,940
Beichuan,

939
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,120
relax. It's going to be okay.

940
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,760
I'll investigate thoroughly these days

941
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,220
to find out who's so malicious
to write that anonymous letter.

942
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,280
Ye.

943
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,970
What a beautiful bouquet.

944
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,210
Which boyfriend gave it to you?

945
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,520
I don't have that many boyfriends.

946
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,230
I'm just kidding.

947
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,070
It's from me.

948
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,870
Do you like it?

949
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,800
I love it.

950
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,130
It's really beautiful.

951
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,360
About the order,

952
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,290
the foreign clients are very interested.

953
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,690
I want to thank you
on behalf of the company.

954
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,580
It's my job.

955
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:31,830
By the way,

956
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,180
you need to make a trip to customs.

957
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,290
We have a shipment of cashmere sweaters,

958
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,150
but they returned our declaration form.

959
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,250
But Mr. Lu, about the customs matter,

960
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,880
didn't you always
handle that yourself before?

961
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,840
Not this time.

962
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,190
You'll have to step in.

963
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm not very familiar with it.

964
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,800
They have a new section chief,

965
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,930
named Shan Huajing.

966
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,690
Shan Hua...

967
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,840
She's your schoolmate, right?

968
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,400
Yes, she was my senior at school.

969
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,000
Exactly.

970
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,000
So it's all up to you now.

971
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,550
Alright, I'll go talk to her.

972
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,760
Thank you for making the trip.

973
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,420
No problem.

974
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,620
Mr. Lu, thank you for the flowers.

975
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,600
You're welcome.

976
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,340
I'll be going then.

977
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,260
Thanks for your hard work.

978
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,290
Hello, I'd like to register.

979
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,360
Miss Ye.

980
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,590
Beichuan, you're here
for customs declaration too?

981
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,720
Yan Jun sent me here.

982
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,590
Who are you looking for?

983
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,590
He told me to find
a section chief surnamed Shan.

984
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,630
I'm also looking for Section Chief Shan.

985
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,290
She was my senior from school.

986
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,170
Then your paperwork

987
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,070
should go through smoothly, right?

988
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:41,800
I hope so.

989
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,760
Don't be nervous when you go in.

990
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,620
Just have a good chat.

991
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,550
I'm not nervous.

992
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,530
It's your turn.

993
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
You should go now.

994
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,320
Miss Ye, why don't you go first?

995
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
I'm not in a hurry.

996
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,480
Ladies first, after all.

997
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,030
Alright.

998
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,480
That's quite gentlemanly of you.

999
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,340
I'll go in then.

1000
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,400
Come in.

1001
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,360
Senior.

1002
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,640
Please call me Section Chief Shan.

1003
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,250
Have a seat.

1004
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,280
Section Chief Shan.

1005
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,800
My apologies. I addressed you as "senior"

1006
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,230
since we are fellow alumni.

1007
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,230
We went to the same school.

1008
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,090
I graduated a few years after you.

1009
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,120
What business are you here for?

1010
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,960
Lu Guoyao, Mr. Lu.

1011
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,090
You know him, right?

1012
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,510
The name sounds familiar.

1013
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,050
But I don't know him personally.

1014
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,110
What's this about?

1015
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,670
These are our company's
customs declaration forms.

1016
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,730
Please take a look.

1017
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,510
Fine, just leave them there.

1018
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,920
Mr. Lu really trusts you.

1019
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,710
Before I came,
he specifically instructed me

1020
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,920
to seek your guidance and advice.

1021
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,480
This shipment is extremely important
for our company.

1022
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,590
Which company doesn't think
their shipment is important?

1023
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,400
Right.

1024
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,010
Mainly because we're a private enterprise.

1025
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,870
Private businesses
are struggling to survive.

1026
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,200
In particular, Mr. Lu.

1027
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,070
He has a background
in a state-owned enterprise.

1028
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,690
Now he has to take on

1029
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,130
the survival issues of laid-off workers.

1030
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,050
So it's really difficult for him.

1031
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,070
Section Chief Shan, this shipment of ours

1032
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,020
has already been delayed for some time.

1033
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,710
We can't afford any more delays.

1034
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,570
So

1035
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,800
I hope you can give us
some special consideration.

1036
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,800
Special consideration?

1037
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,440
What kind of consideration?

1038
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,640
That's not what I meant.

1039
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,840
What do you mean then?

1040
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,330
Is there anything else?

1041
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,960
Next!

1042
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,770
Okay, I'll head out first.

1043
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,510
Hello.

1044
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,790
Yan Jun sent you here?

1045
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,970
Yan Jun and I were college classmates.

1046
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,330
[Admission Notice for New Students,
Shanghai Shude High School]

1047
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,070
Alright.

1048
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,280
Go back and tell Mr. Yan

1049
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,990
I've received the documents.

1050
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,960
About this matter, give me two days.

1051
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,630
It should be done in about two days.

1052
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,170
Okay.

1053
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,300
I'll be going then.

1054
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:33,890
Okay.

1055
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,520
Thank you.

1056
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,820
Why did you come out so quickly?

1057
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,070
Section Chief Shan is
difficult to talk to, isn't she?

1058
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,000
She's easy to talk to.

1059
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,550
So what did you tell her?

1060
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,700
I didn't really...

1061
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,380
I told her I was
Yan Jun's college classmate.

1062
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,190
She said okay
and that she'd take care of it.

1063
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,190
Then she let me go.

1064
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,880
Well, you can go back first.

1065
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,540
I'm going to wait here
a bit longer for my senior.

1066
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,190
Okay, I'll head out then.
