00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,009
You said I'm treating, right?

6
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,590
I'd like scrambled eggs with tomato

7
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,470
and some twice-cooked pork.

8
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,070
Okay.

9
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,050
Okay, thanks.

10
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,710
So this thing's called a computer, huh?

11
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,760
I bought it 6 months ago.

12
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,960
No one's ever used it.

13
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,050
Alright, Professor Xiang.

14
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,990
What brings you here today?

15
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,710
Let's talk.

16
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,470
You set your office here.

17
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,940
Aren't you afraid of bad luck?

18
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,150
Business depends on brains,

Besides,

21
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,829
when I rented this place,

22
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,829
that incident hadn't happened yet.

23
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,940
No, seriously—tell me the truth.

With so many fancy
office buildings around,

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,930
why'd you pick this one?

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,980
Fei had his accident here.

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,520
Doesn't that bother you?

28
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,040
I used to be a scholar too.

29
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,710
I need a cultural atmosphere.

30
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,710
When you entered this room,

31
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,640
didn't you feel the cultural vibe?

32
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,800
I didn't smell any culture.

33
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,140
But I did smell dog.

34
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,030
Your nose is sharper than a dog's.

35
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,290
There actually is one, believe it or not.

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,550

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:16,840
how are things?

40
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,170
What are your plans now?

41
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,520
I don't know what to do.

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,200
Normally,

43
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,700
I could go to

44
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,680

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,690
a magazine,

46
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,110
or a research institute.

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,870
You were a prominent reporter.

00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,570
You know a lot of people.

49
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,690
Give me some advice, will you?

50
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,800
The idea that mindset determines destiny

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,360
is absolutely true.

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,240
Do you realize

00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,190
everywhere's downsizing these days?

54
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,680
So, Professor Xiang,

55
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,470
have you won a Nobel Prize?

56
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,750
Or do you have some patented invention?

57
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,000
You have neither.

58
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,030
All you can do is writing.

59
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,710
Is that worth anything nowadays?

60
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,560
Not at all.

61
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,890
And you know what,

62
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,120
recently,

63
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,910
a friend of mine who works

64
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,430
at the Ministry of Education told me,

65
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,630
a new policy is about to be implemented.

66
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,840
After it takes effect,

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,800
college graduates
won't be assigned jobs anymore.

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,730
Do you understand what that means?

69
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,270
To enter any government
agency or institution,

70
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,270
you'll have to
take exams yourself.

71
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,370
Someone like me, Yan Jun,

72
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,670
who's got some influence, right?

73
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,579
It's useless.

74
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,750
So you're telling me
a university lecturer like me...

75
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,940
really has no way out?

76
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,860
That's the reality for you right now.

77
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,990
What did you expect?

78
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,310
Chuan,

79
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,980
I've told you before,

80
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,920
you need to adapt to
the trends of this era.

81
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,630
You need to keep up with the times.

82
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,600
Shift your mindset.

83
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,460
Think about it.

84
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,880
What do you mean?

85
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,080
To go into business like you?

86
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,950
Why not?

87
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,190
But I don't know how.

88
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,870
I'll teach you.

89
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,330
Our company is hiring right now.

90
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,070
But Chuan, if you join,

91
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,240
I'm not making you my employee.

92
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,240
The two of us would be partners.

93
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,730
I'm offering you
the position of Creative Director.

94
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,170
And the salary will be...

95
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,110
2,000 yuan.

96
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,380
After all these years as friends

97
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,150
and classmates,

98
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,680
I'm being generous, right?

99
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,870
Now it's up to you.

100
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,220
What do you say?

101
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,820
Doesn't your company sell dogs?

102
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,790
Why do you need a Creative Director?

103
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,190
We can be creative with dogs too.

104
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,770
Where do these dogs

105
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,159
come from?

106
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,760
What's their pedigree?

107
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,190
Why are they worth that much money?

108
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,830
Someone's got to tell that story.

109
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,480
That's where you come in.

110
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,560
I see.

111
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,870
So at future class reunions,

112
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,950
those of us who stayed at the university

113
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,010
can say we're supported by the state,

114
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,680
while you can only say

115
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,370
you're supported by dogs.

116
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,510
You know what,

117
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,830
my neighbor used to have
this exact same dog.

118
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,690
It actually looked a bit like you.

119
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,990
Mainly because you both bark a lot,

120
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,190
and honestly, you two even sound alike.

121
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,760
Xiang Beichuan,

122
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,090
what you're saying right now

123
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,480
only proves—
you can't have it, so you mock it.

124
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,200
It just shows you're jealous of my money.

125
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,500
Do you think your words
can hurt me at all?

126
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,330
Can you stop me from making money?

127
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,120
Can you?

128
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
Since you can't,

129
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,800
why keep saying these things?

130
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,560
It never ends.

131
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
Always poking where it hurts.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,420
Just...

133
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,480
speaking without any boundaries.

134
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,470
Is this how you treat people?

135
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,270
Is this what being educated means to you?

What's wrong with you?

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
Why are you actually getting mad?

140
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,680
I...

141
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
Shouldn't I be mad?

142
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
Shouldn't I be?

143
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,600
If you were a dog, wouldn't you be mad?

144
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,390
Well, I...

145
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,790
I was just stating facts.

146

Your current problem

150

is because of what happened with Fei,

you owe the university a lot of money,

00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:06,970
right?

153
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,390
From your 2,000 yuan salary each month,

154
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,040
I'll deduct part to repay the university.

155
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,120
You can keep the rest.

156
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,320
What will your job be?

157

you'll also need to take their photos.

Before taking photos

162
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,870
you need to wash it thoroughly.

163
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,980
The fur must be shiny

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,120
and have texture.

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,950

That's the standard. Got it?

that I can't find a writing job.

What about me?

193
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,790
The bureau has decided

194
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,790
to give you a verbal warning

195
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,680
without putting it in your record.

196
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,020
Your file will be transferred
to the talent exchange center.

Director Jin,

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,790
I didn't do anything wrong.

199
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,750
I was just fulfilling

speak to the leadership for me?

we can offer you.

You should appreciate it.

207
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,210
My file being transferred
to the talent exchange center,

208
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,340
what does that mean?

209
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,650
Does it mean

210
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,090
I have to find a new job?

211
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,700
It means your employment
is no longer with the Textile Bureau.

I was quite interested by what you said.

250
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,790

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,200
what position could I take?

252
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
That depends on what you want.

270
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,090
you'll accompany the boss to fancy places,

271
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,510
broaden your horizons and see the world.

272
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,510
Isn't that great?

273
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,010
What's so good about that?

274
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,960
What if some big boss
takes a liking to you?

275
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,160
Wouldn't that be a shortcut to success?

276
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,360
Is this how you

277
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,980
recruit all your employees?

278
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,190
Yeah.

279
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,360
If the boss is happy,

280
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,870
then I've done my job.

281
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,840
Then this job really
isn't suitable for me.

282
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,750
It's hard to get by these days.

283
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,840
Why don't you reconsider?

284
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,170
I'll go look elsewhere.

285
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,930

292
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
I'm also looking for a job.

293
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,450
Didn't I tell you last time?

294
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,650
It's not optimistic.

295
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,860
So, have you found one?

296
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
Not yet.

297
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,470
Did you offend someone?

298
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,910
There's a guy behind you staring at you

299
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,790
and smirking.

300
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,890
You know him?

301
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,870
Professor Xiang,

302
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,670
I've been watching you.

303
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,790
You've been to 7 or 8 places.

304
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,830
How does it feel to be refused repeatedly?

305
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,710
Cut the crap.

306
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,250
Get me a soda quickly.

307
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,350
I'm dying of thirst.

308
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,240
When you left my place,

309
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,150
didn't you take a bunch?

310
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,200
I finished them.

311
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,080
Hurry up.

312
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,510

313
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
I want a new one.

314
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,130

315
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,060
have a soda.

316
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:22,980
Thank you.

317
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,480
You're here job-hunting too?

318
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,200
Yes, I am.

319
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,900
Let me introduce myself.

320
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,030
Xiang Beichuan and I
were college classmates.

321
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,630
Hello.

322
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,380
Hello.

323
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,490
Although we were classmates,

324
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,420
there are differences between us.

325
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,190
I'm the boss of this company.

326
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,470
I'm here today

327
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,870
to recruit people,

328
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,120
while he's here

329
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,140
to apply for a job.

330
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,840
But he does have his strengths.

331
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,480
For example, when we were in school,

332
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,370
his grades were slightly better than mine.

333
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,300
Other than that,

334
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,400
I'm probably better than him
in everything else.

335
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,670
Our company

336
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,550
is a foreign trade business.

337
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,550
We deal with light industrial
imports and exports

338
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,000
and also some pet trade.

339
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,140
We currently need a secretary.

340
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,860
Are you interested, miss?

341
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,650
Secretary?

342
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,670
Does that mean
I'd have to accompany the boss

343
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,360
for meals, drinks,
and business entertainment?

344
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,150
Can you hold your liquor?

345
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,320
I can't drink much.

346
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,760
I get rowdy and talk nonsense

347
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,960
when I drink too much.

348
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,240
Beichuan, see you.

349
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,100
I'm leaving now.

350
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,160
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

351
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,040
What?

352
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,290
What are you doing?

353
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,700
You can't take your eyes
off a pretty girl, can you?

354
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,960
Bros before hoes, man.

355
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,000
Let me ask you something.

356
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,510
In that company of yours,

357
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,320
besides me,

358
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,630
is there anyone else?

359
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,000
You need a secretary?

360
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,100
I think what you need isn't a secretary,

361
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,250
but a girlfriend.

362
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,270
Come on.

363
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,840
Don't you think that girl

364
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,150
is really pretty?

365
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,200
Long hair,

366
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,280
big curls,

367
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,140
fair skin—

368
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,600
I can't help staring
when I see girls like that.

369
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,270
Hurry up and get me a soda.

370
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,200
You hear me?

371
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,240
Get me a new one.

372
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
She hasn't had a sip. I was watching.

373
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,500
How does that girl have
such perfect teeth?

374
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,150
Miss Ye.

375
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,030
Mr. Lu.

376
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,910
Let's go.

377
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,840
Let's sit down somewhere.

378
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,120
I'll buy you a coffee.

379
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,020
Sure.

380
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,580
Let's go.

381
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,650
Watch your step.

382
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,690
Come.

383
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,060
Let me do it.

384
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,830
Don't worry, it won't spill.

385
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,490
Have a seat.

386
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,790
Thanks.

387
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,910
Miss Ye,

388
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,790
long time no see.

389
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,840
It's been a while.

390
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,200
Didn't expect to run into you today.

391
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,750
Yes.

392
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,350
I'm so happy to see you today.

393
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,650
Let me update you.

394
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,270
Our state-owned factory

395
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,310
eventually went bankrupt.

396
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,320
But I took out a loan

397
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,320
and bought the factory back.

398
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,960
Together with our workers,

399
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,490
we're doing quite well now.

400
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,020
Since I ran into you today,

401
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,080
I'd like to invite you to our company.

402
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,250
Let's make it bigger

403
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,650
and stronger together.

404
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,270
Mr. Lu,

405
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,600
there's something you might not know.

406
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,750
I've just been fired from my job.

407
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,970
And do you know what
they're saying about me?

408
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,550
They're all saying I neglected my duties.

409
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,400
Right now I've got
no government resources, no connections.

410
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,150
I can't help you with anything anymore.

411
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,320
I heard about it.

412
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,410
It wasn't your fault.

413
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,390
You were wronged.

414
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,800
Those leaders of yours are just idiots.

415
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,400
But it's still a big impact.

416
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,320
Yes.

417
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,480
I used to work in the system too.

418
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,750
I really understand how you feel.

419
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,610
Suddenly losing your secure job,

420
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,740
you must feel

421
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,819
wronged

422
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,710
and lost.

423
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,640
So we're planning

424
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,430
to invite you to our company.

425
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,190
2,000 yuan per month

426
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
plus commission.

427
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
What do you think?

428
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,400
That's too much. I...

429
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,660
What would I even

430
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,609
do there?

431
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,630
It's not too much.

432
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:26,890
Well,

433
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,590
back when

434
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,350
our factory was

435
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,330
going through its toughest times,

436
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,410
you were the one

437
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,030
who helped us out.

438
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,550
All of us remember your kindness.

439
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,080
No, Mr. Lu,

440
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,030
I really appreciate your invitation

441
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,710
and

442
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,770
offering me 2,000 yuan per month.

443
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,440
But if this is the reason,

444
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,200
if you want to

445
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,130
help me when I'm at my lowest point,

446
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,750
I think it's really unfair to you,

447
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,480
and I don't accept this kind of pity.

448
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,240
No, no, no.

449
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,540
I must have explained it poorly.

450
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,750
We actually value

451
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,730
your professional skills, Miss Ye.

452
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,100
We've seen it.

453
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
You majored

454
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,630
in foreign languages, right?

455
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,430
Yes.

456
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,480
Our company is now

457
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,240
about to expand into international trade.

458
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,480
Foreign language talents
are exactly what we need most.

459
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,790
Look at you, you're beautiful,

460
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,110
aren't you?

461
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,790
And you have excellent
interpersonal skills.

462
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,640
If you join our company,

463
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,970
you'll definitely be like a fish in water.

464
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,010
Alright.

465
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,770
Then I'll...

466
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll think about it.

467
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,480
Good.

468
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,610
Then it's settled for now.

469
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,070
I haven't decided yet.

470
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,640
Cheers.

471
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,170
Here. Tissues.

472
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,680
It's so hot!

473
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,900
Based on your accommodation requirements,

474
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,340
the room doesn't need to be big,

475
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,650
close to the company,

476
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,140
and preferably rent-free.

477
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,590
I think you'll definitely

478
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,550
like this place.

479
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,560
Are we there?

480
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,450
Yes.

481
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,500
Our company is just
around the corner to the right.

482
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,360
So convenient.

483
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,380
A hair salon?

484
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,030
Wait,

485
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,350
they're still open for business.

486
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,350
It's not appropriate
for me to live here, is it?

487
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,950
They operate during the day.

488
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,790
So you mean

489
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,410
during the day I work at your company,

490
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,880
and at night after they close,

491
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,750
I live here?

492
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,420
Try laying that chair flat.

493
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,640
It's very comfy to lie on. I've tried it.

494
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,110
Try it.

495
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,000
This...

496
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,440
Mr. Su.

497
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,000
Mr. Yan.

498
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,880
He's the owner.

499
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,350
Hello.

500
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:52,960
Hello.

501
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,200
Hello.

502
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,090
When your hair's long,
he can cut it for you.

503
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:55,630
Anytime.

504
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,200
Anytime.

505
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,980
Go try it.

506
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,160
Try it.

507
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,960
Busy?

508
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,270
Please go on.

509
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,050
Alright.

510
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,240
Your shop is quite spacious.

511
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,190
It's okay.

512
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,140
Just a small one.

513
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,000
Idiot.

514
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,030
Idiot.

515
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,350
This way.

516
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,470
This place is our company's warehouse.

517
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,710
But the good point is

518
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,270
it's quiet at night.

519
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,270
You said you wanted to write, right?

520
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,750
And if you need

521
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,350
anything else,

522
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:42,960
just...

523
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,160
just let me know.

524
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,040
Is this place

525
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,920
okay with you?

526
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,780
Yes.

527
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,760
This place is better than over there.

528
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,640
And you helped me pay back

529
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,480
that 60,000 yuan to the university.

530
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,810
I still owe you for that.

531
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,240
The bed and desk you mentioned

532
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,000
are all here.

533
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,310
If you get hot,

534
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,240
there's a fan.

535
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,680
Try it out.

536
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,550
It might not work well.

537
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,290
If it shorts out,

538
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,030
stop using it immediately.

539
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,830
Tell me and I'll buy you a new one.

540
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,320
As for the rest...

541
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Let me help you tidy up.

542
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,030
No need.

543
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,060
Really, don't bother.

544
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,590
You go ahead with your work.

545
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,950
Alright then,
I'll head back to the office.

546
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,830
You can manage on your own.

547
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,090
Thanks a lot.

548
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,830
I've signed in downstairs.

549
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,000
[Shanghai Textile Industry Bureau]

550
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,400
I'm here to get my things.

551
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,270
Xining,

552
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,810
you're leaving today?

553
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,660
What a pity.

554
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,310
Look, for ordinary things
worth a hundred or so,

555
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,270
you're always so precise
with the accounts.

556
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,350
But when it comes to Huang Yahui,

557
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,880
you suddenly got confused?

558
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,160
Ms. Wang,

559
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,960
that American jeans agent
you mentioned last time,

560
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,830
what was the name?

561
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,790
S... what?

562
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,740
What's up?

563
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,150
Director Jin has his eye
on the 5,000-piece

564
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,640
premium jeans order.

565
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,280
Have you followed up on that?

566
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,790
His terms are too harsh.

567
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,400
We need to negotiate with him further.

568
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,930
All the materials are here.

569
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,270
Get on it.

570
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:42,960
I know.

571
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,440
By the way,

572
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,680
don't you also think now

573
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,570
that Huang Yahui is pretty disgusting?

574
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,070
You were always so good to her,

575
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,470
yet she still harmed you.

576
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,190
She's truly heartless.

577
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,590
When you're out in the society,

578
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,250
you better be more careful
when judging people.

579
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,960
Sis.

580
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,430
I heard you got divorced recently.

581
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,730
So you should also be more careful

582
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,460
when judging men in the future.

583
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,640
What did you say?

584
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,110
I'm only saying this for your own good.

585
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,110
I'm only saying it for your good too.

586
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,720
[Mingde Western Restaurant]

587
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,680
Miss Ye.

588
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,350
Let me pay for the coffee.

589
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,410
I've already paid.

590
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,350
That's too kind of you.

591
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,550
I should give you the money.

592
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,350
No need.

593
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,320
I came here to tell you about

594
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,750
a big deal that could make us both rich.

595
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,090
Let's hear it then.

596
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,310
Let me ask you something first.

597
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,270
Has your textile factory

598
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,790
ever produced jeans?

599
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,070
Of course we have.

600
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,390
Our factory is well known

601
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,030
in the industry
for keeping the pre-shrinkage rate

602
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,590
firmly controlled

603
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,930
within 2.5%.

604
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,670
Let me put it this way.

605
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,880
We have 20

606
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,790
German-made rapier looms.

607
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,720
Rapier looms?

608
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,350
Yes,

609
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,240
and also

610
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,880
the latest imported
Japanese sewing machines.

611
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,710
That's good.

612
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,590
Those conditions are suitable.

613
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,200
Today when I went back
to the Textile Bureau

614
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,470
to pack up my belongings,

615
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,440
accidentally,

616
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,920
I just

617
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,020
happened to

618
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,570
overhear some business information.

619
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,740
What information?

620
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,350
Well...

621
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,720
Tell me.

622
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,480
Maybe I shouldn't say.

623
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,440
Tell me.

624
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,350
If I tell...

625
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,410
Just say it boldly.

626
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,870
I'd rather not say.

627
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,070
Miss Ye,

628
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,300
don't be like this.

629
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,150
You can't just tell half the story

630
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,350
and leave me hanging.

631
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,110
Well, it's mainly because

632
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,550
this is something someone else said.

633
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,200
I heard it from someone else.

634
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,030
Was it from

635
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,240
Director Tian

636
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,400
or Director Jin?

637
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,480
Neither of them.

638
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,550
Then who?

639
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,920
Wang Li.

640
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,270
Wang Li? That Li?

641
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,050
Keep your voice down.

642
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,970
Let me tell you,

643
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,400
she's the worst of them all.

644
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,070
She's two-faced,

645
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,560
always trying to trip us up.

646
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,360
Really?

647
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,510
She's absolutely unforgivable,

648
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,960
the most wicked person ever.

649
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,090
In your department,

650
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,770
there's her

651
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,750
and Director Jin.

652
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,830
These two are the absolute worst.

653
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,760
I'm telling you.

654
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,800
They make me so angry.

655
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,000
Calm down, calm down.

656
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,600
I didn't know it was this serious.

657
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,880
So would you say
that by telling you this now,

658
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,540
I'm avenging the bad person
on behalf of the people?

659
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,350
Avenge her.

660
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:16,770
Okay.

661
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,120
It's like this.

662
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,670
Our Textile Bureau

663
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,720
has been in contact with an American

664
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,380
jeans manufacturer's agent.

665
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,470
We're finding them a contract factory.

666
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,360
This time they've made

667
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,530
a huge request.

668
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,780
They want to produce in one go

669
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,140
this many.

670
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,320
500?

671
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,070
5,000 pairs.

672
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,350
Wow, 5,000 pairs!

673
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,460
We're going to be rich!

674
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,050
You're really our God of Wealth!

675
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,880
Goddess of Wealth.

676
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,480
Goddess.

677
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,440
Goddess of Wealth, indeed!

678
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,570
Only if it works out.

679
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,900
You will be when it works out,

680
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,120
and even if it doesn't, you still are.

681
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,480
This big business of yours!

682
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,960
Then I'll treat you
to coffee every day after that.

683
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,550
No, no, no.

684
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,640
When that happens,
I'll be the one treating.

685
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,970
The coffee will be on me.

686
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,350
Then I need to hurry
and secure this agent.

687
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,020
Alright.

688
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,310
Wait for my good news.

689
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,070
Okay, okay.

690
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,290
I'll go first.

691
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,750
Miss Ye,

692
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,200
you don't have a place to stay yet, right?

693
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,440
Let's go to the company.

694
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,750
The company has staff dormitories.

695
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,550
Staff dormitories?

696
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,240
Let's go.

697
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:14,800
Let's go.

698
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,200
Come on.

699
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,790
Give it to me.

700
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,740
No need. It's fine. I'll do it.

701
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,500
You lead the way.

702
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:17,960
Let's go.

703
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,490
Let's go.

704
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,280
Let me do it.

705
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,570
My stuff is a bit heavy.

706
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,830
Careful.

707
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:29,800
Let's go.

708
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,480
Let's go.

709
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,400
Please.

710
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,380
This used to be
Huang Yahui's marital home.

711
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,370
I rented it a few days ago

712
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,230
and turned it into an office.

713
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,150
Please come in.

714
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,370
Huang Yahui had poor fortune.

715
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,770
She couldn't handle it.

716
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,830
You're different.

717
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,750
I feel that you and this apartment

718
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,150
have compatible energy.

719
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,200
I've also heard

720
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,990
that the women who lived here before

721
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,190
were all remarkable.

722
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,440
Except Huang Yahui.

723
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,270
Actually,

724
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,240
she never really lived here.

725
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,270
I know all the women

726
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,260
who lived here.

727
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,910
That's why

728
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,770
I think you and this place
truly have compatible energy.

729
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:17,930
Please.

730
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,790
You can

731
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,240
work outside

732
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,960
and live inside.

733
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,870
This is a suite
with inner and outer rooms.

734
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,430
Why are there two beds?

735
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,160
Our company

736
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,530
is still quite small

737
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,830
and we can't afford

738
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,430
private rooms for everyone.

739
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,130
To be honest,

740
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,370
it's only because Huang Yahui ran off

741
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,310
that the landlord offered a discount

742
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,770
and thus I could afford it.

743
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,720
Mr. Lu,

744
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,030
but I haven't secured the order yet.

745
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,830
Yet I...

746
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,720
Yet I...

747
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
It's fine.

748
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,970
Just make yourself at home.

749
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:52,750
Come on.

750
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,830
Get yourself settled in.

751
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,350
Okay.

752
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,050
Goodbye.

753
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,280
Take care.

754
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,200
Goodbye.

755
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,000
Grandma.

756
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,440
I'm now in the room where you once lived.

757
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,280
Xiang Beichuan?

758
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,800
What are you doing here?

759
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,600
Miss Ye.

760
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,830
Yan Jun's company is right next door.

761
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,360
I live in the room opposite.

762
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,360
So you went to work for Yan Jun?

763
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,910
I finally accepted his offer.

764
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,500
What about you?

765
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,590
I found a job too.

766
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,510
I work here

767
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,530
and live inside.

768
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,160
So we're neighbors now,

769
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,310
living quite close.

770
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,100
We can see each other every day.

771
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,110
Indeed.

772
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,560
Are you feeling awkward?

773
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,690
Or a bit

774
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,590

775
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,960
No.

776
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,870
Why did you come to this room?

777
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,300
I just had a sudden urge to come see it.

778
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,110
Mainly to...

779
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,350
Pay my respects to

780
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,250
the place that changed my fate.

781
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,200
You Chinese literature majors
are so dramatic.

782
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,270
"Pay respects"?

783
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,920
Did you bring a wreath?

784
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,730
No.

785
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,110
This place is unlucky enough as it is.

786
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,310
I'm a materialist.

I'm living here. So what?

788
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,720
I don't believe in that nonsense.

789
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,290
Let's go in and take a look.

790
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,410
You live here now.
Is it okay if I come in?

791
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,610
It's broad daylight.

792
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,850
What can you do to me?

793
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,340
Come on.

794
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,980
Do you think your friend Shang Yunfei

795
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,840
deliberately wanted to harm you?

796
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,270
Well...

797
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,200
If I judge his motives by the results,

798
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,350
then I think he probably did.

799
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,860
But this also indirectly proves

800
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,550
that I'm truly a complete idiot.

801
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,450
What about you?

802
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,760
Do you think Huang Yahui

803
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,090
deliberately hurt you?

804
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,040
I definitely don't think so.

805
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,440
I've always felt Yahui was a victim.

806
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,110
She just loved that man too much

807
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,510
and got lost in love.

808
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,500
That's why

809
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,160
a woman should never

810
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,550
entrust her fate

811
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,680
to love.

812
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,210
True.

813
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,030
Men shouldn't entrust their fate

814
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,000
to love either.

815
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:43,850
By the way,

816
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,880
do you know which bed
Huang Yahui used to sleep in?

817
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:47,760
This one.

818
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,920
Why?

819
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,160
What are you doing?

820
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,200
You...

821
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,030
Didn't you just say

822
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,550
I should pay my respects?

823
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,480
Isn't this part of the necessary ritual?

I'm still alive!

825
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,550

bowing like that.

827

Just get out of here.

Bowing like that in broad daylight

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,220
is really terrifying.

00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,280
Mr. Li.

950
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,610
What are you doing here?

951
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,320
About that order for premium jeans

952
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,840
that you want to produce,

953
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,200
I'd like to have a proper talk with you.

954
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,240
Let's talk in my office.

955
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,760
Okay.

956
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,250
Let's go.

957
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,450
You're free to go now.

958
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,770
Please come in.

959
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,170
Have a seat.

960
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,110
Mr. Li.

961
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,000
I heard you have an urgent order

962
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,400
that needs to be completed within a month,

963
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,760
producing 5,000 pairs of high-end jeans.

964
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,300
And the craftsmanship requirements
are also very high.

965
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,780
I happen to know a factory

966
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,570
that I believe
can fully meet your requirements.

967
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,620
Ye.

968
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,450
This order has never been made public.

969
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,450
How did you find out about it?

970
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:35,800
Mr. Li.

971
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,750
Our industry is quite small.

972
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,360
Mr. Li.

973
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,860
I completely understand your concerns.

974
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,420
Although I've

975
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,070
left the factory,

976
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,360
I don't think that affects

977
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,890
the quality of work
this factory can produce.

978
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,820
Ye,

979
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,150
to be honest,

980
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,840
we already have manufacturing partners.

981
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,440
And actually,

982
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,400
we've almost finalized an agreement

983
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,660
with another factory.

984
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,500
We've worked with them many times before.

985
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,190
The key is that their price

986
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,320
is very reasonable.

987
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,280
I understand.

988
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,420
I completely get it.

989
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,440
If I were in your position,

990
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,590
for stability,

991
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,450
I'd also choose suppliers
I've worked with before.

992
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,630
However,

993
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,780
our advantage lies in our technology.

994
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,960
Our technology

995
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,880
ensures the pre-shrinkage rate of jeans

996
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,280
remains consistently within 2.5%.

997
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,150
This means higher pass rate
for finished garments

998
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,070
and lower return rates later on.

999
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,860
Go on.

1000
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,440
Moreover, our factory

1001
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,960
has imported many German rapier looms

1002
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,510
and Japanese sewing machines.

1003
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,710
With this equipment,

1004
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,700
we can complete orders on time

1005
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,860
while ensuring quality and quantity.

1006
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,070
Ye.

1007
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,100
I must say that what you've described

1008
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,280
is quite appealing to me.

1009
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:00,920
Here's what I'll do.

1010
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,010
I'll discuss this with my team

1011
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,550
and we'll see

1012
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,480
if we need

1013
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,150
to switch to a new supplier.

1014
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,810
Sure, no problem.

1015
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,270
Mr. Li,

1016
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,730
if you'd like to know more

1017
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,230
or visit our factory
to see the production equipment,

1018
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,340
please contact me anytime.

1019
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,670
We welcome you at any time.

1020
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,150
Okay.

1021
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,010
I'll be in touch.

1022
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,030
Okay.

1023
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:20,600
Alright.

1024
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,420
While we're fighting, you throw stones.

1025
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,680
While we're fighting, you throw stones.

1026
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,730
How mean can you be?

1027
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,150
You're not sleeping
in the middle of the night,

1028
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,940
burning the midnight oil,

1029
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,810
just to torment people.

1030
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,160
You old swordsman.

1031
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,880
You know quite a lot.

1032
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,470
Let me make myself clear.

1033
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,720
I won't fight over it.

1034
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,310
It's the middle of the night!

1035
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,900
You...

1036
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,040
Jiuling.

1037
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,510
Could you please keep it down?

1038
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,510
I'm still organizing my materials.

1039
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,550
♪ New Year ♪

1040
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,970

00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,430
I switched to another one.

1044
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,560
Do you like this one?

1045
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,770

1046
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,740

Professor Xiang.

1048
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,000
Still awake?

1049
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,150
Miss Ye.

1050
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,850
May I come in and take a look?

1051
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,800
Miss Ye, it's so late. Uh...

1052
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,190
Your room is really small.

1053
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,230
And so many books.

1054
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,880
Why is there a dog cage?

1055
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,830
Don't tell me

1056
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,630
Mr. Yan makes you live with a dog.

1057
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,400
No.

1058
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,030
Not yet, anyway.

1059
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,360
A grown man like you
sleeping in such a narrow bed.

1060
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,820
It's really unfair to you.

1061
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,670
It's fine.

1062
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,360
Well,

1063
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,670
as long as it's long enough.

1064
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,440
I couldn't handle it.

1065
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,190
I toss and turn a lot when I sleep.

1066
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,230
And when I dream,

1067
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,960
especially when it's a nightmare,
I'd definitely fall off

1068
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,760
and crash right onto this table.

1069
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,590
What are you cooking?

1070
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,080
I got hungry while reading.

1071
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,260
Just cooking some instant noodles...

1072
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,660
I'm actually hungry too.

1073
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,800
I only bought one pack.

1074
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,390
Probably not enough for both of us.

1075
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,350
It's okay.

1076
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,630
I don't eat much.

1077
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,290
Can't I just have half of this?

1078
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,230
Alright.

1079
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,880
Don't sit on that chair.

1080
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,070
You scared me!

1081
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,560
What's wrong with it?

1082
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,920
The screws underneath are loose.

1083
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,180
I haven't fixed it yet.

1084
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,990
If I break it, I'll pay for it.

1085
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,120
That's not it.

1086
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,120
I'm worried if you sit on it,

1087
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,920
you might fall and hurt yourself,

1088
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,710
then I'd have to compensate you.

1089
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,810
You wouldn't need to compensate me.

1090
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,610
I'm already up to my neck in debt.

1091
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,550
Aren't you in debt too?

1092
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,030
Speaking of which,

1093
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,080
we have quite a lot in common.

1094
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,280
Both of us down on our luck.

1095
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,570
But at least that's all behind us now.

1096
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,010
We both found jobs

1097
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,070
and even became neighbors
in this building.

1098
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,950
Shouldn't we celebrate this?

1099
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,210
Celebrate?

1100
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,900
We should toast to this!

1101
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,070
Toast?

1102
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,270
Get a bowl.

1103
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,850
Well, the noodles...

1104
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:55,730
Serve some.

1105
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,190
Thank you.

1106
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,400
Professor Xiang.

1107
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,230
You're so cultured
with your Chinese literature background.

1108
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,760
Shouldn't you say something profound?

1109
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,360
In Gorky's
"The Song of the Stormy Petrel,"

1110
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,960
there's a line that goes...

1111
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:10,840
It says,

1112
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,550
when people face life's difficulties,

1113
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,030
they should be like the stormy petrel,

1114
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,430
flying toward the storm,

1115
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,070
and soaring with outstretched wings.

1116
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:20,800
That's it!

1117
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,690
To us, two stormy petrels!

1118
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,620
Soaring with outstretched wings.

1119
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,300
Delicious.

1120
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
Professor Xiang.

1121
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,590
I must say, you're quite brave.

1122
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,400
This kind of stove

1123
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,870
can easily catch fire.

1124
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,560
This room could go up in flames,

1125
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,280
and you could burn down
the whole building.

1126
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,480
That's a bit extreme.

1127
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,960
How is it extreme?

1128
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,430
At our school before,

1129
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,690
because of this type of stove,

1130
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,640
two people died.

1131
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,360
And they were also eating noodles.

1132
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,280
Instant noodles, too.

1133
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,900
One guy

1134
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,920
and one girl.

1135
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,360
The guy was also

1136
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,090
sitting on a bed just like this.

1137
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,480
And the girl had hair
the same length as mine...

1138
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,080
Fine.

1139
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,970
Stop talking. Please stop.

1140
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,300
I'll unplug it right now.
