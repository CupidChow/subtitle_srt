[Episode 18]

3
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,460
Where has the scholar

4
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,300
gone to?

5
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,930
I've been looking for hours.

6
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,240
I was wrong. Isn't that enough?

7
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,460
You're just...

8
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,230
you...

9
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,750
What are all your names?

10
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,729
My name is Laifu.

11
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,840
My name is Huhu.

12
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,800
My name is Jixiang.

13
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,930
My name is Longlong.

14
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,520
My little brother is called Dabao.

15
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,280
Why are these all boys' names?

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,000
Ms. Yi,

17
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,140
I'm sorry for the embarrassment.

18
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,060
My husband Arun

19
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,340
is an honest man

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,120
with no opinions of his own.

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,030
He listens to my mother-in-law.

22
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,280
My mother-in-law

23
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,440
won't stop until she gets a grandson.

24
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,430
But

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
I had four girls one after another.

26
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,390
When it came to the fifth child,

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,870
I finally had a boy.

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,150
My figure

29
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,079
has changed because of childbirth,

30
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,810
and it still hasn't recovered.

31
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,280
It gave me all sorts of health problems.

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,430
This is their

33
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,290
first time visiting the factory.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,210
Laifu,

35
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,690
who told you to bring your siblings here?

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,080
I'm sorry for the embarrassment, Ms. Yi.

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,190
It's alright.

38
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,310
Auntie has some fish-skin peanuts here.

39
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:07,870
Here.

40
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,080
Take these and share with your sisters.

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,410
- Thank you. - Thank you.

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,560
Thank you, Auntie.

43
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,150
Thank you.

44
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,000
Ms. Su,

45
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,260
do you know why Qing and I argued?

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,400
All the conflicts between Qing and me

47
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,030
are because of my identity.

48
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,420
I am her sister-in-law

49
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,000
and also a martyr's family member.

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,010
But no one considers that

51
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,680
beyond these identities,

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,930
I am just myself.

53
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,690
I have privacy that I don't want to share.

54
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,190
Sometimes I just want to

55
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,030
find a quiet corner to be alone.

56
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,800
But everyone's

57
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,430
constant and overwhelming concern

58
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,400
makes me feel suffocated.

59
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,630
It makes me feel exposed

60
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,320
and judged by everyone.

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,000
Ms. Su,

62
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,780
I'm not targeting you.

63
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,050
I don't expect you to understand.

64
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,520
I'm just talking.

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,840
I do understand.

66
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,840
The fact that you're sharing this with me

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,150
means a lot to me.

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,310
You telling me about your situation

69
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,640
also touches me deeply.

70
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,040
Auntie, I'm hungry.

71
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,190
It'll be ready soon.

72
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,750
Laifu is hungry too.

73
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,250
Huhu is hungry too.

74
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,600
Jixiang is hungry too.

75
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,750
Dabao is hungry too.

76
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,240
You all...

77
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,310
I don't have enough noodles here.

78
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,159
How about this?

79
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,090
Let's go out to eat.

80
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,850
My treat.

81
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,560
Go out to eat?

82
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,790
Ms. Yi...

83
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,310
Thank you then.

84
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,409
You're welcome. Let's go.

85
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,600
Come, give it to auntie.

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,130
Let's go.

87
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,390
Let's eat out.

88
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,070
Come on.

89
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,430
Time to go out for dinner.

90
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,120
Let's go.

91
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,070
It's raining so hard.

92
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,510
Should we take shelter?

93
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,240
Let it pour. It's refreshing.

94
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,190
Let's keep going.

95
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,160
Give me back my hat.

96
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,750
Here.

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,310
Take it.

98
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,400
Hurry.

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,520
You're finally back.

100
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,300
Where have you been?

101
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,040
I've been looking for you everywhere,

102
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,920
all over the place.

103
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,730
You.

104
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,550
Look at you, you're soaking wet.

105
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,480
Why are you still angry?

106
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,430
Alright.

107
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,960
Don't bother.

108
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,750
You're running a fever.

109
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,930
Change your clothes quickly.

110
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,750
Come on, don't be angry.

111
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,560
It's not a big deal.

112
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,420
You're just...

113
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Just go back.

114
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,270
Let me tell you something.

115
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,400
We've been partners

116
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,560
for over ten years.

117
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,690
I finally figured it out on my way here.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
You never kept anything from me before.

119
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,240
Even when you had an abscess in your ass,

120
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,770
you were afraid of surgery.

121
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,830
You told me first,

122
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,030
not your wife.

123
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,950
But now?

124
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,330
You're keeping secrets from me.

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,750
You are hiding things from me.

126
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,880
How many things are you hiding from me?

127
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,210
If you don't come clean with me,

128
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,480
we're done for good.

129
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,900
I have nothing to hide from you.

130
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,750
Open the door.

131
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,830
Just go away.

132
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,510
Why did you lock the door? Open up!

133
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,120
I'll tell you everything.

134
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,310
Just open the door!

135
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,240
Change your clothes first!

136
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,800
Stubborn fool.

137
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:07,980
Yi,

138
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,940
hurry,

139
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,510
come with me.

140
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,610
Come on, hurry up!

141
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,230
Secretary Zhao, what...

142
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,950
Sister,

143
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,830
Sister, find the key to the second floor,

144
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,190
quickly!

145
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,600
Okay.

146
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,270
Go now!

147
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,220
Secretary Zhao,

148
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,800
why did you bring me here?

149
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,170
Wen is dying.

150
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,870
Wen.

151
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,640
Wen.

152
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,950
Look who's here.

153
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,950
Minister Wen.

154
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,040
You're here.

155
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,020
As soon as you arrived,

156
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,440
he came back to life.

157
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,360
It's fine. You don't need to do anything.

158
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Just stay here.

159
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,820
That's the best medicine.

160
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,530
Yi,

161
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,560
take good care of him.

162
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,470
Don't leave.

163
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,550
I won't.

164
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,750
Sister.

165
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,840
Coming.

166
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,550
Sister.

167
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,790
Who is it?

168
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,480
How is he? You took him to the hospital?

169
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,510
Hospital? No need.

170
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,170
Why are you here, Sister Fang?

171
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,270
He's fine. He is in good hands.

172
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,060
Good hands?

173
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,320
Who?

174
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,080
We can't let unreliable people walk in.

175
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,540
Reliable, very reliable.

176
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,720
What's not reliable about it?

177
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,180
They're both willing.

178
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,080
Don't worry about it.

179
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,670
Zhao Hangong, what are you thinking?

180
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,080
They're not together anymore.

181
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,270
Zhou introduced Yi Yi to someone.

182
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,960
They're getting along well.

183
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm looking for someone suitable

184
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,440
for Wen.

185
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,390
Why are you trying to push them together?

186
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,200
I'm not pushing them together.

187
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
You really have nothing better to do.

188
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,630
They both want this.

189
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,790
Let's not worry about it.

190
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,480
Besides...

191
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,740
you don't understand.

192
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,080
What don't I understand?

193
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,790
I introduced you to your wife!

194
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,360
That's true.

195
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
When you first met Jiang,

196
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,390
you couldn't even speak.

197
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,510
You kept running to the bathroom.

198
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,840
And you say I don't understand?

199
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,750
Stop talking about my embarrassing past.

200
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,600
Alright, Sister.

201
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,840
Let's stop worrying about this, okay?

202
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,510
Be quiet.

203
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,840
Is this just my personal business?

204
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,750
I...

205
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,530
Get out!

206
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,910
Sister.

207
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,660
Save him some face.

208
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,390
Sister.

209
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,850
Come out.

210
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,720
Come out.

211
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,640
Zhao Hangong, go home.

212
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,860
Close the door.

213
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,960
Didn't I make myself clear the other day?

214
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,570
I told you to go home and think it over.

215
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,460
You don't understand

216
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,750
what kind of man he is.

217
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,370
You two are completely different.

218
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,320
Although he used to be an intellectual,

219
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,840
he's been in the army for over ten years.

220
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,440
He's been through blood and fire.

221
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,270
He's not the bookish scholar you think.

222
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,910
He was once a military commander.

223
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,560
Do you understand what that means?

224
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,000
You don't understand at all.

225
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,970
Have you thought about it?

226
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,170
Once you two are together,

227
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,120
what kind of life will you face?

228
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,120
Minister Wen is a leader.

229
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,320
He will always prioritize his work.

230
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,750
He can't give you romance.

231
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,750
He can't give you poetry and art.

232
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,000
And he can't satisfy your fantasies.

233
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,500
This surely isn't the life you want.

234
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,480
Then what kind of life do I want?

235
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,640
I certainly know.

236
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,440
But I can tell you this.

237
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,600
Minister Wen absolutely cannot give you.

238
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,510
I've never expected anyone

239
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,060
to provide the life I want.

240
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,340
How do you define your relation with him?

241
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,910
I respect Minister Wen.

242
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,150
I enjoy talking with him.

243
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,200
Even seeing him, hearing him speak

244
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,480
is a sophisticated pleasure.

245
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,320
I won't depend on anyone.

246
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,960
Nor do I ask for anything.

247
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,150
I have my own life.

248
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,510
I have my own work.

249
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,540
Stop beating around the bush. Just say it.

250
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,670
Do you want to form a family with him?

251
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,720
Fine.

252
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,600
If you insist that I take a stand,

253
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,510
I'll tell you.

254
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,270
I like Minister Wen.

255
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,390
I want to live with him.

256
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,120
I want to be with her.

257
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,600
Okay.

258
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,730
Alright.

259
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,320
Okay, Wen Pu.

260
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,790
Fine, Wen Pu.

261
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,270
Then we'll follow the regulations.

262
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,670
The organization must conduct

263
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,670
a thorough background check on her.

264
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,360
Before the investigation results come out,

265
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,150
you two cannot meet.

266
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,840
You're thinking too simply.

267
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,520
I'm sorry for putting you through this.

268
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,630
Don't be.

269
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,390
It's good

270
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,420
like this.

271
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,550
Please list all your social connections

272
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,080
since you turned eighteen,

273
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,360
including relatives, classmates

274
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,410
and colleagues.

275
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
Write down clearly

276
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,870
their current occupations,

277
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,600
workplaces,

278
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,660
and other details.

279
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,080
I lost touch with many people for long.

280
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,000
You just need to provide the list.

281
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
We'll investigate the rest.

282
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,950
Minister Wen,

283
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,200
this is my self-criticism report.

284
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,070
Minister Wen,

285
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,280
I've reflected seriously.

286
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,780
I made a terrible mistake.

287
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,030
My mistake was

288
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,680
not reading books or newspapers

289
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,310
and not understanding government policies.

290
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,200
I'm still

291
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,640
stuck in old society ways

292
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,839
using methods from the Republican era.

293
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,160
These old mindsets and outdated thinking

294
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,750
are hard to change overnight.

295
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,869
But I had no ill intentions.

296
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,680
Minister Wen, you know me well.

297
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,859
Do I know you?

298
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,640
Fu Zihe.

299
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,270
Suppose I knew you before,

300
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,270
now

301
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,310
I understand you less and less.

302
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,869
Minister Wen,

303
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,349
I'm the kind of person

304
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,080
who just likes making friends.

305
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,310
It's the same with Secretary Zhao.

306
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,400
I just thought

307
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,440
friends could have meals together

308
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,900
and exchange small gifts.

309
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,030
It's nothing.

310
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,380
But now I understand

311
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,760
I was wrong.

312
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,440
You worry about government policy changes,

313
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,350
and you also try to exploit loopholes to

314
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,720
corrupt officials and seek private gain.

315
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,570
No, absolutely not.

316
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,070
I suggest you

317
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,330
go back and

318
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,920
read more books, read more newspapers,

319
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,470
and study Central Government's directives.

320
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,270
Yes.

321
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,480
We won't forget those

322
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,690
who once helped us.

323
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,480
But things

324
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,240
are always changing.

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,600
Those who once walked with us

326
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,400
may gradually drift away.

327
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,250
They become strangers,

328
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,160
or even

329
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,110
enemies.

330
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,200
Minister Wen,

331
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,510
not enemies.

332
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,290
We're friends, not enemies.

333
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,080
Get up.

334
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,590
Had enough of this act?

335
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,150
Yes.

336
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:22,520
No,

337
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,330
not enough.

338
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,910
No, no,

339
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,880
I was wrong.

340
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,790
I was wrong.

341
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,440
Wrong. I was wrong.

342
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,240
Wrong.

343
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,320
Go home.

344
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,740
Yes, Minister Wen.

345
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
I'll definitely reflect when I get back.

346
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,240
I'll study hard.

347
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,070
I'll go now.

348
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,530
[Self-criticism]

349
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,240
Your favorite cabbage

350
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,370
with sliced pork and amaranth.

351
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,480
Here.

352
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:11,810
Eat up.

353
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,130
I know you don't want me and Minister Wen

354
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,240
being together.

355
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,790
I also know why you

356
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,520
introduced Professor Xu to me.

357
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,090
You allow me to find someone to live with.

358
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,190
But you won't allow me to fall in love.

359
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,400
Is that so?

360
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,080
Yes.

361
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,570
Then according to you,

362
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,270
I can't have feelings for anyone again.

363
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,130
Can I still call you Sis in the future?

364
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,510
Of course.

365
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,360
Will you forget my brother?

366
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,630
How could I forget your brother?

367
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,810
He was my first love.

368
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,270
You're all my family.

369
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,550
Eat.

370
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,070
Sis.

371
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,640
I don't eat green onions.

372
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,580
Then I'll pick them out for you.

373
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,720
Sis,

374
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,270
you only ordered two steamed buns?

375
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,160
Hello,

376
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,530
add one more steamed bun.

377
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,280
Make it three.

378
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,940
Sure thing!

379
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,530
Eat up.

380
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,770
Did you forget I don't eat green onions?

381
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,190
How could I remember all that?

382
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
But I remember yours.

383
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,440
You don't eat cilantro.

384
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,440
That was your brother.

385
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,570
Thank you.

386
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,550
Hello?

387
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,340
Wen Pu.

388
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,720
Commander, it's me.

389
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,830
What the hell are you doing?

390
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,310
How dare you speak so recklessly

391
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,200
in the interview with the Party newspaper?

392
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,970
Some things

393
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,730
can be said in private,

394
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,610
but not in public.

395
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,490
You're a sophisticated political officer.

396
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,960
Don't you understand this?

397
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,760
I don't understand, Commander.

398
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,350
What happened?

399
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,860
In the Party newspaper interview,

400
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,190
you went on about Western Puritan ideals.

401
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,880
What's all this about worldly asceticism?.

402
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,280
Our Party advocates frugality,

403
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,420
integrity,

404
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:52,760
and selflessness.

405
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,310
[To Comrade Wen Pu]

406
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,310
All that nonsense you talked about,

407
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,270
once published,

408
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,930
what will the people think?

409
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,000
I remember now.

410
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,550
Well,

411
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,180
they did interview me.

412
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,210
But they should

413
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,810
send me the draft for review.

414
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,350
The comrades at the newspaper said

415
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,150
they already sent you the draft.

416
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,560
You weren't there.

417
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,040
Fang said you were sick.

418
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,110
What convenient timing to be ill.

419
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,660
Li was going to send it,

420
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,790
but according to procedure,

421
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,760
it was first submitted to

422
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,180
the Municipal Propaganda Department.

423
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,930
That's when they said that some content

424
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,590
hadn't been confirmed by you.

425
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,620
I understand, Commander.

426
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,000
Perhaps during the interview,

427
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,440
Yang and I didn't understand each other.

428
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,510
If you haven't thought it through,

429
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,970
don't communicate at all.

430
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,640
The responsibility for this matter

431
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,770
still lies with you.

432
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,050
I understand, Commander.

433
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,750
Scholar, let me tell you.

434
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,480
Yang Xue'an

435
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,050
is full of dirty tricks.

436
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,350
I just don't understand.

437
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,750
We all came from the same trench.

438
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,690
Why is he always up to no good?

439
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,830
Even if

440
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,220
he saved the political commissar's life,

441
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,520
he can't just do whatever he wants.

442
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,510
Don't be angry.

443
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,160
I'll handle this.

444
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,680
I'll teach him a lesson.

445
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,920
You'll teach him a lesson?

446
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,750
How exactly?

447
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,790
I'll beat him up.

448
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,440
Come on.

449
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,080
I knew you'd say that.

450
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,800
Will beating him up help?

451
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,800
It might just lead to another article.

452
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,510
The headline would be:

453
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,880
Party Secretary Zhao Hangong

454
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,510
stands up for Minister Wen Pu

455
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,120
and brutally beats reporter Yang Xue'an.

456
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,350
Wouldn't that just complicate things?

457
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,000
Right?

458
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,440
He's not our enemy.

459
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,350
You have a point.

460
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,510
What do you want to do then?

461
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,790
Just swallow this insult?

462
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,520
I'm not swallowing any insult.

463
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,920
I know him.

464
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,560
If he doesn't change his ways

465
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,320
and continues like this,

466
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,630
I believe he won't go far.

467
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,950
Alright, you fool.

468
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,640
Let time take care of this.

469
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,360
Come, let's drink.

470
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,240
Fine.

471
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,390
I'll listen to you this time.

472
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,150
If Yang Xue'an does it again,

473
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,480
I'll beat him up

474
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,070
even if I make a headline.

475
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,750
Good.

476
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,840
I agree.

477
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,000
Secretary Zhao,

478
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,930
who are you planning to beat up now?

479
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,570
For the past decade or so,

480
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,570
all we hear is you

481
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,720
beating someone up.

482
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,120
As the old saying goes,

483
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,360
heaven sees what you do.

484
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,120
How should I address you?

485
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,890
Comrade is clearly not appropriate.

486
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,070
Ms.

487
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,960
or Madam

488
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,590
sounds too formal.

489
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,550
Let me just call you Yi.

490
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,750
It sounds like a tagalong.

491
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,080
That is completely unlike you.

492
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,400
This morning,

493
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,930
I watched the sky from the balcony.

494
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,550
The dawn colors were unusual.

495
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,870
There are pink

496
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,240
and purple.

497
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,490
Neither was bright,

498
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,750
as if washed with water.

499
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,200
It reminded me of

500
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,200
you painting by the river.

501
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,810
Your colors, compared to reality,

502
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,750
were always a bit lighter.

503
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,760
I didn't quite understand then.

504
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
This morning,

505
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,950
standing on the balcony,

506
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,510
watching the clouds gradually fade,

507
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,640
I suddenly somewhat

508
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,280
understood the artistic realm you pursue.

509
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,030
Okay, thank you.

510
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:55,990
Minister.

511
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,210
I'll head out first.

512
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,410
Okay.

513
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,110
Comrade Zhou,

514
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,790
let's find some time

515
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,140
to visit your brother's grave

516
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
together with your sister-in-law.

517
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,790
Zhaoyuan was a revolutionary martyr.

518
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,230
He lost his life for liberation.

519
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,400
I remember the Central Committee

520
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,150
sent a congratulatory telegram

521
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,480
for Shanghai's liberation, ending with:

522
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,700
The revolutionary martyrs

523
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,830
who sacrificed their lives for

524
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,070
Shanghai's liberation will live forever.

525
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,940
We will never forget him,

526
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,020
and neither will the people.

527
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,680
Minister,

528
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,700
you must treat my sister-in-law well,

529
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,800
treat my sister well.

530
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,510
Your biological father's surname is Lin.

531
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,570
Why did you change your surname to Yi?

532
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,350
I was born into a feudal family.

533
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,110
My father was corrupt

534
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,590
and backward.

535
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,640
You have an aunt.

536
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,610
Are you still in touch with her?

537
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,790
[1949]

538
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,390
My aunt and uncle went abroad

539
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,530
for business before the Liberation.

540
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,400
Their address changes frequently.

541
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,440
I've received a few letters from them,

542
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,650
but couldn't reply.

543
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,140
We haven't been in contact recently.

544
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,270
Auntie, are you really leaving?

545
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,400
Your uncle has been urging me to go.

546
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,770
But I must settle things at the hospital.

547
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,920
If I don't leave soon,

548
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,230
my ticket will expire.

549
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,040
You're going to such a faraway country.

550
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,390
Are you not coming back?

551
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,810
It's hard to say.

552
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,070
At least in the near future,

553
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,490
I won't be coming back.

554
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,400
Auntie,

555
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,510
you've put so much effort

556
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,160
into building this obstetric hospital,

557
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,670
and now you're just leaving.

558
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,730
Don't you feel sad?

559
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,960
Of course I do.

560
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,070
Then why?

561
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,270
Some things

562
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,150
are difficult to explain to you.

563
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:00,730
Yi,

564
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,450
perhaps we'll

565
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,030
see each other again.

566
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,350
This watch

567
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,330
is given to you now.

568
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,420
I hope it brings you luck.

569
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,280
When you miss me,

570
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,070
just look at it.

571
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,830
You should be aware

572
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,680
that foreign connections are sensitive.

573
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,410
You must report to us promptly.

574
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,630
I understand.

575
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:52,940
When you were at

576
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,440
Shude Girls' School in Chongqing,

577
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,350
who were you close to?

578
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,580
Liu Zhuyun,

579
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,750
Huang Yiling and Gao Qiongqiong

580
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,010
were quite close to me.

581
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,510
But they all married and moved far away,

582
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,830
and we lost contact after the liberation.

583
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,830
What about Qiao Xiaolan?

584
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,960
Qiao Xiaolan and I weren't that close.

585
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,480
She didn't go to college

586
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,720
after high school.

587
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,930
She also married and moved away.

588
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,180
Since 1945,

589
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,590
Qiao Xiaolan

590
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
worked in the KMT's Central

591
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,200
Investigation Department in Chongqing.

592
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Did you know that?

593
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,970
No, I didn't.

594
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,710
Qiao Xiaolan claims

595
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,880
that she has contact with you all along.

596
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,070
Between 1949 and 1952,

597
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,310
she says you and she were in Shanghai

598
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,790
and lived together.

599
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,240
She's lying.

600
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,440
I can confront her face to face.

601
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,840
So cute.

602
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,700
Mr. Yang, did you like playing soccer

603
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,830
when you were young?

604
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,730
I didn't have time to play soccer.

605
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,230
When I was his age,

606
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,430
I could already write the

607
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,090
Thousand Character Classic.

608
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:09,820
Xue'an,

609
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,140
I want to talk to you about something.

610
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,670
Go ahead.

611
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,650
Don't get angry when I tell you.

612
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,640
Why would I get angry about it?

613
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,110
Speak.

614
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,820
It's about my sister-in-law.

615
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,950
Well then,

616
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,550
I have even less reason to be angry,

617
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,110
right?

618
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,790
Look.

619
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,000
Yi Yi,

620
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,950
is someone we're helping,

621
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,710
and your sister-in-law.

622
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Both officially and personally,

623
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,960
I shouldn't get angry.

624
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,640
Go on.

625
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,370
I'm really going to say it now.

626
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,070
Don't get angry.

627
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,640
I won't get angry.

628
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,920
After you finish, I'll buy you a popsicle.

629
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,050
Alright, here goes.

630
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,790
I think

631
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,480
my sister-in-law and Minister Wen

632
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,610
are actually quite good together.

633
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,440
I'm starting to change my thinking.

634
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,240
Maybe my previous perspective

635
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,590
was too narrow.

636
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,350
See, you're angry.

637
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,470
How am I angry?

638
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,250
Then why are you glaring at me?

639
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,420
I...

640
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,240
glared at you?

641
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,200
I...

642
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,480
Glare?

643
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
Did I glare at you?

644
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,070
Yes.

645
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,500
Continue.

646
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,720
They truly love each other

647
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,050
and respect each other.

648
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,320
Look, even

649
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,240
Director Fang

650
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,070
can't keep them apart.

651
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,480
My attitude is why not let them try.

652
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,030
Try?

653
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,460
Try what?

654
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,950
Comrade Zhou Yunqing,

655
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,610
how could you think like this?

656
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,270
What's Yi Yi's background?

657
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,790
She's petty bourgeois.

658
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,580
She needs to improve herself.

659
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:38,910
She needs

660
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,550
to change her way of doing things

661
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,790
to integrate with the people,

662
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,580
not thinking about vanity all day

663
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,380
and climbing up to Minister Wen.

664
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,890
Your unstable position is one thing, but

665
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,630
Minister is an old revolutionary comrade.

666
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,030
How could he be like this?

667
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,790
What kind of thinking is this?

668
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,880
This is dangerous.

669
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,030
Today,

670
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,520
I'm clearly telling you right here that

671
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,210
they cannot be together.

672
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,710
It's dangerous for them to be like this.

673
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,020
Now that I've talked about them,

674
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,220
let me talk about you.

675
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,110
Comrade Zhou Yunqing,

676
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,060
your position

677
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,610
is too unstable now.

678
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,560
You've changed.

679
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,170
I don't know you anymore.

680
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,650
You used to be

681
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,760
a simple girl.

682
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
I admired that.

683
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,240
And now?

684
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,410
How could you do this?

685
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,810
You've become a two-faced hypocrite,

686
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,220
a fence-sitter,

687
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,720
bending whichever way the wind blows.

688
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,780
Why are you crying?

689
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,630
You...

690
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,030
you start crying?

691
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,630
Not only is

692
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,850
your position inconsistent,

693
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,650
but your willpower is also weak.

694
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,330
Your behavior today

695
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,400
has completely

696
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,330
ruined this pleasant atmosphere.

697
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,550
Such a blue sky.

698
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,390
Such

699
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,810
tall trees.

700
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:45,850
Isn't it

701
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,650
heartbreaking?

702
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,590
You...

703
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,240
if you cry like this,

704
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,110
you'll scare kids.

705
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,610
You said you wouldn't get angry,

706
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,110
so I spoke up.

707
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,690
Am I angry?

708
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:08,880
You...

709
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,179
don't want popsicles?

710
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,469
I'll buy it myself.

711
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,500
The people and environment around me

712
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,630
all require me

713
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,900
to put in great effort to change them.

714
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,850
It's truly heartbreaking.

715
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,670
I know

716
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,720
we can't meet in private.

717
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,320
Just two minutes, okay?

718
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,310
Be careful.

719
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,510
Where's your bicycle?

720
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,400
My bi...

721
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,240
My bicycle!

722
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,380
Well...

723
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,960
you...

724
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,590
I'm fine. You go ahead.

725
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:07,780
Then I'll...

726
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,030
Run quickly. Don't lose it.

727
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,190
Let's go back to our previous question.

728
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,450
What's your relation with Qiao Xiaolan?

729
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,240
We were classmates at Shude Girls' School.

730
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,640
We have no relation.

731
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,230
After the liberation, are you sure

732
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,280
you haven't contacted her again?

733
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,280
No,

734
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:39,850
not even once.

735
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,790
Come in.

736
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,400
Qiao Xiaolan is here.

737
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,110
Let her in.

738
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,330
She's not Qiao Xiaolan.

739
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,320
Qiao Xiaolan,

740
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,180
do you know this woman?

741
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,240
No,

742
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,840
I've never seen her before.

743
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,470
During your investigation, you stated

744
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,610
you graduated from

745
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,790
Chongqing Shude Girls' School

746
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,990
and had close contact

747
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,380
with a female classmate who married

748
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,550
a high-ranking KMT official surnamed Yi.

749
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,510
Madam, I didn't go to

750
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,480
Chongqing Shude Girls' School.

751
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,840
I attended Jinan Shude Girls' School.

752
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,880
How can this be?

753
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,360
Then what's the name

754
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,510
of your classmate with the surname Yi?

755
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,110
She

756
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,320
actually doesn't have the surname Yi.

757
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,120
She took her husband's surname.

758
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,150
Her maiden name is Hu.

759
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,650
Well, here's the thing.

760
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,570
Your political background check

761
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,570
have results now.

762
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,970
Everything is fine.

763
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,600
Thank you, Director Fang.

764
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,720
If there's nothing else,

765
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,770
I'll be going now.

766
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,320
Wait.

767
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,690
I'm not finished yet.

768
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,670
Although you may not want to hear this,

769
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,630
there are some things I must say.

770
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Do you know

771
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,960
what Minister Wen's job

772
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,320
actually entails?

773
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,150
The special nature of his work is that

774
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,440
he must deal with three forces

775
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,590
to negotiate,

776
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,510
balance,

777
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,210
and interact with them.

778
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,140
We live in peaceful times now.

779
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,950
Our enemies are often invisible.

780
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,810
Do you know how many people are watching,

781
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,080
waiting for us

782
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,190
to make mistakes,

783
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,590
to show weaknesses

784
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,630
and

785
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,070
commit errors?

786
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,480
But now that he's with you,

787
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,400
these uncertainties have multiplied.

788
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,680
What you must bear

789
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,600
is not just your personal fate,

790
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,070
but also Minister Wen's

791
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,750
political career.

792
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,360
You're thinking too simply.

793
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,590
Go back and think it over.

794
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,760
How is it?

795
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,110
Ms. Fang told you, right?

796
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,480
Your political background check passed.

797
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,210
Is what we're doing

798
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,460
really right?

799
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,270
What's wrong with it?

800
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,880
What did

801
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,480
Ms. Fang tell you?

802
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,000
You're a veteran revolutionary,

803
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,770
a high-ranking leader.

804
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,400
Now you have me,

805
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,670
an uncertain factor,

806
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
a major weakness.

807
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,480
I'm just an ordinary person.

808
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,960
I can't bear the weight of your

809
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,630
grand political destiny.

810
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,800
Ms. Fang told you this.

811
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,410
She wasn't trying to make it hard for you.

812
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,670
She doesn't know you.

813
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,030
She doesn't know how independent you are,

814
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,490
how strong you are inside.

815
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,150
Besides,

816
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,470
how could you possibly be my weakness?

817
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,880
Having you by my side

818
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,880
is like having a mirror

819
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,810
that shows me sincerity

820
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,280
and the human heart.
