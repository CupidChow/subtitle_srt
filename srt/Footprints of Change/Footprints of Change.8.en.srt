00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,150
Director,

5
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,590
I've finished taking the blood pressure

6
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,710
for the patient in bed 3,

7
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,350
and here are the test results for bed 4.

8
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,410
Please take a look.

9
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,039
Alright.

10
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,840
You may go.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,800
Siyun.

12
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,310
Aunt Nan.

13
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,210
Did you get your medicine?

14
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,870
Yes.

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,130
I just have one concern.

16
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,590
Well,

17
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,400
after taking

18
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,030
this kind of contraceptive,

19
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,910
will I be unable to
get pregnant in the future?

20
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,710
No.

21
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,360
The contraceptive I prescribed for you

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,170
is imported from Germany,

23
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,000
and you can still conceive
after you stop taking it.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,680
It's designed to give us women

25
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,720
greater freedom

26
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
in deciding about having children.

27
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,840
Thank you.

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,360
Aunt Nan,

29
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,380
I have something
I'd like to discuss with you.

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,630
Go ahead.

31
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,560
Recently, Sichuan has been hit by famine
and plague outbreaks.

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,750
I'd like to organize a charity fundraiser

33
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,710
in the name of our Sinan Hospital

34
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,710
to raise donations of medicine
for disaster victims.

35
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,740
Aunt Nan, what do you think?

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,380
Of course, no problem.

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,120
I'll help you invite

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,780
some social elites to attend.

39
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,160
Thank you, Aunt Nan.

40
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,800
By the way,

41
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,079
remember to take the pill on schedule.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Don't forget.

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,400
Got it.

44
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,240
Is Kang Kaisheng

45
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,680
your new pen name?

46
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,040
Don't be ridiculous.

47
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,090
What?

48
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,130
You like his articles?

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,030
This guy is quite bold in his writing—

50
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,090
every point targets the government.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,030
Your newspaper is quite bold as well,

52
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,690
willing to publish anything.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,860
Some people say he's a Communist.

54
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,250
What do you think?

55
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,810
I don't know what his intentions are.

56
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,410
Stay away from him.

57
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
I barely know him.

58
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,570
What did you want to see me about?

59
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,210
About what I mentioned before—

60
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,140
the disaster relief fundraising.

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,190
I want to buy a front-page spot.

62
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,720
Help me design it, will you?

63
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,740
-Cheng, you're here.
-Mr. Lu.

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,750
You guys talk.

65
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,050
I'll handle what you asked me to do.

66
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:51,980
Goodbye, Mr. Lu.

67
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,690
Boss, let's go inside and talk.

68
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,120
Boss.

69
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,220
My men saw Mr. Dalun

70
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,670
doing business with Huang Aniu,

71
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,529
and they took some photos of them.

72
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,640
Take a look.

73
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,360
Huang Aniu was caught before
selling opium with the Japanese—

74
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,680
and he still dares to do this?

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,480
The Japanese?

76
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,270
The Master explicitly forbids

77
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,310
selling opium.

78
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,720
And now he's involved with the Japanese.

79
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,920
The Master won't tolerate
either of those things,

80
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,190
and Mr. Dalun has done both.

81
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,390
When has he ever listened to the Master?

82
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,130
True.

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,300
Cheng.

84
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,510
From today on,

85
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,830
have our men keep a close watch on Dalun.

86
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,440
Got it.

87
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,590
I'll go see to it now.

88
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,640
Mom.

89
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,120
You're back.

90
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,570
Come here.

91
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,170
I have something to tell you.

92
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,090
What is it?

93
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,120
Xiong...

94
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,070
he passed away.

95
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,950
His grandmother asked me to
give you a message.

96
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,680
Xiong wanted to tell you

97
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,950
that he was sorry.

98
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,690
The arranged marriage wasn't
Xiong's fault.

99
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,780
That's true.

100
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,310
We should pick a day

101
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,500
to burn incense and joss paper for him.

102
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,650
After all,

103
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,890
he was still family.

104
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,950
Okay.

105
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,120
I also want to apologize to you.

106
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,720
Marriage is such an important matter,

107
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,450
yet I couldn't even protect your right
to choose.

108
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,480
It's alright, Mom.

109
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,880
That's all behind us now.

110
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,240
Mom hopes that in the future,

111
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,420
you can find someone you truly love,

112
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,070
who is decent, good-tempered,

113
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,670
and will cherish you.

114
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,160
Anyway, I definitely won't

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,490
marry someone like Dad.

116
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,430
What did you want to see me about?

117
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,560
Sit.

118
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,380
Do you know Huang Aniu?

119
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,360
Huang Aniu?

120
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,240
Let me think...

121
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,530
No, I don't know him.

122
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,590
Then I'll tell you.

123
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,750
Huang Aniu made his fortune

124
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,750
by selling opium with the Japanese.

125
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,210
He's been quite active lately.

126
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,360
Then this bastard really deserves to die.

127
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,090
Should he die for selling opium

128
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,000
or for collaborating with the Japanese?

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,260
Whatever the reason, he deserves to die.

130
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,440
Do you want me to use

131
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,720
my connections in the Revival Society
to take care of him?

132
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,520
Dalun.

133
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,310
I don't care what society you're in.

134
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,000
There are two things I've always stressed.

135
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,159
Don't sell opium.

136
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,270
Don't cooperate with the Japanese.

137
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,270
Father taught us these from a young age.

138
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,180
These are our principles—

139
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,020
our bottom line.

140
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,010
I have principles and a bottom line.

141
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,830
I know you and Father both care for me.

142
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,540
So how could I make such a mistake?

143
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,330
His name is Huang Aniu?

144
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,960
He told me his name was Li Zeqing.

145
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,440
I did do business with him
in the Northeast.

146
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,750
I owe him money.

147
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,780
He followed me to Shanghai

148
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,610
and forced me to deal in opium with him.

149
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,910
I originally thought I'd just pay him back

150
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,570
and then cut all ties with him.

151
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,320
He actually has dealings
with the Japanese.

152
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,600
Don't worry.

153
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,840
From now on,

154
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,620
I'll never contact him again.

155
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,190
Don't worry about me anymore.

156
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,990
You're not going to drink it
just because it makes you sick?

157
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,480
Once you get used to it,
you won't get sick.

158
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,270
Alright.

159
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,820
Father.

160
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,580
Father.

161
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,630
What are you two brothers talking about?

162
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,490
Just chatting.

163
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,750
Did you get into trouble again?

164
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,350
He's about to cause trouble.

165
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,150
What have you done this time?

166
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,870
I'm asking you!

167
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,750
He wants to make boiled pork
with pickled cabbage

168
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,000
for your birthday.

169
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,880
That's right.

170
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,410
Your birthday is coming up, isn't it?

171
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,790
I'm planning to show off my cooking skills

172
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,250
at your birthday banquet.

173
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,550
You mean that over-salted
pickled cabbage stew you made?

174
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,690
It's boiled pork with pickled cabbage.

175
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,900
Whatever it is,

176
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,010
I don't want all my guests
choking on all that salt.

177
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,210
I'll be careful with the salt this time.

178
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,930
Keep an eye on him for me.

179
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,900
Alright, you two carry on.

180
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,150
Mom, you look great.

181
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,810
You should keep having
the bird's nest soup.

182
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,600
Alright.

183
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,480
Thanks.

184
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,400
You'd better behave yourself.

185
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,940
Boss, we'll start from Suzhou Creek here

186
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,870
and follow this road into the city.

187
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,910
Then we'll reach here

188
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,030
and continue down this way.

189
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,550
However, if the weather is nice,

190
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,840
we'll go this route...

191
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,240
Who are you?

192
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,480
You're Attorney Cheng, right?

193
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,410
What do you want?

194
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,220
I'm a journalist from a newspaper,

195
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,670
and I'd like to ask you
to write an article.

196
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,920
Look at you, so sloppy

197
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,110
and sneaky.

198
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,670
What could you possibly write?

199
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,240
I'm Lu Yingchen's colleague

200
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,480
and his good friend.

201
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,560
Mr. Lu's friend.

202
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,950
Come in.

203
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,540
This is an article I wrote.

204
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,690
This is my pen name.

205
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,270
You should know it, right?

206
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:03,870
Hello.

207
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,030
I'm Cheng Ao.

208
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,720
Attorney Cheng.

209
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,180
This is an article I wrote.

210
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,380
Under the pen name Kang Kaisheng.

211
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,040
So you're the one whose every viewpoint

212
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,280
criticizes the government.

213
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,250
That's me.

214
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,250
Please, have a seat.

215
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,200
Thank you.

216
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,350
What brings you here?

217
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,910
I came today

218
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,730
on behalf of our newspaper

219
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,000
to commission you to write an article.

220
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,330
I've never written articles before.

221
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,910
I saw you defending
those anti-Japanese students in court.

222
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,560
You have a strong sense of justice.

223
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,610
I just feel

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,870
that you must have many more

225
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,600
genuine ideas
that you haven't fully expressed.

226
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,430
As it happens,

227
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,750
our newspaper is willing to give you

228
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,150
such an opportunity.

229
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,910
You can express all your ideas

230
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,000
and principles in writing.

231
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,790
This way,

232
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,470
they can reach a wider audience
of young people,

233
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,120
including those students who are lost

234
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,900
yet seeking the light.

235
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,870
Mr. Kang,

236
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,930
I am a lawyer.

237
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,950
Whether my client that day was a student

238
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,480
or a murderer,

239
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,060
I must do my best to defend them.

240
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,270
That's my duty as a lawyer.

241
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,210
Attorney Cheng,

242
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,410
how is student Xiaoshan doing now?

243
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,750
If needed,

244
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,030
I can arrange for him

245
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,630
and other students
who seek enlightenment...

246
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,410
to go to the Soviet area together.

247
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,270
What area?

248
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,910
The Soviet area.

249
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,440
Soviet area?

250
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,420
What area is the Soviet area?

251
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,500
Is it a district in Suzhou?

252
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,980
Yes.

253
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,720
By the way,

254
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,080
Attorney Cheng,

255
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,550
I heard

256
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,370
you generously donated to Sinan Hospital's

257
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,000
charity fundraiser this time.

258
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,320
But I wonder,
after collecting these medicines,

259
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
how do you plan to

260
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,290
safely transport them to Sichuan?

261
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,910
That's something
Director Lin should worry about.

262
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,720
I don't know.

263
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,390
What about the article commission?

264
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,550
That's enough.

265
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,140
Attorney Cheng is very busy today.

266
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,870
You should go. Come on, come on.

267
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,850
Well then, Attorney Cheng,
I'll take my leave now.

268
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,450
Take care.

269
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,780
I'm sorry.

270
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,620
I'm sorry.

271
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,780
That dude doesn't look like
he's up to any good.

272
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,670
Why are you looking at me? Keep moving!

273
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,330
Waiting for me to walk you out?

274
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,160
He really doesn't seem like
a decent person.

275
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,120
So sneaky.

276
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,540
Close the door properly.

277
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,870
Just now I said if the weather is good,

278
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,440
we can take this route, right?

279
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,360
[Four Seas Peide Jetty]

280
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,120
They're cracking down hard lately.

281
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,980
This is all I can get you this time.

282
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,840
When will the next shipment arrive?

283
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,750
Didn't I tell you?
They're cracking down hard lately.

284
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,720
Next time isn't guaranteed.

285
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,050
I'll let you know later.

286
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,930
Huang Aniu.

287
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,980
From now on, you've got a new name:

288
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,600
Li Zeqing.

289
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,500
Young Master.

290
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,370
We were being tailed just now.

291
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,170
Who sent them?

292
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,870
Cheng's men.

293
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,360
What?

294
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,390
They didn't see me, did they?

295
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,270
Don't worry,

296
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,250
I've caught them all

297
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,510
and taken care of them.

298
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,040
Good.

299
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,140
What?

300
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,050
Do you know this person?

301
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,470
Who?

302
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,840
Yes, I do.

303
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,380
This guy has become quite famous lately.

304
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,650
Hasn't he already approached you?

305
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
He approached me.

306
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,010
Have you been spying on me?

307
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,150
Look at how paranoid you are.

308
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,150
Someone has been spying on Kang Kaisheng

309
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,550
and saw him approach you.

310
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,120
Since you're here,

311
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,050
let's discuss this together.

312
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,800
You know,

313
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,310
the articles this man has published lately

314
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,910
are extremely provocative,

315
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,710
reeking of communist leanings.

316
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,600
Go on.

317
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,780
But it'd be strange to say
he's definitely a Communist.

318
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,000
How did he manage to
get his articles published, anyway?

319
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,380
The only thing I'm certain of

320
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,780
right now is

321
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,610
that he has someone backing him,

322
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,200
but who could it be?

323
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

324
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,500
You suspect he's working for me?

325
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,930
I didn't say anything.

326
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,390
Your eyes already give it away.

327
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,170
Tell me what he said
when he came to see you.

328
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,870
This man approached me
with clear intentions.

329
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,050
Last time he tried to
trick me into talking

330
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,250
and even implied that I was a Communist.

331
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,080
So are you one or not?

332
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,500
What's that supposed to mean?

333
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,950
He's your guy, isn't he?

334
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,430
How could he be my guy?

335
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,700
I would never investigate you.

336
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,550
Right.

337
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,690
You don't investigate.

338
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,010
Usually,

339
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,630
you just frame me directly.

340
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,550
Wh-What do you mean by that?

341
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,260
Remember to
attend Nan's charity gala tonight!

342
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,440
If you're going, how could I not go?

343
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,870
Thank you very much

344
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,030
to every kind-hearted guest here today.

345
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,960
Today,

346
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,750
we've gathered here to raise funds

347
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,080
for medicines for those disaster victims

348
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,550
suffering from the plague
and to do our part

349
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,960
in supporting the relief efforts.

350
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,840
At the same time,

351
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,960
I'm also grateful

352
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,910
to have witnessed
the growth of a dear friend.

353
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,270
Her persistence has deeply moved me.

354
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,390
Without her,

355
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,990
there would be no Sinan Hospital today.

356
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,930
I'd like to invite her on stage
to say a few words.

357
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,260
Thank you, Mrs. Shen,
for your praise and recognition.

358
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,170
Our Sinan Hospital will donate

359
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,000
all of our medicine supplies
to the disaster area.

360
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,240
At the same time, I'd like to appeal to

361
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,170
every benevolent guest here today

362
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,310
to contribute whatever you can.

363
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,480
Is that so, Miss Lin?

364
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,540
What you're saying sounds very noble,

365
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,670
but from what I know,

366
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,270
the medicine donations
your Sinan Hospital raised this time

367
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,680
probably aren't being sent

368
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,880
to Sichuan, are they?

369
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,860
Sir,

370
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,310
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

371
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,110
Our fundraising is supervised
by the government.

372
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,230
If you don't have solid evidence,

373
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,100
my lawyer is right here,

374
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,020
and I can sue you for defamation.

375
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,730
By government,

376
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,390
you wouldn't happen to mean
the Shen family, would you?

377
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,930
I've looked into your Sinan Hospital's

378
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,090
medication procurement list this time.

379
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,590
The amounts clearly exceed
what's needed for the plague.

380
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,480
Who knows if your Sinan Hospital

381
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,630
is taking advantage of
the Shen family's protection

382
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,270
to work with outside accomplices,

383
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,270
doing all sorts of

384
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,370
shady business behind closed doors,

385
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,720
just to line your own pockets...

386
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,790
Stop, stop, stop.

387
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,880
You're Kang Kaisheng?

388
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,810
Yes.

389
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,000
Take him away.

390
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,350
What are you doing?

391
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,650
What are you doing?

392
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,480
Let go of me!

393
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,160
Let go of me!

394
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,960
Let go of me!

395
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,030
Let go of me!

396
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,960
Let go of me!

397
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,270
Who was that man at the gala?

398
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,030
Why was he targeting me?

399
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,350
And why did Shen Yiqun suddenly step in

400
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,610
and have him arrested?

401
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,700
Was he helping us?

402
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,750
Not  "us,"

403
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,400
just you.

404
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,670
He was helping you.

405
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,160
Yeah.

406
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Isn't he into you?

407
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,240
Why are you such a pain?

408
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,200
Right.

409
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,680
I'm a pain,

410
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,720
while Shen Yiqun is likable.

411
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,750
I know.

412
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,020
I'm leaving then.

413
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,850
Where are you going?

414
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,860
Going to have noodles with Shen Yiqun.

415
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,660
Go ahead then.

416
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,610
Not leaving?

417
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,850
How can I leave when you're pulling me?

418
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,420
Still not leaving?

419
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,050
Can't bear to leave me?

420
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,830
I just can't bear to leave Shen Yiqun.

421
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,480
So what?

422
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,460
Then you have to have noodles with me.

423
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,710
I can't bear to let you go.

424
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,830
Don't pull me. I can walk by myself.

425
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Where's Cheng?

426
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,920
He said he'd treat me to noodles,

427
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,520
but he's nowhere to be found.

428
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,590
Admit it—you're the one craving noodles,

429
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,720
and you claimed Cheng invited us here.

430
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,400
What?

431
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,170
If I had been the one who wanted to eat,

432
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,900
you wouldn't have come with me?

433
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,710
That would depend on my mood.

434
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,330
You're full of pride, aren't you?

435
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,350
How are you?

436
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,590
Are you injured?

437
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,440
Where are you injured? Let me see.

438
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,270
I'm fine.

439
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,810
And I'm not injured.

440
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,440
You must have been terrified.

441
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,830
It's okay now.

442
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,610
I'm here.

443
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,210
How is Cheng Ao?

444
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,480
The doctor said

445
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,110
the knife wound isn't deep.

446
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,550
After it's been stitched up,

447
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,610
he'll be fine after a few days of rest.

448
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,790
What a pity.

449
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,020
You're a doctor too.

450
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,550
Do you doctors have
some kind of drug that,

451
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,790
when injected into someone's body,

452
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,750
will make them never wake up again?

453
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,510
If you do, give it to me now,

454
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,830
and I'll go in there
and inject him with it.

455
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,350
Taking you out for noodles
this late at night?

456
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,190
Shanghai is in such chaos right now.

457
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,320
He still has enemies out there.

458
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,730
Does he not know that?

459
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,480
Luckily, nothing serious happened
this time,

460
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,340
but what if something really bad happens
next time?

461
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,720
Alright.

462
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,170
I'll take you home.

463
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,390
I'm not leaving.

464
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,100
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

465
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,900
What's the point of you staying?

466
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,740
Go home and get some rest.

467
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,720
I'll bring you back tomorrow.

468
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,280
Come on!

469
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,720
I want to stay and keep him company.

470
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,720
Then I'll stay to keep you company.

471
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,160
Can you just leave me alone for a while?

472
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,680
Shen Yiqun.

473
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,960
Can you stop using

474
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,440
your concern to emotionally manipulate me?

475
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,850
It only makes things awkward between us.

476
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,720
I don't like it.

477
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,220
Can you respect me?

478
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,810
Do you understand what I'm saying?

479
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,120
I'll leave two men downstairs for you.

480
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,600
Help.

481
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,510
Help. I can't take it anymore.

482
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,970
It hurts, it hurts so much.

483
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,090
G-Get me a glass of water.

484
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,150
The doctor said your injury isn't serious.

485
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,480
Stop pretending.

486
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,420
Fine.

487
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,170
Have you been here the whole time?

488
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,290
Why are you still holding my pocket watch?

489
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,800
Thankfully, this pocket watch

490
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,000
took the stab for you.

491
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,450
Otherwise, you'd be dead by now.

492
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,830
This pocket watch

493
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,700
was left to me by my mother.

494
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,170
I never thought

495
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,070
they'd still be protecting me even now.

496
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,210
You were quite cute as a child.

497
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,980
Do you like this watch?

498
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,540
Even if you do, I can't give it to you.

499
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,270
Give it back.

500
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,790
Why?

501
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,620

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,660
Scooch over.

561
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,830
You punk,

562
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,480
are you that eager for me to die?

563
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,010
Do you have any conscience?

564
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,830
Look at you.

565
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,080
You've always been smart—

566
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,610
smarter than me at least,

567
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,000
and better educated too.

568
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,110
I really don't understand
what you're thinking.

569
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,750
Now that the national situation is
crystal clear,

570
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,110
you could do anything else,

571
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,790
but you had to pick
the most dangerous path.

572
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,850
What's going on in that head of yours?

573
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,280
You're smarter than me.

574
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,140
You're too smart for your own good.

575
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,520
What do you mean by choosing paths?

576
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,210
I'm working as a lawyer, aren't I?

577
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,760
I don't understand.

578
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,110
Keep playing dumb then.

579
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,350
I'm only saying this

580
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,340
because I see you as a brother.

581
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,000
Fine, thanks.

582
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,000
Where's Cheng?

583
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,160
How would I know?

584
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,240
He's your man.

585
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
He's my man.

586
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,380
But maybe you should ask your men.

587
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,450
Wait, what do you mean by that?

588
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,420
You suspect my men did this?

589
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,110
Without my orders,

590
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,400
who would dare do such a thing?

591
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,200
If my men did it,

592
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,830
I'd

593
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,730
throw myself off the hospital roof today,

594
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,750
headfirst to the ground.

595
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,190
Fine.

596
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,670
I'd send you a wreath by then.

597
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,410
Get some rest.

598
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,110
Did you hurt Cheng Ao?

599
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,380
Are you behind Kang Kaisheng?

600
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,250
Cheng Ao is pro-Communist.

601
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,390
Do you think I'm pro-Communist or not?

602
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,940
Young Master.

603
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,000
Being soft-hearted now
will only backfire on you.

604
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,690
If you don't make your mark now,

605
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,790
people like Shen Yiqun

606
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,800
will crush you under their feet.

607
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,730
By then, you won't even be able to
turn things around.

608
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,120
Jin.

609
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,560
Get up.

610
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,440
Are we buddies or not?

611
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,730
Yes.

612
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,980
From now on, stay out of

613
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,200
Cheng Ao's business.

614
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,430
I looked into it.

615
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,160
Cheng Ao and Zeng Dalun's fathers

616
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,400
were sworn brothers,

617
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,160
with Cheng Ao's father
being the elder one.

618
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,030
So that means

619
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,200
the former leader of this gang

620
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,650
was Cheng Ao's father.

621
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,510
Well, 10 years ago,

622
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,410
Cheng Ao's parents suddenly died,

623
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,170
and Mr. Zeng

624
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,330
naturally took over as the new leader.

625
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,440
As for Cheng Ao,

626
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,960
he became Mr. Zeng's adopted son...

627
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,160
What kind of investigation is that?

628
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,510
Everyone on the street knows that.

629
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,880
Right, I'm useless.

630
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,240
There's more.

631
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,240
Zeng Dalun gives off a dangerous vibe.

632
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,500
-He can't be controlled...
-I know that.

633
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,830
Well...

634
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,060
I think Cheng Ao is a good guy.

635
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,580
This young man

636
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,890
is ambitious,

637
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,830
compassionate,

638
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,910
and well-respected.

639
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,480
If we could get him on our side,

640
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,000
he'd be a valuable asset...

641
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,790
I know that too.

642
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,520
Tell me something I don't know.

643
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,400
I've heard rumors...

644
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,540
Cheng Ao has connections with
the Communists.

645
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,190
What did you say?

646
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,320
Some people say

647
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,820
Cheng Ao is connected to the Communists.

648
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,580
Huang, you really are useless.

649
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,180
Don't make claims without evidence again!

650
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:38,980
Yes, yes, yes.

651
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:39,960
Understood.

652
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,900
Understood.

653
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,880
That's all?

654
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,550
That's all.

655
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,790
Then why are you still standing here?

656
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,920
Yes, I'm going then.

657
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,670
Boss, we found Cheng.

658
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,600
Where is he?

659
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,970
I'll take you to him.

660
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,250
Let's go.

661
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,940
Boss.

662
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,110
Cheng.

663
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,430
You almost got me killed.

664
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,430
I'm sorry, Boss.

665
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,220
Well...

666
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,440
Jin threatened me with my family.

667
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,680
How did those people target you?

668
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,520
Remember

669
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,670
when you asked me to tail Huang Aniu?

670
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,400
Then I wasn't careful

671
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,230
and got captured by him instead.

672
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,850
Oh, right, Boss,

673
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,659
there are Japanese guys among those thugs.

674
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,739
Alright, got it.

675
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,480
Anyway, that's what happened.

676
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,210
I'll pack my things
in the next couple of days

677
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,920
and head back to the Northeast.

678
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,250
I'm too ashamed
to show my face around you.

679
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,719
I truly appreciate how
you've looked after me all these years.

680
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,290
Stop pretending.

681
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,090
I'm not pretending.

682
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,900
Can you still move around?

683
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,570
Move around...

684
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,510
I think so.

685
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,230
Why?

686
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,110
Get dressed properly.

687
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,840
I'm taking you out for noodles.

688
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,550
Noodles, really?

689
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,840
Yeah.

690
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,370
We didn't get to
eat them that day, did we?

691
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,190
Don't worry, Boss.

692
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,440
If those guys show up today,

693
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,070
I'll kick their asses for you.

694
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,400
Don't let these injuries fool you.

695
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,910
I'm tough as nails, I'm telling you.

696
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,710
Yeah, yeah, you're the tough one.

697
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,710
Wait for me, Boss.

698
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:18,860
Hello.

699
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,400
I have an appointment

700
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,840
to see Director Lin.

701
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,680
Alright, this way, please.

702
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,900
You can step outside for now.

703
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,100
I'm just going to speak with the doctor.

704
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,400
Do you understand
what it means to respect women?

705
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,060
This is a maternity hospital!

706
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,050
You go out too.

707
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,150
I just want a private word
with the doctor.

708
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:53,870
Yes.

709
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,830
What's wrong?

710
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,480
Are you feeling unwell?

711
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,510
I'm here

712
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,480
just to ask

713
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,800
if someone like me

714
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,000
can have an abortion.

715
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,970
I'm sorry, Madam Yanhong,

716
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,430
but abortion is illegal.

717
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,800
But I'm carrying a monster.

718
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,920
If I give birth to it,

719
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,030
I'll die.

720
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,080
How do you know it's a monster?

721
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,010
It's growing inside me.
How could I not know?

722
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,510
Why do you want an abortion?

723
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,030
I don't like being forced.

724
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,730
I don't love the father of this child.

725
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,380
Anyway, if you won't help me,

726
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,920
I'll go to your hospital lobby,

727
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,670
grab a pair of scissors,
and cut it out myself.

728
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,670
Do you believe me?

729
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Who are you?

730
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,610
I'm the most miserable woman in the world.

731
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,070
If you keep this up, I'll call the police.

732
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,130
Go ahead then.

733
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,400
The father of this child is so cruel,

734
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,460
and you people
who run hospitals are just as heartless!

735
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,860
Why did you come to my room?

736
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,530
Cheng Ao.

737
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,360
It was my men who hurt you.

738
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,120
It's complicated to explain
in a few words,

739
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,150
so I won't try to do it.

740
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,750
Anyway, I owe you an apology.

741
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,670
Let's put that aside for now.

742
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,130
You have Japanese people

743
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,600
working for you.

744
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,000
No way.

745
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,280
After you and our old man warned me,

746
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,080
I haven't had any contact with
the Japanese since.

747
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,320
Zeng Dalun.

748
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,470
I'm warning you one more time.

749
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,920
Stay away from anything

750
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,800
to do with the Japanese.

751
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,600
Do you hear me?

752
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,680
Why are you so long-winded?

753
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,150
I've always listened to you
since I was little.

754
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,150
Even when I don't listen to the old man,
I listen to you.

755
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,040
Look, is that woman pretty?

756
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,680
Siyun.

757
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,910
Why are you here?

758
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,000
I'm here to give Sixth Madam a check-up.

759
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,180
I invited her.

760
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,400
Miss Lin is now Shanghai's

761
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,060
most renowned gynecologist.

762
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,860
Let's go, Sister-in-law.

763
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,260
I'll take you to her room.

764
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,930
You might as well hit me for real.

765
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,220
Goodbye, Sister-in-law.

766
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,670
Let me walk you there.

767
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,000
Dr. Lin,

768
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,310
thank you for coming all the way here.

769
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,500
It's my job.

770
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,080
Please, this way.

771
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,520
Okay.

772
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,150
What seems to be the problem?

773
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,210
I suddenly bled a little today.

774
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,710
Do you think I could have miscarried?

775
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,880
We'll need to examine you
to know for sure.

776
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,280
Please, doctor,

777
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,930
could you help me
terminate this pregnancy?

778
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,540
I can't.

779
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,300
Father,

780
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,930
is Madam Yanhong alright?

781
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,150
She's fine.

782
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,940
She even performed "The Heavenly Maidens
Scattering Flowers" for me just now.

783
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,670
That's good.

784
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,880
How's your recovery?

785
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,890
I'm doing well.

786
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,480
Did the Anhui gang do it?

787
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,590
No.

788
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,150
We've found Cheng too.

789
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,880
Did he say who the attacker was?

790
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,970
We're still investigating it.

791
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,880
If you need anything from me,

792
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:11,930
just say it.

793
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,590
Father.

794
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,150
I know the Zeng family wharf isn't open
to outsiders,

795
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,480
but I'd like to borrow it

796
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,510
to transport some supplies

797
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,710
to the disaster area.

798
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,110
You silly boy.

799
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,990
What do you mean by
"borrowing our family's wharf"?

800
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,400
In the future, you'll be

801
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,590
in charge of our entire family.

802
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,760
Thank you, Father.

803
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,240
Are you fully healed from your injury?

804
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,810
Didn't you say it wasn't a serious wound?

805
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,800
I still have to ask
if you're fully recovered.

806
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,860
I'm all better now.

807
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,590
With you by my side,

808
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,700
what injury wouldn't heal?

809
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,620
I'm driving.

810
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,340
Your father's sixth concubine
wants an abortion.

811
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,450
W-what?

812
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,330
You mean Madam Yanhong?

813
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:41,860
What did she say?

814
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,670
I feel like...

815
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,910
she's being held against her will

816
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,310
in your house by Mr. Zeng.

817
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,860
She doesn't love Mr. Zeng.

818
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,050
But she can't escape even if she wants to.

819
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,410
She's pitiful.

820
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,620
But Mr. Zeng

821
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,660
can never know about this.

822
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,250
If he finds out...

823
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,400
would he kill Yanhong?

824
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,720
Do all the men in your gang

825
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,150
treat women this way?

826
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,250
Yeah, we all do.

827
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

828
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,660
I was just teasing you.

829
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,750
I was just kidding.

830
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,920
Let go.

831
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,600
Don't be mad anymore.

832
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:15,270
Alright.

833
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,770
I just like girls like you.

834
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,040
Eyes on the road.
Why are you looking at me?
