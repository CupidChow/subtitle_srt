[Episode 29]

3
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,460
Why didn't you invite your boyfriend in?

4
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,479
He just came to bring me the keys.

5
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,789
I left in a hurry and forgot to take them.

6
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,830
Beichuan has night classes
at school tonight.

7
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,870
He's quite funny.

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,060
He seems very attached to you.

9
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,120
I need to talk to him about this
when I get back.

10
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,310
That was too rude.

11
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,110
How could he come here directly?

12
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,850
What book did you say
you wanted to show me?

13
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,630
I'll go get it.

14
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,040
Is Shan Huajing home?

15
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,150
Search warrant.

16
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,840
Who is it?

17
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,860
Ms. Shan.

18
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Which one of you is Shan Huajing?

19
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,840
I am.

20
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,710
Ms. Shan,

21
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,300
if there's nothing else, I'll get going.

22
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,360
Wait.

23
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,120
What's your relationship
with Shan Huajing?

24
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,680
Why are you in her home?

25
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,630
We went to the same school.

26
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,350
She's my senior.

27
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,520
I just came to chat with her.

28
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,900
What's in your bag?

29
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,840
Open it.

30
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,270
You can go now.

31
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,740
Why are you crying?

32
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,150
I'm not feeling well.

33
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Then go home and rest.

34
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,970
We need to talk to Shan Huajing.

35
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,250
Okay.

36
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,000
Section Chief Shan,

37
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,070
I just need a quick word with Xining.

38
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,740
Xiang Beichuan, what are you doing here?

39
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,390
I'm asking you.

40
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,680
Are you crazy?

41
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,120
Jie.

42
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,710
Well,

43
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
Ms. Shan is in trouble. Did you know?

44
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,680
Okay.

45
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,440
I'll let you know once I book the flight.

46
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,200
Alright, thank you.

47
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,260
I'm hanging up now.

48
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,190
This batch of goods
has a strict time limit.

49
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,920
Sea freight takes 40 days.

50
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,190
If we wait another 30 days to send it out,

51
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,820
it'll miss the sales window.

52
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,960
Could you please

53
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,790
help us

54
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,270
talk to your supervisor?

55
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,150
Shan Huajing's case
hasn't been cleared yet.

56
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,960
All our business dealings related to her

57
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,510
are temporarily frozen.

58
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Sorry about that.

59
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,480
Okay, thank you.

60
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,670
Thank you.

61
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,050
Have you eaten?

62
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,510
Yes, I have.

63
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,600
You should go to work now.

64
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,400
Don't be late.

65
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,670
Are you...

66
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,330
I'm fine.

67
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,880
I'm alright.

68
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,200

69
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,450
What is it, Mr. Guo?

70
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,240
Congratulations on your new book.

71
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,280
Although it's your first work,

72
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,440
I can see

73
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,670
you have great literary talent.

74
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,550
Your writing is smooth,
and your ideas are profound.

75
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,270
I've read so many novels,

76
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,000
but yours is the only one

77
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,130
worth reading repeatedly—

78
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,530
it keeps me captivated.

79
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,690
Mr. Guo, you flatter me.

80
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,790
Guys, come out!

81
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,480

82
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,770
Come on!

83

Line up and get it one by one.

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,750
Hurry!

87
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,390
Okay.

88
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,720
Professor Xiang, congratulations.

89
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,630
Your work is really excellent.

90
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,440
Could you sign this for me?

91
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:36,890
Thank you.

92
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,770

93

94

Everyone, how about this?

95
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,510
Please return to the classroom now.

96
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,710
I'll see you in class.

97

99

100
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,490
May you keep writing tirelessly,
dedicating yourself fully,

101
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,160
pouring your sweat onto both the podium
and the literary world.

102
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,940

106
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,390
Here's the money you lent me before.

107
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,390
No need. Keep it for yourself.

108
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,570
I'll be away for a while.

109
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,670
Take care of yourself.

110

112
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,200
I have friends in all these places.

113
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,550
I'll leave you a phone number later.

114
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,750
If anything urgent comes up,

115
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,810
just give me a call.

116
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,890
Okay. I'll be going then.

129
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,930
Sir, I'll take ten copies.

130

Why so many?

131
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,390
Can you even read them all?

132

You don't want to be famous?

137
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,190
To be honest,

138
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,050

142
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,540
that readers can engage with,
and that's enough.

143
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,450
I'm vain.

[When I looked back,]

[Beichuan was still in the same place.]

163
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,200
you were right.

164
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
I'm really not cut out for business.

165
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,350
I've already closed down this company,

166
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,390
and the equipment in the factory
has all been mortgaged to the bank.

167
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,930
So what are you planning to do next?

168
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
I'll just accept my fate

169
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,900
and go back to my old trade—

170
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,380
the textile industry.

171
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,480
I'll open a small factory

172
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,500
and focus only on production.

173
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,090
Then in the future,
when we get stock from you,

174
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,670
you'll have to give us a discount.

175
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,630
Of course.

176
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,830
You can't make a profit from us.

177
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,270
I'll give you factory price.

178
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:03,800
Alright.

179
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,670
By the way,

180
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,849

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,829
I'm almost crippled.

185
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,589
You should rent
a single-story house next time.

186
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,680
Your leg isn't good.

187
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,109
This won't do.

188
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:22,960
Right.

189
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,160
Once you get that small factory running,

190
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,420
you'll be really busy.

191
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,590
[Mr. Lu left with ease.]

192
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,380
[This is both a farewell]

193
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,550
[and a beginning.]

194
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,200
[Xiang Beichuan,]

195
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,370
[I lost pretty badly.]

196
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,510
[All I have left
is the visa Yan Jun gave me.]

197
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,000
[I want to give it a try.]

198
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,730
[I hope I can succeed.]

199
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,940
[Let's]

200
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,750
[break up.]

201
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,820
[I hope everything goes well for you.]

202
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,240
[One year later]

203
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,810
Xiang Beichuan!

204
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,640
I've missed you so much!

205
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,030
Did you miss me?

206
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,960
I didn't.

207
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,780
You're lying.

208
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,480
Why would I lie to you?

209
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,740
Why didn't you miss me?

210
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,290
Why should I miss you?

211
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,480
I went to the old house looking for you.

212
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,850
Why did you move out?

213
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,640
Yes.

214
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,860
I moved out.

215
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,400
Why are you looking for me?

216
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
To date you.

217
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,230
I've made money.

218
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,060
I've made lots and lots of money.

219
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,210
Come on. Let's go to the mall.

220
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,380
The outfit you're wearing
is the one I bought you before.

221
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,450
I'll get you a new one,

222
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,210
a designer brand,

223
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,410
and pair it with a bag.

224
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,870
Tonight, we'll go out to eat

225
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,480
at the best restaurant in Shanghai.

226
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,880
Order whatever you want.

227
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,450
Let's go.

228
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,610
What's wrong with you?

229
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,790
[Fuxing Restaurant]

230
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,060
Mr. Yan.

231
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,440
Come, have a seat.

232
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,030
How's the jet lag?

233
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,510
Not so good.

234
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,180
Have you seen Xiang Beichuan?

235
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,820
Yes, I have.

236
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,370
How did it go?

237
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,610
Pretty well.

238
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Pretty well, huh?

239
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,480
I ordered

240
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,640
sweet and sour spare ribs

241
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,750
and smoked fish for you.

242
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,350
They're all your favorites.

243
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,900
The taste hasn't changed.

244
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,580
They haven't changed their chef?

245
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,780
It's still Chef Liu.

246
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,240
Mr. Yan, I heard

247
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,680
you're still working at the old house.

248
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,960
You're such an accomplished entrepreneur—

249
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,760
why didn't you move
to a top-tier office building?

250
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,200
I quite like the old house

251
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,270
because

252
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,970
it holds so many wonderful memories.

253
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,830
How about you?

254
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,750
Where are you working
now that you're back?

255
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,310
I had Jiuling renew the lease

256
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,570
on Mr. Lu's old office.

257
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,190
One reason is convenience;

258
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,690
another is that

259
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,960
I started my business here before,

260
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,540
and now that I'm back,
I want to start fresh here again.

261
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,270
Looks like we're both sentimental people.

262
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,600
We're still neighbors.

263
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,480
We'll have to help each other out at work.

264
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,080
Don't worry. If there's anything I can do,

265
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,160
just let me know.

266
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,030
During this past year,

267
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,360
have you been in touch with Beichuan much?

268
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,940
He and his senior
opened a cultural company.

269
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,460
I wonder how it turned out.

270
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,950
I haven't kept in touch
with Beichuan much.

271
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,550
I invite you to dinner,

272
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,160
and you don't ask how I'm doing

273
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,580
but keep asking about Xiang Beichuan.
That's not appropriate.

274
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,840
I was just about to ask.

275
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,030
How have you been?

276
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,010
Not good.

277
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,350
I've been single all this time.

278
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,590
That can't be true.

279
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,720
You're so handsome

280
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,550
and charming,

281
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,230
surrounded by beautiful women.

282
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,290
You're the least likely to be single.

283
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,610
I've been single in spirit all this time.

284
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,320
It's just that
I've had a lot of social events.

285
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,480
Alright,
it's been a year since we last met.

286
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,200
We've caught up enough.

287
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,210
Are you hungry?

288
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,200
Waitress.

289
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,770
Hurry up with the dishes.

290
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,570
Alright, sir.

291
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,850
Li.

292
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,750
Mr. Yan.

293
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,370
Xining is back.

294
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,510
Take good care of her.

295
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,040
Alright.

296
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,400
Split it between you two.

297
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,310
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Yan.

298
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,240
Enjoy your meal.

299
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,020
You really deserve your name.

300
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,500
This is the new

301
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,460
clothing export company I set up
after coming back.

302
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,350
Take a look

303
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,540
and see
if you're interested in collaborating.

304
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,790
Whatever your first deal is

305
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,850
after coming back,

306
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,360
I'll fully support you.

307
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,150
I'll toast you with tea.

308
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,750
Just have some wine—why tea?

309
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,840
I can't. I'll be driving later.

310
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,690
Fine,

311
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,930
tea it is.

312
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,720
Beichuan.

313
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,310
I'm here.

314
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,320
If you're thirsty,
pour yourself some water.

315
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,870
Why are you living here?

316
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,160
I'm seeking inspiration among mortals.

317
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,360
What are you talking about?

318
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,240
Mortals?

319
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,030
Are there immortals?

320
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,200
You're classifying people

321
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,900
into different ranks.

322
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,280
I need to criticize you for that.

323
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,480
You have a point.

324
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,800
There's quiet within the noise,

325
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,610
and noise within the quiet—

326
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,200
it's good for your writing.

327
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,880
But

328
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,040
living here

329
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,590
means no girls will come by.

330
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,590
If you ever get a girlfriend,

331
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,450
how could you live here like this?

332
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,830
Who says a man

333
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,560
must have a woman by his side?

334
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,030
And who says a woman

335
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,300
must have a man?

336
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:22,030
You're not going to say
you like me next, are you?

337
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,360
Get lost.

338
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,260
I saw Ye Xining today.

339
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,740
She's back.

340
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,180
How did she react when she saw you?

341
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,570
She ran over to me from far away

342
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,790
and gave me a hug.

343
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,350
That's great!

344
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,110
It means she still loves you.

345
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,550
I don't know.

346
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,140
I still don't understand

347
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,710
why she was so determined

348
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,350
to break up with me a year ago.

349
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,030
You're driving me crazy
with this attitude.

350
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,230
Do you still love her?

351
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,060
Of course not.

352
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,680
Bro,

353
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,670
you're quite something.

354
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,790
I've been hesitant to tell you this,

355
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,440
but from the very beginning,

356
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,840
I felt you two
weren't right for each other.

357
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,020
Why?

358
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,040
Why?

359
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,210
It's a feeling I can't explain.

360
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,980
You two need to figure it out yourselves.

361
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,860
I have a cousin

362
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,140
who teaches at a university.

363
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,730
I think you should meet her.

364
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,510
Really.

365
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,640
I think she's someone

366
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,240
who could live with you
in a partition room.

367
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,110
Just think—

368
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,590
in summer,

369
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,510
you ride your little bike with her

370
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,350
to go grocery shopping

371
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,400
or watch a movie.

372
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,710
She'd feel so happy.

373
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,900
She's not that materialistic.

374
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,540
Do you think

375
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,880
the differences between women

376
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,920
can be that big?

377
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,880
Of course.

378
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,680
What about between men?

379
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,040
It's the same.

380
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,920
I don't think so.

381
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,270
Xiang Beichuan...

382
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,000
This little house is just a storage now.

383
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,750
Nobody lives here.

384
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,310
I made some money and moved out.

385
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,240
You're going to live here
now that you're back?

386
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,830
Yes.

387
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,530
You'll live here?

388
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,330
Alright then.

389
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,720
I'll clean it up for you tomorrow.

390
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,830
Then you can move in.

391
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,450
Okay.

392
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,160
Now that you're back from Europe,

393
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,310
who's handling the shipments?

394
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,880
I hired two people over there

395
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
to handle our shipments.

396
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Will that work?

397
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,630
They're very professional.
There's no problem.

398
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,160
Xining,

399
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,510
tell me the truth.

400
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,950
Why did you really

401
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,080
come back this time?

402
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,110
If it's for work,

403
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,030
you didn't need to come back at all.

404
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,230
So it must be for love.

405
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,360
You came back for Beichuan.

406
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,290
I didn't come back for him.

407
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,440
Xining,

408
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,270
I read a book the other day,

409
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,170
and it said some really good things.

410
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,570
It said that

411
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,120
a woman shouldn't imagine a man
as perfect,

412
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,570
because he can't be perfect in real life.

413
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,490
That would just put too much pressure
on him.

414
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,240
For a woman,

415
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
if she loves too intensely,

416
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,550
she becomes too sensitive.

417
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,960
Even the tiniest crack

418
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,200
gets magnified by her.

419
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,550
And what about men?

420
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,960
It's the same.

421
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,030
Think about it—

422
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,640
if a man treats you like a goddess—

423
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,410
but you're not actually a goddess

424
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,070
and have so many flaws—

425
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,680
doesn't that make you exhausted
and under a lot of pressure?

426
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,030
And his love

427
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,480
will also be intense.

428
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,580
Then he'll become very sensitive.

429
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,310
Then

430
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,200
even the tiniest crack

431
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,740
will get magnified by him as well.

432
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,510
So are you saying

433
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,060
men and women

434
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,520
shouldn't love too intensely?

435
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,270
No.

436
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,510
Then what are you saying?

437
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,640
Love is about managing

438
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,620
and exercising restraint.

439
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,110
Mr. Guo,

440
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,970
I believe this is my class.

441
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,070
Professor Xiang.

442
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,160
Come here.

443
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,160
Beichuan,

444
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,750
about the apartment,

445
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,860
I've always been grateful to you.

446
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:51,960
Today,

447
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,200
they insisted I substitute for you.

448
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,740
I said I wouldn't come,

449
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
but everyone in our department

450
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,790
insisted.

451
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,830
They said only my teaching skills

452
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,640
are on the same level as yours.

453
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,510
Mr. Guo,

454
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,700
you're substituting for me?

455
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,400
I know about

456
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,140
that thing of yours.

457
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,000
Others might think

458
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,450
it's kind of shady,

459
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,110
but to me,

460
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,660
you're very brave

461
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,310
when it comes to love.

462
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,130
I've always thought
you're a truly genuine person.

463
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,270
What thing?

464
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,340
How come I don't even know about this
myself?

465
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,400
Love in Partition Room.

466
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,330
Love in Partition Room?

467
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,930
Professor Xiang,
could you come out for a moment?

468
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,480
It's been a pleasure working with you.

469
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,550
Thank you.

470
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,750
I hope we can work together again.

471
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,590
Sure thing.

472
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,310
Take care, Mr. Liu.

473
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,030
Alright.

474
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,720
Take care.

475
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,680
How is it?

476
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,880
How's the booth?

477
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:04,720
Look.

478
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,850
Ours is a step higher than the others'.

479
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,510
Normally, that would make it 5,000 yuan
more expensive,

480
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,020
but I got it without adding a cent.

481
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,070
It was mainly because
your products are good.

482
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,480
The brand you represent is great.

483
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,590
That's why our products sell well.

484
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,350
That's why they gave us the best spot.

485
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,960
Right?

486
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,590
Alright, Jiuling.

487
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,880
Stop praising me.

488
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,880
We're going to do better and better.

489
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,680
Right now,

490
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,480
I'm going to build my own brand.

491
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,750
I'm currently
looking for a factory location.

492
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,550
Don't worry.

493
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,790
I'll work with you from now on.

494
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,400
Of course. We make such a great team.

495
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,200
That's right.

496
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,400

497
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,590
have a seat.

498
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,210
Mr. Zhong, what's going on?

499
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,940
I need to get back to class.

500
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,030
You should

501
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,240
take a look at this first.

502

[Zhuohua]

503
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,280
Mr. Zhong,

504
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,489
I'm resigning.

505
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,550
Beichuan,

506
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,960
you're a young teacher
I personally selected.

507
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,710
I have

508
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,010
high expectations for you.

509
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,650
And now you're resigning?

510
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,400
You're not Yan Jun.

511
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,560
You don't know how to do business.

512
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,389
Jobs are hard to find these days.

513
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,400
If you resign,

514
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,270
how will you survive?

515
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,070
Mr. Zhong,

516
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,969
I think what you said about me is right.

517
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,030
I am indeed sometimes too rigid.

518
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,630
And as you said,

519
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,880
as a teacher,

520
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,960
it's not enough to just know my subject—

521
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,290
I should also know
how to deal with people.

522
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,030
But to be honest,

523
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,860
I don't really want to learn that,

524
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,350
and I don't want to be too sophisticated.

525
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,460
Can you forgive me?

526
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,240
Don't worry.

527
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,550
I'll submit a formal resignation

528
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,360
to the department later,

529
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,790
and I hope you'll approve it.

530
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,190
Downstairs are our summer items,

and this is the fall collection.

532

But it's our best-selling item
in the store.

533
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,550
Do you have any in season?

534
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,480
In season?

535
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:53,920
Yes.

Well, Jiuling,

540
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,550
could you go take a walk outside?

541
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,280
I need to have a word with Xining.

542
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,080
That won't do.

00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,760
I'm staying with Xining.

544
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,670
Just sit down and say it.

-I'm not an outsider.
-It's okay. Just say it.

00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,710
How could she write such nonsense?

00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,090
Hugging and... kissing?

565
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,890
She's just a kid.

566
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,710
Look at how she wrote about me.

567
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,140
It says I just want sex every night

568
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,440
and that I'm like a horny dog.

569
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,010
Good thing she didn't mention me.

570
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,480
"There's always an old woman
following the girl around..."

571
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,920
What is this?

572
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,070
What nonsense is this?

573
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,420
This is all made up.

574
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,960
We know it's all made up,

575
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,730
but the readers and the school

576
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,710
don't.

577
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,630
Beichuan can't get fired over this,

578
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,400
right?

579
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,140
Getting fired
would be the mildest punishment.

580
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,000
I have to go and see this Tong Tong.

581
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,040
Do you have her contact info?

582
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:28,970
Not right now,

583
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,630
but I should be able to find it.

584
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,590
Xining,

585
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,840
aren't you on bad terms with Beichuan

586
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,230
after you came back from abroad?

587
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,430
Do you still like him?

588
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,890
I don't like him.

589
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,310
Then why are you helping him?

590
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,240
Didn't she call you an old woman?

591
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,320
Scold her.

592
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,510
Find her address.

593
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,850
Such a despicable person.

594
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,760
This kid.

595
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,330
You can sit over there.

596
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,030
Miss Ye?

597
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,770
What are you doing here?

598
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,030
We're good friends of Professor Xiang.

599
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,360
We called you here today

600
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,150
to figure out how to handle
this situation.

601
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,800
How's Professor Xiang doing?

602
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,000
I called the school.

603
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,920
He's already resigned.

604
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,710
How could this happen?

605
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,480
Didn't you know

606
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,550
this would happen

607
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,280
when you were writing
that so-called novel?

608
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,630
I was writing a novel.

609
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Novels are purely fictional.

610
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,730
Who would actually take it
as being about themselves?

611
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,250
But you mixed real people's looks, jobs,

612
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,340
and personalities

613
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,190
with fictional plots.

614
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,670
It's impossible not to make people think
it's about a specific person.

615
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,130
And you included all of us.

616
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,480
Yes.

617
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,080
You even wrote that I'm like a horny dog.

618
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,740
We barely know each other.

619
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,190
I didn't write about you.

620
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,150
You're the one reading yourself into it.

621
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,680
It has nothing to do with me.

622
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,760
Tong Tong,

623
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,570
we've consulted a lawyer.

624
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,900
If a lot of people believe

625
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,670
your novel is about a specific person,

626
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,190
and that person suffers
negative consequences

627
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,590
because of your work,

628
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,000
they could sue you

629
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,080
for defamation.

630
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,760
I don't know these things.

631
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,800
I thought that as long as
I put at the beginning of the novel,

632
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,210
"This story is purely fictional;

633
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,110
please don't read yourself into it,"
it would be fine.

634
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,710
Besides,

635
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,670
Professor Xiang is such a good person.

636
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,320
How could I possibly harm him?

637
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,360
Professor Xiang

638
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,910
has now resigned because of you.

639
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,690
Back when you were selling shirts
in the school dorm,

640
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,960
Professor Xiang
used his school apartment quota

641
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,820
to protect you,

642
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,800
so you didn't get punished by the school.

643
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,880
What did you say?

644
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,880
You can check with the school
if it's true or not.

645
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,080
What you need to do now

646
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,150
is write a formal statement

647
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,110
clarifying that the story's main character
isn't Xiang Beichuan.

648
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,040
That way, even though he resigned,

649
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,670
he won't be too embarrassed

650
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,150
when he meets his old colleagues

651
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,610
or students in the future.

652
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,000
I know.

653
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,280
I'll do it.

654
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,960
I don't need you to tell me that.

655
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Don't act like you're the only one
who cares about him.

656
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,350
What are you here for?

657
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,880
Professor Xiang...

658
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,710
I'm sorry.

659
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,030
I don't accept your apology.

660
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,050
You can go back to class now.

661
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,580
I've already been disciplined
by the school.

662
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,460
Professor Xiang,

663
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,670
here's...

664
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,670
here's all my royalties.

665
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,580
I'm giving it all to you.

666
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,800
It's all because of me

667
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,320
that you lost your job.

668
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,580
Take it, just to get by.

669
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,670
Stop following me.

670
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,190
Do you really have to keep ruining me

671
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,790
over and over
until I'm completely disgraced?

672
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,000
I don't.

673
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,280
Xiang Bei...

674
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,570
Stop following me.

675
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,230
Tong Tong,

676
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,390
are you really going to destroy

677
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,060
the last bit of student-teacher bond

678
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,980
we have left?

679
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,630
I...

680
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,590
As a girl,

681
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,490
I hope you can show some self-respect.

682
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,760
Alright.

683
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:47,560
Can we still be friends?

684
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,920
Are you out of your mind?

685
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,620
No!
