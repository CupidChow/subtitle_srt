[Episode 25]

3
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,229
Ms. Shan.

4
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,310
Section Chief Shan.

5
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,570
Why are you still here?

6
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,860
I was waiting for you to finish work.

7
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,970
It's so hot out here.

8
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,509
Why didn't you wait inside?

9
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,810
There are too many people inside.

10
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,940
I was afraid I might disturb your work.

11
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,370
There were some things

12
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,870
I didn't feel comfortable
saying in your office.

13
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,760
I actually wanted to…

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,890
Let's not talk here.

15
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,240
Let's go somewhere else.

16
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,240
Okay.

17
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,400
Ms. Shan.

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
You and our politics teacher, Mr. Qi,

19
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,490
were in the same grade, right?

20
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,030
You look

21
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,960
at least 10 years younger than him.

22
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,520
What's your secret?

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,400
I mean, you're so young,

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,870
yet you're already
a division-level official.

25
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,870
Section-level.

26
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,710
Oh, a section-level official.
That's so impressive!

27
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,360
I need to learn from you

28
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,710
and seek your guidance.

29
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,520
Where are you from?

30
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,810
Your Mandarin is so standard.

31
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,040
You must be from Beijing, right?

32
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,240
I wanted to develop my career in Beijing,

33
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,430
thinking there were
more opportunities there.

34
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,750
Kunshan, Suzhou.

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,190
You're from Kunshan?

36
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,520
Kunshan is such a beautiful place.

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,470
The air is fresh too.

38
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,360
There's an ancient town
I've visited several times.

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,310
Every time I go there, I feel

40
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,750
it has such rich cultural heritage.

41
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,000
You asked me to out

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
just to talk about these?

43
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,630
Ms. Shan.

44
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,060
I...

45
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,520
I actually wanted to ask you for a favor.

46
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,150
I left the government system

47
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,810
and just started in business.

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,960
I really value this job.

49
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,280
Our factory isn't big,

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,880
but it supports many people.

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,800
If this deal doesn't go through,

52
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
we might not be able to pay salaries.

53
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,680
Our department has rules.

54
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,090
I'm someone who follows procedures.

55
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,010
Asking me to come here to discuss business

56
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,340
is inappropriate.

57
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,870
Yes.

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,030
I'll book a private room
at a restaurant tomorrow.

59
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,750
It allows more privacy.

60
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,120
What's your favorite food?

61
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,280
Our staff cafeteria is quite good.

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,670
I have other matters to attend to.

63
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,670
I'll be going now.

64
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,840
Ms. Shan.

65
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,080
That's a nice necklace.

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,310
Is it a designer brand?

67
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,170
Is it platinum?

68
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,240
No,

69
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,600
a classmate brought it for me from abroad.

70
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,300
What are you doing?

71
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,600
I want to give it to you.

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,270
No, no.

73
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,680
It looks good on you.

74
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
It suits you well.

75
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,200
Why is there a power outage?

76
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,830
Ye Xining.

77
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,600
Ye Xining.

78
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,240
Ye Xining, wake up.

79
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,800
Wake up.

80
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,240
Why did you drink so much?

81
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,360
Jiuling.

82
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,390
Jiuling.

83
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,040
Jiuling.

84
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,750
Wake up.

85
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,020
Where are the keys?

86
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,160
Ye Xining.

87
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,159
Ye Xining, wake up!

88
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,480
The keys!

89
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,740
I'm looking for the keys, okay?

90
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,370
The keys.

91
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,430
You look small and skinny.

92
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,560
Why are you so heavy?

93
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,190
Hang in there.

94
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,380
Let me pull harder.

95
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,270
You and

96
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,150
Shan Huajing are together.

97
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,120
Who am I together with?

98
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,080
Shan

99
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,790
Huajing.

100
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,010
I'm together with Shan Huajing?

101
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,840
Do a magic trick for me.

102
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,450
I don't know any magic tricks.

103
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,230
Then, tell me a joke.

104
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,390
What kind of joke?

105
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,380
Sing a song.

106
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,970
You're drunk.

107
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,390
Sleep on.

108
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Sit down.

109
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,390
I need to tell you something.

110
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,550
Go ahead.

111
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,960
Lie down.

112
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,200
What?

113
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,910
Lie down.

114
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,120
How can I do that?

115
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,390
Lie down!

116
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,150
I can't do that.

117
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,860
Lie down.

118
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,270
I-I'm lying down.

119
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,240
I'll hold you.

120
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,200
D-Don't!

121
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,670
This is inappropriate!

122
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,150
Thank you.

123
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,840
Go ahead and cry,

124
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,150
if it makes you feel better.

125
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,920
You're awake.

126
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,730
I bought breakfast.

127
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,240
What are you staring at? Eat up.

128
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,550
Miss Ye.

129
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,120
Last night...

130
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
What's your relationship
with Shan Huajing?

131
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
After you gave her the envelope,

132
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,870
she rejected me.

133
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,350
What did you give her?

134
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,510
Money?

135
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,650
How much did you pay her?

136
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,960
Not money?

137
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,790
Right. The envelope wasn't that thick.

138
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,480
Property deed?

139
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,200
That can't be.

140
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,480
Surely not.

141
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,050
That's too expensive.

142
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,250
Too high a price.

143
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,870
Shan Huajing has a son.

144
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,440
You know?

145
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,740
He's in middle school.

146
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,480
It's possible that you gave her

147
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,670
an acceptance letter
to a prestigious high school.

148
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,650
Am I right?

149
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,790
Good for you, Yan Jun!

150
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,440
You are something.

151
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,510
This is clearly a case of bribery,

152
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,320
which should not be encouraged.

153
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,790
But it got the job done.

154
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,790
Miss Ye,

155
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,390
you came to my place last night…

156
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,550
Did I come here?

157
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,480
Yes, you did.

158
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,230
Did I really?

159
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,790
Yes, you did.

160
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,580
I didn't.

161
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,130
You were dreaming.

162
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,980
I was dreaming?

163
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,850
You were dreaming.

164
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,590
Was I dreaming?

165
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,510
You must have been dreaming.

166
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,610
I must have been dreaming.

167
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,440
You dreamed about me.

168
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,790
What's your dream about?

169
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,170
Don't daydream!

170
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,940
I was dreaming.

171
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,210
Purse.

172
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,630
Purse!

173
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,670
Here.

174
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,330
Eat while they're hot.

175
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:18,990
Goodbye.

[Fuxingzhai Restaurant]

177
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,240
Madam.

178
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,270
Hello.

179
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,360
How's your business lately?

180
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,080
Thanks to you,

181
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,120
it's good.

182
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,200
The usual. Two packs.

183
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,670
Okay.

184
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,240
Since it's thanks to me,

185
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,510
shouldn't you give me a lighter?

186
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,600
Of course.

187

Have you eaten?

Yes, I have.

By the way, Mr. Yan,

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,270
I have something

194
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,790
I'd like to ask you about.

195
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,250
Go ahead.

196
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,200
Are you

197
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,080
and Section Chief Shan at the customs

198
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,670
on good terms?

199
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,290
We're okay.

200
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,190
Why do you ask?

201
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,840
Well, it's...

202
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,630
I...

203
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,550
You…

204
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,260
want to befriend Section Chief Shan?

205
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,030
Here's what we'll do.

206
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,910
I'll arrange a gathering in a few days

207
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,670
and invite Section Chief Shan
to join us for dinner.

208
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,960
Would she be willing
to have dinner with me?

209
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,000
With me there,

210
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,400
it won't be a problem.

211
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,440
Thank you so much, Mr. Yan.

212
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,830
It's nothing.

213
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,840
Madam.

214
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,670
this lady will pay

215
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,510
the two packs of cigarettes.

216
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,840
Okay. Okay.

217
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,200
Consider it tuition.

218
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,030
No problem.

219
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,510
Here.

220
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,750
Here you go.

221
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,550
Thank you.

222
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,300
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

223
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Professor Xiang.

224
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,870
Professor Xiang.

225
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,510
This is...

226
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,610
Let me introduce.

227
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,690
This is...

228
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,510
No need to introduce.

229
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,270
You just said

230
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,200
she's Tong Tong.

231
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,790
Just introduce me directly.

232
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,720
This is Miss Ye.

233
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,470
Miss Ye.

234
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,200
Ye Xining.

235
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,200
Hello.

236
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,630
Please, have a seat.

237
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,490
Let's sit down.

238
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,790
Professor Xiang,

239
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,120
this is my new essay.

240
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,320
Could you take a look at it?

241
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,580
I can review it for you.

242
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,190
Don't you need to use the bathroom?

243
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:24,910
Go ahead.

244
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,670
Excuse me.

245
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,360
So,

246
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,570
Miss Ye, you're a teacher too?

247
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:38,910
Yes.

248
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,090
What year are you in?

249
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,450
Junior year.

250
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,670
You're 21?

251
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,910
Twenty.

252
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,870
How old are you, Miss Ye?

253
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,000
A bit older than you.

254
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,630
Indeed,

255
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,490
you do look quite mature.

256
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,040
What's wrong with your eyes?

257
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,640
My eyesight is excellent.

258
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,950
I'm not nearsighted.

259
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,150
Miss Ye.

260
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,920
How long have you known Professor Xiang?

261
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,200
Not very long,

262
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
just a few months.

263
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,069
No wonder

264
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,950
Professor Xiang has never
mentioned you to me.

265
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,550
But from what I just heard,

266
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,319
Professor Xiang Xiang

267
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,490
must talk about me to you often, right?

268
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,849
He just mentioned you.

269
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,270
Here, Tong Tong,

270
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,240
try this.

271
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,770
It's the cola
Professor Xiang loves the most.

272
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,710
Miss Ye,

273
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,440
I've known him for 3 years.

274
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,350
As for him,

275
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,940
I have some right to speak.

276
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,030
He doesn't have

277
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,020
many female friends at school.

278
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,700
Nor is he close to any girl.

279
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,110
But I think he treats me differently.

280
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,270
We often chat together,

281
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,030
especially about literature.

282
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,720
Whenever he talks about literature,

283
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,050
he becomes so eloquent.

284
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,680
Some people might find it boring

285
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,830
and don't like hearing him
talk about these things,

286
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,920
but I'm different.

287
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,110
I especially love hearing him talk.

288
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,510
Miss Ye,

289
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,720
what do you usually talk about
when you're together?

290
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,230
We don't talk about these things.

291
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,880
When we're together,

292
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,330
I wash his shirts

293
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,240
and pants.

294
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,640
When I'm hungry at night,

295
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,970
he makes noodles for me.

296
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,590
No wonder!

297
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,930
Last time when I went for a walk
with Professor Xiang,

298
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,160
I noticed that

299
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,750
his clothes smelled particularly nice.

300
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,310
Miss Ye,

301
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,710
what brand of detergent do you use?

302
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,460
When did you go for this walk?

303
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,750
Professor Xiang.

304
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,070
How's it?

305
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,310
What were you two talking about?

306
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,610
Nothing much.

307
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,120
Walking. Chatting.

308
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,660
What do you mean?

309
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,350
Professor Xiang, you must be hungry.

310
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,350
Let's order food.

311
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,160
Tong Tong,

312
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,030
about what Miss Ye just said...

313
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,430
Tong Tong said
you often take her for walks.

314
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,480
You said those things just now?

315
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,510
No, I...

316
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,570
Have we ever done any of those things?

317
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,480
Tong Tong.

318
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,060
I hope you can face your problems.

319
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,690
This isn't the first time, right?

320
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,480
I think our relationship

321
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,310
is just an ordinary

322
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,170
teacher-student relationship.

323
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,390
It's inappropriate for you to say that.

324
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,400
Although we learn academic knowledge
at school,

325
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,860
developing moral values is also important.

326
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,020
One should seek truth from facts,

327
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,960
be sincere,

328
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,160
and be honest, right?

329
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,510
You say these things at school,

330
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,790
and you tell my friend outside of school

331
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,720
the same things.

332
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,270
Do you know what kind of impact

333
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,720
that might have on me?

334
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,510
No…

335
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,510
Please stop

336
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,920
thinking about all these random things

337
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,220
and telling everyone about them.

338
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,050
I didn't!

339
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,110
I haven't!

340
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Could she be gone to jump off a building?

341
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,070
No.

342
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,810
This isn't the first time she's done this.

343
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,950
I'm sorry about that,

344
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,600
but I still need to thank you

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
for helping me so much today.

346
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,500
Well,

347
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,270
what would you like to eat?

348
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,270
Order whatever you want.

349
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,270
This meal is on me.

350
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,680
I'm not eating.

351
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,680
She has already made me lose my appetite.

352
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,920
Eat by yourself.

353
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,270
Jiuling?

354
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,030
Professor Xiang.

355
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,100
What brings you here?

356
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,960
Are you here to look for Yan Jun?

357
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,400
No, no.

358
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,270
I'm here to see you.

359
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,200
Please sit down.

360
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,480
I came here to

361
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,910
show you something special.

362
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,720
Take a look.

363
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,030
Jeans?

364
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,810
Can you recognize them?

365
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,600
These are from that water-damaged batch.

366
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,800
Xining redesigned them.

367
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,880
They're selling really well out there now.

368
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,830
It's truly turning trash into treasure.

369
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,720
They're so fashionable to wear.

370
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,920
When young men wear them,

371
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,120
they look so stylish.

372
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,630
So, I brought one pair specially

373
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,760
to give to you.

374
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,680
But Jiuling,

375
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,640
this isn't appropriate.

376
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,800
Why not?

377
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,270
What's wrong with me
giving you a pair of jeans?

378
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,600
It's perfectly normal.

379
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,380
When you walk around campus

380
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,750
or standing on the sports field,

381
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,110
hands in pockets,

382
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,680
your students will see you and think,

383
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,070
"My teacher is so stylish!

384
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,200
That's so cool!"

385
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,920
If they like the jeans,

386
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,880
you can refer them to me.

387
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,690
Jiuling,

388
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,310
didn't Xining tell you?

389
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,110
What?

390
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
I'm not teaching at school anymore.

391
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,240
You've left?

392
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,350
That doesn't matter. Take them anyway.

393
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,640
This is my sincere gift.

394
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,920
It's just for you.

395
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,070
Take them.

396
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,200
Alright, thank you.

397
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,470
No worries. We're practically family.

398
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,830
Now, the two of us

399
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,310
are selling jeans

400
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,830
at Qipu Road Market.

401
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,830
It's just a stall.

402
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,720
Xining has never experienced
such hardship before.

403
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,160
She used to have such delicate skin,

404
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,290
but now her face is all tanned and dark.

405
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,270
And when it comes to selling,

406
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,880
she doesn't know how to sell
or how to call out to customers.

407
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,720
She's too shy.

408
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,400
When someone finally wants to buy
and tries to bargain,

409
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,310
she gets upset.

410
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,110
"If the price isn't right, I won't sell."

411
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,640
Isn't bargaining normal?

412
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,270
So, we don't sell anything
and suffer for nothing.

413
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,200
This situation,

414
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,710
isn't it heartbreaking?

415
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,590
Jiuling.

416
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,000
Now…

417
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,410
How about this:

418
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,420
I'll buy five pairs of jeans from you.

419
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,880
Really, Professor Xiang?

420
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,060
This is such a big favor.

421
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,720
I thank you on behalf of Xining.

422
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,400
No need.

423
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,240
Then, I'll

424
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,670
tell her to close the stall right away.

425
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,440
We'll call it a day.

426
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,750
Today's mission is accomplished.

427
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,240
Okay.

428
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,760
Where did you go?

429
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,160
I went to sell jeans.

430
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,550
How many did you sell?

431
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,320
Buy five, get one free.

432
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,640
Guess who I sold them to?

433
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,240
Who?

434
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,920
I'm not telling you.

435
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,030
Stop chatting.

436
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,380
I have two things to announce.

437
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,920
I have good news and bad news.

438
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,720
Which one would you like to hear first?

439
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,520
The good news.

440
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,520
The bad news.

441
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,510
Can't you wish us something good for once?

442
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,680
She picked the good news.

443
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,400
All there's left for me is the bad news!

444
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,000
Did you even give me a choice?

445
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,210
Our loan has been approved.

446
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,750
That's great news!

447
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,200
What's the bad news then?

448
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,350
Mr. Chen's batch of
sand-washed silk fabric...

449
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,590
He won't sell it to us anymore!

450
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,440
Why?

451
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,790
He said...

452
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,720
the manager from your former workplace,

453
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,450
Director Jin, has withheld it.

454
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,790
That Director Jin...

455
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,220
I'll go talk to him.

456
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,440
Forget it! You?

457
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,640
You've already been fired!

458
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,510
You think you can solve the problem?

459
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,370
You think he'll do you this favor?

460
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,590
I'll go.

461
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,480
People...

462
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,290
should know their limits.

463
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,230
Listen to that.

464
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,880
You're going to be
the death of me someday.

465
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,920
Could it be as simple as you think?

466
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,880
You think he'll see you
just because you show up?

467
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Who do you think you are?

468
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,810
Do you hear that?

469
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,070
Ye.

470
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,820
We'll still need you to make the trip.

471
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,680
I'll go find him.

472
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,350
Ye, come in.

473
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Thank you for coming down to meet me.

474
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,310
You're a guest now.

475
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,370
It's only natural that I welcome you.

476
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,080
Come, Ye, have a seat.

477
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,610
I heard that recently,

478
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,640
you've been doing quite well in business.

479
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,350
You must've made a fortune with Lu.

480
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,590
It's not that impressive.

481
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,110
We're just a small private business.

482
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,720
We'll need your continued support
in the future, Director Jin.

483
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,110
You're being modest.

484
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,270
Would you like some tea?

485
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:33,930
No, thanks.

486
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,270
Wang Li,

487
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,440
go to the store and get Ye a soda.

488
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,120
Sure thing!

489
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,540
You can have a soda in a moment.

490
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,520
Director Jin,

491
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,440
that batch of sand-washed silk
for our company

492
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,750
still hasn't been approved.

493
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,550
I heard it's being held up by you.

494
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,310
What are you talking about?

495
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,040
I don't have that kind of power.

496
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,270
I do know about that matter, though.

497
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,830
Mr. Chen wants to raise the price.

498
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,310
After hearing the opinions
from the bureau,

499
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,640
he decided to wait a while before selling.

500
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,170
But don't worry.

501
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,750
Did you sign a contract?

502
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,400
Yes, we've even paid the deposit.

503
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,790
That makes things easier.

504
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,520
I'll ask about it at the bureau.

505
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,410
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

506
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,280
Thank you so much, Director Jin.

507
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,360
We were colleagues. No need for thanks.

508
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,240
Here, Ye,

509
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,920
have a soda.

510
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,070
Thank you, Li.

511
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,700
You're welcome.

512
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,090
Here, have some soda.

513
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,590
But there's something

514
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,220
I need to discuss with you.

515
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,170
Please go ahead.

516
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,310
A factory overseen by our bureau

517
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,710
has a batch of towels, bed sheets, etc.

518
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,880
They were all for foreign aid,

519
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,270
so they're definitely of good quality.

520
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,400
There are some left.

521
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,030
The factories are all
trying to generate income,

522
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,890
so they asked me

523
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,000
if I knew of any sales channels.

524
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,070
As you know,

525
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,920
foreign trade is booming now.

526
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,110
Selling our Chinese
light industrial textiles

527
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,370
to the European market

528
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,170
can more than double the price.

529
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,310
I think this is a good opportunity,

530
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,770
so I'm asking if
your company is interested.

531
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,830
Director Jin, I'm just an employee.

532
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,680
I'll have to ask our boss, Mr. Lu,

533
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,720
and discuss it with him.

534
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
I'll get back to you.

535
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,510
I understand.

536
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,240
Alright, I'll wait for your news.

537
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,830
Okay.

538
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,530
Ye,

539
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,790
remember,

540
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,750
it's such a great opportunity,

541
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,110
and I thought of you first.

542
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,110
Isn't that right?

543
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,790
Yes, thank you, Director Jin.

544
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,070
Well, I won't stay any longer.

545
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,110
I should hurry back

546
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,840
and tell him about this matter.

547
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,510
Okay.

548
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,920
I'll take the soda with me.

549
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,350
Okay.

550
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,030
Let me walk you out.

551
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,110
It's fine. You don't need to see me out.

552
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,880
I know the way.

553
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,240
Well then, take care, Ye.

554
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,880
Take care.

555
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,210
If what he said is true,

556
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,550
it's good quality and low priced,

557
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,240
why would they work with

558
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,700
a small company like ours?

559
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,750
They're just taking advantage of us.

560
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,960
Yes, Mr. Lu.

561
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,260
We can't listen to him.

562
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,830
We've done market research.

563
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,590
The best-selling products
in Eastern Europe right now

564
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,640
are clothes.

565
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,270
Bed sheets and towels won't sell at all,

566
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,470
or they would've sold them themselves.

567
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,350
If we take these goods,

568
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,280
what would we do if they don't sell?

569
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,880
We'll be stuck then.

570
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,440
What can we do?

571
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,310
We're just not powerful enough.

572
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,350
We might as well use this opportunity

573
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,010
to build a good relationship
with Director Jin.

574
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,250
Although I hate him too.

575
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,700
Let's leave it at that.

576
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,280
Is the director male or female?

577
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,400
Female.

578
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,760
She's very young, in her twenties.

579
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,080
Why don't you go then?

580
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,270
No, why?

581
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,200
You have to go. I'm counting on you.

582
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,110
You should sing that…

583
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,960
Lady White Snake for them.

584
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,440
Stop it.

585
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,350
Enough.

586
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,340
Sorry to keep you waiting.

587
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,930
Thank you for your trouble.

588
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,400
Let me introduce you.

589
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,880
Hello.

590
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,200
This is Professor Xiang, Xiang Beichuan.

591
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,730
He teaches at a university.

592
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,030
Professor Xiang.

593
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:44,930
Hello.

594
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,590
Hello.

595
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:47,790
Please sit.

596
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,450
Please sit.

with honesty, not empty talk,

600
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,750
so there are some things

601
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,790
I need to tell you.

602
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,320
This project is a good thing,

603
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,350
but you need to move quickly.

604
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,590
Well...

605
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,720
I can only say we'll do our best.

606
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,200
Yin,

607
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,480
show them the agreement.

608
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,240
Thank you.

609
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,750
Yin

610
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,830
will be representing us

611
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,550
in all dealings with you from now on.

612
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:34,470
Yin was the top humanities student
in our county's college entrance exams.

613
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,350
His English is excellent.

614
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,550
He can be your translator in the future.

615
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,470
How does that sound?

616
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,400
That's great.

617
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,880
Perfect.

618
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,160
So, Yin, right?

619
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,330
You'll teach the workers English.

620
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,480
And Professor Xiang, standard Mandarin.

621
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,680
You two together make a powerful force.

622
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,620
How great!

623
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,790
Mr. Yin,

624
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,880
in which year did you take
the college entrance exams?

625
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,740
Which university did you attend?

626
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,480
A key university.

627
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
Professor Xiang,

628
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,830
which university

629
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,480
do you

630
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,000
teach at?

631
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,910
Tonghua Normal University.

632
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,560
It's also a key university.

633
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,120
But I've recently taken unpaid leave.

634
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,000
Yes, he has

635
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,400
specially taken time off

636
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,960
for our project.

637
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,510
This is truly the best combination!

638
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,020
Great. Great!

639
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,160
Yeah.

640
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,000
This works.

641
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,520
Director Jin is a bit shrewd,

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,810

644
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,590
and duvet covers

645
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,990
before he approves our sandwashed fabric,

646
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,880
but

647
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,080
we got the sandwashed fabric after all.

648
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,500
So, we don't lose.
We can actually make a profit.

649

Whose idea was this?

650
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,000
It was my idea.

651
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,920
I even told Ye

652
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,480
that we should take this opportunity

653
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,400
to build a good relationship
with Director Jin.

654
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,270
See? That's why you're the boss.

655
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,920
Smart thinking.

656
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,030
This kills two birds with one stone.

657
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,160
Come on, take a look.

What's that smell?

659
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,940
It's like green onions

wrapped in dead rat skin
and dipped in sauce.

661
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,790
Fishy, stinky, spicy, and rancid.

just take a small portion of it.

00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,570
Sir, a piece of newspaper.

757
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,380
Okay.

758
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,480
Hello, ma'am.

759
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,630
Excuse me,

760
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,160
where does Yu Dongjun live?

761
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,230
Ma'am, may I ask

762
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,760
where Yu Dongjun's home is?

763
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,370
It's right here.

764
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,090
Are you Yu Dongjun?

765
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,480
Yes, that's me.

766
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,320
Could you come out for a moment?

767
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,370
What's it about?

768
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,640
Did you write this for the newspaper?

769
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,360
Why did you do this?

770
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,030
Dad.

771
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,100
You're back.

772
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,650
You're living with my mom.

773
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,000
What are you doing here?

774
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,250
My dad told me to tell Jiang Jiuling

775
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,450
that she has no shame.

776
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,940
Why did you do this?

777
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,120
Go inside first.

778
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Do you know how much this affects me?

779
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,030
Making something out of nothing!

780
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,070
What do you call this?

781
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,800
It's called spreading rumors!

782
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,200
Do you have any evidence?

783
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,210
I'm talking to you!

784
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,290
What's going on?

785
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,120
Why are you here?

786
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,650
See for yourself.

787
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,760
The newspaper told me

788
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,490
it was written by your husband.

789
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,910
You wrote this?

790
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,590
I didn't.

791
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,080
It wasn't him.

792
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,630
Do you have proof?

793
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,400
That's right.

794
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,280
You're spreading rumors and defaming me.

795
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,110
I'm going to sue you!

796
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,000
Sue me?

797
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,150
Let me tell you.

798
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,880
I'm being nice by not suing you!

799
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,050
He knows what he did!

800
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,490
Ask him yourself.

801
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,200
Hua, you go out now.

802
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,840
Are you crazy, Yu Dongjun?

803
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,190
What grudge does she have against you?

804
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,520
Why did you slander her?

805
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,480
I wasn't trying to target Ye.

806
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,880
I just can't stand that guy, Lu.

807
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,960
I wanted to curse him, make him feel sick,

808
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,360
and ruin his reputation!

809
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,650
If I don't vent this anger,

810
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,780
I'll suffocate.

811
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,640
I'm a man!

812
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,830
Do I have money? No!

813
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,240
As for my house,
it's just a few square meters!

814
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,130
What's wrong with me cursing rich people?

815
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,570
I just need to vent!

816
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,230
I earn honest money through hard work.

817
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,340
What are you doing?

818
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,440
I don't care if you die!

819
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,000
If you act like this in public,

820
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,440
how are my son and I supposed to live?

821
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,700
How can we face others?

822
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,480
You work overtime every day

823
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,070
and even stay at the company every night.

824
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,880
Who knows what you're really doing?

825
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,960
Were you shopping at the newly opened
Pacific Department Store

826
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,480
with that Lu a few days ago?

827
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,480
Let me tell you,

828
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,010
my cousin happened to be there that day.

829
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,260
He saw Lu holding your hand!

830
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,880
Lu holding my hand?

831
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,670
Don't make false accusations.

832
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,270
I'm telling you, Yu Dongjun.

833
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,190
We can't live together anymore.

834
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,800
Mr. Lu and I are relatives!

835
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,030
He's my factory director!

836
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,980
Isn't it normal for us
to look at fabrics together?

837
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,260
Explain yourself!

838
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,840
That Lu has a wife and kids too.

839
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,510
Why is he always with you?

840
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,250
You're convinced
we have that kind of relationship, right?

841
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,250
Fine. We can't be together anymore.

842
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,820
We're over, Yu Dongjun!

843
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,440
I've had enough!

844
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,590
Don't go!

845
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,320
What?

846
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,050
Don't leave!

847
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,870
Explain yourself before you go!

848
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,140
Get lost!

849
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,960
Don't go!

850
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,590
Mom!

851
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,270
Come back!

852
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,070
Mom!

853
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,210
My mom told me to give you this.

854
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,230
It's compensation
for your emotional distress.

855
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,710
This is the money
my mom earned from her stall today.

856
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,510
It's all here.

857
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,710
I don't want your money.

858
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,440
Take it back.

859
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,160
What do you want to do then?

860
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,620
I don't want anything.

861
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,130
Why did your dad do that?

862
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,150
Because we're poor.

863
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,130
My dad wasn't like this before.

864
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,440
Do you think

865
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,650
Jiuling will be angry with you?

866
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,670
I don't know
whether I should be angry with her

867
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,870
or feel sorry for her.

868
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,940
I think she'd rather have you hate her

869
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,560
than have you pity her.

870
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,320
Yes.

871
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,900
Jiuling is a proud person,

872
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,510
but does that mean I should be slandered?

873
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,480
Of course not.

874
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,100
But you won't mind.

875
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,310
Because no one will believe the rumors.

876
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,280
You can't represent everyone.

877
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,480
You're a nerd.

878
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,480
I'll tell you one last time.

879
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,280
I'm not a nerd.

880
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,360
I understand you.

881
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,880
I will always be on your side.

882
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,320
Close your eyes.

883
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,360
Why?

884
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,040
Just do what I tell you to do.

885
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,660
I didn't warn you.

886
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,190
You're…

887
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,790
not upset, are you?

888
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,440
If keeping my eyes closed like this

889
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,750
means you'll keep kissing me,

890
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,790
that would be nice.

891
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,470
Alright.

892
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,130
Then, keep them closed.

893
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,460
Don't open them.

894
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,950
Ye Xining.

895
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,670
Um...

896
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,630
You just kissed me.

897
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,890
If we follow

898
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,070
the natural

899
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,710
progression of things,

900
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,280
then next,

901
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,000
shouldn't we...

902
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,640
I didn't expect

903
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,920
you to be so naughty.

904
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,110
I-I mean...

905
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,110
Shouldn't we

906
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,230
go out for a meal?

907
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,980
Rascals aren't scary.

908
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,920
What's scary is

909
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,370
an educated rascal.

910
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,080
When you kissed me just now,

911
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,250
my eyes were closed.

912
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,360
What?

913
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,150
You want another kiss

914
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,010
with your eyes open?

915
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,610
Eyes are the windows to the soul,
you know.

916
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,400
You should sue Yu Dongjun!

917
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,030
Sue him!

918
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,230
Wrong way!

919
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,630
Sorry. Sorry.
