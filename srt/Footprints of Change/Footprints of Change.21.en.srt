[Episode 21]

3
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,590
Hello, Mr. Wen.

4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,759
Hello.

5
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,150
You're here.

6
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,660
I called you many times
but couldn't get through.

7
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,000
I knew you must be busy.

8
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,290
I was planning to visit you
after submitting my manuscript.

9
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,960
Let me make you some tea.

10
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,630
No need.

11
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,490
I have to leave soon.

12
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,960
In such a hurry?

13
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,590
I came to see you.

14
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,800
Besides,

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,260
I want to give you a hug.

16
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,840
What happened?

17
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,190
Nothing.

18
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,970
I've just been too busy lately

19
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,090
so that I can't visit you often.

20
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,990
No matter how busy you are,
you should take care of yourself

21
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,470
I will.

22
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,400
You should take good care of yourself too.

23
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,840
I will.

24
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,400
Well,

25
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,840
I have to go.

26
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Let me see you out.

27
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,120
No.

28
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,360
Carry on with your work.

29
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,500
Are you going to sit there?

30
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,430
Here.

31
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,250
Get some fresh air.

32
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,159
Before I came here,

33
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,480
I called Jiang.

34
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,920
Everyone at home is doing fine.

35
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,800
Huzi

36
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,120
pulled a female classmate's braid

37
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,650
and got reported to the school
by her parents.

38
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,050
Among all your sons,

39
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,740
Huzi resembles you the most.

40
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,670
That little rascal takes after me.

41
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,650
He is as mischievous as I am.

42
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,630
In the future,

43
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,870
please help me keep an eye on him.

44
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,310
Yes.

45
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,000
Scholar.

46
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,240
Thank you.

47
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,750
I heard that

48
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,380
for my sake,

49
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,120
you've asked every officer

50
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,800
in the entire division for help.

51
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,270
Yes.

52
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,080
I've borrowed money
from everyone I know.

53
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,730
I also learned that

54
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,040
as long as I can repay the money,

55
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,390
it will be beneficial for me.

56
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,460
That's right.

57
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,390
I've borrowed most of it already.

58
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,320
I'll figure out how to get the rest.

59
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,650
By the way,

60
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,070
this afternoon,

61
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,810
Ms. Fang mentioned that

62
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,830
she

63
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,600
discussed with Political Commissar Yan.

64
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,460
He will also help find a solution.

65
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,190
So, don't worry.

66
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,310
Don't carry such a heavy burden.

67
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,830
I'm not worried.

68
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,870
It's fine even if you can't
raise the money.

69
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,130
At worst, I'll stay here a few more years.

70
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,960
I can start over after I get out.

71
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,600
Bullshit! You're such an idiot.

72
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,430
If you had listened to me earlier,
things wouldn't have developed like this.

73
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,240
Alright.

74
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,870
I read your self-criticism letter.

75
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,550
It was quite sincere.

76
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,160
But there are

77
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,390
typos

78
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,920
and grammatical mistakes.

79
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,120
You have correct to them.

80
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,580
The wording is imprecise.

81
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,530
I'll fix it.

82
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,430
I'll make whatever changes you suggest.

83
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,230
Now you're listening to me, huh?

84
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,180
I've always listened to you.

85
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,420
From now on,

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,460
I'll seriously reflect on myself

87
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,890
and turn over a new leaf.

88
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,690
Don't worry.

89
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a good time

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
for you

91
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,830
to calm your mind here

92
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,290
and read more books.

93
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,390
Reading books. You always say

94
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,190
through diligent study,

95
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,140
you can gain wealth and...

96
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,920
Be imprecise again.

97
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,210
Don't misuse phrases.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,530
Ms. Fang said she would visit you
in a few days.

99
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,390
She'll come here.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,330
Jiang and I will also visit you regularly.

101
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,460
If you need anything, let me know.

102
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,360
I'll bring it for you.

103
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,970
Actually, I'm doing fine here.

104
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,240
I don't need anything.

105
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,240
Chief,

106
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,270
time's up.

107
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,360
Don't worry.

108
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,960
I'll figure everything out.

109
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,300
-Go back.
-Go back.

110
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,680
I'm leaving.

111
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,510
Scholar.

112
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,100
My watch

113
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,440
has been

114
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,190
running inaccurately.

115
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,720
Fix it for me again.

116
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,930
Okay.

117
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,490
I'll bring it back next time I come.

118
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,630
Hello?

119
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,870
It's me.

120
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,800
Xiurong.

121
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,410
Hangong, he...

122
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,460
What happened?

123
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,320
Hangong passed away.

124
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,659
He hanged himself with a belt.

125
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,870
He left a note for you,

126
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,030
saying he couldn't live like this.

127
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,630
It's too shameful.

128
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,440
Mrs. San.

129
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,800
Where is Minister Wen?

130
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,040
He's in the study.

131
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,230
Once he starts working, he is untiring.

132
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,330
What's in this bag?

133
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,510
I brought tablecloths, mattress pads,

134
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,390
and curtains.

135
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,920
You should live a decent life.

136
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,960
We have to change the curtains?

137
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,380
Look, the curtains are torn.

138
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,330
He doesn't get a say in this.

139
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,660
I'll make the decision.

140
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,240
You know, Secretary Zhao

141
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,710
served in the same troop as Minister Wen.

142
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,030
Why are they so different?

143
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,000
Secretary Zhao understands
the principle that

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,510
only by living well can one work well.

145
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,630
Yes, yes.

146
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,070
Come help me.

147
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,790
Let's change the curtains first.

148
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,360
Okay.

149
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,200
Look, Mrs. San. Isn't it beautiful?

150
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,950
It's beautiful. Very beautiful.

151
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,830
Right?

152
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,950
In life,

153
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,110
you should be frugal where necessary.

154
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,510
But where it's not needed,

155
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,480
you don't need to be hard on yourself.

156
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,410
Make sure you're comfortable
where it counts.

157
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,670
How can he keep sleeping on that hard bed?

158
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,790
If he refuses,

159
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,490
when Secretary Zhao comes,

160
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,440
we'll persuade him together.

161
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,470
Zhao Hangong made a mistake.

162
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,330
What do you want to learn from him?

163
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,310
Right is right.

164
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,410
Wrong is wrong.

165
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,410
A Party member should stand firm
in his position.

166
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,510
What is this? What is this?

167
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,240
I don't need these things.

168
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,710
I don't need these to decorate my life.

169
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,960
I don't need these.

170
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,270
I don't need it. I don't need it.

171
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,670
Don't need it.

172
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,520
Get out!

173
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,950
Get out!

174
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,380
[Shanghai Municipal People's Government]

175
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,460
Director Fang.

176
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,670
Come in.

177
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,720
Remember this.

178
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,390
How can I help you?

179
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,850
This is Political Commissar Yan,
my husband.

180
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,240
He was also Wen Pu's former Chief.

181
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,870
Hello, Mr. Yan.

182
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,510
Perhaps

183
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,200
I should come back another day.

184
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,910
It's fine.

185
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,720
There are no outsiders here.

186
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,520
Just tell me what's on your mind.

187
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,630
I wanted to ask

188
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,830
if something happened to Minister Wen.

189
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,000
Minister Wen is fine.

190
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,490
It's Zhao Hangong.

191
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,820
He passed away

192
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,140
last night.

193
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,600
He passed away?

194
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,030
How could this happen?

195
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,960
I saw Secretary Zhao a few days ago.

196
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,790
Did he

197
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,920
have some kind of acute illness?

198
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,980
It seems Minister Wen
hasn't told you anything.

199
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,390
Your mindset

200
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,840
and Minister Wen's

201
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,580
have never been on the same level.

202
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,550
So, he would rather torture himself

203
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,290
than let you share his burden.

204
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,940
If Rumei were here,

205
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,850
Wen Pu would definitely have told her.

206
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,120
Hello?

207
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,240
Ms. Xia?

208
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,510
Okay.

209
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,270
I'll be right there.

210
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,300
What happened?

211
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,160
Minister Wen has been taken
to the hospital.

212
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,360
What happened to him?

213
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,750
He might have accidentally fallen

214
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,840
and hurt his back.

215
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,480
Yi.

216
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,670
You can't visit him now.

217
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,030
Let him have some peace

218
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,600
and recover.

219
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,300
It's an old injury from his time
on the battlefield.

220
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,040
It's fine.

221
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
You didn't know about this, did you?

222
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,050
Why do you know nothing?

223
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,000
Alright, go back now.

224
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,960
I need to go check on him too.

225
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
[All this time,]

226
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,750
[I thought I understood
Wen Pu better than anyone.]

227
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,000
[I believed we were partners]

228
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,130
[facing all difficulties together.]

229
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,190
[But when he was at his most vulnerable,]

230
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,300
[he chose to hide it from me.]

231
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,690
[Whether it's the death of
his close friend]

232
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,300
[or his physical pain,]

233
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,420
[he chose to bear it alone.]

234
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,790
[I realized I've never entered]

235
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,120
[his inner world.]

236
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,550
Madam.

237
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:52,890
Excuse me,

238
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,290
who are you?

239
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
I'm Zhou Yunqing.

240
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,290
I'm bringing something for Minister Wen.

241
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,440
Come in, come in.

242
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,010
Please.

243
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,910
Thank you.

244
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,670
Sir.

245
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,800
Zhou.

246
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,360
my sister asked me to bring you something.

247
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,600
Where is she?

248
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,120
She left.

249
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,010
Where did she go?

250
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,810
Northwestern region.

251
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,120
She left the plasters for your back pain.

252
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,790
She also made some clothes
for Yuanyuan and Changjiang.

253
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,390
Which part of the Northwest?

254
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,570
She didn't tell me.

255
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,780
When did she leave?

256
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,150
This morning.

257
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,210
I took her to the train station.

258
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,030
Sir.

259
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,340
I'll leave these things here.

260
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,200
I'll leave now.

261
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,830
Because I feel those heroes and gods

262
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,360
are all too distant from me.

263
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,720
Apollo

264
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,240
loved Marpessa.

265
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,160
He promised her immortality.

266
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,150
But she gave up immortality.

267
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,070
She chose her own kind.

268
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,830
She said she was just an ordinary person.

269
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,920
She wanted to grow old with her husband.

270
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,480
I think the ancient Greeks

271
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,920
are truly remarkable

272
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,180
to have such awareness

273
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,750
in love and marriage.

274
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,420
[Six months later]

275
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,090
Who is it?

276
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,550
Mr. Yang, it's me.

277
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,000
Coming.

278
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,810
Comrade Yunqing,

279
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:55,920
hello.

280
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,280
I come to visit you
on behalf of the committee.

281
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,140
Please come in.

282
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,260
Comrade Yunqing, you must be hungry.

283
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,150
If you haven't eaten,

284
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,000
I can cook for you.

285
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,680
No need.

286
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,850
I brought you some food.

287
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,850
I made it myself.

288
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,950
I can cook now.

289
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,970
Comrade Yunqing,

290
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,650
I'm so glad

291
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,640
that

292
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,350
you came to see me.

293
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,810
Did you hear anything?

294
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,950
You must have heard it.

295
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,610
I won't hide it from you.

296
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:32,970
The committee

297
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,640
asked me to take a few days off.

298
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,610
But I think it's unnecessary.

299
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,880
You know me well.

300
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,480
Not being allowed to work
will make me sick.

301
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,750
It's really absurd.

302
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,110
The committee moved my home
from the fourth floor to the first floor

303
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,670
in the name of caring about me.

304
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,830
What kind of care is that?

305
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,360
Mr. Yang, please calm down.

306
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,750
The committee cares about you very much.

307
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,950
You need to rest well.

308
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,900
Only with proper rest can you
work effectively.

309
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,790
Yes.

310
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,390
But I'm feeling perfectly fine.

311
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,070
Comrade Yunqing.

312
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,100
I want to apologize to you.

313
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,680
Last time,

314
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,790
you mentioned my mother.

315
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,680
Due to that,

316
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,210
I lost my temper.

317
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,070
I spoke harshly

318
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,590
and said some harsh words to you.

319
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,830
I want to apologize to you.

320
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,400
But

321
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,730
my apology

322
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,160
is not meant to salvage anything.

323
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,960
Mr. Yang.

324
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,160
You are with great inner strength.

325
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,480
No matter what difficulties you face,

326
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,280
I believe you can overcome them.

327
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,420
I brought you a folk remedy for insomnia.

328
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,550
Give it a try.

329
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,550
If you still can't sleep,

330
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,480
I'll search for another solution.

331
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,960
I have something to attend to.

332
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
I'll be going now.

333
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,850
I'll visit you again when I have time.

334
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,480
Yunqing.

335
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,400
I'm a bit scared.

336
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,700
When you're not working,

337
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,070
please spend more time with me

338
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,270
and talk with me more,

339
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,790
okay?

340
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,120
The doctor said you should not
drink alcohol.

341
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,970
Wait until you're better.

342
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,010
Take care, Mr. Yang.

343
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,510
How did I end up like this?

344
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,440
Qing.

345
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,320
Yi, you're back!

346
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,440
-Xiurong.
-Yi.

347
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,290
We've been waiting for you to come back.

348
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,330
Did you miss me?

349
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,570
Missed you terribly!

350
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,880
Yi.

351
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,750
On your trip to the Northwest,

352
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,280
which places did you visit?

353
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,400
I traveled all over
the Northwest this time.

354
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,200
Was it fun?

355
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,160
The local people are simple and sincere.

356
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,570
They were all very kind to me.

357
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,030
It gave me many new inspirations
for my work.

358
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,360
Was the food delicious?

359
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,210
You only care about food, huh?

360
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,790
Yi,

361
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,850
congratulations.

362
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,640
Your design at the exhibition

363
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,070
received unanimous praise.

364
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,880
Many senior leaders will

365
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,270
attend the meeting.

366
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,000
Really?

367
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,310
Ms. Yi.

368
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,530
I'm really sorry.

369
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,350
After you left, this place

370
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,480
became a reading room
for the female workers.

371
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,440
But don't worry.

372
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,900
I'll have them clean it up soon

373
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,270
and restore it to how it was for you.

374
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,110
Don't bother.

375
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,680
I'll leave after the meeting.

376
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
For these few days

377
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,050
I'll stay at Qing's place.

378
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,680
I went on a field trip.

379
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,300
The factory has been giving me funds
for research trips.

380
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,960
It makes me feel a bit embarrassed.

381
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
The factory doesn't have the money.

382
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,860
It must be from someone
who cares about you.

383
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,850
You'll leave right after the meeting?

384
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,790
I got accepted into graduate school.

385
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,480
Really?

386
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,130
You're going back to school?

387
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,790
I like the campus environment.

388
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,660
I have class this afternoon.

389
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,110
Come with me and look around?

390
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,640
Okay.

391
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,480
Let's go now.

392
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,590
Now?

393
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,120
Come on.

394
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,130
Goodbye, Xiurong.

395
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,020
Bye, Xiurong.

396
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,610
This is your classroom.

397
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,900
They're having class.

398
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,980
Go to class.

399
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,200
I'll just look around by myself.

400
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,960
No,

401
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,480
I want to show you someone.

402
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Today's lecture

403
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,640
See?

404
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,720
is about Chinese traditional culture

405
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,550
and ancient Greek civilization.

406
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,350
Minister Wen sometimes teaches
at the university

407
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,510
because someone told him the story

408
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,480
of

409
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,270
Mar…

410
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,590
Anyway, a story of a goddess.

411
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,070
Marpessa.

412
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,070
Yes.

413
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,110
Was it you who told him that story?

414
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,110
Some students ask me a question.

415
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,200
We are Chinese。

416
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,570
China has 5,000 years of civilization.

417
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,570
Why do we need to study
ancient Greek civilization?

418
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,110
What I want to say is

419
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,070
that ancient Greek civilization

420
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,330
is the origin of European civilization.

421
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,290
And in the course
of historical development…

422
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,680
Mr. Wen.

423
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,310
Everybody.

424
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,360
Please study by yourselves for a while.

425
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,730
You're back.

426
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,510
I'm back.

427
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,440
You won't leave, right?

428
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,750

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,430
[neither Wen Pu nor I ever expected]

464
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,090

00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,110
How have you all been lately?

467
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,060
I asked you to come here

468
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,260
because I have something to tell you.

469
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,870
We want to cut ties with you.

470
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,920

471
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,230

472
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,540
Tell my father that

473
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,660
my daughter won't take his surname
anymore.

474
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,880
She'll take her mother's surname

475
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,210
and be called Ye Xining.

476
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,910
He won't be upset about

477
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,710
his granddaughter not taking his surname.

478
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,650

trouble for you.

00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,750
Is it okay for us to

[Shanghai, 1993]

489
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,250
You were so fond of your grandfather then.

490
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,810
You followed him around all day,
asking him to play with you.

491
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,000
I remember my grandfather was so funny.

492
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,070
He read me a very thick book,

493
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,880
called "Jean-Christophe".

494
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,350
When he read it to me,
I couldn't understand it.

495
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,560
So, I fell asleep.

496
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,310
I miss Grandpa a bit.

497
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,920
That day,

498
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,330

When I got to the door,

501
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,530
I only saw the ambulance
taking Grandpa away.

502
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,810
I didn't get to see Grandpa one last time.

503
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,160
He left me a letter

504
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,750

to our country.

511
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,960
It's a pity

512
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,330
that Grandpa didn't see me go to college.

513
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,370

541

I don't think you teach literature.

542
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,120
You'd teach math. You're so calculating.

We'd like you to cooperate
with our investigation.

After that,

563
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,850
did you manage to contact Huang Yahui?

Even the police can't find her.

565
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,710

That's true.

567
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,040
Shang Yunfei has disappeared too.

568
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,880
How did things

569
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,200
get to this point with those two?

570
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,930
Now we can only hope they
turn themselves in soon.

571
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,590
Why would they embezzle money?

572
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,650
Were they that desperate for cash?

573
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,270
Shang Yunfei is a stock trader.

574
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,770
Police said he misappropriated funds
to trade stocks

575
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,030
and lost a huge amount.

576
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,000
So he married Yahui

577
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
just to use her for money?

578
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,190
What a bastard!

579
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,760
Your classmate is a scum.

580
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,590
No.

581
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,000
Try not to think the worst of him.

582
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,330
I'd rather believe they were desperate.

583
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:33,760
Xining,

584
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,320
how did your wedding dress fitting go?

585
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,780
It looks beautiful.
I'll let you see it later.

586
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,980
Let me introduce you.

587
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,480
This is Xining, Ye Xining,

588
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,360
my best friend,

589
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,760
and also my maid of honor.

590
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,000
Beichuan. His name is Xiang Beichuan.

591
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,239
He's Yunfei's best friend.

592
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,190
He'll be our groomsman,

593
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,050
as well as our wedding officiant.

594
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,670
Nice to meet you.

595
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,800
Nice to meet you too.

596
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,699
Beichuan is a professor
of Chinese literature.

597
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,560
He is a scholar.

598
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,440
I'm just a teacher, not a professor.

599
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,760
Nothing to brag about.

600
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,070
There's nothing to be modest about.

601
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,670
Your friend is quite honest.

602
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,480
Xining is also quite remarkable.

603
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,590
The position
of Shanghai Textile Bureau headquarters

604
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,840
never accepted female candidates before.

605
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,770
But they made an exception for her.

606
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,920
You're too remarkable.

607
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,210
Why don't you stay for dinner?

608
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:16,890
No need.

609
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,280
I have some matters
to attend to at school.

610
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,630
Come on, we've all been busy all day.

611
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,730
You've worked hard too.

612
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,160
Next time.

613
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:23,840
Alright then,

614
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,190
next time.

615
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,670
Okay.

616
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,530
I'll leave now.

617
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,130
Okay.

618
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,280
Bye.

619
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,840
Let's have dinner together next time.

620
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,480
Okay.

621
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,000
Let's go.

622
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,190
Is this dress really okay?

623
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,760
Doesn't it make my waist look thick?

624
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,400
Not at all.

625
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,130
Your proportions are perfect.
It looks beautiful.

626
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,520
Isn't this color too bright?

627
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,380
Not at all.

628
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,260
You'll be the most beautiful bride.

629
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,710
I was worried I wouldn't look good
in this dress.

630
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,760
Look at your perfect figure.

631
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,190
If it were me, I couldn't even
fit into it.

632
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,550
You're teasing me.

633
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,670
It really looks beautiful.

634
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,590
I do love this place.

635
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,510
Your grandmother used to live here.

636
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,280
Then your grandma must have been
quite wealthy.

637
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,410
These old Western-style houses,
at the Republican era,

638
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,070
were all owned by wealthy families.

639
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,600
Well, from what she told me,

640
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,000
her family was quite wealthy back then.

641
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,110
But later her father squandered
their wealth

642
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,510
and even sold the house.

643
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:13,880
However,

644
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,800
my grandmother worked here for some time

645
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,000
and this is the place she fell in love
with my grandfather.

646
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,590
I remember you told me

647
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,880
your grandparents had a happy marriage.

648
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,190
So if I live here,

649
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,480
I'll be happy too, right?

650
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,630
Absolutely.

651
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,030
I wish you an early arrival
of a precious child.

652
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm not ready yet.

653
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,150
Although,

654
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,590
Though
I've been looking forward to this day,

655
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,000
when it's actually here,

656
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,030
I'm still...

657
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,350
Still nervous, right?

658
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,110
You'll understand when it's your turn.

659
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,480
I'll throw the bouquet to you first,

660
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,000
okay?

661
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,630
That's great!

662
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,510
Pass this good luck to me.

663
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,110
I'll pass it to you right now.

664
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,940
Everything was fine at first.

665
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,990
She seemed to cry
in the middle of the night.

666
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,760
I was so tired

667
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,110
that I didn't even bother to get up
and comfort her.

668
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,840
I thought she was just excited.

669
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,730
If that's the case,

670
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,920
Shang Yunfei was indeed

671
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,200
acting a bit strange during that time.

672
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:10,960
Once,

673
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,000
we college classmates
were drinking together.

674
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,400
He was the only one
who didn't touch a drop of alcohol.

675
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,800
That day, my US visa had just
been approved.

676
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,710
I was probably too excited

677
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,440
and didn't pay attention to it.

678
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Professor Zhong,

679
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,260
I have good news for you.

680
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,000
My visa has been approved.

681
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,450
That's impossible.

682
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,110
US visas are so hard to get.

683
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,190
Beichuan, I'm happy for you.

684
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,230
Shang Yunfei

685
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,960
borrowed 60,000 yuan from the Faculty

686
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,760
using my name.

687
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,550
The Faculty demanded

688
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,810
that I repay the money within two months.

689
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,590
Because of this,

690
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,390
my trip to America fell through.

691
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,010
The school also suspended my classes.

692
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
That's terrible for you.

693
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,500
Yahui told me

694
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,760
that Shang Yunfei needed temporary funds
for his business

695
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,400
and he could pay it back within a month.

696
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,510
That's why I guaranteed for her.

697
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,110
You even guaranteed for her?

698
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,590
How much did you guarantee?

699
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,480
50,000 yuan.

700
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,540
So what happened to the money?

701
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,480
Did you pay it back?

702
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,860
My grandmother gave me a pocket watch.

703
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,820
I sold it.

704
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,580
No, I pawned it

705
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,290
and used that money to pay the money back.

706
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,380
A watch worth 50,000 yuan?

707
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,300
Seems like your family is well-off.

708
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,400
If we're comparing,

709
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,000
you're much luckier than me.

710
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,080
My monthly salary is only 200 yuan,

711
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,380
and the school suspended my classes.

712
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,960
I might soon have to

713
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,630
ask my classmates

714
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,200
to help me find a way out.

715
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,440
Has your work been affected?

716
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,840
Yes. Things are not good.

717
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,550
But I have to stay positive.

718
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,950
Don't follow my example.

719
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,130
What happened to you?

720
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:49,940
I'm fine.

721
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,480
I just took a swim in Suzhou Creek.

722
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,190
But I made it to shore.

723
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,820
Seems like you're a good swimmer.

724
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,070
Well,

725
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,230
what should we order?

726
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,540
Would you like a drink?

727
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,210
No, thanks. You go ahead.

728
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,450
Would you like a cola?

729
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,770
No, thank you.

730
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,850
Boss, a mung bean popsicle please.

731
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,880
I'll be going back by the end of the year.

732
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,800
Don't worry.

733
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,070
Are you doing well with food and
accommodation there?

734
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,370
Good. Just tell me if you need more.

735
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,370
I'll mail it to you right away, okay?

736
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,600
Excuse me, could you hurry up?

737
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,860
Why are you rushing me?

738
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,970
Who were you talking to just now?

739
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:43,900
What do you want?

740
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,270
What are you doing?

741
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,760
Do you know who I am?

742
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,550
No, I don't.

743
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,730
I'm the boss of Junlong Company
on the second floor.

744
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:53,600
Got it?

745
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,820
Anything else?

746
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:57,900
No, nothing.

747
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,070
Then get going.

748
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,670
I'm sorry.

749
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,550
What are you sorry for?

750
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,950
Who are you apologizing to?

751
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,880
He's apologizing. How dare you talk
to him like that?

752
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,560
What are you doing here?

753
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,820
I asked what you're doing here.

754
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,970
I paged you.

755
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,530
Why didn't you call me back?

756
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,800
Everyone of importance in Shanghai

757
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,590
uses a cell phone.

758
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,260
No one uses pagers anymore, bro.

759
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,710
Besides, I gave you my number last time.

760
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,970
Why didn't you call me?

761
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,590
You never gave me your number.

762
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,920
Of course I did.

763
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,040
You were too drunk to remember, right?

764
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,630
Get a pen and paper.
I'll write it down for you now.

765
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,150
Okay, okay. No need.

766
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,360
Besides, when you got here,

767
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,160
why didn't you come up to find me?

768
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,150
You only told me where you are.

769
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,400
You never told me your room number.

770
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,070
I told you the room number.

771
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,550
You forget everything when you drink.

772
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,080
What's with all this stuff?

773
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,200
What's going on?

774
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,990
All these bags. Are you moving?

775
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,840
What's that?

776
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,760
Don't touch it.

777
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,480
This is the only

778
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,930
valuable thing I have.

779
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,590
You actually have something valuable?

780
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,360
Let me see.

781
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,420
Don't mess with it.

782
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,550
It's the most advanced personal computer.

783
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,210
You've never seen one.

784
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,600
Chuan.

785
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,190
If you had money to buy it,

786
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,230
you should have bought a cell phone.

787
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,000
Now that you've left school,

788
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,770
you need to network.

789
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,970
How will you contact them?

790
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,420
By pager

791
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,600
and then stand around here?

792
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,080
I told you many times.

793
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,840
You need brains, business smarts.

794
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,920
Enough.

795
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,710
Why are you so nagging?

796
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,330
Hurry up and take me
to get something to eat.

797
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,160
I'm starving.

798
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,340
Sure. Chinese or Western,
whatever you want.

799
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:30,780
Let's go.

800
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,680
You're treating?

801
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,480
Wait a minute.

802
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,290
Why should I treat?

803
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,580
I bought you plenty of meals
when I was in school.

804
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,960
Now you're a big boss.

805
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,610
Why don't you treat one meal for me?

806
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,780
Let's go. You're my bro.

807
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,030
Let's go.

808
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,100
Help me carry this.

809
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,600
I must have owed you a fortune
in a past life.

810
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,380
Then, help me carry this upstairs.
