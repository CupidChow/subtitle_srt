[Episode 19]

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,660
When Ms. Fang said that to you,

4
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,640
she wasn't trying
to make things difficult for you.

5
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,570
It was because she didn't know you.

6
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,640
She didn't know how independent you were

7
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,300
or how strong you were inside.

8
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,770
And also,

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,130
how could you possibly be my weakness?

10
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,410
Having you by my side

11
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,470
is like having a mirror.

12
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,520
You help me see sincerity

13
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,940
and the human heart.

14
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,710
Come,

15
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,060
sit down for a while.

16
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,450
Are you thirsty?

17
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,750
Are you thirsty?

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,310
A little bit.

19
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,620
Here,

20
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,180
soda.

21
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,079
Where did you get that from?

22
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,280
I bought it on the way.

23
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,120
Why is there only one bottle?

24
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,310
I already drank mine.

25
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,280
Will we argue in the future?

26
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,680
Probably.

27
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,440
Where there are people,
there are conflicts.

28
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,880
Having conflicts isn't scary.

29
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,720
We just need to resolve them.

30
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,020
Will you give in to me?

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,910
That depends on the issue.

32
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,450
If it's not a matter of principle,

33
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,520
you can decide.

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,770
But if it's about principles,

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,870
I might

36
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,120
not give an inch.

37
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,390
I won't back down
on matters of principles either.

38
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,000
Good,

39
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,690
I'll remember that.

40
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,750
But you have a high position and power.

41
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,150
You won't use that
to pressure me, will you?

42
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,400
At home,

43
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,110
you'll be the Chief.

44
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,600
How do you divide ranks in your army?

45
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,550
In our division, the highest rank
is the division commander,

46
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,150
then the brigade commander,

47
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,480
regiment commander,

48
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,150
battalion commander, company commander,

49
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,390
platoon leader, and squad leader.

50
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,200
So at home, I'm the Chief.

51
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,920
Then you can be the squad leader.

52
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,240
Can I request not to be a squad leader?

53
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,500
You think it's too low?

54
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,410
Maybe I could promote you to...

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,460
Never mind, no promotion.

56
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,370
It depends on your performance.

57
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,570
You'll get promoted only if you do well.

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,620
Even if I became a company commander,

59
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,370
I wouldn't want it.

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,080
Why not?

61
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,480
Because

62
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,120
even a company commander
doesn't get to see the Chief often.

63
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,580
Then which rank
gets to see the Chief easily?

64
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,510
Let me tell you,

65
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,790
it's the security guard.

66
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
You said it.

67
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,270
Don't go back on your word.

68
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,680
Of course I won't.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,680
Alright.

70
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,710
I approve.

71
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,210
From now on at home,

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,680
you'll be Security Guard Wen.

73
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,880
And you're the Chief.

74
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,720
Don't just humor me.

75
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,070
Stand up!

76
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,170
What for?

77
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,420
Right here, right now?

78
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,240
Chief's orders: Attention!

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,640
Yes, Ma'am!

80
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,430
Alright, Security Guard Wen,

81
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,480
let's go home.

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,280
Okay.

83
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,660
Yes, Ma'am.

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,510
Hangong.

85
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,950
You're learning quite fast.

86
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,750
You're dancing better and better.

87
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,010
It's because you're such a good teacher.

88
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,090
I didn't expect you to be so coordinated.

89
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,830
If I wasn't agile enough,

90
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,270
in that hail of bullets,

91
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,320
I would've been shot dead long ago.

92
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,580
No matter how agile you are,

93
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,170
you can't dodge bullets.

94
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,770
You're lying to me again.

95
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,920
I'm not lying to you.

96
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,870
So beautiful.

97
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,430
My sweet darling.

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,720
After this dance,

99
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,020
I have to go.

100
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,560
You're leaving again?

101
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,870
I've been with you all day.

102
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
You still won't let me go?

103
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,410
I need to go

104
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,480
to Wen Pu's place.

105
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,790
He's not even your superior.

106
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,830
Why do you always run to him

107
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,490
as soon as you get to Shanghai?

108
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,180
My silly darling.

109
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,750
I have to go

110
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,120
to check in with him.

111
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,650
When will you come back next time?

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,310
Whenever you need me,

113
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,159
I'll be here.

114
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
Remember to think of me.

115
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
I will.

116
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,740
I will.

117
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,110
I promise.

118
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,430
Ms. Yi.

119
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,670
I don't know what's going on
with my husband lately.

120
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,800
Who knows what
he's busy with out there all day?

121
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,400
He still hasn't shown up yet.

122
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,340
Why don't we start eating first?

123
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,800
We can eat while waiting for him.

124
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,660
It's fine. I'm not hungry either.

125
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,390
Don't you agree, Minister Wen?

126
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,070
Alright.

127
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,510
Let's wait for him
10 more minutes at most.

128
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,600
If he doesn't show up,

129
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,000
we'll start without him.

130
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,800
Um...

131
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,050
Political Commissar.

132
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,460
Can I talk to you about something?

133
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,540
Sure, what is it?

134
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,620
Let's talk in the kitchen.

135
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,460
You need to talk in the kitchen?

136
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,240
All right.

137
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,630
What is it, Jiang?

138
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,630
Open the door.

139
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,520
Why are you closing the door?

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,800
Go ahead.

141
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,120
Political Commissar.

142
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,720
I don't have anything specific.

143
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,290
I just feel troubled.

144
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,870
I feel that these days,

145
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,710
you're the only one
I can really open up to

146
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,130
and speak honestly with.

147
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,630
Did something happen with Hangong?

148
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,680
Political Commissar.

149
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,830
Why do you immediately think

150
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,580
of Hangong when I say
I have something to discuss?

151
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,630
What's wrong with him?

152
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,090
If it's not about Hangong,

153
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,410
why would you need to talk to me?

154
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,390
Don't you think that this past year,

155
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,360
he's changed too much?

156
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,800
Changes this year...

157
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,230
Yes, there have been some.

158
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,630
He just moved to the city.

159
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,280
He's paying attention to his appearance.

160
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,390
But that's normal.

161
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,990
He's the district secretary

162
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,710
and has to deal with all kinds of people.

163
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,160
It's normal to care about his appearance,

164
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,690
isn't it?

165
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,270
If he's busy with work,

166
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,040
I understand that.

167
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,130
I support him.

168
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,429
But for the past several months,

169
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,890
he's been going out every weekend.

170
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,240
When I ask where he's going,

171
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,770
he says he's busy with work.

172
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,750
He gets impatient.

173
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,000
If I ask again, he gets angry.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,840
I know.

175
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,150
He's been busy with construction site
matters these past months.

176
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,080
But come on,

177
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,480
he's a grown man

178
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,030
with a wife and child.

179
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,240
Sure, working overtime occasionally

180
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,510
is understandable.

181
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,630
But not coming home every weekend

182
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,030
and always rushing off to Shanghai?

183
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,960
What do you think he's doing there?

184
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,240
Visiting you?

185
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,080
Does this make any sense?

186
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,630
Do you think he's seeing someone else?

187
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,770
We can't make wild guesses.

188
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,480
It could cause family conflicts.

189
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,880
Do you have any evidence?

190
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,440
That's right.

191
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,000
I know Hangong well.

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,460
He values relationships.

193
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,630
I think toward his family,

194
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,170
toward you and Huzi,

195
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,720
he's always been responsible.

196
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,390
Right?

197
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,670
But I'm afraid he'll make a mistake.

198
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,960
You know.

199
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,240
He has that old problem.

200
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,580
Back then,

201
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,550
if he hadn't made that mistake,

202
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,240
he wouldn't have had
to transfer to civilian work.

203
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,100
He's still one rank below you now.

204
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,690
Precisely because
he made that mistake before,

205
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,870
I believe he won't

206
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,750
stumble in the same place again.

207
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,440
Alright, Jiang.

208
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,750
If you're worried,

209
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,790
I'll find a chance

210
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,880
to have a good talk with Hangong.

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,050
Alright, Political Commissar.

212
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,120
I believe you.

213
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,080
And if Hangong

214
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,270
repeats that indiscretion,

215
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,730
you'll see how I
deal with him when I get home.

216
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,440
Secretary Zhao.

217
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,510
I rushed here as fast as I could.

218
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,670
Why are you so late?

219
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,170
Well...

220
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,150
My car broke down,

221
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,480
and I didn't bring my watch, you know.

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,510
Please sit down.

223
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,790
I lost track of time.

224
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,510
Where are the two of them?

225
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,600
They're in the kitchen.

226
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,490
Minister Wen.

227
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,670
-Secretary Zhao is here.
-Coming.

228
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,670
I'm back.

229
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,520
Coming.

230
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,960
Why are you late?

231
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,080
My car broke down.

232
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,550
What have you been
tattling to Minister Wen about?

233
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,550
Sit down, please.

234
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,480
She wasn't tattling.

235
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,440
She was just concerned about you.

236
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,270
Concerned about me?

237
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,030
Yes.

238
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,030
She said that for the past few weeks,

239
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,960
you haven't been home on Sundays.

240
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:44,910
Right?

241
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,900
She's worried you're not
eating and drinking well outside.

242
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,500
Is it wrong to care about you?

243
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,630
No, it's not.

244
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,720
But if you have something to say,

245
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,240
well...

246
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,080
Why come here to report it?

247
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,390
Just tell me at home.

248
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,650
I didn't say anything.

249
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,670
Well...

250
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,440
I've told her so many times.

251
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,510
I said that at the construction site,

252
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,150
there are so many people,

253
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,480
several dozens of them.

254
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,950
I have to take care of their meals.

255
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,310
Then there are materials

256
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,550
and supplies to handle.

257
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,210
Don't I have to go buy all that?

258
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,910
About these things, what...

259
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,710
What do you know? Yet you're here

260
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,200
talking nonsense
to the Political Commissar.

261
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,770
What did you say?

262
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,030
I didn't say anything.

263
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,270
You should

264
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,030
learn from Ms. Yi.

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,840
Look at her.

266
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,480
Isn't she a role model right beside you?

267
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,080
Secretary Zhao,

268
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,720
you shouldn't say that.

269
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,670
I'm no role model.

270
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,900
You didn't see
what just happened in the kitchen.

271
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,270
This whole spread of dishes

272
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,370
was almost entirely cooked by your wife.

273
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,230
She's really skilled at domestic chores.

274
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,870
I have a lot to learn from her.

275
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,020
Yes.

276
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,720
Her... Her cooking is fine.

277
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,080
I've been to his construction site.

278
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,030
There are many people there.

279
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,960
It really needs someone to manage.

280
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,250
Hangong.

281
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,480
I wronged you.

282
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,620
I shouldn't have overthought.

283
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,670
Well...

284
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,720
That's how she is. Look.

285
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,300
If you have anything to say,
tell me at home.

286
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,760
I didn't say anything.

287
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,370
Secretary Zhao.

288
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,490
Secretary Zhao,
someone's looking for you outside.

289
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,020
Looking for me?

290
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,700
Yes, and he seems very urgent.

291
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,590
Who is it? Why don't we let him in?

292
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,600
No, no, no.

293
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,670
Um, you...

294
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,520
You stay and eat with them.

295
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,470
It must be about the project.

296
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,970
Please go ahead and eat.

297
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,630
Who is it?

298
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,770
How did you find me here?

299
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,360
Hangong,

300
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
I had no choice. My sister...

301
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,680
Keep your voice down.

302
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,240
Hangong, I had no choice.

303
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,170
My sister swallowed the gold ring.

304
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,610
My sister swallowed the gold ring.

305
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,650
Step aside!

306
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,030
Step aside!

307
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,870
Pu.

308
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,540
Something happened
at my construction site.

309
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,960
I need to check it out.

310
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,290
You all go ahead and eat.

311
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,670
That's strange.

312
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,030
What are you looking for?

313
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,510
My chair.

314
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,010
Oh right.

315
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,720
I put that chair here.

316
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Have you seen it?

317
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,570
I threw it away.

318
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,150
You threw it away?

319
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,710
That chair could
still be used after some repairs.

320
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,510
It made me fall last time.

321
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,480
Better get rid of it
before someone else falls off it.

322
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,650
It could

323
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,730
have been repurposed into something else.

324
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,530
Why did you have to throw it away?

325
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,440
I bought you a new chair.

326
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,790
Where is it?

327
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,670
In the living room. Go take a look.

328
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,210
This chair looks really nice.

329
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,460
You know what?

330
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,670
It matches the study perfectly.

331
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,840
It must be

332
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,900
expensive, right?

333
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,240
Just tell me if you like it or not.

334
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,720
Of course I like it.

335
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,750
But it's too luxurious for me.

336
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,510
I prefer

337
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,460
a simple and frugal lifestyle.

338
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,150
Of course,

339
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,920
that's my personal choice.

340
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,030
I know you Communists

341
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,630
advocate for simplicity and frugality,

342
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,440
integrity and dedication
to public service.

343
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,200
But you don't have to

344
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,320
live like an ascetic monk.

345
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,840
I truly believe

346
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,620
you're already
a very dedicated public servant.

347
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,660
Are you restraining yourself

348
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,010
and rejecting all material temptations

349
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,670
because you're afraid that someday

350
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,270
you might become corrupt?

351
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,510
I'm not a saint.

352
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm just an ordinary person.

353
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,270
What you described...

354
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,670
I don't deny it.

355
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,320
I understand.

356
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,870
Material life can be simple and frugal,

357
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,470
but your spiritual world
shouldn't be dull and boring.

358
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,000
You agree with that, right?

359
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,910
Alright.

360
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,510
Next time when I
want to throw something away,

361
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,240
I'll discuss it with you first.

362
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,910
Thank you.

363
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,910
I promise you too

364
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,190
that our material life
can be simple and frugal,

365
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,910
but our spiritual life

366
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,410
will definitely be rich and colorful.

367
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,000
Thank you.

368
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,120
Come in.

369
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,000
Yuanyuan's clothes have a tear.

370
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,260
I'm mending it for her.

371
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,320
Let me see.

372
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,240
Almost done.

373
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,680
How is it?

374
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,850
Security Guard Wen.

375
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,970
People should focus on
what they are each good at.

376
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,640
Aren't you stealing my job?

377
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,670
How could I steal your job?

378
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,190
You're a great designer.

379
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,050
Please, designer,
take a look at my sewing.

380
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,010
What's wrong?

381
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,860
Why is this bed nothing
but a wooden plank?

382
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,100
-Yeah.
-Where's your mattress?

383
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,030
I don't have one.

384
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,790
I have a back injury.

385
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,800
The doctor said sleeping on this hard bed
is good for my back.

386
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,480
You've been sleeping
on this for all these years?

387
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,200
Yes.

388
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,510
The floor is harder.

389
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,570
Why don't you sleep on the floor then?

390
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,440
The floor is too cold.

391
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,640
You think I'm stupid?

392
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,390
My grandfather
was a traditional Chinese doctor.

393
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,270
I can tell you with certainty.

394
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,280
Back injuries do require firm beds.

395
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,140
But a firm bed
doesn't mean a wooden plank like this.

396
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,660
Really?

397
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,369
Of course.

398
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,200
Well...

399
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,000
You're not planning to take away my bed

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,329
and replace it, are you?

401
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,349
I might.

402
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,770
If you dare to replace it,

403
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,490
I'll sleep on the floor.

404
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,480
Then sleep on the floor.

405
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,030
You really want me to sleep on the floor?

406
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,030
Aren't you afraid I'll catch a cold?

407
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,160
I'll bring you a mattress pad then.

408
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,290
That's more like it.

409
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,970
What are you looking at?

410
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,140
There's a hole in my pants.

411
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,480
Can you mend it?

412
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,880
You always ask me to help you with chores.

413
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,030
So you need to do me a favor too.

414
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,590
Sure.

415
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,210
What do you want me to do?

416
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,190
Secretary Zhao told me
you can fix watches.

417
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,400
My aunt gave me an old pocket watch.

418
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,640
It's not working now.

419
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,920
Can you fix it for me?

420
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,720
Okay.

421
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,270
I'll give it a try.

422
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:15,920
No.

423
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,280
I will definitely fix it for you.

424
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,470
Yuanyuan and I...

425
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,230
What's wrong?

426
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,170
We're thirsty.

427
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,510
I've prepared
some chilled watermelon for you.

428
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,350
I'll cut it in half.

429
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,830
You can use spoons to scoop it out.

430
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,350
Okay.

431
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,550
Yuanyuan.

432
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,000
Your dad prepared watermelon for us.

433
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,880
We'll share it later

434
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,240
and eat it with spoons, alright?

435
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,920
Okay.

436
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,240
I'm here.

437
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,520
Well,

438
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,880
I should go now.

439
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,830
You can go in.

440
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,570
You should go first.

441
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,610
I'll leave after I see you go in.

442
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,400
Go ahead.

443
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,510
Okay.

444
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Let me accompany you to the station.

445
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,890
Alright.

446
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,890
I'm leaving.

447
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,010
Oh, right.

448
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,930
Be careful on your night shift.

449
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,030
Sir!

450
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,750
Comrade!

451
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,400
Take care.

452
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,510
You should go now.

453
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,880
We've seen each other off
several times already.

454
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,480
If you don't leave,

455
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,060
I'll be late for my night shift.

456
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,900
I'll go then.

457
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,960
Hurry up.

458
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,310
Sir,

459
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,060
you almost left without me.

460
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,530
I brought all your favorites.

461
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,920
There are red dates,

462
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,790
vermicelli,

463
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,680
and corn.

464
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,090
The corn grew
exceptionally well this year.

465
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:55,960
Ms. Yi.

466
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,270
Changjiang.

467
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,650
This is...

468
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,800
This is my brother Baoliang.

469
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,240
So you're Baoliang.

470
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,200
Hello, Ms. Yi.

471
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,350
Hello, I'm Yi Yi.

472
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,160
You've grown so much.

473
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,840
Which one of you is older?

474
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,920
I'm the older one.

475
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,120
You're the older one?

476
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,750
Where's your dad?

477
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,860
My dad and my father are in the study.

478
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,960
Alright,

479
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,890
you two chat,

480
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,650
I'll go wash some fruit for you.

481
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,310
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

482
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:19,680
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

483
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,610
Please sit down.

484
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,400
Try one.

485
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,000
Here, my brother.

486
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,930
Have some water.

487
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,080
Political Commissar Wen,

488
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,840
is this the lady your...

489
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,700
Yes, I mentioned her in my letter.

490
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,510
Yi Yi.

491
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,480
Look,

492
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,200
I can be so clueless sometimes.

493
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,070
You're having your Sunday together,

494
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,340
and I'm interrupting your meeting.

495
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,750
My brother.

496
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,510
You're treating me like an outsider.

497
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,450
It's been so long
since we've seen each other.

498
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,490
I'm very happy

499
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,840
to see you and Baoliang.

500
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,590
Well,

501
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,760
don't prepare anything for me.

502
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,640
I've already bought my ticket.

503
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,680
I'm leaving tonight.

504
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,890
You're leaving tonight?

505
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,520
Yes.

506
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,860
Why are you in such a hurry?

507
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,400
You rarely come to Shanghai.

508
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,070
Stay and enjoy yourself.

509
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,160
I'll ask Changjiang

510
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,510
to take time off from school

511
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,030
so he can accompany Baoliang and you

512
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,140
to explore Shanghai properly.

513
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,180
Maybe next time.

514
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,070
You know there's always
work to do in the village.

515
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,470
Chores from dawn to dusk.

516
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,370
Baoliang's mother isn't home.

517
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,590
I need to get back quickly.

518
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,410
Baoliang...

519
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,350
If he...

520
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,080
If he wants to stay, he can stay.

521
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,440
Political Commissar Wen.

522
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,640
These past few years,

523
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,010
you've sent plenty of money to my family.

524
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,720
I appreciate your kindness.

525
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,200
Listen to yourself.

526
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,160
Your family has shown

527
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,160
tremendous kindness to mine.

528
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,110
I'll never forget that.

529
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,030
My brother.

530
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,070
Your hair has turned completely white.

531
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,610
I'm old. If it wasn't white,
I'd be some kind of monster.

532
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,270
The reason I came this time...

533
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,830
I came for the sake of the child.

534
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,790
I...

535
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,170
I explained everything in my letter.

536
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,510
I'm being shameless

537
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,560
coming to you

538
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,790
to ask for a favor.

539
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,400
Forgive my nagging.

540
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,860
Political Commissar Wen.

541
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,920
Well,

542
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,110
I still want

543
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,950
Baoliang

544
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,920
to work in Shanghai.

545
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,110
This boy

546
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,550
has high aspirations.

547
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,510
He's always talking about

548
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,880
his dreams and ideals.

549
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,270
So,

550
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,310
could you put in a good word

551
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,000
to help the boy out?

552
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,070
I received the letter

553
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,550
you sent me.

554
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,570
I wrote back to you as well.

555
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,920
Here's the situation now.

556
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,790
As for working in the city,

557
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,450
there are state regulations.

558
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,480
I've thought carefully
about Baoliang's situation.

559
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,080
If he wants a government job,

560
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,840
there are only two paths.

561
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,490
One is joining the army.

562
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,110
The other is through factory recruitment.

563
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,240
Both are official channels.

564
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,370
You don't understand.

565
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,930
Factory jobs

566
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,300
and army positions

567
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,910
are extremely limited.

568
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,350
By the time my boy gets a chance,

569
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,280
he'll already have kids of his own.

570
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,270
I mean,

571
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,310
you are

572
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,240
such a high-ranking official.

573
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,310
If you

574
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,090
just say something,

575
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,830
if you just put in a word

576
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,200
and write a note
to our county officials...

577
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,640
Our county magistrate

578
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
never gets to see you.

579
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,550
If he met you,

580
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,680
he'd wet himself.

581
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,220
Just like that,
the matter would be resolved.

582
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,810
Well.

583
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,580
My brother.

584
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,220
It's not as simple as you make it sound.

585
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,940
Really.

586
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,070
This note

587
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,640
can't just be written on demand.

588
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,900
Why can't you write it?

589
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,920
Look at you.

590
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,750
You've been a revolutionary all your life

591
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,040
and made such great contributions.

592
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,400
Your position is so high.

593
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,640
I just happen to

594
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,110
have this connection between us.

595
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,400
I'm not trying to take advantage.

596
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,790
I'm saying it's fate.

597
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,830
People in my situation

598
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,350
have all moved to the city
with their families.

599
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,160
My brother.

600
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,030
If what you described is really happening,

601
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,030
then it's against the regulations.

602
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,400
In short,

603
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,240
I cannot write this note.

604
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,590
It violates discipline.

605
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,650
You wouldn't want me
to violate the rules, would you?

606
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,310
I...

607
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,030
I...

608
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,320
No, I wouldn't.

609
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,030
Political Commissar Wen,

610
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,000
I understand.

611
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,400
You want to be

612
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,230
an incorruptible official.

613
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,750
I know

614
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,280
that such officials

615
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,900
show no favoritism.

616
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,590
Fine,

617
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,310
I get it.

618
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,680
Baoliang!

619
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,110
Baoliang!

620
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,070
Pack your things.

621
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,880
My brother.

622
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,480
My brother, calm down.

623
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,070
Take it easy.

624
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,750
But...

625
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,510
I can't violate the rules, you understand?

626
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,590
I know.

627
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,190
I won't make you violate any.

628
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,110
Political Commissar Wen,
take care of yourself.

629
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,880
My brother,

630
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,510
please calm down, will you?

631
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,510
I'm fine. Changjiang,

632
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,270
I'm confused.

633
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,960
Why do I keep calling
the child Changjiang?

634
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,070
Baoliang!

635
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,640
Come down.

636
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,290
Father.

637
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,030
My brother.

638
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,030
Pack up. We're leaving.

639
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,720
No, no, no.

640
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,550
Why leave when you just arrived?

641
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,920
No, no, well...

642
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,750
Son,

643
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,590
I'm leaving.

644
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,310
Take care of yourself.

645
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,120
Pack your things.

646
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,370
Why leave so soon after arriving?

647
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,310
Let Baoliang stay here for a few days.

648
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,180
Let the child play here for a while, okay?

649
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,250
Maybe next time.

650
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,270
Well...

651
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,610
We won't trouble you.

652
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,160
What are you standing there for?

653
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,920
We need to go back
and harvest sweet potatoes.

654
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,140
Weren't you going
to let me stay in Shanghai

655
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,540
and live with my brother?

656
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,590
Stop it.

657
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,950
Dad.

658
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,000
You're making my father and brother leave?

659
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Don't speak.

660
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,870
Why should I?

661
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,560
You and mom had me

662
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,480
but never took care of anything.

663
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,970
You cast me off to my father,
mother, and brother.

664
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,920
When the Japanese
were conducting massive raids,

665
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,680
if it weren't for my father and mother,

666
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,410
I would have been dead long ago.

667
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,680
My brother worked
to earn money for my education.

668
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,970
He was so young when he started
collecting stones in the mountains.

669
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,630
He gave all the good food to me.

670
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,410
He fainted from hunger many times.

671
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,310
Mr. Xu.

672
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,640
Don't worry.

673
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,130
Come.

674
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,160
Come over here.

675
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,820
Have a seat.

676
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,160
Let me tell you something.

677
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,880
As it happens,

678
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,160
our workshop needs to hire a male worker.

679
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,680
As long as he's in good health

680
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,640
and his family background
checks out, it's fine.

681
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,070
The job is very simple.

682
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,760
He just needs to be literate.

683
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,000
The only downside
is that it's a temporary position.

684
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,040
Maybe we'll have to

685
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,770
have Baoliang humble himself.

686
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,220
That's fine.

687
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,970
Don't worry about our family background.

688
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,530
It's completely clean.

689
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,400
Baoliang

690
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,350
works hard

691
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,810
and is very reliable.

692
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,070
I think it's good.

693
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,730
Brother,

694
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,270
you should keep working hard for now.

695
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,130
Later you can attend night school

696
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,460
and definitely find a good job.

697
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,310
No, let me ask you.

698
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,080
Thank you, Ms. Yi.

699
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,540
I know your organization.

700
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,510
Does your organization
have this authority?

701
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,030
Do you have this authority?

702
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,510
It's just a temporary position.

703
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,480
We can make this decision ourselves.

704
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,210
People will gossip about this.

705
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,610
Absolutely not.

706
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,270
Why not?

707
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,170
You're just afraid of gossip.

708
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,240
You're worried about
your official position.

709
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,110
In your eyes,

710
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,530
your position
is more important than your children.

711
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,260
Changjiang.

712
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,110
Don't talk nonsense.

713
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:36,920
If you make my brother leave,

714
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,590
I'll leave too.

715
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,440
I'll go back to my hometown.

716
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,970
What are you saying, child?

717
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,640
This is your real father.

718
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,970
Think before you speak.

719
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,960
Did you hear me?

720
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,770
Why did you even have me?

721
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,110
You did not raise me,
and yet you never repaid those who did.

722
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,350
You're just selfish.

723
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,960
My mom was just as selfish as you.

724
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,590
What did you say?

725
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Don't talk about your mom like that.

726
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,110
Changjiang!

727
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,280
Where...

728
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,110
Where did he run off to?

729
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,750
I...

730
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,450
It's all my fault.

731
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,240
Political Commissar Wen,

732
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,880
I shouldn't have come here to do this.

733
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,830
I was wrong.

734
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,240
My brother.

735
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,000
I really have been foolish.

736
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,180
Political Commissar Wen,

737
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,150
I'm a muddle-headed person.

738
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,150
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

739
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,910
Our boys won't have any problems, will he?

740
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,520
The children will be fine.

741
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,550
Shanghai has excellent public security.

742
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,590
Besides, they're two boys.

743
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,120
They aren't that delicate.

744
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,830
Good.

745
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,510
Baoliang...

746
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,720
He...

747
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,640
Baoliang

748
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,750
can stay in Shanghai for a few more days.

749
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,550
I'll have Changjiang show him around.

750
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,310
Don't worry.

751
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,270
Let them bond with each other.

752
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,590
Alright.

753
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,440
Fine.

754
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,350
My brother.

755
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,510
I know

756
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,030
Changjiang was raised by you and Mrs. Xu

757
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,750
at the risk of your lives,

758
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,430
with great hardship.

759
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,200
He is my son,

760
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,960
but in my heart,

761
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,840
he is your son too.

762
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:15,960
I...

763
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,110
Yes.

764
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,830
Also,

765
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,830
New China has been established.

766
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:23,920
In the future,

767
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:24,960
rural areas

768
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,060
will be built up just like cities.

769
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,200
By then, city people might

770
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,440
all be rushing to go to the countryside.

771
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,110
Really?

772
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,440
Really.

773
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,750
Live well,

774
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,810
and we'll all be able to see it.

775
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:37,800
Alright.

776
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,640
Live well.

777
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:53,720
Alright.

778
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,920
Come on, get up there.

779
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,240
I'll help you up.

780
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,830
Okay.

781
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,790
Fine, I'll hold it.

782
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,680
I'm leaving.

783
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,830
I'll see you off.

784
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,640
Okay.

785
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,640
Come on.

786
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,000
Give me the money.

787
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,960
Are you hungry?

788
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,920
I'm starving.

789
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,590
I'm hungry too.

790
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,410
If you're hungry, just go home.

791
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,770
Mr. Wen is your father.

792
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,610
That smack of his didn't even hurt.

793
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,340
I won't go back.

794
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,210
Communist officials can't just hit people.

795
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,840
He needs to apologize
and write a letter of self-reflection.

796
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,270
Baoliang.

797
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,550
Mr. Wen.

798
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,110
Hello, Ms. Yi.

799
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,510
Come down.

800
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,910
It's dangerous up there.

801
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,410
Changjiang.

802
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,360
Come down.

803
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,170
You must be hungry.

804
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:56,980
Here.

805
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,290
These are for you two.

806
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,640
Eat up.

807
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,850
Go ahead, eat something.

808
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,920
Son.

809
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,640
I need to talk to you.

810
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,680
Keep eating.

811
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,920
When you were born,

812
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,070
your mom and I were fighting
as guerrillas in the mountains.

813
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,730
We had nothing to eat or drink.

814
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,960
Your mother was sick
and couldn't produce milk.

815
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,020
Hunger has left you

816
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,510
all skin and bones.

817
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,090
When the enemy came,

818
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,490
your mom was afraid you would cry.

819
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,210
But you didn't
make a sound the whole time.

820
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,920
You were too hungry to even cry.

821
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,440
The day we sent you away,

822
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,430
I remember it clearly.

823
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,130
Your mom couldn't bear to let you go.

824
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,260
She held you tight and wouldn't let go.

825
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,200
So, son,

826
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,480
I can't accept

827
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,290
that you called your mom

828
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,990
selfish.

829
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,920
Your dad told me on the way here

830
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,550
that he was wrong.

831
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,030
He shouldn't have hit you.

832
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,070
He came here today

833
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,550
to apologize to you.

834
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
But he's not good with words,

835
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,160
so he couldn't express himself clearly.

836
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,510
You should go home first.

837
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,790
I'll keep an eye on him.

838
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,720
I'll make him write you
a letter of self-reflection.

839
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,070
Well,

840
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,290
I've spoken with the school.

841
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,170
I've asked for two days off for you

842
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,880
to spend time with Baoliang

843
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,140
and have a good time exploring Shanghai.

844
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,550
-Go.
-Go back.

845
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,360
Let's go.

846
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,480
This kid,

847
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,630
glaring at me like I'm his enemy.

848
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,300
If I were him, I'd glare at you too.

849
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,570
I need to thank you.

850
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,510
Thank you

851
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,280
for helping me with the apology.

852
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,000
Also,

853
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,940
I want to apologize to you too.

854
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,030
I shouldn't have

855
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,429
treated my child
so roughly in front of you.

856
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,840
Why are you apologizing to me?

857
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
You didn't hit me.

858
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,139
My father used to
hit me when I was little.

859
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,630
I hated it so much.

860
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,670
I still remember it to this day.

861
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,510
That's why you shouldn't hit children.

862
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,960
If you had hit Yuanyuan today, I...

863
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,150
How could I ever hit Yuanyuan?

864
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,679
I love her too much for that.

865
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,239
Just tell me, have you ever hit her?

866
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,320
I never hit Yuanyuan.

867
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,120
Impossible.

868
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,230
Yuanyuan told me everything.

869
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,070
You hit her.

870
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,520
Three times, in fact.

871
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,030
She told you I hit her?

872
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,800
What exactly did she say?

873
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,920
She told me.

874
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
You hit her when she was

875
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,650
one year old.

876
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,800
Then again when she was two.

877
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,510
And once more when she was three.

878
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,320
That's nonsense.

879
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,920
How could a one-year-old
have such memories?

880
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,320
She really told you this?

881
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,790
Yes.

882
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,950
That's exactly what Yuanyuan told me.

883
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,150
Let's go.

884
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,150
Go home and write
your letter of self-reflection.

885
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,510
Fine, I'll write it. Keep your voice down.

886
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,710
Write two copies. One for Yuanyuan too.

887
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,630
Okay.

888
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,560
Three, two, one, begin!

889
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,710
Come on!

890
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,510
Changjiang!

891
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,150
Like father, like son, they say.

892
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,150
You...

893
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,320
You're weak as water, young man.

894
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,070
But that's just like your father.

895
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:33,190
Your father could never
beat me at arm wrestling either.

896
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,880
But his hand with a brush

897
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,440
was quite...

898
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,340
What are you talking about?

899
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,760
Talking behind my back?

900
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,710
Bragging again?

901
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,480
I didn't say anything.

902
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,150
I was talking about Changjiang.

903
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,960
I... I...

904
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,000
I was saying how each new generation

905
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,590
surpasses the one before.

906
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,030
Who won?

907
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,070
I did.

908
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,800
You won?

909
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,230
So strong, huh?

910
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,760
Come on, try me.

911
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,280
Thanks.

912
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,480
No bullying now!

913
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,110
Come on.

914
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,500
Right hand.

915
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,400
Right hand.

916
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,030
Okay.

917
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,480
Move in closer.

918
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,280
Okay, closer.

919
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,650
Put some muscle into it!

920
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,400
Ready.

921
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,280
Begin!

922
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Come on, Brother!

923
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,730
You can do it!

924
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,340
I have to say, this kid's pretty strong.

925
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,000
Come on, Baoliang!

926
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,400
Come on, Baoliang!

927
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:17,920
Push harder, Brother!

928
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,380
Come on!

929
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,880
Give up?

930
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,510
I give up.

931
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,070
But you're pretty strong.

932
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,490
Hangong.

933
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,070
Let's try.

934
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,880
My wrist hurts.

935
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,110
I'm too weak for this.

936
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,170
Changjiang, go on.

937
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,000
Try against your dad.

938
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,400
Yes, challenge your dad.

939
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,630
I can't. I won't win.

940
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,030
How do you know you can't?

941
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,980
I've arm wrestled him before.

942
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,670
You can do it. Trust me.

943
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,550
I really can't.

944
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,590
You really can. Go on.

945
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,390
Come on, young man. Give it a try.

946
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,190
That was before.

947
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,190
Come here.

948
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,230
Mr. Zhao is right.

949
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,640
How would you know
you can't do it if you don't try?

950
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:56,850
Come on.

951
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,920
No cheating.

952
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,720
I won't cheat.

953
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,630
Give us a head start of a fist and a half.

954
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,560
A fist and a half?

955
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,560
No need for that.

956
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,150
Just arm wrestle fair and square.

957
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,070
I can't beat him.

958
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,150
You definitely can.

959
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:07,960
Trust me.

960
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,310
Come on! Changjiang.

961
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,400
Alright.

962
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,860
Come on.

963
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,920
Ready.

964
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,960
Go!

965
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,480
Come on!

966
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:15,960
You can do it!

967
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,480
-You’re much stronger than before.
-Come on.

968
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,080
Keep it up!

969
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,000
Come on!

970
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,670
Harder!

971
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:21,840
Put some muscle into it!

972
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,030
Harder!

973
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,440
Let's see how long you can hold on.

974
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:24,880
You got this!

975
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,320
Come on!

976
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,110
Kid.

977
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,280
Come on!

978
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,400
That's cheating!

979
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,280
Three against one?

980
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,510
Is that even fair?

981
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,670
See? I told you that you could do it.

982
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,880
If you're going to cheat,

983
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,010
then I'll cheat too.

984
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,410
About those two essays
I was supposed to write tonight,

985
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,190
consider them canceled out by this.

986
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,630
Essays? What essays?

987
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,320
The two essays you mentioned.

988
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,540
They're canceled.

989
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,390
But thank you anyway.

990
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,840
Alright.

991
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,760
I'll make something delicious for you all.

992
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,530
Can't have you eating bread all the time.

993
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,180
Hangong.

994
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,030
Give me a hand.

995
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,830
Sure.

996
00:37:58,850 --> 00:37:59,770
Coming!

997
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:00,880
Dad.

998
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,360
I want stir-fried rice cakes.

999
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,320
Stir-fried rice cakes? No problem.

1000
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,880
Stir-fried rice cakes?

1001
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,570
Look who's ordering food now.

1002
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,910
Yi.

1003
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:14,840
Yi.

1004
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,190
I need to go now.

1005
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,690
There's an urgent situation.

1006
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,880
The higher-ups

1007
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
want to check our exhibition clothing

1008
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,010
before the international trade fair.

1009
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,930
Looks like we need to speed things up.

1010
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,030
Is the timeline tight?

1011
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,320
It's quite tight.

1012
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,760
We only have two months.

1013
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,590
We need to complete your designs

1014
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,850
and manufacture the finished products.

1015
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,180
Looks like we'll be working overtime.

1016
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,880
Your enthusiasm

1017
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,800
is back again.

1018
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,510
Pressure creates motivation.

1019
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,000
I've been dragging my feet before.

1020
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,320
Never finalized the design plan.

1021
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
This time we need to decide quickly.

1022
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,690
I'll let you get to work then.

1023
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,670
I have a pile of things
to handle at the workshop.

1024
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,760
I'll head over there now.

1025
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,480
Alright.

1026
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,040
Okay.

1027
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
If you have any ideas or thoughts,

1028
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,550
you can tell me.

1029
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,940
I'll help you choose

1030
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,090
for your reference.

1031
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,370
My creative concept this time

1032
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,130
is rooted in ethnic themes,

1033
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,400
infused with an international touch.

1034
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,920
So it's a fusion
of Chinese and Western styles, right?

1035
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,590
Yes.

1036
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,590
That's a great approach.

1037
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,510
East meets West.

1038
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,230
Greek civilization
is the origin of all Western civilization.

1039
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,030
You might

1040
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,400
find this book useful for reference.

1041
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,840
Your creative thinking aligns with mine.

1042
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,000
Is that

1043
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,980
a compliment?

1044
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,110
Of course it is.

1045
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,850
I gladly accept it.

1046
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,280
So you revolutionaries
also read Greek mythology?

1047
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,030
Of course.

1048
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,030
Which character do you like in it?

1049
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
-I like...
-Wait.

1050
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,630
Let me guess.

1051
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,510
Okay.

1052
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,950
You like...

1053
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,800
You must like Prometheus.

1054
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,630
I do like Prometheus.

1055
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,760
I admit it.

1056
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,710
I admire him

1057
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,240
for not fearing authority,

1058
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,030
for enduring all kinds of hardships,

1059
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,670
and for his tenacious willpower.

1060
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,960
His spirit deserves

1061
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,470
to be learned from
and admired by humanity.

1062
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,550
What about you?

1063
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,410
Who do you like?

1064
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,590
You'll never guess who I like.

1065
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,770
Let me try to guess.

1066
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,070
Which character
would our comrade Yi Yi like?

1067
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,590
The goddess of wisdom,

1068
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,760
Athena?

1069
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,150
No.

1070
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,030
Then who?

1071
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,050
I like Marpessa.

1072
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,970
Marpessa?

1073
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,590
Marpessa, among all the gods,

1074
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,250
chose an ordinary life.

1075
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,710
Tell me,

1076
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,880
why do you like her?

1077
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Because I feel those heroes and gods

1078
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,670
are too distant from me.

1079
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,150
Apollo

1080
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,720
loved Marpessa

1081
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,730
and promised her immortality,

1082
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,560
but she gave up immortality.

1083
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,510
She chose her own kind,

1084
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,360
saying she was just an ordinary person.

1085
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,110
She wanted to grow old

1086
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,480
with her husband.

1087
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,960
I find it remarkable

1088
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,620
that the ancient Greeks
possessed such insight

1089
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,400
into love and marriage.

1090
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,590
I think

1091
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,480
you're telling me this story

1092
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,880
to ask me to make a choice.

1093
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,360
Not at all.

1094
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,440
I didn't say anything.

1095
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,230
You didn't say anything directly,

1096
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,110
but sometimes the speaker is unintentional
while the listener finds meaning.

1097
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,960
I think this story you told

1098
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,150
is suggesting I make a choice:

1099
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,110
If one day

1100
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,670
you agree to live with me,

1101
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,190
first,

1102
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,150
I would have to leave my current position,

1103
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,670
right?

1104
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,440
Comrade Wen Pu.

1105
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,150
What is it?

1106
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,830
As your chief,
I must seriously criticize you.

1107
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,570
You've been too sensitive lately.

1108
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,410
Really?

1109
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:50,920
Okay.

1110
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,960
I accept the chief's criticism

1111
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,010
and will correct it immediately.

1112
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,590
By the way,

1113
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,840
I

1114
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,150
want to apologize

1115
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,000
by giving you a gift.

1116
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,500
What kind of gift?

1117
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:04,700
Here.

1118
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,300
Sit down first.

1119
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,230
Close your eyes.

1120
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,550
I have to close my eyes too?

1121
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,840
Yes. Close your eyes.

1122
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,110
I'm afraid I'll peek.

1123
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,630
No peeking.

1124
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,120
Close your eyes.

1125
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,630
Okay. Eyes closed.

1126
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,880
Don't peek.

1127
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,110
Almost done.

1128
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,050
You can open your eyes now.

1129
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,630
A Leica camera.

1130
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,640
Yes, a Leica camera.

1131
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,450
Do you like it?

1132
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
Wait, this model is discontinued.

1133
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,310
It is.

1134
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,660
Where did you get it?

1135
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,840
I didn't buy it.

1136
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,880
It's a trophy.

1137
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,280
Editor-in-Chief Ji gave it to me.

1138
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,990
Now I'm giving it to you.

1139
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,240
No.

1140
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,440
It's too valuable. I can't accept it.

1141
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,480
You must take it.

1142
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,410
Think about how useful it will be
when you're gathering material.

1143
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,290
Just like the pen I gave you.

1144
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,400
It will definitely help
with your creative work.

1145
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,280
Well.

1146
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,670
Comrade Yi Yi.

1147
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,850
I hope you accept my apology.

1148
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,800
But...

1149
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,630
But I don't have any gift for you.

1150
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,330
You did.

1151
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,590
What?

1152
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:27,540
You.
