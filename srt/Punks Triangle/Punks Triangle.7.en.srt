1
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:08,375
Do you... like me in that way?

2
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:12,458
AE...

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:16,083
It's okay. You're cute.

4
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,958
Is something wrong with me?

5
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,333
It's gonna hurt.

6
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:13,708
"PUNKS△TRIANGLE"
(Episode 7)

7
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:11,500
- Hasegawa.
- Yes?

8
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,042
Did you reply to that inquiry?

9
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:14,833
It's been handled.

10
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,125
- Thank you.
- Of course.

11
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,458
Sumiura.

12
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:23,958
That competition is tomorrow, right?

13
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:26,833
Yes.

14
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,875
What's that?

15
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,640
It's a collab competition with
"SHOWNAVI."

16
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,958
It's getting a lot of buzz in the industry.

17
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:33,958
I heard that if you win,

18
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,750
AE will wear your outfit on the runway.

19
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,917
AE?! That's amazing!

20
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:45,375
Getting AE to wear your design
would be a dream come true.

21
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,208
Welcome.

22
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,750
Welcome.

23
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,750
Today's the last day to
prepare for the competition.

24
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,750
Even if I make it big in the future...

25
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:04,875
and meet AE as a "designer and model"...

26
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,958
we can never go back
to the way things were.

27
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,542
But why, back then...

28
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,292
The look on his face...

29
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:27,875
My head is a total mess.

30
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,583
Heading to school after this?

31
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, the competition's tomorrow.
I have to do some final checks.

32
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,375
I see.

33
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,167
You've done a great job
considering how little time you had.

34
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:49,667
So, who's going to wear the outfit?

35
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,625
Don't tell me it's you, AE?

36
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,042
No way. That would totally blow my cover.

37
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:59,917
True. Is it a student from
the modeling department?

38
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,167
It's my partner for the project.

39
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:07,708
A partner, huh?

40
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, so that's what this is all about.

41
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,250
Huh?

42
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,375
It's him, isn't it?

43
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:21,167
The one who's making you so
clumsy when it comes to love.

44
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,167
I knew it.

45
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,667
But hey, this is the perfect excuse for you
two to present something together, right?

46
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:37,125
I don't know what happened, but good luck.

47
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,583
That's true.

48
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,583
(P Mode Fashion Academy)

49
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,167
Suzuki, you've got way
too many loose threads here.

50
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:03,042
Whoa! Good catch.
You're a lifesaver, Mochizuki.

51
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:04,292
Honestly...

52
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,708
Um, Shino-san, the pleats
here are coming loose.

53
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,333
I'll take care of this. Can
you handle the lining?

54
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:13,417
This hem should probably be secured better.

55
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:14,667
In that case...

56
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:18,250
By the time you're done, Enaga, the
contest will have started. Give it to me.

57
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,958
Ow.

58
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,833
This isn't like you, Sumiura.

59
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:48,167
Give me your hand.

60
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:49,542
Huh?

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,958
Hey, Enaga, this is...

62
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,125
I took a page out of your book
and started carrying them on me.

63
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,708
It took me forever to find the same one.

64
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,667
A matching pair.

65
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,167
Sumiura...

66
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:27,250
Alright, is everyone ready?

67
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,250
Tomorrow's dress rehearsal starts at 10 AM.

68
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,167
The main event starts at 2 PM.

69
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:35,583
Don't be late.

70
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,917
Okay...

71
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,542
Somehow, I can't bring myself
to look Enaga in the eye...

72
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:57,458
Sumiura can't focus.

73
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:02,958
It must be... my fault.

74
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,333
Good work.

75
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,458
You too.

76
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,042
See you tomorrow.

77
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:17,833
Let's do our best tomorrow.

78
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,583
Yeah... See you tomorrow.

79
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:35,167
Chiaki, you were working so hard
to make your dream come true...

80
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,750
I'm only telling you this
because we're close.

81
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,458
My dream...

82
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:45,625
is to have AE walk the runway
in an outfit I made.

83
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:53,375
But... whether that
dream comes true or not,

84
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:57,833
once you find out that I'm AE...

85
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:31,167
This is... the place I first
started going out at night.

86
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:40,000
It's also where I first met AE.

87
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,667
That night, everything seemed to sparkle.

88
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:58,417
The night air smelled... new and different.

89
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:02,500
You've become quite the bad boy, Chiaki.

90
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:07,500
Everything was so fresh and new...

91
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:14,417
But now...

92
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,417
I don't even understand
my own feelings anymore.

93
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,083
I'm sorry about the last time.

94
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,583
I ruined my bias's clothes.

95
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,333
I went to a hotel with my bias...

96
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,917
I even had my bias give me a piercing...

97
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,542
Is something wrong with me?

98
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,583
Of course not.

99
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,250
How could there be anything wrong with
you...

100
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,417
Why?

101
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:00,083
Enaga, you're covered in paint.

102
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,583
So are you, Sumiura.

103
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,833
Why?

104
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,792
Even though it's the color of poop.

105
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't say that out loud!

106
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:09,833
This is fun.

107
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,208
This isn't fun at all!

108
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,000
Why?

109
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,917
I'm Enaga Ayumu. It's nice to meet you.

110
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:19,583
Enaga, do you have a bias?

111
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,958
Maybe... I guess?

112
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,833
I'm not telling you to give up on punk.

113
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:23,483
Not bad.

114
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:24,667
Is it matte and sparkly?

115
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:26,042
Huh? I forgot.

116
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,410
Let me rest on your shoulder.

117
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,143
The beans keep running away
from me, so I'm chasing them.

118
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's do our best in the competition.

119
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,042
Why? Again...

120
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,708
My mind is filled with thoughts of Enaga.

121
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,250
In the end, I couldn't sleep at all.

122
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,333
And just like that, the morning
of the competition arrived...

123
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,375
(P Mode Fashion Academy)

124
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,000
Ooh, nice.

125
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,583
I'm so glad I got paired
with you, Shino-san.

126
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:42,417
But everyone's work is so high-level.
Do you think we can win?

127
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,375
We've done all we can do.

128
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,792
Their outfit looks
particularly amazing, though.

129
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,042
You're right.

130
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:52,125
I saw them staying late pretty often.

131
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,958
Either way, they've
become a pretty good team.

132
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,380
It really suits you...

133
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,875
You look great, Sumiura.

134
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,833
Th... thanks.

135
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,375
Alright, rehearsal is starting.

136
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,000
Good luck with the rehearsal.

137
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,625
Yeah... thanks.

138
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,208
I'm heading out.

140
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,958
Okay, let's begin the rehearsal.

141
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,667
Is everyone ready?

142
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,042
Yes...

143

A lot of people will be
watching the actual show.

144
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,833
Let's put on a show
that everyone will enjoy.

145
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,042
Yes...

146
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,292
Alright, cue the music.

147
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:59,250
My head's still a mess.

148
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,708
This is no good.

149
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,875
I need to focus on the
competition right in front of me.

150
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:12,458
Focus...

151
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,083
Number 1, you're up.

152
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,250

154
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,583
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

155
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,458
It hurts...

156
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:41,833
Ah...

157
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,167
The outfit...

158
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:52,708
It's ripped! It's ripped! What do we do?

159
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,833
Sumiura, calm down.

160
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,458
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

161
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,625
What are we going to do?

162
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,042
How is he?

163
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,333
It looks like a sprain, but just in case,
please go to the hospital afterwards.

164
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,042
Got it. You okay?

165
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,426
Yeah.

166
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,458
Sorry.

167
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:25,042
This means you can't walk
in the show today.

168
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:28,292
No! I'm going to walk.

169
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:29,125
But Sumiura...

170
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,167
No, I won't let you.

171
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,833
Then what about the competition?

172
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:40,792
What's going to happen
to the outfit we made?

173
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,792
I'll walk.

174
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:51,292
What... What are you talking about?

175
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,917
Enaga, you and I are
completely different heights.

176
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,083
See?

177
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:05,208
Either way, I'm walking.
We need to fix this rip, fast.

178
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,083
Enaga, what are you doing...?

179
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,167
Everyone, does anyone have safety pins?

180
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,458
Any kind will do!
Can I borrow as many as you have?

181
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:47,250
Sumiura, our outfit is punk-style, right?

182
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,917
We'll use safety pins to adjust the length.

183
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:56,042
That's right. Your clothes are punk.

184
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,625
Here, use these.

185
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,458
I only have a few, but here.

186
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,250
Thanks.

187
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,667
I've got some big ones! Here.

188
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,583
- You can have this too.
- Thank you.

189
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,042
Who'd want to deal with you guys?

190
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,917
You're all my competition.

191
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,458
Everyone...

192
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,875
Thank you.

193
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,333
Don't mention it.

194
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,958
Yeah. We're supposed to help
each other out when things get tough.

195
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,375
We're classmates, after all.

196
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,292
If that's not enough,

197
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,833
I can go check the other classrooms.

198
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,292
Please.

199
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,708
Thank you.

200
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:56,917
Yeah.

201
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,792
Alright.

202
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:09,208
Enaga, rip the top
too. I'll take care of it.

203
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,583
Let's re-tailor this to fit your size.

204
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:46,250
Everyone, the doors are opening!

205
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,333
Okay... It's finally coming together.

206
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:56,208
I'll handle your hair and makeup.
Let's get you ready over there.

207
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,042
Thank you. I'm in your hands.

208
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,375
Go on, Enaga Ayumu.

209
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,000
Sumiura...

210
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,208
I'm sorry.

211
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,667
Wha... What for?

212
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,750
For your terrible runway walk?

213
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,792
"P-MODE Collection 2025
SHOW NAVI Presents: Human Connection"

214
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,583
This is the runway.

215
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,748
The elevator is over here.

216
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,292
This is the runway.

217
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:40,917
The elevator is right ahead.
Please watch your step.

218
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,333
Welcome to the P-mode Collection 2025.

219
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,667
Please watch your step.

220
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,958
The elevator is right ahead.

221
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,417
Okay, let's take your hat off first.

222
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,375
Enaga, your hair...

223
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:18,917
Could you try to keep
my face from being seen?

224
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,042
I don't want the audience to recognize me.

225
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:27,958
OK.

226
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:39,958
And now, it's time for SHOW NAVI's
'Fashion Show of Human Connection'!

227
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:48,333
The winner will be decided
by a vote from our guests.

228
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,018
The winner will get to collaborate
with a professional designer.

229
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:55,667
And their creation will be worn
by top model AE at the TBC.

230
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:01,958
And now, please enjoy these pieces which
our students poured their souls into.

231
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:28,125
Here he is!

232
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,792
I've seen that walk countless
times. There's no mistake.

233
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,875
Enaga Ayumu is...

234
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,542
AE.

235
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,309
(Next Episode) You don't
even want to look at my face?

236
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,292
But I still want Chiaki.

237
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:02,333
Don't mess with those feelings.

238
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:05,458
Didn't you find your own courage
through punk fashion?

239
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:06,601
We're partners, aren't we?

240
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,601
You're the first person
I've ever truly opened up to.

241
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,375
My heart already belongs to someone else.

242
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,458
No one's ever taught me how to kiss.

243
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,958
Let me teach you.
