1
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:11,000
AE...

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,792
You're so cute, Chiaki...

3
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,375
No.

4
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:33,833
AE... Are you hiding
something from me?

5
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:40,792
I know. AE is Enaga...

6
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,542
I know. AE is Enaga...

7
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:53,750
AE is Enaga...

8
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,635
You're hiding something
from me, aren't you?

9
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:21,667
Why on earth aren't you
getting enough sleep?

10
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:24,500
I had a nightmare this morning...

11
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,792
A nightmare?

12
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:30,167
Yeah, sort of...

13
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,375
You're probably just overworked.

14
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,583
Speaking of which, AE, you have it rough.

15
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,208
Going to fashion design
school at night, right?

16
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,667
Do you manage to stay
under the radar at school?

17
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,417
I'm holding up pretty well.

18
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:50,333
A condition of my enrollment was
that my identity not be revealed.

19
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,125
So, are you having nightmares
about your competition piece?

20
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,042
Nah, it's about relationship stuff.

21
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:05,750
Romance! I never would've guessed.

22
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,917
AE, I thought you were
just clumsy with your hands.

23
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:12,167
Turns out you're dense
when it comes to love, too.

24
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:15,625
And here I thought I was pretty good at it.

25
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,042
What, are you trying to make me jealous?

26
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,167
Make you jealous?

27
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:23,083
Because being this awkward...
it just means you really like them.

28
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:30,417
Yeah, very much.

29
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:34,208
Ugh, enough with the lovey-dovey talk!

30
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,375
After our weekend night out...

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,250
I finally realized it.

32
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,039
I...

33
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:51,208
I like Chiaki.

34
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:58,542
But... that feeling.

35
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:04,125
Someone who doesn't keep secrets...

36
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,875
I wonder if something
happened to him in the past.

37
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,750
If I like Chiaki,

38
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,167
and want to build a
genuine relationship with him...

39
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:22,042
All done! Perfect again today.

40
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:28,167
Not as AE, but as my true self.

41
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,125
Excuse me.

42
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,833
AE, are you ready?

43
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,292
Ready.

44
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,042
Alright, go on, you clumsy oaf.

45
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,333
I'm off.

46
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:48,417
I have to tell him I'm Enaga.

47
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,875
"PUNKS△TRIANGLE"
(Episode 4)

48
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,333
Whoa, the stuff downstairs is amazing.

49
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,833
This is so cool!

50
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,583
See? This place is incredible.

51
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,000
They have a lot of other
interesting pieces here, too.

52
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,042
I'm gonna go try this on.

53
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,792
Excuse me...

54
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:18,792
Sumiura!

55
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,625
Welcome.

56
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,458
Oh, right. You work here, don't you?

57
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:30,167
Trying it on?

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,208
I'll show you to the fitting
room. Right this way.

59
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,792
Thanks.

60
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:47,417
AE modeled this piece, right?

61
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,958
Yes, this one's very popular.

62
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,683
This is the only store in the
country that still has it in stock.

63
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:10,042
AE... Ever since then, he's left
me on read and just ghosted me.

64
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,917
Sumiura seems really down today.

65
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:23,167
You think? It's probably
because he's at work.

66
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:27,583
That's all the more reason
he should act a little more cheerful.

67
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,625
Excuse me.

68
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,917
This... do you have it in a size small?

69
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,917
Yes, a size small...

70
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:57,375
Does this mean I'll never see AE again?

71
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,750
If I can't ever see AE again...

72
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,458
the only path left for me is...

73
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,750
to win the competition.

74
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,292
Everyone, can I have your attention?

75
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:25,208
Regarding the competition
you're all working on,

76
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,333
we've had a scheduling
conflict with the models.

77
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:31,583
So this time, one person from each pair
will have to walk the runway.

78
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,958
Huh!?

79
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,917
That's all. Okay, back to work, everyone.

80
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,000
Shino-san, what are we going to do?

81
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:38,875
Haruka, you should do it.

82
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,458
No way! Rock-paper-scissors?

83
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,292
Rock-paper-scissors?

84
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:45,125
Oh, great. I have to be
the model? What a pain.

85
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,458
You say that, but you're
actually excited, aren't you?

86
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,542
A model, huh? Enaga, you should do it.

87
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,250
You're tall.

88
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:57,792
Look, like that model AE?

89
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,357
You're about the same height, right?

90
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,583
He's pretending not to know again...

91
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,208
So cute.

92
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:11,417
No! I have to turn this
down, no matter what.

93
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:17,375
I'm too clumsy. I can't
even walk in a straight line.

94
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,375
What does being clumsy have to do with it?

95
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,000
Maybe so...

96
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,125
Enaga, you do look like
you might trip and fall.

97
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,250
Sumiura, you look like
you'd be good at this.

98
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,208
Why don't you give it a try?

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,875
Huh? Me?

100
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,625
Walking the runway as a model...

101
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,083
Yeah.

102
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,583
Just like AE.

103
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,500
Like this?

104
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,708
Not bad. That's great.

105
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,208
Really?

106
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,750
You kept your gaze steady.

107
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,125
And you walked heel-to-toe
in a perfectly straight line.

108
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:27,458
No way... Are you a
professional or something?

109
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:32,917
But seriously, I'm impressed.
Sumiura, you're a natural.

110
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:40,708
He's blushing. How cute.

111
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,833
Sumiura, that was a really good walk.

112
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,167
I never knew you had it in you!

113
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:47,292
Yeah.

114
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,625
Arguing about it is just a waste of time.

115
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,292
Whatever, I'll do it.

116
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,268
Anyway, about the production. How
are the design sketches coming along?

117
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:03,542
If you have some ideas,
let's share them with each other.

118
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,958
I've been looking forward to
seeing your designs, Sumiura.

119
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,625
Enaga's is... punk.

120
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,208
Sumiura, why isn't yours punk style?

121
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:39,583
I was so excited when I heard
the theme was "a night out."

122
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:44,375
I thought you'd get to show off
your signature punk style.

123
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,417
Don't tell me... you got scared off?

124
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,792
Because, about the punk theme before...

125
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,833
It's just not working.

126
00:10:57,167 --> 00:11:02,875
You just want to do punk, so you're
forcing the concept onto the design.

127
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,792
You know, I think what the teacher meant was,
"Don't just default to a specific genre."

128
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,000
Not that you shouldn't
do punk at all, right?

129
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,708
Didn't you say it takes courage
to go out clubbing for the first time?

130
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:21,833
And that you wanted to design an outfit
that could give those people courage?

131
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:29,000
(Shoot... I said too much.)

132
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:33,250
(I can't help myself when
it comes to clothes...)

133
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:37,625
Sorry, I didn't mean to
sound like I was lecturing you.

134
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,167
Enaga, you're right.

135
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:48,417
I was a little intimidated
by what happened last time.

136
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,375
Seeing your design made
me realize something.

137
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:58,667
"An outfit that gives you
courage for a night out."

138
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,583
It has to be punk. There's no other way.

139
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:09,417
I thought you were just clumsy,
but you're actually quite principled.

140
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,250
You really have a mind of your own.

141
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,333
Was I being blabbing too much?

142
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,000
A little, yeah.

143
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,023
But it's better than someone
who doesn't say anything at all.

144
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:28,042
Alright, let's get back to brainstorming.

145
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,458
Enaga, using these two intersecting colors
to express human connection is brilliant.

146
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:38,583
Sumiura, your use of bead patterns
to evoke neon city lights is so romantic.

147
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:43,458
For this part, I was thinking of using
beads and paint to create a plaid pattern.

148
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:50,208
For example, like the
lines on this patchwork...

149
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,292
Let me give you an example, like...

150
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,042
(P Mode Fashion College)

151
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,333
Professor Nakano.

152
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,750
I'm sorry
to always bother you on your break.

153
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:28,292
It's fine. So, is it finished?

154
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,167
Yes.

155
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:50,833
Hmm.

156
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,625
I think it's very good.

157
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,375
Huh? Really?

158
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:03,708
Enaga's bold, innovative style
and Sumiura's delicate, refined touch...

159
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,375
are both well-represented.

160
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,417
I can feel the connection between you two.

161
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,375
If you just refine the details
and the silhouette a bit more,

162
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,292
I think you can start production.

163
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,833
Thank you, Professor.

164
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,750
Thank you very much.

165
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,458
Let's go.

166
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,083
Okay, where should we start?

167
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:47,208
First, let's go find a pattern
in the resource room.

168
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:52,417
As for inspiration... How about we go to
the zoo or an exhibition over the break?

169
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,917
We can observe the structures
and lines of living things...

170
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:58,083
I have to tell him... about AE.

171
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,583
Sumiura.

172
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,625
Ah, your shoelace is untied.

173
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,667
Oh! Thanks.

174
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,125
If I'm going to say it... it has to be now.

175
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,292
Ah, it's tangled.

176
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,625
You're so clumsy.

177
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,292
What would you do without me?

178
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,875
I'm trying my best.

179
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,708
- Sumiura, I...
- You know,

180
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:37,042
I'm taking this competition very seriously.

181
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,917
It's for personal reasons,

182
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:45,500
but I'll probably pour more of myself
into this than for my graduation project.

183
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,875
Personal reasons?

184
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:53,208
I can't go into the details. We don't
know each other that well yet, Enaga.

185
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:58,708
(The way he talks is so cute.)

186
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,375
(But... this competition...)

187
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,000
(Is it really that important to Chiaki?)

188
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,208
Okay.

189
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,125
Let's go.

190
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,333
Yeah.

191
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,943
By the way, Enaga, were you
about to say something earlier?

192
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,625
(If I tell him right now that I'm AE, )

193
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,708
(whether Chiaki forgives
me or gets angry, )

194
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:28,167
(he won't be able to focus on his work.)

195
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,875
No, just that the competition
is only two months away.

196
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,417
We have to make every second count.

197
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,417
Yeah!

198
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,750
Let's make sure we win this competition.

199
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:49,208
(Right. Telling Chiaki the truth now...)

200
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,417
(...would just be for my own convenience.)

201
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,292
(Until this competition is over, )

202
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:58,833
(I'll just keep being
Enaga Ayumu around him.)

203
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:08,375
The tighter the lines are here...

204
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,125
the cuter it ends up looking, right?

205
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,708
True, but that makes
the silhouette stand out.

206
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,750
So the pants become crucial.

207
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,833
Exactly. What are we
deciding on for the pants?

208
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,038
For the pants, I'm thinking
of a flared cut for now.

209
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,083
How would that work
with the jacket's style?

210
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,226
If we do that, I feel like we'll stray
from the punk vibe we're going for.

211
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,208
We can add some beading as an accent
to bring back that punk feel.

212
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,833
- 80.
- Okay.

213
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:29,750
80.
91.

214
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,875
91.

215
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,476
For the vest color, are we sticking
with the black we talked about?

216
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,351
- Yeah, I think that works.
- What kind of fabric do you think we should use?

217
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,000
I want it to look... a little
more glamorous on the runway.

218
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,667
Glamorous... like this?

219
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:43,667
Oh, that's nice.
Isn't it a bit... frumpy?

220
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,375
Would a matte finish be better?

221
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,059
- This could work.
- A matte finish, then?

222
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:48,792
Yeah.

223
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,833
The left and right sides are different.

224
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,540
How many centimeters? Two?

225
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,208
Here, take a look.

226
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,208
Huh? I forgot.

227
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,625
Focus!

228
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:05,292
Maybe we could make them into shorts?

229
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,458
Shorts would be great.

230
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,667
Shorts, and we'll add the beading here.

231
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,417
(Sumiura Residence, No. 13)

232
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:52,708
Right now, just focus on the competition.

233
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,292
Focus!

234
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:59,458
Focus...

235
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,417
We're never going to finish...

236
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:33,625
At this rate, we won't make it in time.

237
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,583
What are we going to do?
The competition is next week.

238
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,708
This is a disaster.

239
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,667
Hey, Enaga, try to look
a little more panicked!

240
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,667
You guys are still here?

241
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:49,042
The school's about to close. Hurry up.

242
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,625
There's no other way.

243
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,833
Enaga, you want to come over to my place?

244
00:20:58,958 --> 00:20:59,792
Are you sure?

245
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:02,083
Yeah, let's do it. My place is closer.

246
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,934
Besides, we have to
pull an all-nighter to finish.

247
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,375
And I can't do it without your help.

248
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,417
So you just want me for my hands?

249
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,458
Hurry up and get your stuff.

250
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,458
Let's go.

251
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,458
Let me lean on your shoulder.

252
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,292
He's so close.

253
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:48,500
Chiaki, you're really different now.

254
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,583
This is a side of you I never
saw when you were with AE.

255
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,958
He can probably be
this natural around me...

256
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,875
because he doesn't see me that way.

257
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,583
This feeling sucks...

258
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,500
This is my place.

259
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,042
Oh.

260
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:15,875
You asked me about idols before,
remember?

261
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,375
Sumiura, are you a fan of any idols?

262
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,750
Idols?

263
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,500
Idols... Nah, not really.

264
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,500
Oh? Okay.

265
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,500
Actually, I am a fan of someone...

266
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,208
Coming in.

267
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,042
Enaga.

268
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:02,917
The idol I'm a fan of... is AE.

269
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,625
Wow...

270
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,893
(Next Episode Preview) Getting too
involved with people is just exhausting.

271
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,375
Those days were the absolute worst.

272
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,292
Mom.

273
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:26,167
I don't want to ruin what we have.

274
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:28,042
But ever since we got closer...

275
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,500
This distance between us...

276
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,684
Then we should just sleep together.

277
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,708
Can I turn off the lights?

278
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,542
(Sumiura Chiaki on a Day Off)

279
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,667
On my days off before I started clubbing,

280
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,917
I would ride my beloved bike
and go shopping.

281
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:53,250
I'm the kind of guy whose
bandages get called punk...

282
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,875
but this bike is the complete opposite.

283
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:05,750
Then again, I wonder if a
punk-style bike even exists.

284
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,250
All right, let's do this.
