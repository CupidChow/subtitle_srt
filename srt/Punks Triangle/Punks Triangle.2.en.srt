1
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:11,458
Just walk right past?

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,875
Good. Let's get a few more shots.

3
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,042
Great, great.

4
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:20,958
I used to just walk straight ahead...

5
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:25,667
Staring down the lens was second nature...

6
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,952
But the needle of the sewing
machine followed a curve,

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,958
and it pierced me.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,500
That's when I realized...

9
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,417
some people just aren't
cut out for certain things.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,583
But...

11
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,667
the dress Sumiura made...

12
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,250
was so delicate, so pure...

13
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,250
so beautiful.

14
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,875
"PUNKS△TRIANGLE"
(Episode 2)

15
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:34,083
Let me see you to the door.

16
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,417
Thank you.

17
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,875
Thank you.

18
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,208
Thank you for coming.

19
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,625
I'm so glad I found something I like.
Thank you so much.

20
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,750
Please come again.

21
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,375
Thank you for your purchase.

22
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:50,917
Manager.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,625
Sumiura-kun seems to be
in a great mood, doesn't he!?

24
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,750
Yeah.

25
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:55,500
Manager.

26
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,542
We're out of the chain necklaces.
Can I place another order?

27
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,667
Absolutely! Go for it.

28
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:05,250
Hasegawa-san,
I can handle that inquiry from earlier.

29
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,750
Thanks.

30
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:11,917
Manager.

31
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:15,417
Sumiura-kun... he just
called me "Hasegawa-san"!

32
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:18,083
That's great, isn't it?

33
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,917
I've read that DM over and over.

34
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,458
But I still can't believe it.

35
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:33,292
AE didn't just notice me,

36
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,083
we even had an indirect kiss.

37
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,458
With this momentum, the
competition should be a breeze.

38
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,375
So, for the competition...

39
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,167
Let's nail down the concept, Enaga!

40
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,500
Enaga, did you finish the design
sketches for the competition?

41
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah...

42
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,958
Then... let's show each other.

43
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,458
You seem to be in a pretty
good mood, Sumiura-kun.

44
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,000
You think so?

45
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,083
Here.

46
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:18,542
Huh?

47
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:27,417
Enaga, let's submit our
designs to the teacher separately.

48
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:29,625
And then we'll make
whichever one gets approved.

49
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,333
Now that's the Sumiura I know...

50
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,083
I knew you'd be here.

51
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,000
Nakano-sensei, sorry to
bother you on your break.

52
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,143
Could you take a look at these for us?

53
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,583
Sure.

54
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:56,917
Ah...

55
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:03,417
Um...

56
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,083
Sumiura-kun.

57
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:09,917
This won't work at all.

58
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,875
Huh?

59
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:16,083
I can definitely feel
your passion for punk.

60
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:21,708
But the theme for "Fashion Navigation" this
time... is "Human Connection." Do you understand?

61
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:23,292
Yes, of course.

62
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:26,792
Punk fashion has an aspect
of sharing a rebellious spirit.

63
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:28,750
So in that sense, punk also...

64
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,875
You've got it backwards.

65
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,000
Huh?

66
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:38,333
You wanted to do punk,
so you're just forcing the theme to fit.

67
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,708
Have you seen Enaga-kun's collage
and concept notes?

68
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:52,000
No, just the design sketch.

69
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:59,583
First, you need to
properly "connect" with him.

70
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,083
Yes...

71
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,542
Thank you, sensei.

72
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:34,167
It's true, I was only thinking about what
kind of clothes I wanted AE to wear, and...

73
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,917
Sorry for the wait!

74
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,542
After meeting AE, I was on cloud nine.

75
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,833
This is no good. I need to get it together.

76
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,333
Sumiura-kun.

77
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,792
Sorry, Enaga.

78
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:06,875
Let me see your inspiration notebook again.

79
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,500
Okay.

80
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,208
The streets... at night.

81
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:20,625
I think nighttime is when people connect.

82
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,583
People with different jobs,
wearing different styles of clothes,

83
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,750
sit side by side, drinking together.

84
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,792
I wanted to capture that feeling of an
instantaneous connection between people

85
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:35,083
and put it into the clothes.

86
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,875
I see.

87
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,417
This design sketch...

88
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,875
is depicting the light spilling out
from the shops at night.

89
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,375
Still...

90
00:07:54,125 --> 00:08:01,167
his choice of photos, color
schemes, and composition...

91
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,333
is just undeniably impressive.

92
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:08,500
Enaga, you've got great taste.

93
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,750
But I feel my design is too plain.

94
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,208
Sumiura-kun's is much
more suited for the stage.

95
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:22,167
I was wondering if I should
try a different approach.

96
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:23,917
True.

97
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:27,083
It might need a little more "playfulness."

98
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:30,625
A night out.

99
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:37,917
Let me teach you what a real night out is.

100
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:42,917
Hey, what about "a night out"?

101
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,167
A night out...

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's good. It's more positive and active.

103
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:55,458
Going out at night is an act of making
instant connections with all kinds of people.

104
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,000
And besides...

105
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,500
Going out for the first time...

106
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,458
I think that takes a lot of courage.

107
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,417
So...

108
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:13,667
the clothes that become
your "pillar of courage"...

109
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,292
I hope the clothes I make...

110
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:21,250
can also be that source
of courage for someone.

111
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,833
Let's make clothes that give people
the courage to get closer to each other.

112
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,042
Sounds great.

113
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,458
So what are we doing today?

114
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,863
Finish the design sketches here?

115
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,667
Or should we do some research...

116
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,667
We're going out, of course!

117
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:02,042
Enaga, have you ever been to a club?

118
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,333
Um...

119
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't worry.

120
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,417
I'll be your nightlife guide.

121
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,167
Please, lead the way.

122
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,708
By the way,

123
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,125
what kind of club do you think
would suit Enaga?

124
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,450
Is it that thing that turns
into two pairs of scissors?

125
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,083
That's the character for plum blossom!

126
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,750
The club I usually go to is...

127
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,125
This is it.

128
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,917
You okay? Nervous?

129
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:36,708
No, I'm fine.

130
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:44,583
It's gonna be loud when I open
the door, so don't be startled.

131
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:46,667
Thanks.

132
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,000
What is this?

133
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:28,583
Looks like a live performance
mixed with a painting event?

134
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:32,125
Hey, if you wanna join in,
you gotta buy a T-shirt first.

135
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,708
I see, so it's mainly
about selling T-shirts.

136
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,273
Are you kidding me? They're
really doing something this lame?

137
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:43,958
Sumiura-kun, isn't this your usual spot?

138
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,167
Well... yes, it is.

139
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:50,458
But I wore my favorite jeans today.

140
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:54,792
They even sell pants. Come on, let's have
fun. This is what a night out is all about.

141
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,667
Let's go, Sumiura.

142
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,000
Amidst the booming music and neon lights...

143
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,583
vivid paint splattered everywhere.

144
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,500
I never knew...

145
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:44,625
that under a blacklight,
a white T-shirt would glow aqua blue.

146
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,250
Sorry...

147
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,917
Enaga! I'm gonna make your T-shirt
the ugliest in the world.

148
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,708
Sumiura-kun, right back at you.

149
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,542
No! You can't do that.

150
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,958
Hold on.

151
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,042
What is happening?

152
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,542
I'm in the same place I
was with AE yesterday,

153
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,708
having the same kind of night out,

154
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:52,417
but it feels completely different.

155
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,667
It's so weird.

156
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:29,375
What's wrong?

157
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,375
"Sumi-ura?" That's so lame!

158
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,083
Poop-colored~

159
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,208
That's because you smeared
every single color on me, Enaga.

160
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,458
Enaga, for some reason,
you actually look more stylish like this.

161
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,463
Is that supposed to be a
backhanded compliment?

162
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,458
Enaga, a belly button ring...

163
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,542
I'm surprised, Enaga. Didn't
take you for the type to have one.

164
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:59,292
A slob like you with a belly button ring...

165
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,083
It's kinda hot?

166
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,958
Don't get cocky.

167
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,542
And when you're changing, you
could at least take off your hat, right?

168
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,625
Stop staring, it's embarrassing.

169
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,208
What's there to see?

170
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,708
You're surprisingly toned.

171
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,458
Compared to you, I
feel kinda self-conscious.

172
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,083
Sumiura, you've got paint on your back.

173
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,000
- Here...
- You little...

174
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,375
Is it off yet?

175
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,583
Almost... there.

176
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:51,125
You're... so clumsy.

177
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:53,792
Sorry.

178
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,958
Mmm.

179
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,208
Stop it...

180
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,208
Just a little more...

181
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,000
Hurry up!

182
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:56,083
This kind of feels like a date.

183
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,958
Huh? A date with you?

184
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
It's fun.

185
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,958
I'm not having fun at all.

186
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,333
Really?

187
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,208
So, how was it?

188
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,213
Did you get any inspiration
from our night out?

189
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,750
What about you?
Wasn't it your first time?

190
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:22,167
Since it was with you, Sumiura,
my first night out was amazing.

191
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,667
Even if I ended up covered
in poop-colored paint.

192
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,083
I told you to drop it.

193
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,667
Poop-colored, poop-colored.

194
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:31,792
Wait!

195
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,208
Being with you is seriously exhausting.

196
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh... no.

197
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,875
Uh... what's his name again?

198
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,708
The model for this competition... AE?

199
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
He's still pretending he doesn't know me...

200
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,375
So cute...

201
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:11,292
If we win this competition,
we can get him to wear our design.

202
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,726
Would that really make you happy?

203
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,958
Of course!

204
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,750
Wait... Isn't it because of AE?

205
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,167
That's not why I said it!

206
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:24,292
Look! Of course I'd be
happy to win the competition.

207
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:25,917
Hmm...

208
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:35,250
Hey, Sumiura Chiaki.
Do you have a 'bias'?

209
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,542
A bias?

210
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,417
Yeah, a bias.

211
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,875
No, I don't.

212
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,375
I see.

213
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,792
Enaga Ayumu, what about you?

214
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,708
Do you have a bias?

215
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,417
Maybe... I do.

216
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,083
What do you mean, 'maybe'?

217
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:04,125
Well, my place is this
way. See you at school.

218
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,292
W-Well then...

219
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:05,000
Sumiura Chiaki... We've
been together for so long.

220
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,792
And you haven't noticed at all.

221
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:12,375
I never thought...

222
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,250
I'd be deceiving you like this.

223
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:19,458
Could you show me
some of your previous design work?

224
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,292
But every time I see your innocent side...

225
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,833
It's a night out, right?

226
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,125
Let me show you
what a real night out is like.

227
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,208
It makes me want to
gently stroke your chin.

228
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:36,625
But for some reason, I also want
to completely shatter that innocence.

229
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:42,208
You... You haven't taken it off yet?

230
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,542
It feels so strange.

231
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:52,917
I never thought I'd run into Sumiura Chiaki
'here' too.

232
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:03,601
"Thanks so much. I'll let you
know once the schedule is set."

233
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,265
- "I'm counting on you then~
- We're having 'that' party tomorrow!"

234
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,458
Tomorrow...

235
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:43,208
For some reason... I feel really happy.

236
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,542
This kind of feels like a date.

237
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,417
No, what am I saying? A date?

238
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,000
You've got paint on your back.

239
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,167
What am I even thinking?

240
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,667
"Chiaki-kun, are you free tomorrow night?"

241
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,250
"I'll be there."

242
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:12,250
I can see AE again.

243
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:22,083
Yes! I get to see him. I get to see him!

244
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,476
(Next Episode)
Wow~ I'm going for drinks with AE now.

245
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:32,875
Let's go.

246
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,500
If my body won't listen,
I'll just follow my heart.

247
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,458
It's like I have AE all to myself.

248
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:38,833
It feels a little naughty.

249
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,292
He taught me so many things.

250
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:41,601
The first time my heart skipped a beat.

251
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:44,458
By the way, Chiaki, is
there someone you like?
