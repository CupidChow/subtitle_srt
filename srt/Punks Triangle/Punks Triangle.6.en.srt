1
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:14,833
It's AE! He's so cool! Seriously amazing.

2
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,583
Fantastic!

3
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:19,125
Perfect.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,625
- This one's great.
- That one's awesome, too.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,042
Thanks!

6
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,875
- So handsome!
- Oh, nice.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,958
You've got such an ethereal vibe today.

8
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,375
Thank you.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,060
That twitch in your throat, are you OK?

10
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,375
- So cool...
- Perfect! This one's amazing.

11
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:51,792
Perfect, that was really great!

12
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:53,083
Thanks.

13
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,708
Great work. Today's shoot was fantastic.

14
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,684
Everyone was raving about you. They
said your dreamy expression was incredible.

15
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:00,792
Oh, really?

16
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:04,167
By the way, isn't the school's design
competition the day after tomorrow?

17
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:07,042
I've cleared your entire
schedule for that day.

18
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,333
Please, whatever you do, don't
let anyone find out you're AE.

19
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:14,417
Also, about next month's schedule...
I'll send it to you later.

20
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,417
- Got it.
- Thanks for your help.

21
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,500
AE, great work.

22
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,958
Saeki-san.

23
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:42,250
Did something happen... with that guy?

24
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:51,667
That expression of yours was both sexy and
sad... it didn't look like you were just working.

25
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,750
You looked completely heartbroken.

26
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:06,875
But the reason it all
fell apart... it's all my fault.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,250
I'm doing the one thing that
would hurt him the most right now.

28
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:20,917
Looks like you're in
full-on lovesick idiot mode.

29
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,083
Something like that.

30
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,893
I don't know what's
going on between you two.

31
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:26,434
But you still have the
competition to prepare for.

32
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,417
Being lovesick on top of
that is a recipe for disaster.

33
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:34,000
You'll end up getting torn to shreds.

34
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,667
You're right.

35
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:42,167
Anyway, try not to overthink it for now.

36
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:43,542
Okay.

37
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:46,417
But you know... being foolish
enough to love someone that much...

38
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,458
is actually kind of romantic.

39
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:52,042
I want a love like that, too.

40
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,875
Alright, see ya.

41
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,750
Good work.

42
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:02,250
Great work! Bye-bye!

43
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:12,458
Right now, I just have to
focus on the competition.

44
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:33,083
It's been three months
since I last heard from him...

45
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,500
"Thanks for yesterday! I had a great time."

46
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,434
"I completely blacked out for the
second half. I must've been wasted, sorry!"

47
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,738
"If you're up for it... I'd
like to hear what you think."

48
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:55,833
No, no, I have to focus on the competition.

49
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,417
To make my dream come true!

50
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,750
AE!?

51
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,417
AE!

52
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,083
Chiaki...

53
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,292
"PUNKS△TRIANGLE"
(Episode 6)

54
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,708
- Wh-What do I do?
- What am I going to do...

55
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,792
I called out to him on impulse.

56
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,667
And now I'm completely speechless...

57
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:49,292
I really need to apologize to him soon.

58
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:52,417
The competition is the day after tomorrow.

59
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,833
Of all the times to run into him.

60
00:06:55,458 --> 00:07:00,417
Chiaki is a model, so I don't want to
give him anything extra to worry about.

61
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:16,083
I can't... He's too handsome.

62
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,625
Take your time, Chiaki.

63
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:31,417
I'm sorry. I promised
I wouldn't drink too much next time.

64
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,792
It's fine if you drink a lot.

65
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,750
I just don't want you to push yourself.

66
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,958
How did you recognize me so quickly?

67
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,083
Of course I'd recognize you.

68
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:55,250
The way you walk...

69
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,417
It's because it's you.

70
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,833
The way I walk?

71
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:10,917
I really love the way you walk.

72
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:13,500
I've watched you so many
times, so I recognized it instantly.

73
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,792
No matter how big the crowd is...

74
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:19,917
if it's you walking...

75
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,042
I would never get it wrong.

76
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:39,833
Right, about that time with Enaga...

77
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,125
He was deliberately slouching
when he walked to keep a low profile.

78
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,542
Could it be...

79
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:56,417
The look in your eyes... and the way
you walked... like you were on a runway.

80
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,625
It was so cool...

81
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,375
So that's why... Chiaki's runway
walk is so good. It's because...

82
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,167
The reason he can walk so beautifully...

83
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:12,542
is because he secretly copied
my walk over and over again...

84
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,125
Like this...

85
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,042
It's... it's creepy, isn't it?

86
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,583
I said something weird again...

87
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,333
Um...

88
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,042
About last time, I'm really...

89
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm sorry!

90
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,292
Ah...

91
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,500
Wow, that's a pretty
artistic-looking spill.

92
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,458
I'm so sorry!

93
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,167
Are you okay? I'm really sorry!

94
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,375
This stuff works wonders
on red wine and liquor stains.

95
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,917
Oh, really?

96
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,708
Just let it soak for a few
minutes, then rinse it with water.

97
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,542
Then blow-dry it, and you're all set.

98
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,750
Leave it to me.

99
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,500
I'll get it perfectly clean for you.

100
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,833
Chiaki.

101
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,292
Where exactly are you planning to wash it?

102
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:21,167
Oh, right...

103
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,208
S-Sorry.

104
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,000
I was just panicking.

105
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,833
It's okay. I wanted to
talk to you more anyway.

106
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,875
I can just use this to
wash it when I get home.

107
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,250
No, wait!

108
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,125
I... I want to talk with
you a little longer.

109
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,875
Chiaki.

110
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,750
Um...

111
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,917
Is there a faucet nearby?

112
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,042
What about that hotel?

113
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,333
Huh?

114
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,684
The sign says "Rest." I guess it's a
hotel where you can just rest for a bit.

115
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,458
Chiaki, this is a...

116
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:22,125
Okay, let's dry your shirt here.

117
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,458
Chiaki.

118
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,708
Do you know what a love hotel is?

119
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,167
A love hotel!?

120
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:40,826
It's a place where
couples go to... you know.

121
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:47,292
Me... I'm okay with it if I'm with you.

122
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,417
But are you?

123
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,833
Just kidding.

124
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,375
Let's just find a business hotel.

125
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,667
I... I'm okay with it, too.

126
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,083
Huh?

127
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,083
Let's hurry inside.

128
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,000
Otherwise, the stain will set.

129
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:13,792
Huh...

130
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,083
This is all so sudden.

131
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,958
If I weren't Enaga...

132
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,167
- This bed is huge!
- If my name wasn't AE...

133
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:37,333
There are so many light switches.

134
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,583
And the TV is massive!

135
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,125
I want to hug him right now.

136
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,833
Hm?

137
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:50,183
What kind of tea is this?
I've never seen it before.

138
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,875
That's lubricant.

139
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,375
Lubricant!

140
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:04,875
To think I'm in a place
like this with my bias...

141
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,833
So, what now?

142
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,542
Um... please take off your shirt.

143
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,833
Ah! For the stain!

144
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:25,125
Chiaki, you're so cute. I get it.

145
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,500
Okay, it's off.

146
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,208
My bias's naked body!

147
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,375
Chiaki, are you okay?

148
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,375
Oh, AE, you have a belly button piercing.

149
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,875
Crap.

150
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,583
Oh, Enaga has a belly
button piercing, too...

151
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,750
This situation is way too similar.

152
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,167
Um...

153
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:31,958
You have a belly button
piercing. A friend of mine does, too.

154
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:37,125
Belly button piercings are
so cool. It really suits you.

155
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,250
Chiaki...

156
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,750
Sorry! I'll go wash the stain now.

157
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,000
Sorry, it just needs
to soak a little longer.

158
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,375
Thanks.

159
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,042
A bathrobe!

160
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,833
This is so seductive.

161
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,748
This feels like something
out of an American movie.

162
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:28,875
Hm?

163
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,833
Um... AE.

164
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,875
Today, too...

165
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:56,000
Every time we meet, I
just cause trouble for you.

166
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,292
I'm really sorry.

167
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,917
The last time we saw each other,

168
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:07,951
I don't remember it very clearly...

169
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,292
I threw up, and you took care of me.

170
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,750
I've been wanting to
apologize to you for that.

171
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,375
That's not something
you need to apologize for.

172
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,167
Huh?

173
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:35,125
Chiaki, I know you can't hold your liquor.

174
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,000
I should have stopped
you from drinking more.

175
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,708
Then... why didn't you answer my messages?

176
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,792
That was because...

177
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,417
Have I... been putting him in a
difficult position this whole time?

178
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,458
You don't have to tell me why!

179
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:09,250
I just... I really wanted to apologize.

180
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,917
Chiaki...

181
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,542
Then can I...

182
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,250
Can I ask for something selfish?

183
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,000
Something selfish?

184
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:29,958
Please... leave a memory on me.

185
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,208
Huh?

186
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,451
I want... you to give me a piercing.

187
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,542
You want me... to pierce your ear?

188
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,583
I got my lip pierced because of you.

189
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,000
Every time I touch it,

190
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:04,833
I remember the moment I first saw you.

191
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:11,750
So whenever I feel anxious, I touch it.

192
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:16,667
And it gives me courage.

193
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,625
That's why...

194
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,750
I've been thinking that if I
ever got to see you again,

195
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,333
I'd ask you to give me a new one.

196
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,917
That way, I can always remember...

197
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:41,417
the memory of this... night out with you.

198
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,833
Is that... not okay?

199
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,417
Okay.

200
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,000
Where do you want it?

201
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,958
Um...

202
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,333
I want to get one just like yours...

203
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,542
right here.

204
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:43,292
Is this spot okay?

205
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,667
Let me just sanitize it for you.

206
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:57,917
This is probably... the
last time we'll ever meet.

207
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,625
The moment I saw the
hesitation on his face... I knew.

208
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:12,833
He must have tons of fans like me.

209
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:20,875
He's not the kind of person to
say, "I don't want to see you,"

210
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,417
or "You're annoying."

211
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,792
I don't think we'll ever
have another night like this.

212
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,958
Ready? Here I go.

213
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:38,542
Never... again.

214
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:42,875
Mmm...

215
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,583
Just try to relax.

216
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,958
You okay? Does it hurt?

217
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,292
I'm... I'm okay.

218
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,750
Okay, I'm pushing it through.

219
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,083
Ah... AE.

220
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,542
Are you all right?

221
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:41,667
Mmm-hmm...

222
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:51,839
This way... he'll always be on my body.

223
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,583
Chiaki...

224
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,333
Now we match.

225
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,792
Yeah...

226
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:40,118
Do you... like me in that way?

227
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,583
AE?

228
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:50,542
It's okay. You're cute.

229
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,083
So... is that a no?

230
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,167
That's not it.

231
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,875
Let's go, Chiaki.

232
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,833
What do I do? I have to say something.

233
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,625
I can't just stay silent.

234
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,833
I can't let it end like this.

235
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,875
I can't just let him walk away...

236
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,625
I'm heading out.

237
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,417
Go home and get some rest, okay, Chiaki?

238
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,434
(Next Episode Preview)
We can never go back to how things were.

239
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,208
All I can think about is AE.

240
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,042
Damn it! We lost.

241
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:25,750
What now?
The way I walk...

242
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,559
He must have watched me
so many times. I just know it.

243
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:29,583
AE...
