"P-MODE Series 2025 SHOW NAVI
Presents: The Connection Between People"

2
00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:08,083
When I saw Enaga walking toward me,

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,250
I remembered his name,
Ayumu, means 'to walk.'

4
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:24,208
It must have been a name given by the gods.

5
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:29,792
A gaze so sharp you
can't look him in the eye.

6
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:31,875
So tense it takes your breath away.

7
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:35,000
His walk is so powerful,

8
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,292
yet it has a casual, effortless cool.

9
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:41,500
And the best part is...

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,000
he makes the clothes look insanely good.

11
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,875
That's AE's walk.

12
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:54,726
That outfit is awesome, right?

13
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,500
The model is gorgeous too.

14
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,000
Incredible.

15
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,375
That outfit was just thrown
together on the spot, but...

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,042
with Enaga's presence,
it looks like a finished piece.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,250
The glowing fabric and pattern are...

18
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:18,750
the bright paint colors I saw
on my night out with Enaga.

19
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:22,083
The colors of those beads are...

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,500
from when I was out at night with AE,

21
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,250
the color of the dawn sky.

22
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:35,833
I used to think that once something
was broken, it was hopeless.

23
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:40,422
Enaga and the clothes are both
expressing themselves with all they have.

24
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:45,417
This is punk. Even broken
things can be fashion.

25
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:52,208
And then... I understood.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,042
Enaga...

27
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:59,208
is AE.

"PUNKS△TRIANGLE" (Episode 8)

29
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,333
Sumiura.

30
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,083
You could have just called me Chiaki.

31
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:50,208
Was it fun? Watching me be so clueless?

32
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,042
You had fun messing with me, didn't you?

33
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,875
Enaga.

34
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,250
You know, right?

35
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,875
I hate feeling like I've been deceived.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,417
Yeah.

37
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,417
That day...

38
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,000
why did you kiss me?

39
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:42,458
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,125
Even so, I still want you, Chiaki.

41
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,333
- Chiaki...
- Please.

42
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,917
Stop messing with my feelings.

43
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:17,958
Just go... I don't want
to see you right now.

44
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:55,000
Sumiura, your design won first place!

45
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,750
Where's Enaga?

46
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,333
After that...

47
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:05,792
Enaga and I never spoke again.

48
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,750
Thanks for coming.

49
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,500
Thank you.

50
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:29,083
Hey, boss.

51
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:33,083
Didn't Sumiura win that competition?

52
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:38,500
I think so, but he gets
quiet whenever it comes up.

53
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:43,500
Man, I'd love to see Sumiura smile.

54
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,792
I've seen it.

55
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,625
For real? When?

56
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,292
During his first interview.

57
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,750
Sumiura might seem a little unreliable,

58
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:00,208
but when he talked about
why he wanted to work here,

59
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,125
he had a great look on his face.

60
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,417
I had no idea.

61
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,375
I think that sometimes,
clothes can make you brave.

62
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,292
They give you the courage to be yourself
without worrying what others think.

63
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:19,250
I want to help other
people find that courage too.

64
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,042
I figured back then,

65
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,000
that he was probably
lacking in confidence himself.

66
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:32,375
The kind of person who found
courage through punk fashion.

67
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,958
So that's why...

68
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:52,297
No wonder... when Enaga said he wanted to make
'clothes that let you hold your head high, '

69
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:56,542
it resonated with me so much.

70
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:58,143
Should we practice this part first?

71
00:08:58,167 --> 00:08:59,542
I want to practice.

72
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,833
Deep down, I know.

73
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,667
Enaga is really serious
about making clothes.

74
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:08,375
Yeah, that's it.

75
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:17,208
Enaga probably knew
how important this competition was to me.

76
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:22,417
He didn't tell me so I
could focus on the design.

77
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:29,042
My head understands all that, but...

(P Mode Fashion Academy)

79
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,167
To get your designs recognized,

80
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:42,333
the key is how you express your ideas.

81
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,208
My mind is a complete mess.

82
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:54,042
I have no idea how to face Enaga.

83
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:59,292
I can't even look him in the eye.

84
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,101
Alright everyone, let's
start the practical work.

85
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,750
Consider the characteristics
of your fabric as you design.

86
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,250
Okay...

87
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,208
Chiaki.

88
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:46,500
This is the invitation for the TBC.

89
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,875
Nakano-sensei just gave it to me.

90
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,708
Enaga, this is for you.

91
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,667
Uh...

92
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,500
It's for Sumiura.

93
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,750
I thought it would be
better coming from you.

94
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,833
You guys are partners, after all.

95
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,958
Okay.

96
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,208
No thanks.

97
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,417
I... don't want to go.

98
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,458
I know I have no right to say this,

99

come see it, Chiaki.

trouble of coming here too.

Huh? Where's Enaga?

113
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,083
Forget about that. Sumiura, hurry!

114
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,583
You can still make it.

115

- Right.

I'm so out of breath...

126
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,125
Of course...

127
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,333
He's still so...

128
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,417
incredibly cool.

129
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:31,000
Please welcome the
hottest model right now, AE!

130
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:40,792
I hear the theme of this piece is
"The Connection Between People."

131
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:44,042
AE, how does it feel to actually wear it?

132
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:45,750
Well...

133
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:54,000
Hmm... it's the kind of outfit that makes
you want to go out and party all night.

134
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I think expressing human connection
through colors, fabrics, and safety pins

135
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,167
is a very interesting idea.

136
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,750
In the past...

137
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:19,792
I always felt if clothes tore or relationships
broke, I should just give up and throw them away.

138
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,625
But if it's something I truly care about,

139
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:24,833
from now on,

140
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:29,417
I'll use safety pins if I have to,
to patch it up and hold it together.

141
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,042
That's how I feel now.

142
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:39,958
Sumiura...

143
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,833
Sorry, you'll have to excuse me.

144
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,292
Huh? Ah, AE-san?

145
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,417
AE was looking at me when he said that.

146
00:16:57,542 --> 00:17:01,042
If something is important,
you have to find a way to hold on to it...

147
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,542
It's okay, You're cute.

148
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,125
Even so, I still want you.

149
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:14,083
I can't... My head's a mess,
my chest is burning up.

150
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:17,583
I...

151
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,500
Chiaki!

152
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,292
Chiaki, wait! Listen to me.

153
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,083
I have nothing to say to you!

154
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,958
Your shoelace, it's untied.

155
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,542
Huh? Now?

156
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:44,417
I've been meaning to ask,
are shoelaces really that important?

157
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:50,125
I once saw a colleague have an accident
on the runway...

158
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,875
Ah.

159
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,500
Messed it up again...

160
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:13,167
Seriously! You're so cute.

161
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:18,792
Chiaki...

162
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,583
Be quiet. Stop talking to
me with that handsome face.

163
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,500
Can I reintroduce myself?

164
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,208
It's nice to meet you.

165
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,000
My name is Enaga Ayumu.

166
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,375
I'm a professional model,
and my stage name is AE.

167
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,917
I'm clumsy, but I want to make clothes.

168
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,958
I'm currently attending night
classes at a fashion school.

169
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,750
And I... I'm in love with someone.

170
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:02,167
Honestly, I first approached
you out of curiosity.

171
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,292
You don't go out much, do you?

172
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:08,833
Yeah, I only really know about fashion...

173
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,792
Seeing all your different
expressions was interesting and cute.

174
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,167
You're straightforward,
honest, and considerate...

175
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,667
a little worrying, but also very pure.

176
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:32,333
As we spent time together,
I fell for you...

177
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:43,167
But I... I selfishly hurt that person.

178
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,583
I kept trying to figure out what to say
to fix things.

179
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,708
I thought I needed more
time to talk it out properly.

180
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,125
I kept hesitating and
dragged it out for too long.

181
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:03,000
But when I put on the clothes
I made with Chiaki again,

182
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:08,375
I decided I had to tell you right now.

183
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:16,625
I'm in love with you, Sumiura Chiaki.

184
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:26,333
As Enaga Ayumu,
can we start over as friends?

185
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,042
No.

186
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,167
If not, I'll wait.

187
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,000
That's not it!

188
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,667
Starting over as friends is impossible.

189
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:46,083
Because... I'm already in love with you.

190
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,917
Chiaki.

191
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,250
- Let me see your face.
- No!

192
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:57,125
What am I supposed to do?

193
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,583
I was trying to just hate
all of you, AE included.

194
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,050
But even when I was making clothes,
you were all I could think about...

195
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:08,292
I get jealous when I see
Enaga being popular at school.

196
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:09,792
Huh?

197
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,333
Really?

198
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:17,958
And... AE is, after all, super handsome.

199
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:23,208
But your clumsy side is also really cute.

200
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,583
You're just too much.

201
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,167
Ever since I met you,

202
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,417
I haven't had a moment's peace.

203
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,542
I'm so sorry...

204
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,292
Can I see your face?

205
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:57,750
It's been so long since
you've looked me in the eye.

206
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,292
This way, we can't really see each other.

207
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,375
Because...

208
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,458
When I look in your eyes,
you're just so handsome.

209
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,383
I feel like I could
forgive you for anything.

210
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,833
Even as Enaga?

211
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:22,125
Enaga... is handsome, too.

212
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,000
AE...

213
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,625
No more secrets.

214
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:41,917
I promise.

215
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,750
I'm sorry for making you cry so much.

216
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,667
I should have done this sooner.

217
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:52,125
Yeah, you should have.

218
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,083
By the way...

219
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,958
I thought as AE
you'd have a much cooler way of confessing.

220
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,583
This is the first time I've
ever been this serious.

221
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,750
So of course I'm going
to be a little awkward.

222
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,693
Your heart is beating so fast, AE.

223
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:17,042
Right. My bias is just a person, after all.

224
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,458
It's not fair for you to be this cute.

225
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,208
AE...

226
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,667
You taught me how to have
adventures at night, but...

227
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,875
no one's ever taught me how to kiss.

228
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,917
You're right. Let me teach you.

229
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:47,333
Chiaki, close your eyes.

230
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:53,417
You don't have to hold your breath.

231
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:57,083
Just relax.

232
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,417
This is so... so embarrassing...

233
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,000
You're so cute.

234
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,000
Huh? Isn't that AE?

235
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,000
It is AE! Who's that with him?

236
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:49,667
Someone's coming...

237
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:55,208
It's fine. I've decided
I'm not hiding anymore.

238
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,583
Chiaki, it's the middle of the day.

239
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,958
So, where should we go for our date?

240
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:25,917
Sorry, this is the last one.

241
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,167
I'll go get one, then.

242
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:30,000
We can just share.

243
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,792
Huh?

244
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,792
What are you looking at?

245
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,417
It's Enaga...

246
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,583
Enaga... that guy...

247
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,417
Enaga...

248
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,292
So cute.

249
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,958
This is so...

250
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,083
Incredibly blissful!

251
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,667
Do you want some?

252
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:28,875
Yeah.
