1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,542
That was when I was a
senior in high school...

2
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,292
I was trying to get out of the house,

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,500
so I went to a fashion show with a friend.

4
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,583
Right then, I made up my mind.

5
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:23,199
The minute I got back, I was
going to get my lip pierced.

6
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:40,792
(Three Years Later)

7
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,250
Thank you.

8
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,833
Thanks.

9
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,500
Thank you for stopping by.

10
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,000
Hey, boss.

11
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,833
We just got an email inquiry.

12
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,625
They're asking if we can
special order this chain necklace.

13
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,500
Oh, another one for this necklace?

14
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,292
It's the same accessory AE wears, right?

15
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:09,417
That's the one.

16
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,958
We've already gotten a ton
of calls about it this morning.

17
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,500
Everyone's fighting over it right now.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,667
Tell me about it.

19
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,917
AE is huge right now.

20
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:24,500
Sumiura, you can head out soon.

21
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:26,417
Okay.

22
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,375
I'm heading out then.

23
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:33,375
Later, Sumiura.

24
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,750
Ugh... He ignored me.

25
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,333
That's just how he is.
He gives everyone the cold shoulder.

26
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,458
Don't take it personally.

27
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,583
You're so gross.

28
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,625
You're pale as a ghost.

29
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:08,417
- You look like a zombie.
- A zombie?

30
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,000
- You're totally a zombie.
- Who are you calling a zombie?!

31
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,417
- I'm human!
- I'm human!

32
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:15,083
- You're a zombie!
- You're a zombie!

33
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,083
Better than your face, anyway.

34
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,500
(P Mode Fashion Institute)

35
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,167
That's AE. Sumiura, are you a fan too?

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,042
Not really.

37
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,875
Oh, I see.

38
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,000
- Shino-san.
- Hey.

39
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,375
Shot down in an instant...

40
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,976
I saw him looking up AE all the time,
so I just assumed he was a fan.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But I guess not.

42
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,625
He's always sitting
in that seat by himself.

43
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,667
Doesn't seem like he
wants to interact with anyone.

44
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,708
Well, this school is full
of all sorts of people.

45
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,042
But seriously,
Sumiura is a total enigma.

46
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,708
What does he even do during the day?

47
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,917
Well... I do know where he works.

48
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,417
It's "LABORATORY" in Harajuku.

49
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,583
Huh? LABORATORY?!

50
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,750
Isn't that the shop famous
for its killer punk selection?

51
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,667
I've been dying to go there.

52
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,101
By the way, Shino-san,
how do you know that?

53
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,375
The salon I used to work at was nearby.

54
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,292
I don't need that kind of fake socializing.

55
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,625
To be a successful fashion designer,

56
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,000
you have to be the best in the class.

57
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,167
Which means...

58
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,667
everyone is my enemy!

59
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,083
"PUNKS△TRIANGLE"
(Episode 1)

60
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,750
We're now in the second
year of our night fashion course.

61
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:21,500
I trust you've all mastered the
fundamentals of garment construction.

62
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,715
So, without further ado...

63
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:27,625
we've received a corporate collaboration offer
from the Tokyo Emerging Designers Exhibition.

64
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,500
A corporate collaboration?

65
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,309
This time, the theme is "Human Connection."

66
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,500
Please create your designs
based on this concept.

67
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,625
Furthermore, the winning design
from our school's fashion show...

68
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,083
will be worn by a celebrity model.

69
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,792
- A celebrity model?
- Who is it?

70
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,792
Professor! So who is it?

71
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,667
The model is...

72
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:55,708
the super-popular model, AE.

73
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,667
That's right. The one and only AE
will walk the runway in your design.

74
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,917
AE.

75
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,792
"That" AE?

76
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,684
Does this mean... I have a chance
to get AE to wear my creation?

77
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:11,708
For this project, you'll work in pairs.
Find someone you can work well with.

78
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,708
Uh-oh... Crap! We have to work in pairs?

79
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,833
There's no one here I can team up with!

80
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,458
Alright, start forming your pairs now.

81
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,583
Okay!

82
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,042
Shino-san, please be my partner.

83
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:27,333
- What should I do...?
- Of course. Let's do our best.

84
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:32,750
Oh, no...

85
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,250
Just as I thought...

86
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,083
Looks like the only ones left are...

87
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:48,167
the perfect pair of leftovers.

88
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:55,583
And that hat...

89
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,000
is so lame.

90
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,458
Sorry.

91
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,625
Who are you?

92
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,625
You don't remember me?

93
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,417
I'm Enaga Ayumu. It's
nice to work with you.

94
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,625
Sumiura Chiaki.

95
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,208
Huh?! How do you know my name?

96
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:20,125
We've been in the same class for a year...

97
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,250
Right, that's true...

98
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:28,208
No way. I have no idea who this guy is.

99
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:32,250
And why do I have to be paired up
with someone so tacky?

100
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,542
I have no choice...

101
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,167
I'll just have to ignore
him and do it all myself.

102
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,375
Anyway, let me see your past work first.

103
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,375
I need to get a feel for your style.

104
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,625
Mm-hmm.

105
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,375
Here.

106
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:51,792
Okay.

107
00:08:55,375 --> 00:09:00,625
The fabric on this cover is simple,
but it has an amazing texture.

108
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,708
Let me see yours too, Sumiura-kun.

109
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,417
Hm? Oh.

110
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,458
Wow, this is amazing.

111
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,667
So you're into the punk style, Sumiura-kun.

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,125
I guess so.

113
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,833
Enaga, this is...

114
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,292
Huh...?

115
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:37,458
What is this, horror movie chic?

116
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,583
Wait a second.

117
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,208
Why are there bloodstains everywhere?!

118
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:47,708
I'm really clumsy, so I get hurt a lot.

119
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,260
Hey... can we get started
on the assignment?

120
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,917
You want to be a designer
when you're this clumsy?

121
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:59,417
Then why do you want
to be a designer, Sumiura?

122
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,167
Answering my question with a question...

123
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:14,250
There's someone I want
to see wear my designs.

124
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,667
That's a good reason.

125
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:23,333
I don't need your opinion.

126
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,250
What about you?

127
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,000
Clothes...

128
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,500
They can be a source of support for people.

129
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,750
For their dreams, for
who they want to become...

130
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,250
I hope the clothes I make...

131
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:44,292
can become a source of
courage for someone, just like that.

132
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,417
Clothes that give you courage...

133
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,250
That's a unique way of putting it.

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,708
But I think I get it.

135
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,625
That's a pretty good way of thinking.

136
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:03,083
Didn't you just say you
didn't need an opinion?

137
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,917
It's okay when I'm the one saying it.

138
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,542
Hmph.

139
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,833
The feeling of getting closer to
your ideal self through clothes...

140
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,958
Yeah. For someone who's timid,

141
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:22,000
changing their appearance is
the first step toward that ideal.

142
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,667
Your name's Enaga, right?

143
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,375
So this guy's just clumsy.
His taste isn't half-bad...

144
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,500
Ah!

145
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:38,292
Hey!

146
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:39,458
Jeez.

147
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,625
A sketchbook is a designer's lifeblood!

148
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,333
You're hopeless...

149
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,250
Sumiura-kun, you're actually a nice person.

150
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,500
Even your bandages have a punk style.

151
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,250
Is this really the time for that?

152
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,500
What have you been
doing for the past year?!

153
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,333
Um... I've been trying my best.

154
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,125
It's over...

155
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,667
My big design competition...

156
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,750
My dream is dead.

157
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,667
I'm home.

158
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,708
AE.

159
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,083
My dream...

160
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,500
is to have AE wear my designs

161
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,333
and to shine on the runway.

162
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,500
Back in high school,

163
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:12,917
I had absolutely no interest
in clothes or models.

164
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,708
Until the moment I saw AE...

165
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:21,542
It was a shock... like I
was rooted to the spot.

166
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:32,625
I impulsively got my lip pierced that day.

167
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,292
I ran around to unfamiliar shops,
looking for clothes in a similar style.

168
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,292
I bought every magazine
with AE on the cover.

169
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:54,292
After high school, I started
working at a boutique.

170
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,351
Sometimes I'd see AE
wearing clothes from our shop.

171
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,655
(AE Pioneers a New World of Punk) I thought
it was enough to support him from afar.

172
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,000
But the more I thought about it...

173
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,667
I realized my designs
could make AE shine even brighter.

174
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:09,792
I started getting greedy.

175
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:14,917
And that's why I've been in
fashion night school for two years.

176
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,208
So now...

177
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,375
It's the super-popular model, AE.

178
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,208
Could "the" AE really model
this for me on the runway?

179
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:28,167
I thought my dream was about
to come true ahead of schedule...

180
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:29,708
I'm Enaga Ayumu.

181
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm really clumsy, so I get hurt a lot.

182
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,338
Why did it have to be a
two-person competition?

183
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,059
Aren't designers supposed
to stand on their own?

184
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,708
I want to do this by myself.

185
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,833
This is no time to mope.

186
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,000
Because I've got...
someone I'm rooting for!

187
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,542
AE posted a new story.

188
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,542
Where could this be?~

189
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:12,458
Huh?!

190
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,458
This is...

191
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:23,875
This place...

192
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,958
It has to be.

193
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,208
I rushed over here on impulse,

194
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:34,708
but I've never been to a
place like a club before!

195
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,375
Hey, the night's still young.

196
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:41,958
We can keep drinking, right?

197
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,958
Let's get going!

198
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,750
This is insane.

199
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,167
Let's hit the next spot.

200
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,000
Cheers!

201
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,333
Great work, everyone...

202
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,250
Excuse me...

203
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,292
This place is wild.

204
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,458
Hey! You!

205
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,958
What can I get you to drink?

206
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,750
A drink?

207
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,000
Ready to order?

208
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,792
The only thing I know is a cassis orange...

209
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,250
But that's so basic, right?

210
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,615
Then... a gin and... ton... ic.

211
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,292
It's a gin and tonic.

212
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,125
Whoa! That's strong.

213
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,750
What do I do...

214
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:32,083
Forget finding AE, I'm so
nervous I'm going to puke.

215
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,542
Whoa, bro, your outfit is sick!

216
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:36,375
Huh? What?

217
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,583
Come hang with us~

218
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,125
Wanna get high?

219
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,500
No, thank you...

220
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,500
I've got some really good stuff...

221
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,042
S-So scary...

222
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,125
Sorry! Kept you waiting.

223
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,458
What, did you bring a friend?

224
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:34,083
So, leave him alone.

225
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,708
- Alright, alright.
- We're outta here.

226
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,042
Hey, you okay?

227
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,458
Oh... My idol is right in front of me!

228
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,333
Is this a hallucination!?

229
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,583
Whoa!

230
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:16,708
Drink some water.

231
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,042
I'm sorry...

232
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,833
You saved me, and now
you're taking care of me...

233
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:26,833
It's fine. I needed some air anyway.

234
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,292
Is this a dream?

235
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:40,333
My idol... My idol in the flesh...

236
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,208
Breathing right in front of me...

237
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:45,133
And he's smoking...

238
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,500
And he's so handsome!

239
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,458
Um... You're the model, AE, right?

240
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,042
Are you a fan of mine?

241
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:09,958
N-Not just a fan.
I mean... I'm your follower.

242
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,792
Which one do you want?

243
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:13,000
Keep your voice down.

244
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,875
Ah...

245
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:20,333
Having a cute kid like you as a fan...

246
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,000
makes me happy.

247
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,167
This fan service is on another level!

248
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,167
Oh no...

249
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,542
I feel like I'm about
to burst into tears...

250
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,667
You okay?

251
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,250
Drink more water.

252
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,000
Please don't...

253
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,000
You're so handsome, it's killing me...

254
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,833
Please keep breathing...

255
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:49,417
You've been way too cute this whole time.

256
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,309
You're completely different
from what I imagined.

257
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,208
How interesting.

258
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,500
Completely different?

259
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,375
By the way, what's your name?

260
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,625
Huh...

261
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,458
Chiaki.

262
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,000
Mm.

263
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:12,958
Chiaki... You don't party much, do you?

264
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:17,875
Dressed like that, but you're
actually super innocent?

265
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,083
Y-Yes.

266
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,042
I... I just like fashion.

267
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,208
I see.

268
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,000
Interested in trying something?

269
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,667
The nightlife.

270
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,167
Huh?

271
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,875
You've never smoked, have you?

272
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,208
Relax.

273
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:59,083
Put the cigarette between your lips.

274
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,833
Yeah... slowly.

275
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:08,458
Good.

276
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:13,590
Just like that. Don't exhale yet...

277
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,708
Okay, now let it out.

278
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,833
Then, breathe in the
night air through your nose.

279
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,250
See?

280
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,615
You've never smelled a night
like this before, have you?

281
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,583
Feeling dizzy?

282
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,875
Y-Yes.

283
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:12,750
You're a bad boy now, Chiaki.

284
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,833
I'm not dizzy because
it's my first time smoking...

285
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:33,167
I'm being intoxicated by him.

286
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:38,250
Message me when you get back.

287
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:46,417
I'll teach you
how to enjoy the nightlife.

288
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,583
The next day.

289
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:37,292
The DM I worked up the courage to send...

290
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:40,812
(Thanks for the message. I'll be in touch.)
He actually replied.

291
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,625
In my mouth...

292
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,667
the taste of his
cigarette still lingers...

293
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,476
(Next Episode)
I want to see AE again.

294
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,708
I want him to leave me in pieces.

295
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,233
I'll teach you about the nightlife.

296
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,833
I've always felt that the night
is a time for people to connect.

297
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,601
Let's design clothes that give people
the courage to connect with others.

298
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,875
This feels like a date, doesn't it?

299
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,125
No pictures yet.
