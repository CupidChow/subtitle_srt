1
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,000
He's welcoming you.

2
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,500
Classic Chinese hospitality.

3
00:00:58,583 --> 00:00:59,833
Is this gold?

4
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,250
Of course.

5
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,958
This temple was originally built during
the Yongjia era of the Western Jin dynasty

6
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,875
and later renovated during the Tang,
Liao, and Jin dynasties.

7
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,291
I like it.

8
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,500
This is for you.

9
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,666
Only one?

10
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,333
All of them, of course.

11
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,041
Fools.

12
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,125
Go!

13
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,375
Filthy beggars.

14
00:01:59,041 --> 00:01:59,958
Back to the palace!

15
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,041
I had convinced the consuls
of Britain, America,

16
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,916
Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan,
and Austria-Hungary

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,875
to cease further involvement
in the Boxer Rebellion.

18
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,916
Empress Dowager, rest assured.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,208
Very well.

20
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,500
The rebels of the Revive China Society,
Sun Yat-sen and Zheng Shiliang,

21
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,750
having failed in the Guangzhou affair
are now hiding in America,

22
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,375
assembling firearms
for a larger rebellion.

23
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,333
Internal stability must come
before dealing with external threats.

24
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,291
I believe we must take
the initiative and capture

25
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,208
both Sun Yat-sen and Zheng Shiliang.

26
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,750
I have one person in mind for the job,

27
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,541
Fei Yanggu,
the Captain of the Imperial Guards.

28
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,041
He is well-versed
in both literature and combat.

29
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,125
He has a dignified bearing
and immaculate appearance.

30
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,208
He's a master at throwing daggers
and fluent in English.

31
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,708
He's waiting outside.

32
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,541
- Summon him.
- Summon him!

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,583
Your humble servant, Fei Yanggu,
bows before Your Majesty.

34
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,125
Travel to America

35
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,000
and bring back those traitors.

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,708
Eliminate those pests

37
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,250
and you will help ensure

38
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,500
the lasting prosperity of the Great Qing.

39
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,291
Yes, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,958
CHINATOWN FIGHTS AGAINST
THE ANTI-CHINESE EXCLUSION BILL

41
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,041
What is a genius?

42
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,500
A natural talent.

43
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,708
By five, I had mastered music,
chess, calligraphy, and painting,

44
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,916
read all the classics, and could easily
recite Tang and Song poetry.

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,083
At seven, I studied medicine,
the family trade.

46
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,625
By nine, I treated patients.

47
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,541
People called me a prodigy.

48
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,375
At 11, Lord Yung Wing sent me to America
as one of the first Chinese students

49
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,750
to help revive China
because of my remarkable talents.

50
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,208
So, Mr. Prodigy…

51
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,125
Genius.

52
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,291
Mr. Genius.

53
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,166
How exactly did my father die?

54
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,125
I have to think about it.

55
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,250
- The pills!
- The pills？

56
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,416
The victim died from heavy drinking

57
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,541
combined with a large dose
of chloral hydrate,

58
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,958
which caused respiratory failure.

59
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,333
Who's responsible for his meal?

60
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,875
- He is.
- He is.

61
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,166
He's the murderer.

62
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,500
Isn't that a bit hasty？

63
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,083
<i>What a luxury room.</i>

64
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,458
<i>There's an ice box.</i>

65
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:04,041
<i>You knew the victim's habits,</i>
<i>so you laced the ice with chloral hydrate.</i>

66
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,083
<i>Whiskey on rock,</i>

67
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,125
<i>a nail in the coffin.</i>

68
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,125
There's still some melted ice water.

69
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,458
Let's test it.

70
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,541
Tie him up!

71
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,708
Money!

72
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,375
Easy-peasy.

73
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,500
It's me.

74
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,125
What are you babbling about,
you banana man?

75
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,041
I am Sherlock Holmes.

76
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,166
You?

77
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,750
Last name, Qin. Given name, Fu.
Courtesy name, Olmes.

78
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:26,791
Fu-Olmes sounds like Holmes.

79
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,125
- I thought it would be a white man.
- I am. Can't you tell?

80
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,041
Is he?

81
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,875
Whatever. Take his words then.

82
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,458
Mr. Detective, this way, please. Come on!

83
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,125
- So this is San Francisco!
- Yes.

84
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,083
What's the case?

85
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,375
"Jack the Ripper"?

86
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,291
Wasn't he in England?
How did he end up in America?

87
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:50,750
Shut up.

88
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,041
Shut up.

89
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,583
- Run!
- Who is Bai?

90
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,541
Run!

91
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,750
Run!

92
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,916
- Big commotion in San Francisco, isn't it?
- Haven't you read the papers lately?

93
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,125
- It's shocking news in America.
- I just got here.

94
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,500
Jack the Ripper vanished over
a decade ago! Since when is he Chinese?

95
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,416
Three days ago, two Chinese people
wandering behind the theater

96
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,416
<i>found two bodies.</i>

97
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,041
A white girl named Alice and an old
Native American man called Six-Hands.

98
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,958
The woman was cut open.
Her organs were removed.

99
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,958
The old man's throat was slit,
blood sprayed across the ground.

100
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,000
The next morning,
the <i>San Francisco Times </i>received a letter.

101
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,250
<i>It was from Jack the Ripper.</i>

102
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,166
<i>There's only one line.</i>

103
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,916
<i>"Very delicious…</i>

104
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,875
Are you ready, girls?"

105
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,458
"Very delicious"? What does that mean?

106
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:37,375
The worst part is,
Alice's father's a Republican senator.

107
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,125
- Grant.
- He's running for mayor.

108
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,875
The white community won't let this slide.

109
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,875
And Six-Hands is
the chief of the Navajo tribe.

110
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,416
The Natives will not let this go either.

111
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,875
It's getting more chaotic
out there lately.

112
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,208
Our people dare not leave Chinatown.

113
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,083
Even Chinatown might soon be in danger.

114
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,291
What should we do?

115
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,833
Who exactly is this Jack the Ripper?

116
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,708
Hip Sing Tong. Ring a bell?

117
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,750
Who does not know
the biggest Chinese gang in America?

118
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,583
Jack… Bai…

119
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,375
Are you saying it's Bai Xuanling,
the boss of HST?

120
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,041
It's his son, Bai Zhenbang.

121
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,000
How sick are gangsters nowadays?

122
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,125
As if gambling, drugs, pimping,
looting, and kidnapping weren't enough.

123
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,375
Are they into cannibalism now?

124
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,875
So embarrassing.

125
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,625
All right, enough about them.

126
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,625
- Let's talk about our case.
- We just did.

127
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,708
Did what?

128
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,458
We've told you everything.

129
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,000
Our boss will tell you the rest.

130
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,750
Father!

131
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,458
Father!

132
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,833
Father!

133
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,666
Father.

134
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,958
- Why did you burn him?
- He was starting to stink.

135
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,166
No, I don't believe Father is dead.

136
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,208
He's gone.

137
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,291
And…

138
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,333
stinks too.

139
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,291
I will avenge him!

140
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,458
Ghost.

141
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,291
Go ask Pearl. Go on.

142
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,875
Pearl,

143
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,375
who killed Father?

144
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,250
Go where the Easterners gather.

145
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,500
The first person you bumped into

146
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,291
will answer you.

147
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,750
Use the gift granted

148
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:36,666
by the Kachina

149
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:43,166
to find the justice you seek.

150
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:12,625
HIP SING TONG

151
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,250
Here in America,
Buddha, General Guan, and Jesus all work.

152
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,708
You…

153
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,000
must be Detective Fu, right?

154
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,833
Such a majestic young hero.

155
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,875
I am Bai Xuanling. You can call me Louis.

156
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,708
Master Bai,

157
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,416
nice to finally meet you.

158
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,916
I've heard so much about you.

159
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Coming to America alone, empty-handed,

160
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,833
building an empire in 40 years,

161
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,208
helping all Chinese in America
through Hip Sing Tong.

162
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,500
You're truly our hero.

163
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,083
Every Chinese knows your name.

164
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,583
Brother, you're too kind.

165
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,416
You don't mind if
I call you "Brother," right?

166
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,583
Big Brother.

167
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,833
What you said wasn't entirely accurate.

168
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,208
I didn't come alone.

169
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,666
In the third year of Xianfeng, 1854,

170
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,000
I set off
with seven fellow villagers from Siyi.

171
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,291
We traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong,

172
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,166
then went on a ferry ride for three months

173
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,833
before we reached San Francisco,
the Gold Mountain.

174
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,708
Two of us died of illness on the way.

175
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:15,208
This is a photo taken
by a British journalist back then.

176
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,666
- Which one is you?
- I'm not in this picture.

177
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,666
I hung up these photos
as a constant reminder to myself.

178
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,875
So I'll never forget where I came from.

179
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,833
Later, I opened a restaurant,

180
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,125
then a laundry,

181
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,375
a pawnshop, and finally, a factory.

182
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,875
I kept going against all odds.

183
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,750
Even against the Americans, Italians,

184
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,291
and Irish.

185
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,416
I made it to where I am today.

186
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,333
Out of seven, I was the survivor.

187
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:42,583
My success was built on two things.

188
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,583
Versatility and righteousness.

189
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,833
<i>Amitabha</i>

190
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,833
and hallelujah.

191
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,541
I've learned a lot from your words.

192
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,041
If you don't mind,
please take me as your disciple.

193
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,583
From just a brother to a disciple?

194
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,500
You're being too much.

195
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,958
Not at all.

196
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,291
Once a teacher, always a father.

197
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,958
From now on, you're my godfather.

198
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,250
Godfather.

199
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,291
Hey! You!

200
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,500
All right!

201
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,208
Fine, godson.

202
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,250
I accept you.

203
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,958
Shall we talk about your godbrother then?

204
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,708
So,

205
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,750
why do they think
my brother is the killer?

206
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:24,416
Three nights ago, on August 10th,
at the Chinese Grand Theater,

207
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,416
it was Ching Ling Foo's premiere
in San Francisco.

208
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,625
<i>Soon after the show began,</i>

209
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,583
<i>Zhenbang suddenly rose to leave.</i>

210
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,166
Hey, Zhenbang. You're leaving?

211
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,750
What's so great about those tricks?

212
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,083
That's amazing.

213
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,500
Bravo!

214
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,583
<i>Alice and Six-Hands were killed that night</i>

215
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,875
<i>in the alley behind the theater.</i>

216
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,875
<i>Someone called the police,</i>

217
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,875
<i>claiming that they saw</i>
<i>Zhenbang there at that time.</i>

218
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,125
<i>Where was he going?</i>

219
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,625
<i>After leaving the theater,</i>
<i>where did he go?</i>

220
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,541
<i>No one knows.</i>

221
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,375
<i>Until the morning of the 11th,</i>

222
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,333
<i>when the police arrested him at the port.</i>

223
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,541
<i>After Zhenbang was taken to the station,</i>

224
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,166
<i>he didn't say a word.</i>

225
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,208
He has a record of harassment?

226
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,125
Alice's family servant reported
the harassment.

227
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,875
That's slander!

228
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,250
Grant even came
to confront the master about it.

229
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,500
Shameless!

230
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,791
And he studied anatomy?

231
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,625
It's just a hobby!

232
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,250
It's just a coincidence.

233
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,916
Godfather, I may be a detective,

234
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,291
but I'm still green.

235
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,541
I'm far from qualified to solve this case.

236
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,958
Perhaps you should find someone else,

237
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,708
lest it delay the investigation.

238
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,916
Detective Fu, you solved
countless crimes in England.

239
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,416
How could you be "green"?

240
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:56,166
I'm working on bailing Zhenbang out
so he can meet you in person.

241
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,958
His life is in your hands now.

242
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,041
Zhenbang

243
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,958
is my only son.

244
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,458
Godfather,

245
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,666
to tell you the truth,

246
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,708
I'm actually here on a secret mission.

247
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,916
Fei Yanggu, an imperial official

248
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,208
from the Qing, will arrive
at the dock this afternoon.

249
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,791
He's been ordered
to capture some dangerous fugitives.

250
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,583
It's the order from the Empress Dowager.

251
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,666
Grant, the Republican senator,
has formally proposed a bill,

252
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,083
citing his daughter's tragic death,

253
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,791
to ban all Chinatowns in California.

254
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,250
In four days, I'll represent
the Chinese Chamber of Commerce

255
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,041
in a debate at the Council Hall.

256
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,666
If this bill passes in San Francisco,

257
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,125
they'll immediately propose it
to the federal government.

258
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,500
Then, Chinese people all across America
will have no place to call home.

259
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:45,041
So, this case concerns
not only the fate of the Bai family,

260
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,708
but also all Chinese in America.

261
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,750
Master…

262
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,458
Lao Si, ask Mr. Weyman
to come to the silk factory.

263
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,041
Take good care of Detective Fu.

264
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,875
Let him rest in the third-floor guest room

265
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:00,916
and keep an eye on him.

266
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:13,458
Sir, do we need to keep
such a low profile for this mission?

267
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,958
Mission confidential.

268
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,541
Be cautious. Strike and go.

269
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,166
What are they talking about?

270
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,041
They're welcoming us to America.

271
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,208
Don't send me back!

272
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,375
What are you doing?

273
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,458
Protecting our Master.

274
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,083
Firearms are powerful.
Do not act recklessly.

275
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,416
What does that mean?

276
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,958
- Wai Pen?
- What's Wai Pen?

277
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,666
Wai Pen? I think it means foreigners.

278
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,416
I am Fei Yanggu,
of the Yellow Banner under the Great Qing.

279
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,875
- He's telling us to kneel?
- Insolent!

280
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,958
I, Fei Yanggu,
only kneel before the Emperor

281
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,625
and the Empress Dowager.

282
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,875
Who do you think you are?

283
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,916
<i>The first person you bumped into</i>

284
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,583
will answer you.

285
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,333
This way.

286
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:54,833
Trots.

287
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,041
Where's the bathroom?

288
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:58,916
Over there.

289
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,750
Jack the Ripper, Hip Sing Tong…

290
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,375
Are you kidding me?

291
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,083
I have a better chance
of fooling that imperial official.

292
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,750
What? Why build the toilet so high up?

293
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,083
Detective Fu,

294
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:21,291
is everything going smoothly?

295
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:25,416
Detective Fu…

296
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:27,708
Detective Fu…

297
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,125
You…

298
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,750
Just a weird habit.

299
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,333
I can't go unless I'm undressed.

300
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:38,833
Understood.

301
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,416
You…

302
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:47,416
Also a weird habit.

303
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,750
Foul smell makes me dizzy.

304
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,083
I see.

305
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,000
Help!

306
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,750
He's trying to escape!

307
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,250
Please don't, sir.

308
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,333
Really, sir. Let me go.

309
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:15,958
Sir!

310
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,458
Please. Stop it.

311
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,416
Sir. Please, sir.

312
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,541
You bumped into me.

313
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,500
Chinese? You're Chinese?

314
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:00,291
- Go.
- Where?

315
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,666
- Take me to the killer.
- What killer?

316
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,208
- The one that killed Father.
- Whose father?

317
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,166
- Pearl said you would…
- Who the hell is Pearl?

318
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,458
The Kachina will protect us.

319
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,416
- Enough with the crazy talk.
- Where are you going?

320
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,208
- To get dressed.
- Take me with you!

321
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,500
Stop it. People look down on that!

322
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:21,291
Stop them, then we'll go for the killer.

323
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,791
Eyes of the Hawk!

324
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,375
Ears of the Wolf!

325
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,625
Speed of the Puma.

326
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,750
Useless.

327
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:55,541
Hey.

328
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:58,083
Sir.

329
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,791
- Go.
- By myself, please.

330
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:43,833
Strength of the Bear!

331
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,250
Impressive.

332
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,958
- What are you doing?
- Right.

333
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:20,583
- The killer is here?
- How did you find me?

334
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,125
I'm the hunter and you're the prey.

335
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,041
Put this on.

336
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,375
Together, let's thank Mr. Weyman.

337
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,875
- Congratulations.
- Louis.

338
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,625
I know you took them in out of kindness,

339
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:37,375
but you can only protect them
for a while, not forever.

340
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,916
I'll do it as long as I can.

341
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,708
Do you need me to help accommodate them?

342
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:45,000
No need to bother you with these.

343
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,375
Hold off work here before the hearing.

344
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:52,333
Can't give them any ammunition.

345
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,500
Understood.

346
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:57,041
- Take this.
- That was sudden.

347
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,500
Zhenbang's bail money is way too high.

348
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,375
This piece of land is
my most valuable asset.

349
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,125
Keep it as a mortgage.

350
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,875
Again, I'm counting on you
to help my family through this.

351
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,583
I told you. I can lend you the money.

352
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:09,541
No.

353
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:12,291
I've owed you so much all these years.

354
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,000
My people have owed you too much.

355
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,166
All right then.

356
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,291
I'll keep this just for now.

357
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,583
I'll arrange Zhenbang's bail shortly.

358
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:24,250
Right now, our priority is
to clear Zhenbang's name

359
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:25,833
and find the real killer.

360
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,291
Thank you.

361
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,666
So, this is America.
Not as fancy as I thought.

362
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,708
Sir, watch out.

363
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:02,041
Sir, where's the pick-up guy?

364
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,250
He should be here.

365
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,833
It's a young Chinese man called Qin Fu.

366
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:09,791
- Qin Fu.
- Qin Fu.

367
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:12,333
Remember, in the West,
the given name comes first

368
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,000
then the family name.

369
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,083
So, we should call him Fu Qin.

370
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,250
- Fu Qin.
- Fu Qin.

371
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,125
- Who's Fu Qin?
- Fu Qin.

372
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:20,666
- Fu Qin.
- Fu Qin.

373
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,833
- Who's Fu Qin?
- Fu Qin.

374
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,166
Fu Qin.

375
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,333
Are you looking for…

376
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:27,333
Fu Qin?

377
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:29,166
I am Fu Jin, yes.

378
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,166
And you are…

379
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:31,791
My name is Fei.

380
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,625
- Mr. Fei.
- Address him as Master.

381
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,375
Master Fei.

382
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,833
What are you waiting for?

383
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,250
Help the master with his luggage.

384
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,833
- Let me.
- I'll take this.

385
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,541
Find us the best inn in town,

386
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,458
then a nice meal.

387
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,666
The food on the ship was terrible.

388
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:56,958
No worries.

389
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:57,916
All set.

390
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,541
Chinese help Chinese.

391
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:00,875
Exactly.

392
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:02,458
No scamming your own kind. Let's go.

393
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:03,750
One moment, sir.

394
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,291
I'll go bring the ride around.

395
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,250
Hold on.

396
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:08,875
What ride?

397
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:10,500
Our master's not used
to those newfangled cars.

398
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,791
I'm driving a carriage.

399
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:14,416
One moment, sir.

400
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,583
- Don't wander around.
- Wait here.

401
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,083
"Fu Jin" will be right back
to pick you up.

402
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:29,958
Sir.

403
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,166
Have we

404
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,625
been scammed?

405
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,208
Why aren't you eating?

406
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,791
I miss my father.

407
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,458
Your name is Gui?

408
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:44,500
Gui as in Ghost.

409
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,375
All right, Gui.
So Six-Hands, the victim, was your father?

410
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:49,708
But how could an old Native man
father a Shanxi son?

411
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:50,833
I'm from Hebei.

412
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,166
No matter where you're from,
let me say this again.

413
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,916
I'm really not a detective.
I can't help you find the killer.

414
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,458
- But Pearl said…
- Pearl or pig,

415
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:58,541
no still means no.

416
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:00,875
Does she know me better
than I know myself?

417
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,875
Whatever, I'm sticking with you.

418
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:03,833
What's your problem?

419
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,416
Wherever you go, I'll go.

420
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm going to the bathroom. Want to join?

421
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,583
If you can find me again,

422
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:27,125
I'll follow your command.

423
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,541
Sir, should we keep waiting?

424
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,208
Maybe a little longer.

425
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,541
Go back. Leave.

426
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:44,166
Indeed, this barbaric land
is full of tricks.

427
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,208
We must keep our eyes open
and never be fooled again.

428
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,125
- Come on, quick.
- Spread out and search.

429
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,208
Hurry.

430
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,750
He's not getting away.

431
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:22,791
Find him!

432
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,375
You're awake.

433
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,625
Who the hell are you?

434
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:43,875
I'm Ghost.

435
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,875
- We're here.
- Where?

436
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,583
- Home.
- Home?

437
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:49,291
This is him.

438
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,958
Stare at my sister again
and I'll drink from your skull.

439
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,500
Tell him.

440
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,458
What did he say?

441
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,875
He said if you find the killer,

442
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,000
his sister will marry you.

443
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,500
And you'll drink the wine
of matrimony tonight.

444
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,208
Do your people do that too?

445
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,375
What did he say?

446
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,333
Don't you want to avenge Father?

447
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,833
All you know is revenge.
Look at that stupid face of his.

448
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:32,416
Pearl must have made a mistake.

449
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,375
What is he saying?

450
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:36,166
If his sister isn't enough,
you can have that piece of land too.

451
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,500
- Deal!
- He's fine with it.

452
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:45,250
When I was five,

453
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,875
I watched my parents die in front of me.

454
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,500
<i>Magpies cheer</i>

455
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,500
<i>New Year's near</i>

456
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:02,000
<i>Father's off to earn</i>

457
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,375
<i>We hear</i>

458
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,416
<i>Father found me,</i>

459
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:26,750
<i>raised me,</i>

460
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,208
<i>and taught me everything.</i>

461
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,625
<i>He gave me a second life.</i>

462
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,916
<i>Magpies cheer</i>

463
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
<i>New Year's near</i>

464
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,916
<i>Father's off to earn</i>

465
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,250
<i>We hear</i>

466
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:45,375
<i>Gain he will, silver and gold</i>

467
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:48,000
<i>Silver and gold</i>

468
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:53,791
<i>To buy the land and build a home</i>

469
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,583
So, you must help me find the killer.

470
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:09,791
With you as my partner,
I'm very confident.

471
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,208
If you try to escape again,

472
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,416
I'll castrate you.

473
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,166
It hurts my feelings that you'd say that.

474
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:15,666
In fact,

475
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,083
they've already found the killer.

476
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,541
Godfather.

477
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,708
I'm back.

478
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:25,916
Fu, my boy!

479
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,291
I thought you ran away.

480
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,250
Godfather, how could I?

481
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,208
Exactly. How could you?

482
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:33,833
I actually left to recruit him.

483
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,375
Six-Hands' son, Gui.

484
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,041
We'll solve the case together.

485
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,041
It's Ghost.

486
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,666
Gui.

487
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,041
Fu and Gui.
A perfect match made in heaven.

488
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:43,708
Come here.

489
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:46,250
Last night, three men wandered around
looking for "Fu Qin."

490
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:49,208
And this morning, they came to my door.

491
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:51,541
This is Fei Yanggu. Master Fei.

492
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,958
Master Fei. Nice finally meeting you.

493
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:57,708
I was tied up yesterday
and couldn't pick you up.

494
00:37:58,416 --> 00:37:59,291
Never mind.

495
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,375
As soon as I arrived, I got scammed.

496
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,791
We had to sleep on the street.

497
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:06,875
I heard that Hip Sing Tong is
the largest Chinese society in the city,

498
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,583
so I came to pay my respects
to Master Bai.

499
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:11,208
Master Fei, you're too kind.

500
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,416
You mentioned you're here
to arrest some rebels.

501
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,541
Who are they exactly?

502
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,916
Sir, the young master is back.

503
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,416
As long as you are safe.

504
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,291
Come, let me introduce you.

505
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,625
I hired these two detectives for you.

506
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,583
Mr. Fu and Mr. Gui.

507
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:36,500
This is Master Fei Yanggu,
who just arrived in America.

508
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,875
This is my son, Bai Zhenbang.

509
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,541
And this is…

510
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,916
We studied together in England.

511
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,666
Zheng Shiliang.

512
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,208
Master Bai,

513
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:53,416
you just asked me

514
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,083
who I came here to arrest.

515
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,916
This must be destiny.

516
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:00,916
Arrest him!

517
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:07,916
Stop!

518
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,041
Be civilized.

519
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,875
Master Bai,

520
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:22,250
this man, Zheng Shiliang, is a fugitive
wanted by the Empress Dowager herself.

521
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:26,125
Your Empress is back in the Qing.

522
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,875
This is America.

523
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,708
I'm taking this man with me,

524
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:31,583
no matter what.

525
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:32,916
Master Fei,

526
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:36,208
at this moment, both of them

527
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,916
are guests of the Hip Sing Tong.

528
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,333
As long as I'm here,

529
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:41,041
your safety is guaranteed.

530
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,458
Once you leave this room,

531
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:45,333
whatever you do is none of my business.

532
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,000
But here and now,

533
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:50,083
no one is taking him away.

534
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:59,125
Master Bai made his point.

535
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:01,541
Zheng Shiliang,

536
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:02,916
count your blessings.

537
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,541
You won't be this lucky forever.

538
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:06,500
Sheathe your swords.

539
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:16,750
What a day!

540
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:19,250
Wen, Wu, serve Master Fei some more.

541
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,000
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be necessary.

542
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,541
We're leaving.

543
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:34,958
Fu, Gui.

544
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,125
Tell them exactly what you did
on the night of the 10th?

545
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,375
You boys have a good talk.
I'll be right back.

546
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,000
Hey.

547
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:20,125
Where did you go
after leaving the theater that night?

548
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,250
How can we help you if you don't tell us?

549
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:26,000
Say something.

550
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:27,583
Tell us.

551
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,875
Please.

552
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:31,208
Why don't you tell us?

553
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:34,000
What are you doing? Didn't we agree to
only take action when it's necessary?

554
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:36,166
What more is there to say?
He doesn't even dare to say where he went.

555
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,833
- He must be the killer.
- Be patient. Give him more time.

556
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:40,958
No. I'll avenge Father right now.

557
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,708
What's the motive?
Why would he kill your father?

558
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:44,541
Don't you want to know?
Was he into money or Native men?

559
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,166
Come on, speak up, man.

560
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,666
Young Master, tell them.

561
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,291
Young Master, tell them!

562
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,041
- Please.
- Tell us.

563
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:58,041
- Are you going to talk or not?
- Tell them.

564
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,166
- Tell me.
- Tell them!

565
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,833
- Speak up.
- Will you talk or not?

566
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,333
All right!

567
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:05,833
Shiliang.

568
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,916
Nothing is more important
than clearing your name right now.

569
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,166
Shiliang, don't.

570
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,041
Zhenbang, I have to say it.
It's killing me inside.

571
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,750
- Shiliang.
- Zhenbang.

572
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:18,708
You two!

573
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:22,541
Did you go on a date?

574
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:24,416
Guns.

575
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,708
Marston said you two stole his guns.

576
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,000
That's right.

577
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,291
On the night of the 10th,

578
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,500
Zhenbang and I, we…

579
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,208
went to steal guns from the Irish.

580
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,291
You got something else to do?

581
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:01,750
No.

582
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:02,875
<i>This is Zheng Shiliang.</i>

583
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:05,083
We went to medical school
in England together.

584
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:07,416
He's joined Dr. Sun's
Revive China Society.

585
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,291
Guns can be bought,

586
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:10,750
why steal them?

587
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,875
The revolution is imminent.

588
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,416
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

589
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,166
They stole from us all the time anyway.

590
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,666
The Irish gathered these weapons
for their next raid on Chinatown.

591
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,875
So you had no time to kill Father.

592
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:23,291
Of course not.

593
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,083
My people can vouch for him.

594
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,583
No wonder you kept silent
at the police station.

595
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,250
Turns out you were stealing guns.

596
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:34,083
I knew my brother was innocent.

597
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:36,208
Godfather, we did good, didn't we?

598
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,583
Gui, put your knife away.

599
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,666
Then why were you at the port so early?
You weren't trying to escape.

600
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,000
He was simply scared
after stealing the guns.

601
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,333
So, he was going to lay low out of town.

602
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:49,833
Right?

603
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,583
Just believing you is not enough.

604
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,208
All Americans need to be persuaded.

605
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:01,791
For now, we need to find the killer first.

606
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:03,958
Yes. Let's go find him.

607
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:06,375
Godfather,

608
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,166
- I have another request.
- Tell me.

609
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,791
I've just acquired land
in Native territory and taken a wife,

610
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,875
but I still don't have
American citizenship.

611
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:14,541
Do you really want to stay for good?

612
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:15,833
I have a property and a family now.

613
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:17,208
All right, I'll help you.

614
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:18,750
Thank you, Godfather.

615
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:22,875
One's a fraud,

616
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:24,333
while the other's a savage.

617
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:27,083
And you ask them to solve the case?

618
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:28,750
At this point,

619
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,458
is there anyone else
who would take on your case?

620
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:34,250
Qin Fu is quite observant
and quick-thinking.

621
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:35,541
He's definitely a man of talent.

622
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:38,333
As for Gui, with his animal instincts,
and skills in combat and tracking,

623
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:39,833
is no average Joe either.

624
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:43,500
The two of them came along
at the right time just to save you.

625
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,708
Right now, both of you are
wanted criminals out there.

626
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:49,875
Stay put.

627
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:52,083
Stay. At least until it's safe.

628
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:56,750
The great Master Bai

629
00:45:58,416 --> 00:45:59,666
can only protect me for a while?

630
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:03,250
If I fail the hearing,
which is in four days,

631
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:06,416
I won't just fail to protect you,
but Hip Sing Tong and Chinatown too.

632
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,000
I fear that all Chinese in America
won't be safe, either.

633
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:10,750
We were never safe here, to begin with.

634
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:14,250
We shouldn't place our hope here.

635
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:16,750
No more talk of revolution!

636
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,416
If it could truly change things,

637
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,333
we wouldn't have to cross the ocean
to make a living in a foreign land.

638
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:26,500
I've fought my whole life to earn respect,

639
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,208
hoping we'd no longer be bullied
by the whites.

640
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,666
That's the Chinatown you've protected
for decades.

641
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:44,125
It's still filled with brothels,
opium dens, and casinos.

642
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:46,958
Have our people led better lives here?

643
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:50,750
If our hope isn't back home or here,

644
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:52,333
then where is it?

645
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:10,791
Gentlemen.

646
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:13,916
Your hope

647
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:16,041
feels too far away for me.

648
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:25,833
My only hope now…

649
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:30,208
is for you to be okay.

650
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,291
Where to?

651
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,958
Yeah, where to?

652
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:01,250
You're asking me?

653
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:13,458
I got it. Follow me.

654
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,208
<i>A doctor of Chinese medicine</i>
<i>does four things.</i>

655
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:18,041
<i>"</i>Wàng<i>," observe the patient.</i>
<i>"</i>Wén<i>," listen to the breathing.</i>

656
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,916
<i>"</i>Wèn,<i>" ask about symptoms.</i>
<i>And "</i>qiè<i>," feel the pulse.</i>

657
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,333
<i>Crime investigation is not that different.</i>
<i>Let's start with…</i>

658
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:23,750
<i>"WÀNG</i>,<i>" OBSERVE</i>

659
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:25,541
What do you have here?

660
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:27,166
Footprints of my father.

661
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,375
How do you know?

662
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:29,750
He doesn't wear shoes.

663
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,125
Judging by the bloodstains,
someone cut your father's throat.

664
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,583
His name is Six-Hands.

665
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:39,375
Once, he chopped off six enemies' hands
and wore them around his neck.

666
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,041
Did your father not carry a knife
at that time?

667
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,541
Someone must've ambushed him from behind.

668
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,000
These footprints…

669
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:49,125
That's strange.

670
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:51,666
Two people died,
yet only my father's blood was found.

671
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:52,916
How do you know?

672
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,750
Can't you smell the difference
between a man's blood and a woman's?

673
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:55,750
Can you?

674
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,250
You don't even have common sense.

675
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,583
So, Alice didn't die here.

676
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,250
There are no women's footprints here.

677
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:03,500
Only a fat man's.

678
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,208
- How fat?
- Thrice your size.

679
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:14,958
Carriage.

680
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:20,083
You don't need to eat shit
to prove that, do you?

681
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,375
City horse.

682
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,333
What's special about the dung
of a city horse?

683
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:25,250
City horses are fed beans. Ours eat grass.

684
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,041
So it wasn't a fat man.

685
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:34,916
Someone left Alice here from a carriage.

686
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:42,583
<i>And your father just happened to pass by.</i>

687
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,791
The killer wasn't alone.

688
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,500
Our land was taken from us.

689
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:54,416
Father would come here at night
to trade furs.

690
00:49:58,416 --> 00:49:59,291
Maybe…

691
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,000
he was finding a mother for you.

692
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,208
"<i>WÉN</i>," LISTEN

693
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,291
What are you doing?

694
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,250
- Guess this country needs an FBI.
- Isn't sniffing part of <i>wén</i>?

695
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:50,500
In Chinese medicine,
it means to listen, not to smell.

696
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:52,041
As in listening to the dead.

697
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:54,000
Examine the body, do an autopsy.

698
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:55,500
You know what autopsy means, right?

699
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,875
How do I explain it to a Native?

700
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,375
Autopsy means…

701
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,833
Fractured joint at the funny bone.

702
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:05,541
Bruise on the tushy bone. Rack scraped.

703
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:07,625
Back of the head cracked. Neck snapped.

704
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:09,166
This is the fatal wound.

705
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,500
Hang on, wait a second.

706
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:14,625
What are "funny bone,"
"tushy," and "rack"?

707
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,333
Is that Native slang?

708
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:18,000
It's authentic Chinese.

709
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:19,208
You mean Hebei dialect.

710
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,250
You banana man.

711
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,333
- How can you do an autopsy?
- Father taught me.

712
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,625
Animals first, then people.

713
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:25,000
Impressive.

714
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:28,333
Multiple external injuries
suggest severe violence before death.

715
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:29,333
She fought back too.

716
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,166
No, she scratched.

717
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:35,333
Why can't I see it?

718
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:37,125
Because it's not visible to human eyes.

719
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:38,916
Only the Hawk's.

720
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:46,041
So the killer must have
scratch marks on him.

721
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,541
Gui, impressive.

722
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:50,833
The stomach is empty.

723
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:54,375
But why would the killer
remove all her intestines?

724
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:57,458
The estimated time of death
is between 6 to 10 p.m. on August 10th,

725
00:51:57,541 --> 00:51:59,250
the same time your father was killed.

726
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:02,875
So the guy killed Alice nearby,
moved her and disemboweled her.

727
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:04,333
What was the purpose?

728
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,958
There have been rumors
that Jack the Ripper was a doctor

729
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,458
because the victims' wounds were
as clean as surgical cuts.

730
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:12,541
This person struck without hesitation.

731
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:14,458
He must be a butcher or hunter,
if not a doctor.

732
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:19,583
Didn't I tell you not to sniff around?

733
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:22,125
Just now, I smelled
a strange scent right here.

734
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:24,416
Look.

735
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,250
Wood shavings.

736
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:30,416
Why are there wood shavings?

737
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:33,416
A stick. She was beaten to death with it.

738
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,458
I see you've got the nose of a pig too.

739
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,625
This isn't an ordinary murder.

740
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:39,000
It's a crime driven by deep hatred.

741
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:40,708
Time to ask the question, "Who?"

742
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:41,958
Whoever knew her the best.

743
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:46,416
"<i>WÈN</i>," ASK

744
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:35,458
Nothing valuable.

745
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:37,416
Since asking fails,
it's time to feel the pulse!

746
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,791
Feel the pulse? How?

747
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:43,416
It's too early for that.
We'll just do it later.

748
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:46,208
Let's go, before Grant comes home.

749
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,291
Once you're in, open the door for me.

750
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:49,750
Didn't we say "feel"?
Since when did it turn into "steal"?

751
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:50,875
Clearly, your Chinese is terrible.

752
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:52,208
It's better than yours, you banana man.

753
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:53,833
You savage. Ever heard of homophones?

754
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:54,791
<i>Qiè </i>can mean both feel and steal.

755
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,583
- So handy.
- Screw you.

756
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:58,500
FEEL

757
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:00,583
STEAL

758
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:09,083
Come on. Get your ass out here
and do it yourself.

759
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,541
Where's Alice's room?

760
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:19,125
How should I know?

761
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:21,208
Use your pig nose to find it.
Wherever it smells nicest.

762
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:25,750
Second floor.

763
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:24,333
What is it about this photo that
makes you so emotional? I don't get it.

764
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,291
- Can I take it?
- No.

765
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:27,666
- Why not?
- Don't even think about it.

766
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,125
- But you said <i>qiè </i>also means steal.
- It doesn't mean you can take things.

767
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:32,000
Let's go.

768
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:43,583
What's wrong?

769
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:46,166
I have something important
to ask Bai Zhenbang.

770
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:48,416
Young Master.

771
00:55:58,541 --> 00:55:59,416
Master.

772
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,833
Young Master left with Mr. Zheng.
No idea where.

773
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,333
San Francisco isn't that big.

774
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:08,708
Just tell the boys
to bring them back safely.

775
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:09,958
Yes, sir.

776
00:56:10,916 --> 00:56:13,291
If anything happens to Zhenbang,
we'll never be able to overturn the case.

777
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:14,333
Is there anything you can do?

778
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:26,083
Damn!

779
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:27,666
Is this real? Do you have psychic powers?

780
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:33,416
Last time, you used bamboo acupuncture
to block pain and boost strength,

781
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,125
and chewed coca leaves
to stimulate your nerves.

782
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:38,000
Chinese medicine can explain all that,
but not this.

783
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:42,666
Come with me.

784
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:49,708
The Chinese Grand Theater?

785
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,458
Is Bai Zhenbang still in the mood
for a magic show?

786
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:54,708
We'll ask around and find out.

787
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:55,875
Ask who?

788
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:57,625
Him.

789
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:15,875
- We're looking for Ching Ling Foo.
- Sorry. Mr. Ching is about to go on stage.

790
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:17,208
He won't be meeting fans.

791
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,541
Do we look like fans?

792
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:23,875
Yes, you do.

793
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:28,208
You can't go in.

794
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:30,791
Sorry, Mr. Ching.

795
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:32,916
I couldn't stop these crazy fans of yours.

796
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,375
I understand.

797
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:37,083
After all, I am the great Ching Ling Foo.

798
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:39,458
Have you heard the song
the Americans made for me?

799
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:42,416
<i>And I will have a Ching Ling Foo</i>

800
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,500
<i>Going…</i>

801
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:46,750
You're a good singer, but please stop.

802
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,916
- Where is he?
- Who?

803
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,000
- There are three cups.
- Have a drink.

804
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:53,666
And three chairs.

805
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,875
Sit and drink then.

806
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:57,458
So, what do you want? An autograph?

807
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:00,333
We are detectives
hired by Master Bai Xuanling.

808
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:06,583
Mr. Bai and Mr. Weyman
are my loyal fans and magic experts.

809
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:09,333
So, where would you like me to sign?

810
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:10,291
Chest?

811
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:11,500
We're here to see Bai Zhenbang.

812
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,291
He's not here.

813
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,333
I can make anyone appear out of thin air,
except Bai Zhenbang.

814
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:18,166
I just heard him. He's here.

815
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:22,416
- No, he's not.
- He's here.

816
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,541
My friend!

817
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,375
You must be delusional.

818
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:35,750
We're often deceived by our own senses.

819
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:40,666
Whatever you think you see or hear…

820
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,791
isn't necessarily real.

821
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:45,250
The same goes for your words.

822
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:46,375
In fact…

823
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:49,125
they're more likely to be fake.

824
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,208
Isn't that right, Mr. Magician?

825
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,500
I'm about to go on stage. Be my guest.

826
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:20,375
Bai Zhenbang, we're not here for you.

827
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,041
We are.

828
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:28,041
Who are you?

829
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,083
Get out of here now!

830
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,291
None of your business!

831
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:38,833
Zheng Shiliang.

832
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,041
No one can protect you today.

833
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:49,375
We'll protect him.

834
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:58,333
Stab yourself.

835
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,166
- Use the sticks and transform.
- I can't.

836
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,458
Why not? Use Strength of the Bear now!

837
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:08,083
I can only use it once every two days.

838
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:12,458
There are four of us

839
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:15,083
and only three of you.

840
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:17,250
Get them.

841
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,541
Even four against three isn't enough?

842
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,875
No.

843
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:53,375
- How about four against one then?
- How about four against one then?

844
01:00:58,083 --> 01:00:59,125
Which one of you

845
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:01,333
wants to die first?

846
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,000
Come out.

847
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,125
Smile, just smile. Wave.

848
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:41,416
Now, get your ass back in there.
What the hell? Shut the door.

849
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:46,166
One.

850
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:48,541
Two.

851
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:51,500
Three!

852
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:54,333
Sir.

853
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:57,375
Go get them!

854
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:59,000
Kill them!

855
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,708
- So, you're a real kung fu master?
- Of course.

856
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:11,333
Can't even win four against two.

857
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:16,541
What about four against one?

858
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:18,291
No.

859
01:02:22,541 --> 01:02:23,958
My leg! My…

860
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,083
My leg…

861
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:29,750
My…

862
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:25,833
Smile. Everybody, smile.

863
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:26,791
Say "thank you."

864
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:29,375
And bow.

865
01:03:58,375 --> 01:03:59,291
Bravo!

866
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,666
Bravo.

867
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:13,541
You hid the guns
in the theater, didn't you?

868
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:16,583
You went to see Ching Ling Foo
to talk about moving the guns.

869
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:19,291
This is why you came to us?

870
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:21,583
Actually, we came for something else.

871
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:24,333
You and Alice, the dead girl,

872
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:27,291
were you a couple?

873
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:32,958
Why do you ask?

874
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,083
Observe, listen, ask, and feel.

875
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:36,833
Crime investigation is a lot
like Chinese medicine.

876
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:39,458
You look for seemingly unrelated symptoms
to find the root cause.

877
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:41,291
That day,
Zheng Shiliang hesitated to speak.

878
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:42,958
All right!

879
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:46,000
You studied in England, and so had Alice.

880
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:48,291
<i>Maybe you two knew each other back then.</i>

881
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:49,583
<i>Most importantly,</i>

882
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:51,458
<i>you were arrested at the port</i>
<i>on the morning</i>

883
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:52,666
<i>of August 11th.</i>

884
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,041
You weren't trying to escape.

885
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,583
You were trying to elope with Alice,

886
01:04:57,458 --> 01:04:58,333
weren't you?

887
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,500
Apparently, I've underestimated you.

888
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:04,833
Looks like I was right.

889
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:07,833
Honestly, even I'm surprised
by my own detective talent.

890
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,000
Turns out I'm perfect
for this job after all.

891
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:19,083
I first met her by the River Thames.

892
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:22,625
I was eighteen.

893
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,541
<i>From that moment, I knew</i>

894
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,250
<i>she'd be where my life began</i>

895
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,041
<i>and where it would end.</i>

896
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:39,916
<i>I despised my father</i>
<i>and all his criminal deeds.</i>

897
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:43,375
<i>I planned to settle in England for good.</i>

898
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:44,541
<i>I returned to San Francisco</i>

899
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:46,833
<i>only for her.</i>

900
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:24,583
<i>That's when</i>

901
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:27,250
<i>we truly got to know each other.</i>

902
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:30,000
<i>The Chinese Exclusion Act stated</i>

903
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:33,166
<i>that Chinese men cannot marry white women.</i>

904
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:35,875
<i>We were in love,</i>

905
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:38,000
<i>but it was us against the world.</i>

906
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,625
<i>We could only meet in secret.</i>

907
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,708
Revealing your relationship
could've cleared your name.

908
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:48,083
Why didn't you say anything?

909
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:50,958
Alice is already dead.

910
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:55,500
I don't want her name tarnished
after her death.

911
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:58,375
A true romantic.

912
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,083
But you can't be known as
the Chinese Jack the Ripper, can you?

913
01:07:02,166 --> 01:07:03,625
You've finally got to the point.

914
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:06,458
This case is the biggest story
in America right now.

915
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:08,625
They want to make
the Chinese Exclusion Act permanent,

916
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,750
so they need a reason
to convince the public.

917
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:13,666
Brother, why don't you tell us
what happened that night?

918
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:18,708
On the afternoon of the 8th,
I got a letter from Alice,

919
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:20,416
delivered by her maid, Amanda.

920
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:39,541
We planned to steal
the guns from the Irish block

921
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,041
on the night of the 10th.

922
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:45,083
After delivering the guns to the theater,
I went home to pack

923
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:48,625
and made it to the port before 6 a.m.

924
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:51,208
But instead of Alice,
the police showed up.

925
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:54,541
I understand now.

926
01:07:55,541 --> 01:07:56,416
Go find Amanda.

927
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,958
She knows everything about me and Alice.

928
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:01,666
And she should know
who the real killer is.

929
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,625
- Where are you going?
- The revolution's underway

930
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,458
and those guns are crucial.

931
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:08,375
From now on, either love or death
must make way for it.

932
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:10,125
Shiliang and I will move the guns first.

933
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:11,833
You were born and raised here in America,

934
01:08:11,916 --> 01:08:13,166
and you've never even been to China.

935
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:15,041
Why do you care so much
about the revolution?

936
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:18,958
I've never been to China.
Never even braided my hair.

937
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:20,541
And still, they call me "pig-tail."

938
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:23,250
Alice and I truly love each other,

939
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,875
but we can't be seen together
in broad daylight.

940
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:30,208
The world is full of questions
I have no answer to.

941
01:08:31,416 --> 01:08:33,041
After meeting Shiliang, I realized

942
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:37,375
the Chinese are always protected
by their own.

943
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:38,958
They knowingly pursue the impossible.

944
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,166
They are the true hope of China.

945
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:46,750
Maybe they hold the answers
I've been searching for.

946
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,541
You're doing something great.

947
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:51,916
I admire that.

948
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:54,916
Great or not,
we all have a purpose in life.

949
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:58,250
I truly hope you two
can clear Zhenbang's name.

950
01:08:58,333 --> 01:09:00,250
We can help you tomorrow too.

951
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:02,041
But right now, Zhenbang's case is
just as important.

952
01:09:02,875 --> 01:09:04,333
We appreciate your kindness.

953
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:07,916
Qin Fu, Gui,

954
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:11,958
please find the person who killed Alice.

955
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:14,208
Rest assured, Brother.

956
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:16,333
Just call me Zhenbang.

957
01:09:16,916 --> 01:09:17,958
Please don't call me "Brother."

958
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:21,541
It creeps me out.

959
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:24,541
All right, Brother Zhenbang.

960
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:58,333
Who here can speak Chinese?

961
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,916
Anyone?

962
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:02,333
Get out, Chinaman.

963
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:04,875
As long as there's a translator.

964
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:07,833
I am from the Yellow Banner
of the Great Qing,

965
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,208
Captain of the Imperial Guards,

966
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:12,166
First Assistant and Deputy
of the Intelligence Department,

967
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,583
Head of the Secret Escort,

968
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:15,041
Recipient of the Yellow Jacket,

969
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,750
member of the Niohuru Clan,

970
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:19,166
Fei Yanggu.

971
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,458
Translate that.

972
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:30,416
So?

973
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,291
So,

974
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:34,375
we can work together

975
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:35,708
to catch the rebels.

976
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:37,333
You take the guns.

977
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:38,916
I take the people.

978
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,833
I know where you can find the guns.

979
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,916
Eh, wait. You… My…

980
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:10,375
CHINESE AND DOGS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER

981
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:14,166
CHINESE ARE ALLOWED TO ENTER

982
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:22,458
Which is faster?

983
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:23,916
A dagger or a gun?

984
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:26,833
At this distance,

985
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:29,791
I'm faster.

986
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,291
Sir, you really held yourself together
back there.

987
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:56,291
Much respect.

988
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:00,833
- Sir.
- Help me.

989
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,458
Don't let the Americans see.

990
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:03,875
I'm about to pee myself.

991
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:28,375
Zhenbang has something important
to do tomorrow.

992
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:30,458
I know. The guns.

993
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:32,250
We'd like to check out the crime scene.

994
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:33,666
Go ahead.

995
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,458
I'll call Mr. Weyman.

996
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,166
Right now, he's the only one

997
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:39,083
who can help us.

998
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:41,458
Lao Si.

999
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:45,916
Get Zhenbang a ferry ticket
for tomorrow night,

1000
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,958
and make sure he stays away for a while.

1001
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:49,375
Where to?

1002
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:52,333
As far as possible.

1003
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:54,125
Hong Kong.

1004
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:57,875
She was like me.

1005
01:13:57,958 --> 01:14:00,166
- She was a detective?
- She's a doctor of Chinese medicine.

1006
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:02,000
Let's keep observing.

1007
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:03,916
OBSERVE AGAIN

1008
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,250
No signs of struggle.

1009
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:08,125
Fresh blood.

1010
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:09,375
This time, the body wasn't moved.

1011
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:10,666
The attack happened right here.

1012
01:14:16,208 --> 01:14:17,541
She was strangled first,

1013
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:19,708
then disemboweled.

1014
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:21,916
LISTEN AGAIN

1015
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,583
- Strange.
- What?

1016
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:26,291
This cut isn't as clean as the last one.

1017
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:28,000
The internal organs were displaced, too.

1018
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,500
So, it wasn't the same person?

1019
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:31,666
Definitely not.

1020
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,416
All right, let's ask again.

1021
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,416
Lin Yue'e was a good child.

1022
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,500
She came to America with me
when she was 15.

1023
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:40,583
She never even argued with anyone.

1024
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:42,500
Why would anyone do something so horrible?

1025
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:43,833
She had no enemies.

1026
01:14:43,916 --> 01:14:45,000
Did she have any friends?

1027
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:46,833
What do you mean?

1028
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:49,875
You should know that Bai Zhenbang's case
affects the future of Chinatown.

1029
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,416
And the fate of all Chinese in America.

1030
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,500
If you know anything…

1031
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:53,791
Now's the time to speak
before it's too late.

1032
01:14:53,875 --> 01:14:54,833
And more importantly…

1033
01:14:54,916 --> 01:14:56,083
Don't you want justice for your daughter?

1034
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:21,083
Hey.

1035
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,666
He's a better driver than you.

1036
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:31,750
Zhenbang is on the move.

1037
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:33,500
- Are we heading out now?
- Let's go.

1038
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:55,708
A distraction.

1039
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:57,875
These amateurs…

1040
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,416
Such an amateur move.

1041
01:18:01,666 --> 01:18:02,916
Amateur…

1042
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:05,875
It's empty…

1043
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:21,833
Gui.

1044
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,416
Gui, please don't die.

1045
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,708
Gui!

1046
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:49,583
Gui!

1047
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:51,041
Gui.

1048
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:52,041
My name is Ghost.

1049
01:20:00,416 --> 01:20:01,666
Thank Kachina

1050
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,625
and my father, too.

1051
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:41,666
Save the young master!

1052
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:47,833
Dao.

1053
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:52,833
Dao.

1054
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:56,583
- Dao.
- Young Master.

1055
01:20:56,666 --> 01:20:57,583
Get out of here, Young Master.

1056
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,458
- Dao.
- Leave him with us.

1057
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:00,708
We'll take it from here.

1058
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:06,125
The master booked you
a ferry ticket to leave tonight.

1059
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:07,333
We're taking you to the dock.

1060
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:08,375
Let's go.

1061
01:21:12,416 --> 01:21:15,166
Mr. Lao Si, I can't go with you.

1062
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,625
There's something I must do.

1063
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,125
No, we have to go to the dock now.

1064
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:19,333
No, I must do this.

1065
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,916
Take him to the dock.

1066
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:23,083
- Young Master.
- Young Master!

1067
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:26,208
If you won't let me go,
I'll kill myself right here.

1068
01:21:26,291 --> 01:21:27,916
Give me the ticket.

1069
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,541
I'll leave after I'm done.

1070
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:31,916
Zhenbang, don't do this.

1071
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,958
Give me the ticket!

1072
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:39,166
Mr. Lao Si.

1073
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:53,541
Tell my father that

1074
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:56,875
even though I don't agree
with many things he has done,

1075
01:21:58,375 --> 01:21:59,541
he's always been…

1076
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,416
a hero to me.

1077
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:04,875
That has never changed.

1078
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:08,833
I'm truly grateful
for the name he gave me.

1079
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:11,208
It taught me

1080
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,375
what a man

1081
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:16,000
should do with his life.

1082
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:25,625
Boss, everything is loaded.

1083
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:27,375
Let's go.

1084
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:47,666
Tell me where your operation is

1085
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,666
and name every rebel,

1086
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:51,958
and I'll spare your life.

1087
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:54,541
Okay,

1088
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:56,958
but on one condition.

1089
01:22:57,041 --> 01:22:58,916
What is it? Tell me.

1090
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,500
Your hairstyle doesn't really
suit your face.

1091
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:09,625
Cut off your braid and I'll tell you.

1092
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:10,625
How dare you?

1093
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,583
What are you trying to do?

1094
01:23:20,666 --> 01:23:22,041
Stop!

1095
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:24,041
We don't want to start
a diplomatic incident.

1096
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:53,958
I'm not dead.

1097
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,416
I faked it.

1098
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,750
A wise man knows when to yield.

1099
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:01,333
Where's Brother Zhenbang?

1100
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:03,541
He said he had something
more important to do.

1101
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:05,083
He'll join me afterward.

1102
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:07,333
Join you? How are you getting out?

1103
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:09,833
Gui, do you have any ideas?

1104
01:24:10,916 --> 01:24:13,083
There is one, but it's slow.

1105
01:24:13,166 --> 01:24:14,083
How slow?

1106
01:24:14,166 --> 01:24:15,708
They're coming for us
first thing in the morning.

1107
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:29,666
Don't worry.

1108
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:31,500
We'll live.

1109
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,541
<i>We're doomed.</i>

1110
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:35,541
<i>- Completely doomed.</i>
- Master Fei.

1111
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:36,791
We're like peas in a pod.

1112
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:38,208
Why must we harm each other?

1113
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:39,916
I'm nothing like you.

1114
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:40,958
Look at you three.

1115
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:44,041
A rebel, a savage, a banana man.

1116
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,833
You all deserve to die.

1117
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,791
Do you want to live?
Let him talk if you do.

1118
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:52,541
Shiliang, just confess.

1119
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:54,625
As long as you're alive, there's hope.

1120
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:56,750
Revolution requires patience.
Let it take its course.

1121
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,166
Live as a hero,

1122
01:25:02,041 --> 01:25:04,583
die a martyr.

1123
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:05,916
I'll beat the "martyr" out of you.

1124
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,166
Bury them. Do it!

1125
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:11,583
Where are your powers?

1126
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:12,750
Use them!

1127
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:14,291
Strength of the Bear!

1128
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:15,833
The pigeon said we'll live.

1129
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:17,000
You believe a pigeon?

1130
01:25:17,916 --> 01:25:20,541
Our lives are at stake here
and you believe a pigeon?

1131
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:21,708
I believe in Kachina.

1132
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:23,291
And I believe in the revolution!

1133
01:25:23,375 --> 01:25:24,708
Oh sure, I totally believe you!

1134
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:37,875
Sir!

1135
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:40,333
Sir!

1136
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:42,708
The Eight-Nation Alliance, led by Britain
and America has invaded Peking

1137
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:44,166
and occupied the Forbidden City.

1138
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:45,250
Concubine Zhen was killed.

1139
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:46,625
The Empress Dowager and the Emperor…

1140
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,416
have gone missing, their fate unknown.

1141
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:57,250
They say they'll loot the Forbidden City.

1142
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:04,333
Now they are talking about sleeping
with the emperor's wife.

1143
01:26:17,583 --> 01:26:19,583
THE EIGHT-NATION ALLIANCE CAPTURED PEKING

1144
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:27,458
A dagger or a gun?

1145
01:27:39,916 --> 01:27:41,625
Brother!

1146
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:27,291
We're late.

1147
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:29,291
Just in time.

1148
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:35,541
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1149
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:36,708
Does he speak Hebei dialect too?

1150
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:39,000
He's my eagle eye.

1151
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:04,291
Save China.

1152
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:20,208
Detective Fu.

1153
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:22,958
We have news of the young master.

1154
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:25,125
Do you need us to go with you?

1155
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:26,458
You'll scare people.

1156
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:27,500
Just give us the horses.

1157
01:29:27,583 --> 01:29:29,250
Brother-in-law, take care of your sister.

1158
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:30,208
I'll come for her soon.

1159
01:29:30,291 --> 01:29:31,500
What did he say?

1160
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:34,416
That he'll find the killer soon.
We made a good team.

1161
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,916
I misjudged you.

1162
01:29:37,708 --> 01:29:38,666
His sister is waiting for you.

1163
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:39,708
Don't forget the land.

1164
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:41,708
I will not give up.

1165
01:33:19,916 --> 01:33:21,458
Don't touch me.

1166
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:41,583
POST OFFICE

1167
01:33:43,166 --> 01:33:45,125
HUA XIN RESTAURANT

1168
01:34:12,666 --> 01:34:15,375
FUNERAL

1169
01:34:15,458 --> 01:34:17,708
This is the American
residency paper you wanted.

1170
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,750
Master Bai knew all along
that you are not Mr. Holmes.

1171
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:22,458
Your real name is Qin Fu.

1172
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:24,125
Your grandfather was the imperial
physician to Emperor Daoguang.

1173
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:26,125
Qin Benyu, the Divine Hands.

1174
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:28,541
He retired to his home village
and treated common folk for a living.

1175
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:30,500
In the third year of Xianfeng,

1176
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:32,625
Qian Yuan, the Lord of Jin, took Henan

1177
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:34,958
and slaughtered all 11 members
of your family.

1178
01:34:35,041 --> 01:34:37,291
Your father was the only survivor.

1179
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:41,000
I think that's why you'd rather stay here
than go back.

1180
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:43,500
You're not a student sent
by the Qing government either.

1181
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:44,916
The age doesn't match.

1182
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,625
Your older brother, Qin Lin, is.

1183
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:49,833
You came to America years ago
to look for him,

1184
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:51,291
who is the only family you have left.

1185
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:52,250
Am I right?

1186
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:55,833
Take this residency paper and go find him.

1187
01:35:05,958 --> 01:35:07,750
What does this mean?
No more investigation?

1188
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:14,125
And you? You're giving up too?

1189
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:15,333
This time tomorrow,

1190
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,375
Lance will announce the case as closed
at City Hall Square.

1191
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,541
What more can we do?

1192
01:35:28,125 --> 01:35:30,875
My parents died in an explosion
building railways for white people.

1193
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,000
I was young. I had to let it go.

1194
01:35:33,583 --> 01:35:36,666
Later, the Native American tribe
that raised me was driven away,

1195
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:39,208
forced to leave their ancestors' lands.

1196
01:35:39,791 --> 01:35:41,958
Father told me not to resist.
I had to let it go.

1197
01:35:42,041 --> 01:35:43,666
Now Father was killed,

1198
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:44,916
and Zhenbang was falsely accused.

1199
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,458
Are we supposed to let it go again?

1200
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:48,375
Plus, with so many loose ends,

1201
01:35:48,458 --> 01:35:51,041
we all know Zhenbang can't be the killer.

1202
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:53,833
Yet in the end, even we are
giving up the investigation.

1203
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:57,791
Then history will forever remember
a Chinese Jack the Ripper.

1204
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:02,125
You can choose to give up, to let it go.

1205
01:36:02,208 --> 01:36:03,625
But this time, I won't.

1206
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,833
I will find the real killer.

1207
01:36:28,208 --> 01:36:29,583
What are you doing here?

1208
01:36:29,666 --> 01:36:31,583
We've come to say goodbye
to Young Master Bai.

1209
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:34,458
Everyone here has received help
from the Bai family to some extent.

1210
01:36:34,541 --> 01:36:36,875
Whether it's you,
Master Bai, or the Young Master.

1211
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:38,750
Six months ago, I had a difficult labor.

1212
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:40,625
The American doctors had given up on me.

1213
01:36:40,708 --> 01:36:42,750
If it weren't for the Young Master,

1214
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:44,583
my child and I wouldn't have survived.

1215
01:36:44,666 --> 01:36:47,750
My wife and I run a laundry shop
outside Chinatown.

1216
01:36:47,833 --> 01:36:49,916
We're bullied
by the Irish gang all the time.

1217
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
My wife was pushed
to the brink of suicide.

1218
01:36:52,083 --> 01:36:54,541
It was Young Master Bai
who stood up for us.

1219
01:36:54,625 --> 01:36:56,708
We don't believe he is a murderer.

1220
01:36:56,791 --> 01:36:58,166
We don't believe it.

1221
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:00,666
- Public will.
- Public will.

1222
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,583
Isn't this the will of the public?

1223
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:05,375
Gui is right.

1224
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:06,791
We can't let Zhenbang die for nothing.

1225
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:08,875
There are still 24 hours
before the case closes.

1226
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:10,500
We still have a chance.

1227
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:12,041
Gui, let's go.

1228
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:13,166
Take me with you.

1229
01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:22,541
Aren't you supposed to be
on a ship tonight?

1230
01:37:23,291 --> 01:37:24,958
Yes. The magician is waiting for you.

1231
01:37:25,041 --> 01:37:27,291
I want to stay
and fight with you until the end.

1232
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:28,875
You have something more important to do.

1233
01:37:28,958 --> 01:37:30,625
We've got it covered here. Don't worry.

1234
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:32,541
Shiliang, the greater cause
needs you more.

1235
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:36,333
If all our countrymen were like you two,

1236
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:38,291
China would surely become
a great nation again.

1237
01:37:39,791 --> 01:37:40,750
I guess this is where we part ways then.

1238
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:41,750
- Take care.
- Take care.

1239
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,875
From now on,

1240
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:49,583
you two shall be known
as Detective Chinatown.

1241
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,125
Observe, listen, ask, feel? Which one now?

1242
01:37:57,208 --> 01:37:58,125
Time is against us.

1243
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:00,416
Just improvise.

1244
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,041
These past few days, we were so focused
on Bai Zhenbang and Alice

1245
01:38:03,125 --> 01:38:04,833
that we overlooked an important person.

1246
01:38:04,916 --> 01:38:06,166
That Black maid.

1247
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:29,541
You said the wounds on Amanda's body

1248
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:31,333
are the same as those on Dr. Lin's.

1249
01:38:31,416 --> 01:38:34,041
The person who cut Alice open
is not the one who did them.

1250
01:38:34,125 --> 01:38:35,166
But I don't understand.

1251
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:36,750
Besides a need for attention,

1252
01:38:36,833 --> 01:38:39,666
why would the killer copy
Jack the Ripper's pattern?

1253
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,041
What's even stranger is,

1254
01:38:41,125 --> 01:38:42,583
why are there two killers?

1255
01:38:48,333 --> 01:38:49,583
What's this herb-brewing pot doing here?

1256
01:38:50,208 --> 01:38:51,583
Black people believe
in Chinese medicine too?

1257
01:38:56,583 --> 01:38:57,958
Mulberry mistletoe.
Nourishes the liver and kidneys,

1258
01:38:58,041 --> 01:38:59,916
dispels rheumatism, strengthens bones,
and stabilizes the fetus.

1259
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,625
Baikal skullcap.
Clears heat, purges toxins,

1260
01:39:01,708 --> 01:39:02,708
stops bleeding, and stabilizes the fetus.

1261
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:04,125
Atractylodes.
Replenishes qi, strengthens the spleen,

1262
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:05,916
dispels dampness, relieves sweating,

1263
01:39:06,666 --> 01:39:07,541
and stabilizes the fetus.

1264
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:09,208
The medicine wasn't for her.

1265
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,625
But why would the killer
remove all her intestines?

1266
01:39:12,708 --> 01:39:14,208
This is the fatal wound.

1267
01:39:14,291 --> 01:39:16,458
<i>Wood shavings.</i>
<i>Why are there wood shavings?</i>

1268
01:39:21,125 --> 01:39:22,750
We're close to solving Alice's case.

1269
01:39:22,833 --> 01:39:24,583
Who killed Father then?

1270
01:39:24,666 --> 01:39:26,416
We need to do <i>qiè </i>one more time.

1271
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,166
Which one are we talking about?

1272
01:39:38,666 --> 01:39:40,500
<i>None of us believe</i>
<i>Zhenbang was the murderer.</i>

1273
01:39:40,583 --> 01:39:42,500
<i>There must be a loophole in what they saw.</i>

1274
01:40:01,333 --> 01:40:03,333
Me, it's me.

1275
01:40:06,666 --> 01:40:07,791
You didn't leave?

1276
01:40:08,458 --> 01:40:10,333
I did. Almost.

1277
01:40:10,416 --> 01:40:11,375
I thought you had a ferry to catch.

1278
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:14,291
That can wait a day.

1279
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:15,708
Zhenbang's case can't wait.

1280
01:40:16,791 --> 01:40:17,875
Mr. Ching said

1281
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,916
this whole thing
might just be a misdirection.

1282
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,958
I was recreating the scene
where Zhenbang got shot in my mind.

1283
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:26,708
I think maybe it was all a trick.

1284
01:40:26,791 --> 01:40:29,416
I wonder if he is thinking
what we are thinking.

1285
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:30,541
It was rather misty here in the afternoon.

1286
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:32,916
The person everyone thought was Zhenbang
wasn't him at all,

1287
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,541
<i>just someone dressed like him.</i>

1288
01:40:35,625 --> 01:40:39,291
<i>When he saw Lance and the others coming,</i>
<i>he pretended to escape.</i>

1289
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:42,375
Grant fired a shot.

1290
01:40:42,458 --> 01:40:43,958
Where's that gunshot sound from?

1291
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:44,875
That was my whistle.

1292
01:40:45,791 --> 01:40:46,666
Impressive.

1293
01:40:48,333 --> 01:40:50,375
- So…
- Grant…

1294
01:40:50,458 --> 01:40:51,833
Fired a blank shot.

1295
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:55,416
The fake Zhenbang pretended to be shot,
fell in the water, then was switched out,

1296
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,833
and the real Zhenbang's body
was floated to the surface.

1297
01:40:58,708 --> 01:40:59,916
So,

1298
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:03,625
there must be a hiding space
at the bottom of this pool.

1299
01:41:03,708 --> 01:41:05,666
Gui, how good a swimmer…

1300
01:41:08,583 --> 01:41:09,500
So hasty.

1301
01:41:38,083 --> 01:41:40,166
- So?
- Someone could hide in there.

1302
01:41:44,208 --> 01:41:45,333
And I found this.

1303
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:48,541
Looks familiar.

1304
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:50,541
The Irish Union pin.

1305
01:41:50,625 --> 01:41:51,791
Our theory is plausible,

1306
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:53,291
but we're still missing direct evidence.

1307
01:41:53,375 --> 01:41:55,750
Right now, only one person can help us.

1308
01:41:59,083 --> 01:42:02,125
I studied medicine to save lives,
out of benevolence.

1309
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:03,833
Later, I realized that practicing medicine
can only save individuals,

1310
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:05,125
but not the world.

1311
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:06,708
That's why I joined
Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution.

1312
01:42:06,791 --> 01:42:08,791
Who knew
I'd be back on my old trade again.

1313
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:11,125
I studied Chinese medicine because…

1314
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:12,541
Enough chitchat, let's get started.

1315
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:13,625
Still so hasty.

1316
01:42:13,708 --> 01:42:14,791
Bai Zhenbang,

1317
01:42:14,875 --> 01:42:17,333
if you're watching from above,
please show us some clues.

1318
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:41,833
On the night of August 10th,

1319
01:44:41,916 --> 01:44:44,250
two victims were killed in Chinatown.

1320
01:44:44,333 --> 01:44:46,166
One was Mr. Grant's daughter, Alice,

1321
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:48,666
<i>and the other was</i>
<i>the Native American chief, Six-Hands.</i>

1322
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:50,000
<i>After the autopsy,</i>
<i>we discovered that the killer</i>

1323
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:51,833
<i>demonstrated expertise</i>
<i>in the use of a scalpel.</i>

1324
01:44:51,916 --> 01:44:55,166
<i>On August 15th,</i>
<i>another victim popped up in Chinatown,</i>

1325
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:58,125
<i>the female Chinese doctor, Lin Yue'e,</i>
<i>who was also disemboweled,</i>

1326
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:00,750
<i>but the cut on her body was uneven,</i>

1327
01:45:00,833 --> 01:45:03,666
<i>just like Amanda's,</i>
<i>found at the silk factory yesterday.</i>

1328
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:06,416
From this, we can conclude
that your so-called Jack the Ripper

1329
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:07,458
is actually two people.

1330
01:46:14,166 --> 01:46:15,583
<i>Mr. Thomas.</i>

1331
01:46:15,666 --> 01:46:18,791
We just happened to find your union badge
at the bottom of the pool.

1332
01:46:19,666 --> 01:46:22,041
It has the initials
of Thomas Lawrence on it.

1333
01:46:22,125 --> 01:46:24,541
I wonder what you were doing
in the pool at the silk factory.

1334
01:46:24,625 --> 01:46:26,416
Taking a bath?

1335
01:46:49,916 --> 01:46:51,666
Here's our second witness, Piggy.

1336
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:52,583
PUNISH THE MURDERER

1337
01:47:01,875 --> 01:47:03,208
Depending on distance,

1338
01:47:03,291 --> 01:47:06,375
bullet wounds on an animal or a human
could be very different.

1339
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:08,583
By looking at Bai Zhenbang's wound,

1340
01:47:08,666 --> 01:47:10,208
we'll know who's lying.

1341
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:11,958
<i>There are clear burn marks</i>
<i>on Bai Zhenbang's body.</i>

1342
01:47:12,041 --> 01:47:13,500
He was shot by this gun.

1343
01:47:13,583 --> 01:47:15,791
But he was shot from point-blank range,

1344
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:17,750
and the time of death
wasn't yesterday morning,

1345
01:47:17,833 --> 01:47:19,000
but the night before.

1346
01:47:32,416 --> 01:47:35,375
- What did you find?
- Clenched teeth, facial muscle spasms,

1347
01:47:35,458 --> 01:47:37,166
stiff limbs, a twisted smile.

1348
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:39,416
The livor mortis appears bright red
with a blackened nose and fingertips.

1349
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,625
Cold energy invaded,
keeping the yin energy inside

1350
01:47:41,708 --> 01:47:42,583
and the yang energy out.

1351
01:47:42,666 --> 01:47:44,166
Could it be he was…

1352
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:45,666
I have a knife.

1353
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:46,708
I have a bottle of vinegar.

1354
01:47:46,791 --> 01:47:47,916
What do you need vinegar for?

1355
01:47:55,375 --> 01:47:56,666
His complexion appears pale gray.

1356
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:58,291
He's frozen to death.

1357
01:47:58,375 --> 01:48:00,208
Zhenbang would've been proud

1358
01:48:00,291 --> 01:48:03,458
to see we combine Chinese learning
with Western methods.

1359
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,291
<i>In San Francisco, there aren't</i>
<i>many buildings with ice cellars.</i>

1360
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:34,958
Mr. Grant,
don't you have one in your home?

1361
01:48:48,958 --> 01:48:51,041
You fought in the Civil War,

1362
01:48:51,125 --> 01:48:53,250
<i>serving as a military doctor.</i>

1363
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:07,208
As you all know,
Mr. Grant is running for mayor.

1364
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:09,875
His new policies include making
the Chinese Exclusion Act permanent,

1365
01:49:09,958 --> 01:49:11,333
shutting down Chinatown,

1366
01:49:11,416 --> 01:49:13,791
and banning any business
or individual from hiring Chinese.

1367
01:49:13,875 --> 01:49:16,166
These policies have won him votes,

1368
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:18,875
especially the support
of the Union led by Thomas.

1369
01:49:18,958 --> 01:49:20,125
But what you might not know is,

1370
01:49:20,208 --> 01:49:22,333
his daughter Alice's boyfriend
was a Chinese man.

1371
01:49:23,125 --> 01:49:24,625
And that man

1372
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:26,125
was none other than Bai Zhenbang.

1373
01:51:17,416 --> 01:51:18,708
Now, let's talk about
what everyone is eager to know,

1374
01:51:18,791 --> 01:51:20,750
Jack the Ripper.

1375
01:51:20,833 --> 01:51:22,708
The one thing that
confused us the most before was

1376
01:51:22,791 --> 01:51:24,416
why the killer would impersonate him,

1377
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,916
removing the victims' intestines.

1378
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,458
Until we went to the home
of the second victim, Lin Yue'e.

1379
01:51:29,541 --> 01:51:30,916
Her clinic

1380
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,958
was where Alice and Bai Zhenbang
would meet in secret.

1381
01:51:33,041 --> 01:51:34,458
Don't you want justice for your daughter?

1382
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:38,166
She did tell me that

1383
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:42,375
<i>she was pretty close</i>
<i>to Young Master Bai and Miss Alice.</i>

1384
01:51:46,333 --> 01:51:47,791
<i>But one day,</i>

1385
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:49,875
<i>they were seen</i>

1386
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:51,333
<i>by Mr. Grant.</i>

1387
01:52:04,458 --> 01:52:06,000
And the true reason Alice was killed

1388
01:52:06,083 --> 01:52:07,833
was because she was pregnant

1389
01:52:07,916 --> 01:52:09,541
with Bai Zhenbang's child.

1390
01:52:12,125 --> 01:52:14,250
After discovering her pregnancy,

1391
01:52:14,333 --> 01:52:17,000
Alice decided to elope with Bai Zhenbang
on the morning of the 11th.

1392
01:52:17,083 --> 01:52:18,541
But just as she was about to leave…

1393
01:52:20,041 --> 01:52:21,208
You…

1394
01:52:21,291 --> 01:52:23,000
pushed her down the stairs to her death.

1395
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:31,791
These blood-stained wood shavings

1396
01:52:31,875 --> 01:52:33,666
<i>were found in Alice's hair,</i>

1397
01:52:34,375 --> 01:52:37,625
<i>and they are a perfect match for the</i>
<i>broken railing in Mr. Grant's home.</i>

1398
01:52:37,708 --> 01:52:39,625
This is the true cause of Alice's death.

1399
01:52:40,416 --> 01:52:41,625
Also,

1400
01:52:41,708 --> 01:52:43,958
we found some human tissue
under Alice's fingernails,

1401
01:52:44,875 --> 01:52:47,083
<i>from when she fought against her killer.</i>

1402
01:52:48,583 --> 01:52:49,750
Mr. Grant,

1403
01:52:49,833 --> 01:52:52,083
I'm guessing there's a scratch
on your left hand.

1404
01:53:06,125 --> 01:53:07,875
You used Jack the Ripper's name

1405
01:53:07,958 --> 01:53:10,125
to increase public attention on this case,

1406
01:53:10,208 --> 01:53:13,333
then you blamed the Chinese
which earned you quite a few votes.

1407
01:53:13,416 --> 01:53:15,875
More importantly, it covered up the fact
that Alice was pregnant.

1408
01:53:16,916 --> 01:53:18,875
And Bai Zhenbang,
until his death, never knew

1409
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:22,416
that Alice…

1410
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:23,416
was carrying his child.

1411
01:55:55,083 --> 01:55:57,291
<i>You moved Alice's body to Chinatown,</i>

1412
01:55:57,375 --> 01:55:59,666
<i>where Six-Hands who was there</i>
<i>to trade furs, saw you.</i>

1413
01:56:01,208 --> 01:56:02,875
<i>So, he became the second victim.</i>

1414
01:56:02,958 --> 01:56:05,416
<i>To make sure no one finds out</i>
<i>what you did,</i>

1415
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:06,958
<i>you had to silence the witnesses.</i>

1416
01:56:07,625 --> 01:56:09,041
The first was Lin Yue'e,
the Chinese doctor

1417
01:56:09,125 --> 01:56:10,791
who knew about Alice's pregnancy.

1418
01:56:12,666 --> 01:56:14,208
<i>And then, the person who knew everything,</i>

1419
01:56:14,291 --> 01:56:16,125
<i>the maid, Amanda.</i>

1420
01:56:33,208 --> 01:56:34,708
Bai Zhenbang.

1421
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:15,000
FUNERAL

1422
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:04,833
Gui, tomorrow morning, go to Grant's house

1423
01:59:04,916 --> 01:59:06,041
and get something for me.

1424
01:59:06,125 --> 01:59:07,125
What?

1425
01:59:07,208 --> 01:59:08,375
I know who you are.

1426
01:59:08,916 --> 01:59:10,625
I knew from the moment I first saw you.

1427
01:59:28,291 --> 01:59:29,250
Go!

1428
01:59:59,041 --> 02:00:00,458
What is it about this photo
that makes you so emotional?

1429
02:00:00,541 --> 02:00:02,041
I don't get it.

1430
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:19,791
My old friend.

1431
02:04:20,958 --> 02:04:22,583
I have a house full of guests.

1432
02:04:22,666 --> 02:04:24,166
Please forgive me for not inviting you in.

1433
02:04:24,250 --> 02:04:25,625
No need for formalities.

1434
02:04:25,708 --> 02:04:27,000
I came to say goodbye.

1435
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:30,166
I'm really sorry about Zhenbang.

1436
02:04:30,833 --> 02:04:32,458
It was all part of your plan, wasn't it?

1437
02:04:32,541 --> 02:04:33,625
What?

1438
02:04:33,708 --> 02:04:35,625
Grant could never come up with

1439
02:04:36,208 --> 02:04:39,666
an idea using Jack the Ripper
to frame Zhenbang.

1440
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:42,625
Nor would he know so much
about the silk factory

1441
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:45,583
to create a misdirection
using its environment.

1442
02:04:45,666 --> 02:04:48,291
It must have been someone who knows
how to manipulate public opinion

1443
02:04:48,375 --> 02:04:50,666
and is an expert in magic tricks.

1444
02:04:52,708 --> 02:04:55,000
<i>Mr. Bai and Mr. Weyman</i>

1445
02:04:55,083 --> 02:04:57,666
<i>are my loyal fans and magic experts.</i>

1446
02:05:03,833 --> 02:05:06,541
I told Lance to hand you the key evidence

1447
02:05:06,625 --> 02:05:08,041
not to help you,

1448
02:05:08,125 --> 02:05:09,750
<i>but because I realized</i>

1449
02:05:09,833 --> 02:05:12,458
<i>that if Grant, a Republican, wins,</i>

1450
02:05:12,541 --> 02:05:17,583
his policies would prohibit any business
from hiring Chinese laborers.

1451
02:05:17,666 --> 02:05:19,750
So, he had to be removed

1452
02:05:19,833 --> 02:05:22,291
to secure a win for William,
the Democrat candidate.

1453
02:05:23,125 --> 02:05:25,833
At the same time, you had to deal
with the mortal enemy of capital,

1454
02:05:25,916 --> 02:05:27,083
<i>the union.</i>

1455
02:05:27,166 --> 02:05:28,291
<i>Only by winning the union over</i>

1456
02:05:28,375 --> 02:05:32,833
can you legally employ
Chinese laborers long-term.

1457
02:05:35,250 --> 02:05:36,375
Louis,

1458
02:05:36,458 --> 02:05:38,833
you're indeed worthy of being my friend.

1459
02:05:40,875 --> 02:05:43,291
In fact, that day, I was going

1460
02:05:43,375 --> 02:05:45,500
to talk him into changing
his campaign strategy.

1461
02:06:13,333 --> 02:06:14,958
<i>There must be something else.</i>

1462
02:06:15,041 --> 02:06:16,666
Your silk factory…

1463
02:06:17,416 --> 02:06:19,500
I need that land.

1464
02:06:20,750 --> 02:06:23,958
<i>But for the livelihood</i>
<i>of your fellow Chinese,</i>

1465
02:06:24,041 --> 02:06:25,666
you would never give it up.

1466
02:06:26,750 --> 02:06:28,958
Now all my assets have been confiscated.

1467
02:06:29,833 --> 02:06:32,625
And the land is already yours.

1468
02:06:32,708 --> 02:06:35,791
<i>You gave me the deed willingly.</i>

1469
02:06:35,875 --> 02:06:38,750
This world operates on two rules.

1470
02:06:40,125 --> 02:06:42,416
Power controls everything,

1471
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:44,250
or money controls power.

1472
02:06:44,875 --> 02:06:46,208
We are the latter.

1473
02:06:46,291 --> 02:06:47,708
Understood.

1474
02:06:47,791 --> 02:06:48,958
Old friend,

1475
02:06:49,833 --> 02:06:51,250
see yourself out.

1476
02:06:52,625 --> 02:06:54,916
We have an old saying in Chinese,

1477
02:06:55,625 --> 02:06:57,125
"Times change,

1478
02:06:57,208 --> 02:06:58,541
fortune rises and falls."

1479
02:06:58,625 --> 02:07:00,291
What is on top today

1480
02:07:00,375 --> 02:07:02,041
may be at the bottom tomorrow.

1481
02:07:03,250 --> 02:07:04,875
We will meet again.

1482
02:07:14,291 --> 02:07:18,708
SILK FACTORY

1483
02:08:09,291 --> 02:08:12,166
Gui, you look just like your father.

1484
02:08:13,208 --> 02:08:16,125
If he could see what you've become,

1485
02:08:16,208 --> 02:08:17,875
he would smile from beyond.

1486
02:08:17,958 --> 02:08:19,416
Too bad fate wasn't that kind to him.

1487
02:08:21,541 --> 02:08:22,875
Don't let your emotions
cloud your judgment.

1488
02:08:26,916 --> 02:08:29,958
There's so much
we can learn from this place.

1489
02:08:30,833 --> 02:08:33,541
Study your opponent's strength
before going into battle.

1490
02:08:33,625 --> 02:08:35,833
Godfather, I understand it now.

1491
02:08:37,083 --> 02:08:38,500
Fallen leaves return to their roots.

1492
02:08:39,166 --> 02:08:42,000
Zhenbang and I
are going back home, to Canton.

1493
02:08:42,666 --> 02:08:44,500
He's never been there.

1494
02:08:48,875 --> 02:08:50,166
Take care.

1495
02:08:54,666 --> 02:08:56,625
- Take care, Godfather.
- Take care, Master Bai.

1496
02:08:58,625 --> 02:09:00,958
Kid, sing us a song.

1497
02:09:01,041 --> 02:09:02,083
Kid.

1498
02:09:02,958 --> 02:09:03,791
Sing us a song.

1499
02:09:05,458 --> 02:09:08,416
<i>Magpies cheer</i>

1500
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:11,583
<i>New Year's near</i>

1501
02:09:11,666 --> 02:09:13,708
<i>Father's off to earn</i>

1502
02:09:13,791 --> 02:09:16,000
<i>We hear</i>

1503
02:09:17,125 --> 02:09:23,000
<i>Gain he will, silver and gold</i>

1504
02:09:23,666 --> 02:09:28,750
<i>To buy the land and build a home</i>

1505
02:09:36,708 --> 02:09:37,875
Now that my godfather has left,

1506
02:09:38,708 --> 02:09:40,583
I have two plans in mind,
so help me choose.

1507
02:09:40,666 --> 02:09:41,875
Go ahead.

1508
02:09:41,958 --> 02:09:44,000
One, we work as a team,
Detective Chinatown.

1509
02:09:44,083 --> 02:09:45,000
I choose the second one.

1510
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:47,625
Go back and marry the princess.
Become a prince of your tribe.

1511
02:09:47,708 --> 02:09:49,375
I'll go with the first then.

1512
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,666
- Gui.
- Ghost.

1513
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:54,041
What's your last name?

1514
02:09:54,125 --> 02:09:55,583
I forgot to ask Master Bai earlier.

1515
02:09:55,666 --> 02:09:57,416
From now on, your last name will be Tang.

1516
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:58,750
Why Tang?

1517
02:09:58,833 --> 02:10:01,125
So your children will know
where you came from,

1518
02:10:01,208 --> 02:10:02,833
and where this Chinatown came from.

1519
02:10:02,916 --> 02:10:05,166
So, I'll be Ghost Tang?

1520
02:10:05,250 --> 02:10:06,291
It's Gui Tang.

1521
02:10:06,375 --> 02:10:07,958
"Fu" means fortune and "Gui" means wealth.
We wish you super-duper rich!

1522
02:10:08,041 --> 02:10:09,541
King-of-the-world rich!
God of wealth rich!

1523
02:10:09,625 --> 02:10:10,791
Rich and lucky!

1524
02:10:10,875 --> 02:10:13,458
Happy New Year! I hope you get rich!

1525
02:10:46,916 --> 02:10:47,916
Mr. Ching.

1526
02:10:48,958 --> 02:10:50,041
What's this?

1527
02:10:50,125 --> 02:10:51,166
This?

1528
02:10:51,250 --> 02:10:52,916
It's called a camera.

1529
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,500
For making movies.

1530
02:10:54,583 --> 02:10:56,666
What's a movie?

1531
02:10:56,750 --> 02:10:59,125
Movies are the best thing ever.

1532
02:10:59,208 --> 02:11:00,625
But I worry that this thing

1533
02:11:00,708 --> 02:11:04,166
might someday put magicians like myself
out of business.

1534
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:07,208
Mr. Ching, I hope to see
your performance again soon.

1535
02:11:07,291 --> 02:11:09,750
At least I didn't lose the bet.

1536
02:11:09,833 --> 02:11:13,166
I will surely have the courage
to come back one day.

1537
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:14,833
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

1538
02:11:14,916 --> 02:11:16,750
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

1539
02:11:16,833 --> 02:11:18,125
Farewell.

1540
02:11:18,208 --> 02:11:19,791
- Farewell, Shiliang.
- Farewell.

1541
02:11:19,875 --> 02:11:20,833
Farewell.

1542
02:11:22,833 --> 02:11:24,083
What exactly is a revolution?

1543
02:11:25,125 --> 02:11:26,041
It's something

1544
02:11:27,041 --> 02:11:28,416
that will make China better.

1545
02:11:29,708 --> 02:11:32,250
If things were better there,
who would come here?

1546
02:11:34,291 --> 02:11:37,000
Mr. Ching,
thank you for waiting another day.

1547
02:11:40,208 --> 02:11:41,416
Look at this country.

1548
02:11:42,333 --> 02:11:45,625
Their magic lies in cars,
movies, skyscrapers,

1549
02:11:45,708 --> 02:11:47,208
railways, and steamboats,

1550
02:11:47,291 --> 02:11:50,250
while mine is just for show.

1551
02:11:51,625 --> 02:11:53,458
So, what I cannot achieve,

1552
02:11:54,083 --> 02:11:55,541
I hope all of you can.

1553
02:11:56,916 --> 02:12:01,000
Can a few hundred guns on this ship
really save China?

1554
02:12:02,041 --> 02:12:04,625
If hundreds aren't enough,
then I'll bring thousands.

1555
02:12:04,708 --> 02:12:07,708
And if those still aren't enough,
then I'll bring tens of thousands.

1556
02:12:07,791 --> 02:12:10,375
Despite endless trials and tribulations,
our nation still stands.

1557
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,666
It's all because our people
gave their lives for greater causes.

1558
02:12:15,708 --> 02:12:17,958
I believe that one day,

1559
02:12:18,041 --> 02:12:20,625
we will become the most powerful country.

1560
02:12:23,833 --> 02:12:24,708
Yes.

1561
02:12:25,583 --> 02:12:26,958
And that will be

1562
02:12:27,791 --> 02:12:30,041
the greatest magic trick
the world has ever seen.
