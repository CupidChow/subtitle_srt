Who are you looking for? Stop!

00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,289
I'm talking to you! Stop!

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,700
Do you hear me?

8
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,920
Stop moving forward.

9
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,680
Stop!

10
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,410
Miss, are you all right?

11
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:07,840
Don't be afraid.

12
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,669
Miss, don't be afraid.

13
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,000
We just want to ask

14
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,680
what you are doing here.

15
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,170
Are you okay?

16
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,830
You pesky fatty!

17
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,079
How dare you hit me?

18
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,870
Believe or not...

19
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,710
Are you in a position to call her fatty?

20
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,510
-Miss Chubby. -Miss Chubby.

21
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,140
Why does Boss come here?

22
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,720
Who is she?

23
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,690
Does she know our Boss?

24
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,250
I don't know.

25
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,530
They seem to be close.

26
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,720
Don't come out alone

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,550
in the middle of the night.

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,810
Tell me

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,720
before doing anything.

30
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,010
If you're in danger,

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,170
ask for help loudly.

32
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,250
Boss, thank you for saving me.

33
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,980
Why did those two

34
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,980
chase me?

35
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,150
Have you seen anyone

36
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,310
who lives in a high-end villa

37
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,240
shopping for vegetables in the middle of the night?

38
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,260
But after 6 p.m.,

39
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,540
the vegetables have a 30% discount.

40
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,090
Your hand.

41
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,480
do not touch the boss's body.

44
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,290
But it's you

45
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,110
who are touching my body.

46
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,190
Boss, am I too heavy?

47
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,100
Can you hold on?

48
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,150
How can a man admit that he can't?

49
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,590
Then why are you getting slower and slower?

50
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,600
Am I?

51
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,470
Boss,

52
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,300
actually,

53
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,810
you can put me down now.

54
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,020
Don't move.

55
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,320
Don't move!

56
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,010
Sorry, Boss.

57
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,490
Are you okay?

58
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,959
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,970
Are you okay, Boss?

60
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,770
Get up.

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,860
I didn't mean it.

62
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,880
I'll get up.

63
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,770
Boss.

64
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,540
Are you okay?

65
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,870
Help me in.

66
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,590
Help me in now!

67
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,200
You returned kindness with hatred.

68
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,570
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,170
Be careful, Boss.

70
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,170
My jacket.

71
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,270
Boss, let me help you.

72
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,830
Be gentle.

73
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,400
What are you doing?

74
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,270
I...

75
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,980
I'll make some bone soup

76
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,590
for you.

77
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,540
Now that she's taking good care of me,

78
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,060
I should take the chance to fully enjoy it.

79
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,110
Wait.

80
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,300
The blanket.

81
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:25,860
Wait.

82
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,040
It's so noisy outside.

83
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,550
This is the feeling of happiness.

84
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,810
Wait.

85
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,520
It's windy.

86
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,930
Where are you going?

87
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,560
What are you doing?

88
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,830
I'm asking you.

89
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,580
What are you doing?

90
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,660
That should be okay.

91
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:16,830
What do you think?

92
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,280
I think it's good.

93
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,800
That's enough.

94
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,970
Time for soup.

95
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,240
Go to bed early.

96
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,250
Dad, what are you doing?

97
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,450
I'm picking fish bones.

98
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,370
Otherwise,

99
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,940
you'll be done for if you get one stuck in your throat.

100
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,700
Mom, what are you doing?

101
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,750
I'm making your favorite

102
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,920
yellow croaker wontons.

103
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,310
Tonight,

104
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,220
we'll have yellow croaker wontons.

105
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,050
When will it be ready?

106
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,420
I'm starving.

107
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,030
It's so strange.

108
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,920
She always gives me

109
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,220
a sense of déjà vu.

110
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,990
A sense that is familiar but unfamiliar,

111
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,190
silly

112
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,310
but secure.

113
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,550
I'm not drinking it.

114
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,440
But you haven't started.

115
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,940
Let me change another bowl for you.

116
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,730
No need.

117
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,260
Now

118
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,299
I want to sleep.

119
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,309
You finally want to sleep.

120
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,000
Chubby Su.

121
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,430
Chubby Su.

122
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,270
What kind of person is he?

123
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,890
Even if you don't know him well,

124
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,540
you can still be attracted by him.

125
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,050
He looks cold,

126
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,860
always with a long face,

127
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,980
and he likes to tease others,

128
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,660
but his willfulness

129
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,970
makes me feel him close or distant

130
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,580
as he gets closer

131
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,590
or drifts away.

132
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,880
Accidently,

133
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,740
you'll find his cuteness.

134
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,150
That's right.

135
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,450
Being alone all day

136
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,050
in such a big house,

137
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,630
anyone would feel lonely.

138
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,530
I can't believe she took care of me all night.

139
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,320
Boss, you're awake.

140
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,020
Are you feeling better?

141
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,860
I still can't move.

142
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,590
Chubby Su, help me turn over.

143
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,700
Why are you

144
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,660
getting worse?

145
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,770
Drinking so much bone soup

146
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,640
doesn't help at all.

147
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,180
Chubby Su,

148
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,550
I'm hungry.

149
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,790
I'll make you breakfast.

150
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,080
Okay.

151
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,860
This time,

152
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,220
I really have to thank Chubby Su.

153
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,250
If she hasn't hurt

154
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,010
my waist,

155
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,110
I really don't know

156
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,450
how to get away from the blind date

157
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,610
my mom arranged for me.

158
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,650
Maybe you should go to the hospital

159
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,220
to see a doctor.

160
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,750
No need.

161
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,910
I'm almost recovered.

162
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,580
I'll just lie down for two more days.

163
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,880
What do you want this time?

164
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,600
You know.

165
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,320
How's the new maid?

166
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,320
She's better than anyone else before.

167
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,360
She cooks well

168
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,180
and works hard.

169
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,730
Chubby Su, where's my tea?

170
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,540
Boss, why are you becoming so bad?

171
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,860
All right, I'm hanging up.

172
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,030
Boss, your tea.

173
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,550
You even give me a small paper umbrella.

174
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,400
You're teasing me again.

175
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,560
You got hurt

176
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,410
for me,

177
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,900
so I'll forgive you.

178
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,440
Put it over there.

179
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,480
Put some sunscream on me.

180
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,940
Be careful, Boss.

181
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,190
Boss, your arm.

182
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,990
When are you going on the blind date?

183
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,200
My waist injury is a bit serious this time.

184
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,250
I don't think I can go.

185
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,010
You don't like the Faroe Islands?

186
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,220
That place is not bad.

187
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,840
I'll think about it.

188
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,770
I'll reply to you tonight.

189
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,760
Bye.

190
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,640
Faroe.

191
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,580
Liar!

192
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,700
It turns out you're just fine.

193
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,390
I did so much

194
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,390
following your orders.

195
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,530
I'll teach you a lesson.

196
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,120
Well,

197
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,340
our boss is such a catch

198
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,630
that he can get whatever kind of girlfriend,

199
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
but in the end he gets a fatty.

200
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:44,920
What do you know?

201
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,080
You won't understand

202
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,100
the taste of rich people.

203
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,320
You're right.

204
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,150
You're quite idle.

205
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,750
-Miss Chubby. -Miss Chubby.

206
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,960
No, no, no.

207
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,200
We were not talking about you.

208
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,600
Right?

209
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,750
Chubby Su, I need to go to the toilet.

210
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,270
If you're free,

211
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,060
do me a favor.

212
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,090
-Boss. -I can't hold it anymore.

213
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,850
We're coming.

214
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,770
Come on. I'll be on this side.

215
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:21,880
What are you doing?

216
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Get up. Be careful with your waist.

217
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,100
Get up.

218
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,540
Let's go. Hurry.

219
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,740
What are you doing?

220
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,680
Come on.

221
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,670
Unzip it.

222
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:29,640
Let me do it.

223
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,200
Let me.

224
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,560
Let me.

225
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,330
Let me.

226
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:31,740
No need.

227
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,070
Boss, let me do it.

228
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,940
No, no, no.

229
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,650
-I said I'll do it. -Get lost.

230
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,240
Get lost.

231
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,410
Don't let me see you again.

232
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,500
You're quite nimble.

233
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,740
I'm recovered.

234
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,880
It's a medical miracle.

235
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,170
A medical miracle?

236
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,380
So,

237
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,310
you pretended to be hurt

238
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,250
to avoid going on the blind date?

239
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,430
Marriages between family businesses

240
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,040
are just to maximize the interests.

241
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,100
Love is just an appendage.

242
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,770
Will you marry someone you don't love

243
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,960
for the family business?

244
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,000
Of course not.

245
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,880
A marriage without love

246
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,320
is like a pile of sand.

247
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,040
Even without the wind blowing,

248
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,410
it'll fall apart by itself very quickly.

249
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:34,860
Right.

250
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,210
Being with someone

251
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:37,950
you don't love

252
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,340
would be so miserable.

253
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,520
Do you love Yu Mengmeng?

254
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,400
Of course.

255
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,480
Hello.

256
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm Yu Mengmeng.

257
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,590
I didn't expect you to be so loyal.

258
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,850
If you like her so much,

259
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,860
why don't you go after her?

260
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,440
How can a goddess

261
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,560
get into a relationship so easily?

262
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,720
How can you laugh at me?

263
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,829
You are behaving like a fan yourself.

264
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,400
When I first met her,

265
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,550
I was moved by her smile.

266
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,660
I'm the most loyal to Mengmeng.

267
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,450
Except for the Faroe Islands

268
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,330
and the 24-hour artificial sunlight

269
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,090
on the islands.

270
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,280
What?

271
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,380
Let's go.

272
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,870
Go on a blind date with me.

273
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,820
You just said you were loyal.

274
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,720
A blind date does not mean I'm getting married.

275
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:41,640
Let's go.

276
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,500
I'm not going.

277
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,070
If I go, I'd be a dog.

278
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,780
[Woof woof]

279
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,580
Boss.

280
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,380
Why do you come to the company for a blind date?

281
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,020
Isn't the blind date about business?

282
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,900
If we are talking business,

283
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,160
of course we need to come to the company.

284
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,230
How can you bring a maid to talk business?

285
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,400
Accompanying the boss to talk business

286
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,470
is also part of your work.

287
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,140
You're deceiving me again.

288
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,350
If you don't believe me,

289
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,690
take a good look at your contract.

290
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,050
It is specified in Article 56.

291
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,570
That contract of yours

292
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,200
is as thick as the law code.

293
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,090
How could I

294
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,270
remember every single article?

295
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,920
Anyway, I'm a nobody.

296
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,560
I'll just do whatever you say.

297
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,550
Look at you, being so lack of confidence.

298
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,890
I just want to show you the world.

299
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,150
If you do well,

300
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,350
I'll let you be my personal assistant.

301
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,600
You don't want to

302
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,750
be a maid forever, do you?

303
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,380
Boss.

304
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:41,890
Boss.

305
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,210
Morning, boss.

306
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,670
Morning.

307
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,720
Boss.

308
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:48,390
Boss.

309
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:48,960
Boss.

310
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:49,820
Morning.

311
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,300
Hello, Miss Tong.

312
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,710
What took you so long?

313
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,040
Wu!

314
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,230
Oh, no! I have to run!

315
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,860
It's not too late now.

316
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,340
Have a seat.

317
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,120
Chubby Su.

318
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,410
Don't look at me. Don't look at me.

319
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,290
Introduce yourself.

320
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,410
It's not like we haven't met before.

321
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,420
Stop pretending.

322
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,030
So they know each other.

323
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,180
Have we met?

324
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,330
[Sweet Girls]

325
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Why am I in the photo too?

326
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,520
Is she...

327
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,130
your maid?

328
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,960
She's my assistant.

329
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
I just think

330
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,730
she looks familiar.

331
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,920
She looks like a friend of mine.
