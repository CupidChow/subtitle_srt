5
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,210
This is Mrs. Jiang's last day

6
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,430
in China.

7
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,120
I found out

8
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,950
that she liked this spa hotel the most.

9
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,229
It's now or never.

10
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,259
It's your time to shine.

11
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,259
I can't believe people actually enjoy spas.

12
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,590
It's full of germs.

13
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,220
Boss.

14
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,710
Can I ask for a half-day off

15
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,000
later when we finish?

16
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,530
You're going on a date?

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,360
You know me so well.

18
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,910
What brings you here?

19
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,380
Su, let's go.

20
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,260
Come with me for a big thing.

21
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,079
What big thing?

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,770
Chi Ye lied to me.

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,880
He told me he was going on a business trip.

24
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:30,970
But in fact,

25
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,070
he never left the city.

26
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,350
How did you know?

27
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,250
From the GPS on his phone.

28
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,030
How dare him!

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,130
If I find out

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,610
he ever did something

31
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,950
that might hurt me,

32
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,090
I'll burn him into ashes today.

33
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,690
Don't jump to conclusion.

34
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,040
Maybe it's about work.

35
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,340
If it's about work,

36
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,100
why did he lie to me?

37
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,280
Do you know

38
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,190
where is his location?

39
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,820
His location is

40
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,260
at a spa hotel.

41
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,090
How about

42
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,790
I call Huangfu Jue

43
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,750
and ask him about it?

44
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,320
No.

45
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,420
They are

46
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,220
best friends.

47
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,920
He won't tell the truth.

48
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,130
No way.

49
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,140
Huangfu Jue never lies.

50
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,370
You can't judge a book by its cover.

51
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,020
Until today,

52
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,829
I thought Chi Ye

53
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,630
would never lie to me.

54
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,500
In the end?

55
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,840
Today, I'll find out

56
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,650
who the tramp is.

57
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,130
Let's go.

58
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,550
I haven't changed yet.

59
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,900
Can you wait for me to change first?

60
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,270
Mrs. Jiang.

61
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,450
Hello.

62
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,780
Do we know each other?

63
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,510
I'm Huangfu Jue.

64
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,070
Do you have time for a quick chat?

65
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:52,900
Have a seat.

66
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:53,510
Thank you.

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,200
I know you've been looking for me.

68
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,590
Let's cut to the chase.

69
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,360
What do you want?

70
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,920
Since you are so straightforward,

71
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,010
I won't beat around the bush.

72
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,190
I'm here

73
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,460
for Tang Su.

74
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,240
If you're for her,

75
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,770
there's nothing to say.

76
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,910
I got something else to do.

77
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,570
Goodbye.

78
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,120
Mrs. Jiang.

79
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,700
I wonder if you are interested in

80
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,410
taking a look at this photo.

81
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,500
What do you want?

82
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,890
Hello.

83
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,350
Hello.

84
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,260
May I ask

85
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,110
if a guest named Chi Ye

86
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,590
stays here?

87
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,500
The Chi in pond.

88
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,830
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,909
We can't disclose

90
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,050
any of our guests' information.

91
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,820
Then could you

92
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,760
tell me

93
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
how many rooms are there

94
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,430
in this place?

95
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,670
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,360
I can't disclose that either.

97
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,800
Miss.

98
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,909
Please.

99
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,659
Please.

100
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,490
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,620
I really can't tell you.

102
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,270
Su.

103
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,820
Here.

104
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,860
Listen.

105
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,910
Let's split up later.

106
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,460
I'll start looking from the left.

107
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,390
You start from the right.

108
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,600
If anything happens,

109
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,220
let's keep in touch through our phones.

[Spa Hotel]

112
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,210
Damn it! Chi Ye!

113
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,460
Where did he go?

114
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,330
Oh my god.

115
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,870
Where did he go?

116
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,930
I've been looking for him for so long.

117
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,980
-Chi... -You must have been looking for me.

118
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,650
I'm in room 8888.

119
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,650
I compared

120
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,650
the reporters' photos.

121
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,650
I found that

122
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,130
you and Tang Su wore similar outfits

123
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,870
that day.

124
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,409
So,

125
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,680
I checked the surveillance video

126
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,680
of you entering the hotel.

127
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,950
Since you've got

128
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,120
the videos and photos,

129
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,659
why won't you just reveal them?

130
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,490
Why did you come up to me?

131
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,170
The reporters could use

132
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,440
a fake video to spill the tea.

133
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,420
Any evidence that I provide now

134
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,870
can be assumed as fabrication.

135
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,909
So I want you to stand up

136
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,420
and clarify the situation.

137
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,730
That's impossible.

138
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,750
Since I chose to remain silent,

139
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,040
I won't say anything now.

140
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,760
I know you have your reasons,

141
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,870
but Tang Su is innocent.

142
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,200
She shouldn't and cannot pay

143
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,890
for your mistakes.

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,870
I saw the news.

145
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,160
She has made a comeback.

146
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,950
The impact of the incident on her

147
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,010
is gradually fading.

148
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,980
The external impact can fade away.

149
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,540
But what about the inner effects?

150
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,360
Do you think you can stay out of it

151
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,850
by keep hiding?

152
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,430
Make a condition.

153
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,700
I've told you everything.

154
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,650
Please leave.

155
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,580
I know you came back

156
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,690
for a new project.

157
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,890
Since the incident happened,

158
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,080
you must've also had

159
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,780
a hard time.

160
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,570
If you agree to my terms,

161
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,820
I can help you

162
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,090
with the new project.

163
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,470
This is my sincerity.

164
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,310
Tang Su is an artist of Leo Culture.

165
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,270
If Time Entertainment has the extra money,

166
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,810
why won't you terminate the contract for her?

167
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,700
First come, first served.

168
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,570
If you don't agree to my terms,

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,810
I promise

170
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,230
your directors

171
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,900
will have a rough time in China.

172
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,410
I need some time for the contract.

173
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,540
If possible,

174
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,670
I'll go back and check the details.

175
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,250
Of course.

176
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:33,940
Chubby Su.

177
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,429
Why are you here?

178
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,860
Chi Ye, what's wrong with you?

179
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,919
You told me you had a meeting.

180
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,700
But you came here again.

181
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,340
Follow me.

182
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:44,940
Stop talking.

183
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,280
Let's go.

184
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,870
Turn left.

185
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,330
One, two, one. Stop.

186
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,190
Turn left.

187
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,910
Three, two, one.

188
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,750
Surprise!

189
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,840
I knew you would come to the hotel.

190
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:58,980
All right.

191
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,470
You counter investigated me.

192
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,290
Or else why

193
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,460
did I turn on

194
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,060
the GPS?

195
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,950
No wonder you were acting so mysterious.

196
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,060
So

197
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,160
you prepared a surprise for me.

198
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,850
All right.

199
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,600
I'll reluctantly

200
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,260
forgive you.

201
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,530
By the way, how many

202
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,140
days off did your boss approve?

203
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,580
He's here too.

204
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,660
What is he doing here?

205
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
We finally found

206
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,840
the missing director's wife.

207
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,270
We're here

208
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,390
to ask her to clarify things in person.

209
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,180
That's good news.

210
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,230
Why did you hide it from us?

211
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,610
Boss was planning

212
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,960
to tell Chubby Su about it

213
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,100
after it's settled.

214
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,990
Otherwise, if you knew in advance,

215
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,370
your hope could've been shattered.

216
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,320
Su is not like that.

217
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,500
Oh, no. Something's wrong.

218
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,300
Let's go.

219
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,670
What's wrong?

220
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,610
Su

221
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,880
ran into the director's wife.

222
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,270
Chubby Su, let me explain.

223
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,520
Let go of me!

224
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,250
Chubby Su, listen to me.

225
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,070
What do you want to talk about?

226
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,700
You already have someone else.

227
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,630
Why do you still need me?

228
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,210
Su.

229
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,950
No, I don't.

230
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,630
Su.

231
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,160
Don't go! Don't go!

232
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,670
It's a misunderstanding.

233
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,940
What misunderstanding?

234
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,970
I saw it with my own eyes.

235
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,120
It's really a misunderstanding.

236
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,050
We're here for business.

237
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,000
The lady you saw just now

238
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,980
is our business partner.

239
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,070
Why would you come here for business?

240
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,830
Why won't you discuss in the hot spring?

241
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,790
-Good idea. -Good idea.

242
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,700
Surprise!

243
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,700
Isn't that my line?

244
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,730
Su, look.

245
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,370
Huangfu Jue

246
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,160
prepared this surprise for you.

247
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,200
He's very considerate.

248
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,520
Stop lying.

249
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,340
It says Sugar.

250
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,550
Isn't it your English name?

251
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,180
Sugar.

252
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,110
Sweet.

253
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
It's yours.

254
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,800
Young people are already very busy.

255
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,030
Why would he have time to lie to you?

256
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,020
That's right.

257
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,120
Sweet.

258
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,940
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

259
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,470
I thought...

260
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,420
You didn't give me the chance

261
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,120
to tell you.

262
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:02,910
Well,

263
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,190
we won't disturb

264
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,430
your sweet time.

265
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,750
Boss.

266
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,250
Enjoy.

267
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,310
By the way, there'll be

268
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,420
a special arrangement later.

269
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,920
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,770
I shouldn't have thrown

271
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,140
a tantrum at you.

272
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,020
I didn't expect

273
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,760
you got a surprise for me.

274
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,740
It's okay.

275
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,580
As long as you like it.

276
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,760
What do you think?

277
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,640
Isn't it comfortable

278
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,010
to relax in the spa?

279
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,330
It's great!

280
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,150
Wu.

281
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,660
So this is the special arrangement

282
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,400
that you mentioned?

283
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,050
Isn't it great?

284
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,700
High temperature and humidity foster germs.

285
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,960
Do you know how unhygienic

286
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,820
the pool is?

287
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,150
So Boss,

288
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,520
it's sensible

289
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,100
that you're in a pool by yourself.

290
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,650
Chubby Su.

291
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,350
You have a lot of clothes on.

292
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,630
Don't you feel hot?

293
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,250
Right.

294
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:11,990
Don't you feel hot?

295
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,050
Su.

296
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,480
Why don't you take it off?

297
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,940
I don't feel hot.

298
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,910
I'm fine.

299
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,050
I can lose weight if I sweat.

300
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,430
It's too hot. I must stop.

301
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,540
What a bummer.

302
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,320
Don't mind him.

303
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,830
Let's enjoy.

304
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,890
I think our relationship

305
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,230
is getting a step closer.

306
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:44,900
Why?

307
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,040
Because

308
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,740
I think

309
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,890
you would be jealous because of me.

310
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,680
The sky is so clear.

311
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,310
So many stars.

312
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,380
Do you remember

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,850
♫The Hall of Memories♫

314

because of his goddess, Yu Mengmeng.

because it's far away.

333

♫Only then can you face disappointments♫

347
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,910
The bad things

348

come all at once.

♫Don't be afraid of these annoying things♫

350
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,850
Chubby Su.

351
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,420
You're right in front of me.

352
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,070
♫They are gone with the wind♫

353
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,170
Real.

354

♫When I got close to my previous dream♫

356

It's all true.

357
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,470
I remember

358
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,050
you said the feeling of love

359
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,810
♫I tamed my youthful indiscretion♫

360
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,530
made you worry about someone.

361
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,460
The happiness in a day came from her.

362
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,880
♫Looking back at the silent rainy seasons♫

363
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,570
The sadness in a day

364
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,990
was also caused by her.

365
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,790
When you saw her

366
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,240
with another man,

367
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,390
you couldn't help going crazy and jealous.

368

♫Like daisies bloom secretly by the road♫

369
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,700
You didn't want her to be bullied.

370
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,170
You wanted to protect her wholeheartedly,

371
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,390
and treat her

372
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,500
as your only proprietary property.

373
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,160
That's how I feel right now.

Let's go to bed.

385
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,410
There's only one bed here.

386
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,650
How can we sleep?

387
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,270
Just sleep like this.

388
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,300
Huangfu Jue?

389
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,860
Is this your real purpose?

390
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,670
What kind of person

391
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,330
do you think I am?

392
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,210
This is a big bed.

393
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,330
Do you want me to sleep on the floor?

394
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,690
You have to sleep on the floor today.

395
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,740
You're so cruel.

396
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,470
Let me tell you.

397
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,990
Even if we are in the same bed,

398
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,110
I won't do anything to you.

399
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:18,830
Unless you take the initiative.

400
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,110
Why would I?

401
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,260
Why not?

402
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,710
I'm so handsome.

403
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,850
I'm in good shape.

404
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,210
And I'm a neat freak.

405
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,900
If you want me to sleep on the floor,

406
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:30,560
I can't fall asleep.

407
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,990
Come on.

408
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,030
Come on.

409
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,450
Good night.

410
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,230
Good night.

411
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,990
Why won't you sleep?

412
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,810
How can I fall asleep?

413
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:08,940
Go to sleep.

414
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,730
It's too late.

415
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,460
[Wu]

416
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,450
Ignore it.

417
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,470
What if it's something important?

418
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,240
Who is it in the middle of the night?

419
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,630
Hello, Wu?

420
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,510
What?

421
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,120
Wu!

422
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,510
Where's Mrs. Tong?

423
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,160
She's inside.

424
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,430
Wu!

425
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,430
Your mom's really sick this time.

426
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,540
After you go in,

427
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,890
be nice if you want to say something.

428
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,760
Don't make her angry again.

429
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,580
Okay.

430
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,650
Got it. Got it.

431
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,830
Mrs. Tong.

432
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,400
Mom.

433
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,740
What happened, Mom?

434
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,770
You're finally here.

435
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,460
Mrs. Tong, are you okay?

436
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,690
Jue, you're here too.

437
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,470
Since your friends are here,

438
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,230
I have something to tell you.

439
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,050
Mom, don't scare me.

440
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,720
My condition is getting worse,

441
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,200
but I still have something on my mind.

442
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,440
Mom.

443
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,320
I'm not going on a blind date.

444
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,550
Mom.

445
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,860
Mom, why are you...

446
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,440
Mom.

447
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,770
These

448
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,790
are the men I've carefully selected

449
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,200
for you.

450
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,020
If you still care about your mother

451
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,390
in your heart, take a look carefully.

452
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,430
If one day I'm gone,

453
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,920
I hope

454
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,800
there's someone

455
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,800
who can take good care of you.

456
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,550
But Mom,

457
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,830
I already have someone I like.

458
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,200
Who?

459
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,290
It's him.

460
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,280
His name is Chi Ye.

461
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,760
Hello, auntie.

462
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,830
Are you from the Chi family of Shangqing Group?

463
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:13,870
No.

464
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,380
Then you are...

465
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,690
I'm the executive assistant

466
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,510
of Time Entertainment.

467
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,430
Jue's assistant.

468
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,750
We met each other

469
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,220
on a blind date.

470
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,280
And we're already together.

471
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,110
Are you crazy?

472
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,300
You didn't like a CEO.

473
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,530
You fell for an assistant.

474
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
So you're not ill.

475
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,830
You lied to me.

476
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,080
No wonder

477
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,070
you didn't come home every day.

478
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,130
So you were

479
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,230
with an assistant every day.

480
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,350
What's wrong with an assistant?

481
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,880
Mrs. Tong.

482
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm really

483
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,950
disappointed in you today.

484
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,410
Chi Ye.

485
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,220
Let's go.

486
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,220
Wu.

487
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,450
If you cross this door,

488
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,550
you'll never be my daughter!

489
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,100
Goodbye, Mrs. Tong.

490
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,630
Kids nowadays

491
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,700
couldn't take a joke?

492
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,560
What a waste of time.

493
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,690
What?

494
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,510
Mrs. Tong has gone too far.

495
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,210
Ye,

496
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,700
please don't take it

497
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,610
personally.

498
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,300
It's okay.

499
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,020
I'm fine.

500
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,300
I heard that your mother

501
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,850
had some difficulties in her business recently.

502
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:44,670
My mom

503
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,500
only thinks about money.

504
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,370
Her business got into trouble, so she

505
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,080
wanted to exchange my happiness with it.

506
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,710
Marriage of convenience.

507
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,260
Isn't it

508
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,140
their usual trick?

509
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,630
Otherwise,

510
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,280
we wouldn't have gone on a blind date.

511
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,370
Wu,

512
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,240
what's your plan for now?

513
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,340
She simply won't let me go home.

514
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,570
How about

515
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,940
staying at your place?

516
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,770
You could,

517
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,560
but I worry

518
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,880
that it could escalate

519
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,970
the conflict between you and your mother.

520
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,180
Actually, I'm just a bargaining chip

521
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,870
in my mom's eyes.

522
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,040
Wu,

523
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,320
she's your mother after all.

524
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,090
Fine.

525
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,270
Su,

526
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,240
could you take me in?

527
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,410
Me?

528
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,450
She'd better not.

529
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,680
Did you forget

530
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,060
who disturbed my happy time?

531
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,250
Without me,

532
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,720
how could you have the happy time?

533
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,650
Fine.

534
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,990
You don't have to ask me.

535
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,890
It's up to you.

536
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,370
Su, that's great.

537
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,960
We can live together again.

538
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,350
I suddenly feel like we're back

539
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,740
in the days when we were training.

540
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,780
Let's go.

541
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,730
I'll take you to clean up your room.

542
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,280
Great!

543
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,500
It's okay.

544
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,720
Brother.
