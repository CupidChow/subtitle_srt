I don't think so.

Tang Su's scenes

I also need to remind you

77
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,810
that the advertisers

Let me reiterate.

87

It's not that I am forcing you

89

The conflict between you girls is not important.

92
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,620
What's the most important is your personal career development.

93

Do you understand, ladies?

94
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,550

96

Lu Yanzhi made a statement.

103

But he didn't do it

104
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,550
through the official channel.

105
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,850
He posted it using his own account.

106
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,320
I know that you have many questions

107
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,330
that you want to ask.

108
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,800
I'll take this opportunity

109
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,070
to explain to you.

110
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,300
First,

111
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,480
Tang Su and I never started a relationship before,

112
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,190
so there wouldn't be an end either.

113
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,180
We will be friends

114
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,030
forever.

115
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,950
Also,

116
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,950
I announce

117
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,280
that my love relationship with Yu Mengmeng

118
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,600
is completely over.

119
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,960
We didn't confess to the public before

120
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,880
because we wanted to maintain our respective privacy.

121
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,520
I would like to apologize to all those

122
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,120
who care about us.

123
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,870
Sorry.

124
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,630
He's usually dispirited

125
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,390
but he's unequivocal at the critical moment.

126
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,880
Should we do anything

127
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:37,630
in response to this statement?

128
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,780
Not yet.

129

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,730
Yes.

132

The live stream will start at three o'clock on time.

133

134
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,610
Not bad.

135
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,800
Right?

136
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,780
What are you looking at?

137
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,260
Huangfu Jue asked me to watch a live stream

138
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,010
at three o'clock.

139
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,510
What live stream?

140
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,960
He didn't make it clear.

141
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,970
So secretive.

142
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,840
Let him be secretive on his own.

143
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
We will just focus on our shopping.

144
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,750
Look.

145
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,470
Those two people over there

146
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,770
seem to be celebrities.

147
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,340
Yes.

148
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,210
They seem to be SURAGR GIRL?

149
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,440
Yes…

150
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,460
Su.

151
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,150
Did you hear that?

152
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,360
Celebrities.

153
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,180
After all,

154
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,280
we are quite popular.

155
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,480
That one is Tang Su.

156
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,310
There seems to be quite a few trending topics related to her recently.

157
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,600
The other one…

158
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,070
I can't remember the other one.

159
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,310
What's her name?

160
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,110
She must be a has-been for too long.

161
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,990
I can't call to mind her name.

162

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,500
This bag…

165
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,870
I have a black one at home.

166
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,070
I think I can buy another one that is white.

167
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,909
This one is okay too.

168
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,060
I'll take it.

169
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,190
Let's go, Su.

170
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,770
I'll take all of these.

171
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,300
Okay.

172
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,180
It's quite expensive.

173
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,300
Excuse me.

174
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,450
Do you have another card?

175
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,000
What's going on?

176
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,800
It doesn't work either.

177
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,660
She's really an unpopular celebrity.

178
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,370
She can't even afford the new clothes.

179
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,640
Hello. Please try this one.

180
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,230
Okay.

181
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,020
Sorry.

182
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,720
Use mine.

183
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:47,270
Okay.

184
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,760
Wu!

185
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:53,500
Wu!

186
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,700
Wu.

187
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,630
Wu, are you okay?

188
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,270
Mrs. Tong intentionally

189
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,470
froze my card

190
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,310
just to force me to go back.

191
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,700
Su,

192
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,820
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,670
I'll pay you back later.

194
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,470
How am I going to pay you back?

195
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,060
I have no money to pay you back now.

196
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,700
What are you talking about?

197
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,810
You helped me so much.

198
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,900
Don't treat me as an outsider now.

199
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,140
Alright. Don't think so much about it.

200
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,220
She is your mother,

201
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,180
not your enemy.

202
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,500
Auntie froze your cards

203
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,310
only because she wants you

204
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,770
to go back to her.

205
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,590
She forced you to go on blind dates

206
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,720
but she is not

207
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,549
as snobbish as we thought.

208
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:34,880
Maybe she just wants to find someone

209
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,179
who is reliable

210
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,140
and able to take care of you

211
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,380
so that you can continue your life

212
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,740
as a rich young lady

213
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,000
and don't need to worry about anything.

214
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,960
After all, she loves you,

215
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,970
and she's doing it for your own good.

216
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,780
What you said

217
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,190
seems to make sense.

218
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,460
Let me think about it then.

219
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,620
By the way, what time is it?

220
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,850
I forgot all about the live stream at three.

221
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,870
Hurry up.

222
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,940
Follow me.

223
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,970
Tang Su

224
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,940
could have had a promising future,

225
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,950
but because of me,

226
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,660
she has been misunderstood by everyone for so long.

227
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,300
Today,

228
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,110
I will recount to everyone thoroughly

229
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,410
how the incident

230
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,900
happened on that day.

231
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,580
On the day of the incident,

232
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,150
Tang Su did go to the room of the hotel

233
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,410
where my crew stayed.

234
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,070
But we were only

235
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,140
talking about the script in the room.

236
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,130
After that, she left.

237
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,680
Our talk

238
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,170
didn't last longer than 30 minutes at most.

239
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,880
But someone captured

240
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,110
that you and Tang Su

241
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,350
left the hotel together on the next day.

242
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,570
It wasn't Tang Su who was captured in the photo.

243
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,660
It was her, my wife.

244
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,060
So, this is the live stream

245
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,060
that Huangfu Jue

246
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,060
asked me to watch.

247
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,720
Great!

248
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,400
Here it is finally.

249
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:58,910
Why didn't you

250
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,120
clarify the situation back then?

251
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,220
At that time,

252
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,410
the photo provoked much discussion

253
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,550
after being exposed

254
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,530
and were taken out of context.

255
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,900
For some reason,

256
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,260
we couldn't make our relationship public either.

257
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,760
So,

258
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,180
I'm sorry that I had to be unfair

259
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,010
to Miss Tang Su then.

260
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,400
Wu is immature.

261
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,600
Jue, are you immature too?

262
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,110
Even if it's like what you said,

263
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,960
it was your girlfriend who took her in,

264
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,520
that is not okay either.

265
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,460
Do you know what impact it will make if this gets out?

266
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,010
Auntie,

267
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,150
I understand

268
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,060
what you mean.

269
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,280
Then, you are here today…

270
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,470
I'm here today

271
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,680
to take Wu home.

272
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,020
Mrs. Tong,

273
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,680
whether Wu leaves or stays,

274
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,110
she should follow her own will, right?

275
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,900
This is the affair of the Tong family.

276
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,340
We don't need outsiders to interfere in it.

277
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,100
We are home.

278
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,580
Su, stop watching.

279
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,540
You've been watching it all day.

280
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,220
Stop watching.

281
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,570
I'm excited.

282
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,870
It's been a long time

283
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,390
since I've encountered something so refreshing.

284
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,180
I can finally get my own back.

285
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,220
Do you really think

286
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,300
that you are her boyfriend?

287
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,650
My mom?

288
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,790
You froze my cards, I can let it go.

289
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,670
But you even come here today

290
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,600
to humiliate Chi Ye.

291
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,460
Mrs. Tong, you've gone too far.

292
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:12,830
Wu.

293
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,000
Mrs. Tong?

294
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,210
You are really

295
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,160
getting more and more unruly.

296
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,550
You didn't even call me "Mother"

297
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,520
but you sided with him as soon as you came in.

298
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,590
I am unruly?

299
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,660
You are making a scene in someone's house.

300
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,480
Are you behaving yourself?

301
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:24,940
Go home.

302
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,930
I'm not going back.

303
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,420
I'm not going back.

304
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,530
-I'm not going back. -Auntie.

305
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:29,900
Wu!

306
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:35,790
Wu.

307
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,690
Stop being so willful.

308
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,750
You think you've grown up.

309
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,120
But don't forget,

310
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,370
you are still

311
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,680
under my protection.

312
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,510
Without me…

313
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,000
How are you going to live without me?

314
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,240
Can you make money?

315
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,840
Can you sustain yourself?

316
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,520
Our bossy CEO

317
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,290
is cooking personally today?

318
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,480
There's a happy thing happening

319
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,350
for our superstar today.

320
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,300
Of course I have to help her

321
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,010
with the celebration.

322
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,160
I want to ask you a question.

323
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,740
How did you

324
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,450
find the director?

325
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,190
Don't ask about this.

326
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,880
Just tell me.

327
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,990
The CEO has his own way.

328
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,730
How do I wash this?

329
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,680
Do I need to peel it before washing it?

330
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,690
Or can I just directly wash it?

331
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,480
Come home with me.

332
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,050
Stop being willful.

333
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,870
You are

334
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:39,780
a little flower

335
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,010
in the greenhouse.

336
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,140
You simply can't live on

337
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,220
without others' support.

338
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,870
So, I'm such a good-for-nothing

339
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,660
in your heart.

340
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,490
I'm telling you.

341
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,470
Even if I can't live on,

342
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,810
I won't go home with you.

343
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:00,980
Wu!

344
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,160
Wu!

345
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,360
Wu! Wu!

346
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,420
Calm down, Wu.

347
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,390
Sorry.

348
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,290
Leave me alone.

349
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,420
Wu!

350
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,060
Look at this one.

351
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,600
Fried eggs with persimmons. What do you think?

352
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,960
I can't guarantee anything else,

353
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,100
but at least it's fully cooked for sure.

354
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,860
What's wrong?

355
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,660
I'm grateful

356
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,650
for everything you did for me.

357
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:40,610
But

358
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,620
why did you make everything easier for me

359
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,910
even when it was about my work?

360
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,370
What are you talking about?

361
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,430
You invested in Love and Espionage, right?

362
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,990
It was the producer

363
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,790
who called just now.

364
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,800
Your phone is ringing.

365
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,750
Answer it for me.

366
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,660
Hello?

367
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,850
Hello?

368
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,960
Isn't it normal for me

369
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,580
to invest in a drama series?

370
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,170
So, if I'm suddenly asked

371
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,330
to go back for filming,

372
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,850
or whether I can take leave of absence,

373
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,430
it's all up to you.

374
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,220
If you want to add more scenes for me,

375
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,160
you can just add them.

376
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,430
If you want to change my scenes, you can just change them.

377
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,200
I didn’t.

378
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,610
By the way,

379
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,020
can she ask for leave of absence

380
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,660
during the filming process?

381
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,920
Of course.

382
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,270
When would you like it to be?

383
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,700
I'll tell you when I've made up my mind.

384
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,320
Okay.

385
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,110
The producer

386
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,260
misunderstood me.

387
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,750
Huangfu Jue, you know about me.

388
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,480
I would rather be a benchwarmer

389
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,580
than be considered an eye candy

390
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,850
or a person relying on connections.

391
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,080
All right.

392
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,850
I know.

393
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,330
Let me explain.

394
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,130
Don't explain.

395
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,750
I need to draw up a three-point covenant with you.

396
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,370
First,

397
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,990
don't shadow me.

398
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,110
It was the producer who wanted to…

399
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,590
Second,

400
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,260
don't practice jobbery.

401
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,340
He misunderstood me.

402
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,860
Third,

403
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,360
don't interfere in my work.

404
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,460
I won't agree then.

405
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,440
Why not?

406
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,400
Because I still have your contract.

407
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,940
I'm speechless.

408
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,190
Did I do anything wrong?

409
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,610
Wu.

410
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,250
Why are you here?

411
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,050
Su.

412
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,360
What's wrong?

413
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,970
Why are you crying here?

414
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,500
What happened?

415
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,540
Don't cry.

416
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,950
Did you quarrel

417
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,750
with your mom again?

418
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,230
She…

419
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,640
She often disregards others' feelings,

420
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,560
but…

421
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,610
but I think she was right.

422
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,230
I'm just a parasite.

423
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,860
I became an artist.

424
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,910
I ran away from home.

425
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,710
It was all because

426
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,700
I wanted to prove myself.

427
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,420
But in the end,

428
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,630
I proved

429
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,810
that I'm a good-for-nothing.

430
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,720
No.

431
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,360
No.

432
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,730
Wu.

433
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,270
Do you still remember

434
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,340
what we used to be like

435
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,530
on stage?

436
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,360
At that time,

437
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,770
we were charming

438
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,170
and shining.

439
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,770
We were

440
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,420
never afraid of anything.

441
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,349
Stop it. Let's go back.

442
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,780
Come. Hurry up.

443
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,670
They are already off duty.

444
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,859
Let's go.

445
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,640
Wait for me.

446
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,089
Wu.

447
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,040
This is the most exciting moment

448
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,420
of our award ceremony today.

449
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,460
Next,

450
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,890
let me announce for you

451
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,830
the Best Female Artist—

452
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,810
the visual center of SURAGR GIRL,

453
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,570
Miss Tang Su.

454
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,580
Thank you, Father, Mother,

455
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,870
and my friends,

456
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,090
for supporting and accompanying me.

457
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,690
I made every effort

458
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,920
offstage

459
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,990
to give my best performance onstage.

460
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,860
I know

461
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,400
I'm really not perfect.

462
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,090
I also know

463
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,160
that there might be a lot of regrets.

464
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,540
But I believe,

465
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,770
as long as I stand on tiptoes,

466
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,650
I will definitely

467
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,010
be able to touch the brightest star.

468
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,920
Well said.

469
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,480
That's already in the past.

470
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,240
It's

471
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,540
as ephemeral

472
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,370
as a meteor.

473
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,340
No one will

474
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,130
remember us from the past.

475
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,730
If that's the case,

476
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,400
I would really be the one who is a good-for-nothing.

477
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,700
Su,

478
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,030
how can you say that about yourself?

479
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,750
You are the best

480
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,050
in my heart.

481
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,250
What's wrong?

482
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,430
I have always thought

483
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,640
that I earned everything I have now

484
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,200
through my own efforts.

485
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,920
But actually, I found that every step I took

486
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,380
wouldn't have been possible

487
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,550
without the help of Huangfu Jue.

488
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,270
So I tried my best

489
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,610
to prove myself.

490
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,170
But I still found

491
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,830
that I can't do anything well

492
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,830
without him.

493
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,600
Can we still go back?

494
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,740
I want to give it a try.

495
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,830
You mean

496
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,050
you want to accept Luo Shi's suggestion?

497
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,210
Maybe

498
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,270
reassembling is the best choice

499
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,280
for us.

500
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,210
Wu, look.

501
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,170
We once fell over there.

502
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,750
Then we need to get up from there.

503
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,790
There shouldn't be only sweat

504
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,970
under the spotlight,

505
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,730
but also our glory.

506
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:33,820
Wu.

507
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,330
Let's say goodbye to the past together.

508
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,930
Next,

509
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,450
let's welcome the award winners.

510
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,050
They will perform their award-winning song,

511
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,350
"Girls' Declaration."

512
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:46,680
Please.

513
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,490
♫No matter how many fairy tales and fables we read, it's not as good as an adventure♫

514
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,700
♫Start a new chapter, it's time to say goodbye to yesterday♫

515
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,480

from your experience of skin whitening?

565
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,560
My usual beauty tips

-are that… -You have that many dark pasts.

567
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,790
Do you think it's appropriate

568
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,670
for you to be here now?

569
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,700
How could you say that?

570

you are right.

I, Tang Su,

575
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,600
do have many dark spots.

576
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,510
The reason why

577
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm qualified to be here today

578
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,080
is that I'm dark enough.

579
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,760
That's how we can prove

580
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,550
that this brand new

581
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,290

582
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,580
is remarkably effective.

00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,490
Great.

584
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,390
That's why

585
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,980
I can be so confident

586
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,090
about my dazzling white skin.

587
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:47,930
