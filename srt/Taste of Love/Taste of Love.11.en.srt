Our wise and great boss

8
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,640
surely won't let her be.

9
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,200

Chubby Su,

13
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,700
you came to work

14
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,650
even though you haven't recovered yet.

15
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,490
You are very hard-working.

16
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,340
You look slimmer.

17
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,940
Thank you for your concern.

18
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,530
What?

19
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,340
Make sure to balance between work and rest,

20
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,240
and take care of yourself,

21
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,630
or you'll end up in the hospital again.

22
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,970
It's good to go to the hospital.

23
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,440
It's so quiet there.

24
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,700
No one will misunderstand me.

25
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,810
I will be completely free.

26
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,720
It seems like you want to chat

27
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,630
and gossip with others and eat apples in the hospital,

28
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,090
it would be very quiet and comfortable.

Are you going

32
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,560
Why fish?

33
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,370
You think I'm picky.

34
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,070
Why don't we work out together?

35
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,090
No.

36
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,050
No one can argue like you can.

00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,390
Alright, guys.

really cares about you.

What are you talking about?

47
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,750
I have to thank him then

48
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,860
for saving me

49
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,780

50

worse for me again.

making things worse.

56
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,850
Yes.

57
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,690
Then I read too much into it.

58
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,650
I won't bother you

59
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,660
or waste

60
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,910
your precious time again.

61
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,540
I must be the one

62
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,560
who read too much into it.

63
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,770
I shouldn't have gone...

64
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,580
Where?

65
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,340

Do you have anything else to say?

If not, the parking lot is on the left.

69
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,520
Okay.

70
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,510
I will be a dog

71
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,430
if I ever care for you again.

72
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,800
Excuse me. Goodbye.

if I ever speak to you again.

00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,050
Take care. I won't send you off.

76

It's really troublesome

77
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,130
when they argue.

78
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,140
I've done enough for her.

79
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,740
She doesn't know what's good or bad for her.

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,190
That fatty.

81

Boss.

82
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,680
She's not fat anymore.

83
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,680
She's a very popular lady.

84
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,230
With her personality, who in their right mind

85
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,650
would be interested in her?

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
Why are you looking at me?

87
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,430
But then again,

88
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,110
Chubby Su

89
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,280
is very upright and innocent.

90
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,470
If we leave her be,

91
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,620
she will surely get bullied.

92
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:33,950
Who would bully her?

93
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,730
This is so annoying.

94
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,090
I can't recite it at all.

95
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,820
It's all because of Huangfu Jue.

96
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,150
Don't be sad.

97
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,980
Although it's a small role,

98
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,470
it's still a new beginning.

Miss Mengmeng.

Let's sit over there.

103
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,070
I think this place is good.

104
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,150
Latte without sugar.

105
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,090
I got it for you.

106
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,120
No, thank you.

107
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,460
I've already bought it.

108
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,790
It's up to you whether you will drink it or not.

109
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,620
I appreciate it.

110
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,110
No need.

111
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,020
Do you still think

112
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,660
you are the old Tang Su?

113
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,400
Who are you to act so arrogantly?

114
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,340
Miss Mengmeng, are you okay?

115
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,360
I'm fine.

116
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,420
Miss Mengmeng,

117
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,650
don't worry.

118
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,430
We've got

119
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,820
your back for sure.

120
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,740
That's right, Miss Mengmeng.

121
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,310
Don't worry.

122
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,030
I'll work until late today.

123
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,860
You must be careful

124
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,380
on your way back to the hotel.

125
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,370
Thank you, Miss Mengmeng.

126
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,530
Hurry up.

127
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,280
You're up to no good.

How dare you bully our Chubby Su!

129

Chubby Su?

130

Pervert!

131

Chubby Su, it's me!

132
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,270
My phone!

133
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,750
Stop! Stop!

134
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:03,840
Take it.

135
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,380
All the information is inside.

136
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,580
Take it and go now.

137
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:07,700
No!

138
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,910
I won't leave without you.

139
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't waste time. Go now!

140
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,940
Hurry up!

141
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,500
Go!

142
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:18,880
Hurry up!

143
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,840
Stop! Stop!

144
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,170
Stop. Stop.

145
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,880
Miss Tang,

146
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,050
you fell down late in this scene.

147
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,860
You should fall down after three gunshots.

148
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,410
Got it?

149
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,950
Sorry, Director.

150
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,220
Let's do it again.

151
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:38,750
Go back.

152
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,060
Get ready.

153
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,070
Be quiet.

154
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,930
Come on.

155
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,750
Get ready. We'll start filming.

156
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,950
Get ready.

157
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,050
Start.

158
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,600
Stop. Stop.

159
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,610
Stop. Stop.

160
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't wave your hands

161
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,530
when you are falling down, okay?

162
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,070
Okay.

163
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,780
Let's do it one more time.

164
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,950
Let's do it one more time.

165
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,610
Go back.

166
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,180
The shot is good.

167
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:04,850
Okay.

168
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,320
Come on, get ready.

169
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,130
Come on.

170
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,850
Don't move.

171
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:12,670
Don't move.

172
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,520
You'll get scolded later.

173
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,300
What are you doing? Don't move.

174
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,650
What have I done so wrong

175
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,630
to come up with such a method?

176
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,420
Start!

177
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,350
Stop.

178
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,370
Stop.

179
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,420
Who is this? You got in the way.

180
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,530
Director, I'm sorry.

181
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,010
I didn't know you started shooting.

182
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,060
Please do it again.

183
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,110
Is that okay, director?

184
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,550
Be more careful.

185
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,030
Come on. Let's do it again.

186
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,780
Go back.

187
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,640
Let's do it one more time.

188
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,120
Can't you see that someone

189
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,570
is intentionally giving you a hard time?

190
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,930
I...

191
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,990
Hang in there.

192
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,460
I...

193
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,510
Get ready.

194
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,030
We'll start filming.

195
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,980
Get ready.

196
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,190
Start.

197
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:57,930
Okay, stop.

198
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,390
Stop.

199
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,630
Come on. Thank you.

200
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,120
Let's do it one more time.

201
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,070
Start.

202
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,260
Director Liu.

203
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,260
Superstar Lu.

204
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,030
Come, have a seat.

205
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,000
Director Liu, thank you.

206
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,420
I got milk tea for everyone.

207
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,570
Thank you.

208
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,290
Superstar Lu is treating everyone to milk tea.

209
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,110
Take a beak, everyone.

210
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,940
Thank you, Superstar Lu

211
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,430
Thank you, Superstar Lu.

212
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,480
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

213
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,220
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

214
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,890
Yanzhi,

215
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,770
you came to see me.

216
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,710
Will my presence bother you?

217
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,050
Of course not.

218
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,500
That's good then.

219
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,730
Alright. Come on.

220
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,700
Let's get ready for the next scene.

221
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,420
Let's change the scene.

222
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,400
Get up. Come on.

223
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,420
Get up. Come on.

224
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,570
Where are you going?

225
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,020
Come here.

226
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,580
No.

227
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,700
Stand still.

228
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,870
Let's change the scene later.

229
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,030
Let's do it on this street.

230
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,090
Where are you

231
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:18,820
going now?

232
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,780
-No, I’m not an extra. -What do you mean by that?

233
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,240
Stop talking nonsense.

234
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,630
Stand still.

235
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,690
What is wrong with you?

236
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,180
It's better that they

237
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,920
lie there later.

238
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,760
You get ready first.

239
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,580
I'll come back later.

240
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,190
They will

241
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,980
lie there later.

242
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,750
It will be the same as this scene, okay?

243
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,170
Come on.

244
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,920
Back to your places. Lie down.

245
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,800
Lie down.

246
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,830
-Hurry. Lie down. -I…

247
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,810
Stop talking nonsense.

248
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,420
Hurry.

249
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,300
Press him down.

250
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,110
You just got discharged from the hospital.

251
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,100
Do you have to work so hard?

252
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,000
It seems like you are avoiding me.

253
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,300
I just think

254
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,480
that this is really inappropriate.

255
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,250
I'm very grateful

256
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,300
for everything you have done for me in the past,

257
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,970
including the time

258
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
when you pretended to be a volunteer to help me.

259
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,170
Volunteer?

260
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,020
Me?

261
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,730
There's no need

262
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,950
to hide it anymore.

263
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,650
No.

264
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,200
What volunteer?

265
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,280
Don't you really know

266
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,100
what I'm talking about?

267
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,490
Someone

268
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,370
went to the hospital today.

269
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,260
Impossible.

270
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,890
I haven't seen him for so many days.

271
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,840
With his personality,

272
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:56,960
if I had really come across him,

273
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,350
I would have punched him again.

274
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,380
No wonder

275
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,590
he was so angry today.

276
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,720
Oh no!

277
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,410
I wrongly blamed Huangfu Jue!

278
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,440
Huangfu Jue again?

279
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,770
I can be with you

280
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,550
like him.

281
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,040
Thank you,

282
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:12,860
but I don't need it.

283
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,400
We're just friends.

284
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,670
Just friends?

285
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,200
You know that I love you.

286
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,850
But I don't love you anymore.

287
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,870
In the future,

288
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,570
let's not see each other too often.

289
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,520
Was this meal

290
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,530
cooked this morning?

291
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,340
Yes.

292
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,560
Thank you.

293
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,240
Miss Su.

294
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,240
Director.

295
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,150
You've really

296
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,100
impressed me.

297
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,040
You've really impressed me!

298
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,290
You're really exceptional

299
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,250
and very talented.

300
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,760
Let me ask you.

301
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,170
Are you dating

302
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,040
the CEO of Time Entertainment?

303
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,560
No, don't talk nonsense.

304
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,600
What are you doing?

305
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,120
Extras eat over there.

306
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,860
[Craft services for the set of Love and Espionage]

307
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:02,970
I saw him

308
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,440
on the set today.

309
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,069
Very interesting.

310
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,560
A top CEO was unexpectedly

311
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,140
among the extras.

312
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,290
Others may not recognize him,

313
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,060
but

314
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,490
he cannot escape my sharp eyes.

315
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,440
My second aunt's sister-in-law,

316
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,420
the daughter-in-law of the younger brother...

317
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:17,960
Wait!

318
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,599
What did you say?

319
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,730
Stop pretending.

320
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,400
He was wearing a costume

321
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,589
and lying among the dead people.

322
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,510
But he looked a bit strange

323
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,240
while he was walking.

324
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,350
He kept holding his leg.

325
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,090
Pervert!

326
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,630
Oh no!

327
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,230
I kicked him.

328
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,150
Not only did I misunderstand him,

329
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,120
but I also kicked him.

330
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,950
I have done terrible things.

331
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,030
I keep making mistakes.

332
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,120
What should I do?

333
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,810
Miss Su.

334
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,600
Director Li.

335
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,080
Where is he now?

336
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,390
How would I know?

337
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,170
It's all over.

338
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,240
The extras left.

339
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,530
Li.

340
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,660
Come and eat.

341
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,710
Let Miss Tang have a good rest.

342
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,050
Okay.

343
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,320
Take a look at these people.

344
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,600
Where are you?

345
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,250
I was wrong, I'm sorry.

346
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,940

♫Is it tacit understanding or trust?♫

373

But at that time,

385

I couldn't see it.

386
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,950
You can't blame me.
