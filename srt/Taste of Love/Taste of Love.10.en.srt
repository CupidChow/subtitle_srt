00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,830
When we meet again,

173
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,200
we'll start over.

174
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,580
OK!

175
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,410
Chubby Su.

176
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,820
About the question you mentioned last night...

177
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,560
I know you like apples.

178
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,650
Do you prefer a hard one

179
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,490
or a soft one?

180
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,010
Anything is fine.

181
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,440
Actually,

182
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,760
I knew

183
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,760
you are Huang Yousu.

184
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,330
Whatever the Huang Yousu is,

185
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,000
the most important thing for you now

186
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,110
is to get well soon.

187
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,470
Nothing else matters.

188
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,220
Thank you

189
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,170
for taking care of me these days.

190
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,320
Don't be so polite.

191
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,020
But there's something

192
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,300
that I want to tell you.

193
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,660
We are just friends.

194
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,890
I have no right

195
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,800
or reason

196
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,560
to accept your help.

197
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,220
So I will

198
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,210
repay the favor.

199
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,410
Alright.

200
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,910
Let's not talk about this.

201
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,250
Eat the apple.

202
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,360
Thank you.

203
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,760
♫Do you believe it?♫

204
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,140
♫We spend our whole life just for our meeting♫

205
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,480
No matter how much I've done for you,

206
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,520
is  Lu Yanzhi

207
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,290
♫No matter how many scenes change♫

208
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,580
the first person that comes to mind?

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,960
♫No matter we are sad or happy♫

210
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,790
Do you like her?

211
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,740
♫No matter we have quarrels or peace♫

212
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,770
Yes.

213
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,850
Does she like you?

214
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,680
♫The simplest plots♫

215
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,210
♫The most memorable experience♫

216
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,450
Of course.

217

♫Don't be childish♫

218
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,690
♫It's time to make peace with the past♫

219
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,840
♫Even if we end up breaking up♫

220
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,360
How do you feel?

221
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,820
Have a try.

222
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,530
Can you see clearly?

223
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,910
I knew he wouldn't come.

224
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,610
Okay.

225
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,110
Don't get your eyes wet.

226
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,740
Get some rest.

227
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,720
Thank you, doctor.

228
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,220
You're welcome.

229
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,930
Why are you still here?

230
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,850
You'll be discharged today,

231
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,060
someone needs to be here.

232
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,270
They removed my gauze,

233
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,590
so I can handle it myself,

234
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,140
and take care of myself.

235
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,310
Okay.

236
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,690
Let's just get through today.

237
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,860
I'll take you home.

238
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,380
Let's go.

239
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,180
How do you feel? Are you feeling better?

240
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,540
Why should I

241
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,670
do as you say?

242
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,100
It's very simple.

243
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:37,920
First,

244
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,710
you need to win back

245
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,000
your reputation and popularity.

246
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,380
Second,

247
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,500
it's safer to keep your enemy close

248
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,030
than away.

249
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,070
Finally,

250
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,130
do you want to keep Lu Yanzhi?

251
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:58,980
Tell me.

252
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,040
What do you want me to do?

253
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:10,990
Chi Ye.

254
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,460
Can you drive faster?

255
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,620
It's too late.

256
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,220
We have to follow the traffic rules,

257
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,680
even if we're in a rush.

258
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,910
What time is it now?

259
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,580
You are telling me to obey the traffic rules.

260
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,710
Forget it.

261
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,940
You are unreliable.

262
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,300
I'm not counting on you, I'll do it myself.

263
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,520
Hello, madam.

264
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,290
Yes, yes, yes.

265
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm Miss Tang's friend.

266
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,650
What! Lu...

267
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,970
What?

268
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,220
What's going on?

269
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,080
Just leave me here.

270
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,510
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

271
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,180
I'll walk you home.

272
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,030
It's okay.

273
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,080
I can do it myself.

274
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,140
You just got out of the hospital.

275
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,580
Let me walk you home.

276
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,610
No need, I can do it.

277
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:04,990
Su.

278
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,880
I've recovered, and I'm really fine.

279
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,430
Let me walk you home.

280
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,230
I can do it myself.

281
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,660
Let me do it.

282
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,260
I will take care of her,

283
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,380
so there's no need to bother you.

284
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:18,660
Well...

285
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,070
Su, I'm sorry.

286
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,240
I'm late for picking you up.

287
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,410
It's okay.

288
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,960
Then...take care.

289
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,830
I'm leaving.

290
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,230
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

291
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,950
Lu Yanzhi

292
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,460
has been taking care of you for a couple of days.

293
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,730
Is he up to something?

294
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,440
Is he

295
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,380
up to no good?

296
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,460
I think

297
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,270
you need to ignore him

298
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,040
even if he has good intentions.

299
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,600
He's breaking up

300
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,560
with his girlfriend

301
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,840
while he's eager

302
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,840
to please you.

303
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,810
He is a scumbag.

304
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,490
Can you stop nagging me about him?

305
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,610
At least he took care of me.

306
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,470
Unlike someone.

307
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,550
Someone

308
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,490
went to the hospital today.

309
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,359
No wonder

310
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,680
he was so angry today.

311
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,740
Did he meet Lu Yanzhi

312
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,609
in the hospital?

313
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,839
Impossible.

314
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,900
I haven't seen him for many days.

315
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,869
If he had met him,

316
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,950
he would have punched him

317
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,290
based on his personality.

318
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,450
Then what?

319
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,340
Are you not going to see him?

320
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,010
[Chi Ye]

321
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,720
Hello?

322
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,550
Are you interested

323
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,740
in Yu Mengmeng?

324
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,580
Spit it out!

325
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,070
Mengmeng announced that

326
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,710
she will call a press conference about apology.

327
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,440
What?

328
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,980
Someone is making trouble again.

329
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,410
She wants to call a press conference

330
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,510
and make a public apology to you.

331
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,380
And she wants you to be there.

332
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,130
The longest day has an end.

333
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,470
Do you think

334
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,570
that she will truly apologize to you?

335
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,690
Will she clarify the rumors

336
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,470
she spread about you?

337
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,740
Do you believe it?

338
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,170
Su.

339
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,660
What do you think?

340
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,730
I think...

341
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,500
If we're here, we will know

342
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,470
what she wants to do.

343
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,030
Good idea, Su.

344
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,900
You're indeed our captain.

345
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,990
Let's see

346
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,770
what Yu Mengmeng is up to.

347
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,090
I won't

348
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,130
be her cannon fodder this time.

349
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,950
I want to apologize

350
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,340
for my suicide.

351
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,050
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

352
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,980
From the allergy incident

353
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,850
to now,

354
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,910
I have suffered a lot of

355
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,290
malicious speculations and criticism.

356
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,940
But these

357
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,040
are not the reasons

358
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,320
for hurting myself.

359
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,270
Her acting skills have improved a lot.

360
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,060
If I didn't know

361
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,200
what happened,

362
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,440
I would trust her.

363
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,460
She is now

364
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,530
a perfect victim.

365
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,950
But she didn't mention a word

366
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,330
about the one

367
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,870
who was really hurt by this matter.

368
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,980
I'm waiting for her to mention me.

369
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,630
If she dares to

370
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,680
start another rumor about me,

371
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,070
I will confront her in person.

372
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,560
Tang Su has disappeared for so long.

373
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,300
But she stole your boyfriend as soon as she showed up.

374
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,470
Does it

375
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,340
hit you hard?

376
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,780
It has nothing to do with them.

377
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,280
Yanzhi is a very devoted person.

378
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,520
We

379
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,880
have the perfect relationship.

380
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,540
Then why do you

381
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,460
want Tang Su to be here today?

382
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,270
Please answer.

383
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,660
Please answer.

384
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,600
Please answer.

385
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,270
Because I want

386
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,470
to tell her that I'm sorry

387
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,970
in person.

388
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,110
Unfortunately,

389
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,660
she didn't come.

390
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,940
Su.

391
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,530
Although you didn't come,

392
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,860
I still want to say

393
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,700
that I'm sorry.

394
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,160
I've always

395
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,370
taken you as my closest friend.

396
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,790
I hope we can

397
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,590
keep the most precious

398
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,680
teammate relationship.

399
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,820
I can't stand it anymore.

400
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,900
So disgusting.

401
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,260
Let's leave.

402
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:01,930
Su.

403
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,680
You came.

404
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,120
Su.

405
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm so happy

406
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,390
to see you here.

407
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,790
It is Su!

408
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,460
Su.

409
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,210
Su.

410
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,450
Did you hear

411
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,470
what I just said?

412
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,500
Can you forgive me?

413
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,790
Take the picture! take it! take it!

414
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,650
[After flirting with the CEO of Time Entertainment at a cocktail party, now Tang Su is back]

415
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,650
[Huangfu Jue and her former teammate Yu Mengmeng]

416
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,540
Do you remember this place?

417
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,760
Of course we do.

418
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,270
Yes.

419
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,370
This is our starting point.

420
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,140
Unfortunately,

421
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,900
we split up

422
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,570
right after we started.

423
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,880
Stop reminiscing.

424
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,670
Just tell us what you want.

425
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,090
Do you want to regroup Sweet Girls?

426
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,800
Do you think

427
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,500
I need you to regroup

428
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,550
with my current status and popularity?

429
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,810
I want to tell you,

430
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,530
it's the end of

431
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,670
your acting career.

432
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,520
Let's see where we started.

433
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,510
Do you still want to come back?

434
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,510
Wait.

435
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,790
Yu Mengmeng, what do you mean?

436
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,030
Yu Mengmeng.

437
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,750
I've never thought about

438
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,650
competing with you

439
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,550
from the very beginning.

440
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,040
Back then, everything I had

441
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,170
was made by myself,

442
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,690
step by step.

443
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,860
I have never wanted

444
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,470
your position.

445
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,180
But this time,

446
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,820
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

447
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,190
Since you are so afraid of me.

448
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:48,880
Let me tell you.

449
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,410
This time,

450
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,510
I won't back down again.

451
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,730
So, Yu Mengmeng.

452
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,450
You stand here

453
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,960
and see

454
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,340
how we take back

455
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,260
everything we lost?

456
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,720
Yu Mengmeng

457
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,780
has reacted so quickly.

458
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:12,970
Take Tang Su down with her,

459
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,170
and face this together.

460
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,220
Even if she can't clear herself,

461
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,870
Tang Su will be getting lambasted with her.

462
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,630
Yu Mengmeng couldn't be

463
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,030
the one who came up with this idea.

464
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,680
If I'm not mistaken,

465
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,050
it should be Luo Shi who is behind her.

466
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,270
Whether the two artists

467
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,430
are innocent or vilified,

468
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,030
Leo Culture will gain

469
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,380
all the data and clout.

470
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,910
It's his style.

471
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,240
Boss,  are you...

472
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,850
Are you really going to give up on Tang Su?

473
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,800
If

474
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,460
Tang Su comes back to find Luo Shi again,

475
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,920
can you just ignore it?

476
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,620
How could

477
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,150
someone be so stupid?

478
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,130
Mr Luo.

479
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,370
Mr Luo!

480
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,740
Please give me another chance.

481
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,190
I can let you come back,

482
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,880
but you have to understand that

483
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,160
our company won't give you the job opportunities

484
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,390
like before.

485
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,230
I understand.

486
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,540
I'm willing to start over.
