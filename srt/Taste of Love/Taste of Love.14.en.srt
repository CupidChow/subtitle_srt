Why did I fall asleep?

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,850
you had a fever

11
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,150
as soon as you got to the hospital last night.

12
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,560
You have a fever of 39 degrees Celsius.

You and Huangfu Jue

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,850
I thought something had happened to you.

29
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,329
I won't let go!

Alright.

can you stop making me

34
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,480
a regular at the hospital?

35
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,510
I can't take it anymore.

36
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Let me formally introduce you.

37
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,280
This is

38
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,040
the boss lady

39
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,200
of Time Entertainment from now on.

40
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,930
What！

41
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,600
But...

42
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,600
Chi Ye, Wu.

43
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,790
Thank you so much for this.

44
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:03,680
Boss,

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,240
the person you should thank the most

46
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,100
is Lu Yanzhi.

47
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,800
He carried you

48
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,900
to the emergency room.

49
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,310
He carried me?

50
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,820
Where is he?

51
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,810
I'm sorry, Su.

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,200
I've been meaning to apologize

53
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,740
for my previous silence.

54
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,250
But now, you have someone to protect you.

55
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,180
I think I need to

56
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,250
be out of your life,

57
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,159
and your memories gradually.

58
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,150
You deserve better.

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,640
How have I gained so much weight

60
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,430
in just a few days?

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,650
No way, no way.

62
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,840
I can't eat anymore!

63
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,450
Troublemakers!

64
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,250
You're all troublemakers!

65
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,600
Coming!

66
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,890
Uncle, why are you here?

67
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,060
There're a few days left

68
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,950
to pay the rent.

69
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,320
I was just passing by.

70
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,850
So I don't need to come

71
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,120
next time.

72
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,320
Okay.

73
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,650
I have the money ready too.

74
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,740
Please wait a moment.

75
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:41,960
The amount is not right.

76
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,350
It's not enough?

77
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,120
No, It's too much.

78
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,080
Yes.

79
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,930
Since I have money now,

80
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,280
I'll pay you the rent for the next year.

81
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,960
You don't have to go all the way here.

82
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,900
Mr Luo.

83
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,780
I'm not going to the art festival.

84
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,600
It's so degrading.

85
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,750
Besides,

86
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,580
you need to

87
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,300
ask for my opinion

88
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,040
before you made the decision.

89
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,140
Did you ask for my permission

90
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,160
before you came?

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,410
Sorry.

92
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,750
I was too hasty.

93
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,470
You are the No. 1 female artist of the company.

94
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,520
You are so bad at controlling your emotions.

95
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,940
Have you forgotten who you are?

96
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,280
You just said who I am.

97
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,340
Then why did you want me

98
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,270
to attend that?

99
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,570
I'm not going.

100
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,940
Mengmeng.

101
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,950
The name is Art Town,

102
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,840
but it doesn't mean

103
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,560
the festival is very low.

104
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:38,850
Let me tell you.

105
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,440
Artists in all industries will

106
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,950
come this time.

107
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,470
The aim is to let all kinds of artists

108
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,550
have a chance to communicate.

109
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:45,780
At the same time,

110
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,780
it also provides the public

111
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,130
an easy environment to join.

112
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,420
The aim is to let art

113
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,360
come into life.

114
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,470
I want you to attend,

115
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,250
because I want you

116
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,250
to improve your cultivation of art,

117
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,330
and gain popularity at the same time.

118
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,990
All my decisions

119
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,420
are for your sake.

120
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,050
The performances in a town

121
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,460
can't be so good.

122
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,990
And you asked me

123
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,080
to be on the stage with Tang Su.

124
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,060
You knew

125
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,850
we are enemies.

126
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,910
Why did you do that?

127
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,870
Haven't you two

128
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,210
reconciled?

129
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,350
I listened to you

130
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,130
to smooth over the public image.

131
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,820
As you can see,

132
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,620
My popularity and reputation

133
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,560
have gone back.

134
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,500
There's no need

135
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,740
to do unnecessary things.

136
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,610
whether it's unnecessary,

137
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,680
it's not up to you.

343
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,359
♫When I got close to my previous dream♫

344
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:26,190
♫I tamed my youthful indiscretion♫

345
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,130
♫Looking back at the silent♫

346
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,350
♫rainy seasons♫

347
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,650
♫Like daisies bloom secretly♫

348
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,600
♫by the road♫

349
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,490
One more song!

350
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,540
One more!

351
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,280
-One more! -One more!

352
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,010
One more time!

353
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,740
-One more time! -One more time!

354
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,790
One more time!

355
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,010
You must be proud.

356
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,330
You embarrassed me.

357
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,200
Are you happy about it?

358
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,740
I'm not as bored as you.

359
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:13,730
Yu Mengmeng,

360
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,300
I advise you not to do bad things.

361
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,230
You'll get what you deserve.

362
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,360
Get what I deserve?

363
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,460
How old are you? Are you daydreaming?

364
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,390
Do you think you can win

365
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,360
since you landed Huangfu Jue?

366
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,310
Let me tell you.

367
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,420
Mud and ants

368
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,530
can only live underground

369
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,810
and be trampled forever.

370
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,940
Land him.

371
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,220
You're really pathetic.

372
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,780
You will never understand

373
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,720
the meaning

374
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,870
of hard work and dream to someone.

375
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,170
Stand on that stage

376
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,550
and be expected by others.

377
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,600
You will never understand

378
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,710
how lucky

379
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,680
and wonderful the things are.

380
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,240
You have all these things.

381
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,440
But you just don't cherish them.

382
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,020
You don't have to tell me so much.

383
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,720
I'll take away everything you care about.

384
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,140
Whatever you like,

385
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,620
or the one who likes you.

386
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,550
Su.

387
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,590
What are you doing?

388
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,850
Don't hit me!

389
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,250
Su.

390
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,390
-What are you doing? Get up. -Su.

391
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,880
I didn't do those things.

392
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,680
Don't hit me!

393
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,280
Yu Mengmeng!

394
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,310
Get up, what are you doing?

395
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,090
Su, you misunderstood me.

396
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,340
I didn't do those things.

397
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,230
Su, I'm sorry.

398
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,220
Mengmeng.

399
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,870
Yanzhi.

400
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,860
Talk some sense into her.

401
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,050
She hit me

402
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,770
when she was unhappy just now.

403
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,530
Again?

404
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,260
Why did you do this?

405
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,410
What are you talking about?

406
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,580
-It's definitely Su... -Enough!

407
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
I heard everything

408
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,430
about your conversation,

409
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,580
including everything you did before.

410
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,200
Do you have anything

411
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,990
to say?

412
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,840
Or

413
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,250
do you want to smear me again?

414
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,190
Nothing to say?

415
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:02,950
Let's go.

416
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:05,980
In that case,

417
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,060
I don't have to pretend anymore.

418
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,430
Back then,

419
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,830
you hated her for being tough

420
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,390
and liked me for being weak

421
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,810
in front of you.

422
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,040
I just

423
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,130
turned into the way you like,

424
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,840
based on your preference.

425
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,850
Now you

426
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,180
question me

427
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,030
as a victim.

428
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,600
Don't you think you're too selfish?

429
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,930
It's ridiculous.

430
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,160
Forget it.

431
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,950
Su is here!

432
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,690
Su!

433
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,770
Su, please sign for us.

434
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,630
Look at the camera, okay?

435
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,140
Yes, please sign for us.

436
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:44,920
Thank you, thank you.

437
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,670
Thank you all.

438
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,210
You are so beautiful.

439
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,210
Chubby Su.

440
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,100
I told you not to come.

441
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,320
I came after it was over.

442
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:05,850
It doesn't count.

443
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,580
Lu Yanzhi and I...

444
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,280
No need to explain.

445
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,340
I just miss you.

446
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,890
Miss Tang.

447
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,680
Uncle.

448
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,830
I have already paid you

449
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,050
the rent earlier.

450
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,770
That's not what I meant.

451
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,370
I'm really sorry, Miss Tang.

452
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,270
I sold this house

453
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,720
because of some personal reasons.

454
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,900
So I'm afraid

455
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,900
that you need to find a new place.

456
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,080
But don't worry.

457
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,880
I'll return the rent

458
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,840
and deposit.

459
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,960
You suddenly inform me.

460
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,870
I can't find a new place

461
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,200
in such a short time.

462
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,040
I know it's hard for you.

463
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,720
But I had some difficulties.

464
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,510
And take the penalty

465
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,980
as my compensation.

466
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,860
No, Uncle.

467
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,190
It's not about money.

468
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,710
The point is...

469
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,300
Uncle, don't worry.

470
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,590
We'll move soon.

471
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,470
I heard that

472
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,840
you have a house to rent in this neighborhood.

473
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,270
Yes, what?

474
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,290
Can you sublet it to me?

475
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,390
No way.

476
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,250
Besides, the tenant won't agree.

477
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,300
How about this?

478
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,130
Will you sell it?

479
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,840
I can buy it.

480
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,040
Not to mention this.

481
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,360
I've already received the rent

482
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,430
for a year.

483
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,440
Do you want me to breach the contract unilaterally?

484
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,950
Don't reject it so quickly.

485
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,070
The market price is not high

486
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,410
in such an old neighborhood.

487
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,970
Would you like to take a look at this first

488
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,320
before making a decision?

489
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,150
[House Trading Contract]

490
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:55,900
So straightforward.

491
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:57,640
Miss Tang,

492
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,520
your boyfriend is really nice.

493
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,460
I'll get going then.

494
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,050
Goodbye, uncle.

495
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:01,650
Bye.

496
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,540
Where should I move to?

497
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,310
My house.

498
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:11,980
No.

499
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,650
It's our house.

500
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,470
It's your first day here.

501
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,690
I'll cook for you.

502
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,030
And you help me cook.

503
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,100
Really?

504
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,010
I need

505
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,150
two tomatoes,

506
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,220
two eggs,

507
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,750
and a bottle of ketchup.

508
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,570
Can you say it all at once?

509
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,690
ketchup.

510
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,030
Put it down.

511
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,570
You're good.

512
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,410
Let me do it.

513
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,630
Okay.
