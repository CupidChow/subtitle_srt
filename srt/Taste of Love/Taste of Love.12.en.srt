Are you playing with fire?

78

You can tell me off.

79

85
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,310
You have already overcome yourself.

86
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,340
It's just that we came to the hospital

87
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,370
even more often than

88
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,990
we went to the company these days.

89
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,590
It seems that she woke up.

90
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,680
You are talking too much.

91
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,340
Let's talk outside.

92
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,160
Are you sleepy?

93
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,640
No.

94
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't force yourself to stay awake.

95
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,110
Go back first.

96
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,340
I'll take care of Chubby Su.

97
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,320
Don't you have anything to do in the company?

98
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:43,700
Besides,

99
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:46,280
I have to take care of her myself.

100
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,010
How can I let others do it for me?

101
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,350
Your hand is injured.

102
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,500
It's not convenient for you.

103
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,480
At least more convenient than it is for you.

104
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,120
So sensible.

105
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,230
I'm really not used to it.

106
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,420
Boss,

107
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,170
we found them.

108
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,030
Su.

109
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,080
It was our fault yesterday.

110
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,240
You are kind and generous.

111
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,610
Please don't mind.

112
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,180
Yes.

113
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,590
Please forgive us.

114
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,830
This drama series is very important to us.

115
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,470
Is this your apology?

116
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:25,810
So far, I haven't

117
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,130
heard a single "sorry" yet.

118
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,250
Sorry, Su.

119
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,670
-Sorry. -We'll never dare to do it again, Su.

120
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,930
We really know that we were wrong.

121
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,190
If you dare to do this

122
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,070
to Tang Su again,

123
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,450
it won't be as simple as making an apology.

124
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,700
Okay…

125
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,580
Let's go.

126
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,330
-Have a good rest. -Rest well.

127
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,620
What happened to your hand?

128
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,159
Nothing.

129
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,810
It's just a scratch.

130
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,909
Did you feel great just now?

131
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,980
Have you given vent to your anger?

132
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,790
Not bad.

133
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,820
So, their roles

134
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,100
in this drama series…

135
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,510
Of course we'll need to replace them.

136
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,110
Then, wouldn't it

137
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,790
waste the production costs?

138
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,100
Don't plead on their behalf.

139
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,700
I'm not pleading on their behalf.

140
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,390
It's just

141
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,850
that conflict is inevitable at work.

142
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,070
If you have to fire all those

143
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,950
who have a little conflict with me,

144
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,440
will we still be able to film?

145
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,340
Wu.

146
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,110
Which room is Su in?

147
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,490
I brought her some soup.

148
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,140
They are having a sweet time inside.

149
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,780
Sit down.

150
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,490
What happened?

151
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,870
Why is she hospitalized

152
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,090
for no reason?

153
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,740
Someone was deliberately causing trouble.

154
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,730
Who was it?

155
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,040
I suspect it was Yu Mengmeng.

156
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,150
Why her again?

157
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,040
Take this.

158
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,230
I'm going to find her.

159
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,660
Get out! Huangfu Jue!

160
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,950
You are talking nonsense!

161
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,960
How is that possible?

162
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,760
What did you do to Su?

163
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,600
It's common sense that you need

164
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,640
to be mindful of the patient's feelings.

165
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,950
Don't you even understand that?

166
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,900
Quickly go

167
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,940
and see your bestie.

168
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,960
Is she out of her mind due to the fever?

169
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,650
I don't want to talk to you.

170
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,150
What's wrong again?

171
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,100
None of your business.

172
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,870
Come on, tell me

173
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,660
what's wrong.

174
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,740
It's so hard to eat a piece of fruit.

175
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,120
Be content.

176
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,050
I have never

177
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,860
peeled an apple for others.

178
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,200
Are you feeling hot?

179
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,080
You are blushing.

180
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,730
Really?

181
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,070
What's wrong with this hospital?

182
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,430
Why isn't the air conditioning on?

183
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,030
I have thought over

184
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,720
what happened yesterday.

185
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,300
I agree.

186
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,370
Agree to what?

187
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,680
Don't get me wrong.

188
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,520
I'm not the casual type of person.

189
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,980
I have to consider carefully

190
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,240
before I make any decisions.

191
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,030
Based on

192
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,890
what you did to me yesterday,

193
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,490
I accept it.

194
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,460
Hold on a second…

195
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,910
Plus, I need to be responsible too.

196
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,500
Wait.

197
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,820
What are you talking about?

198
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,150
Didn't you fall in love with me?

199
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,560
I agreed to let you

200
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,470
be my girlfriend.

201
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,890
I…

202
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,180
Fell in love with you?

203
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,590
Be your girlfriend?

204
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,760
Who said that?

205
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,340
We have already kissed each other.

206
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,690
You still don't admit it?

207
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,380
Kissed?

208
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,460
I…

209
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,380
I had a fever yesterday.

210
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,240
I don't remember anything.

211
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,460
You clearly kissed me yesterday.

212
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,290
Are you trying to deny it?

213
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,980
Oh, I knew!

214
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,920
It must be you who wanted to take advantage of me

215
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,760
while I was sick.

216
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,370
How could you do that?

217
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,710
Do you recall it now?

218
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,220
That's how we kissed.

219
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,760
Huangfu Jue, get away!

220
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,140
You… You are talking nonsense!

221
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,540
It was definitely not so!

222
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,150
What's wrong with you?

223
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,690
Get out, get out, get out!

224
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,400
That's it?

225
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,390
That's all?

226
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,340
What else do you want to hear?

227
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,500
Su, I didn't expect

228
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,750
that you also

229
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,750
have such a passionate and unrestrained aspect.

230
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,130
Wu.

231
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,800
I must have lost my mind due to the fever.

232
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,480
Otherwise, how could it be possible?

233
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,900
Who says it's impossible?

234
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,190
Who says that girls can't take the initiative

235
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,970
when falling in love?

236
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,690
Anyway,

237
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,940
your wish has been fulfilled.

238
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,770
Who would establish a relationship

239
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,950
in such an overbearing and unreasonable way?

240
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,070
And he never said

241
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,650
that he likes me.

242
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,480
He's just a beginner in love relationships.

243
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,170
Ignore him.

244
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,350
Just love with confidence and boldness.

245
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,230
But…

246
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,220
I'm afraid.

247
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,480
What are you afraid of?

248
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,820
If he dares to bully you,

249
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,590
I will teach him a lesson.

250
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,690
Not that.

251
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,880
I'm afraid that I will hurt him.

252
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,570
I'm afraid that my current situation

253
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,150
would bring him trouble.

254
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,830
Besides, there is such a big gap

255
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,850
between the two of us.

256
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,830
Alright, Su.

257
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,650
Don't

258
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,490
meet trouble halfway.

259
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,380
Even the worm

260
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,410
can turn one day.

261
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,340
Even if you bring him trouble,

262
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,780
no big deal, make him a worm too.

263
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,960
Isn't it also quite good to be two worms?

264
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,980
Honestly,

265
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,910
if you are serious

266
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,130
about this relationship,

267
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,580
I think you should show a bit more sincerity

268
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,850
when you express yourself.

269
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,660
Sincerity?

270
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,650
You know it yourself.

271
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,830
Sometimes, the way you speak

272
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,180
can easily lead to misunderstandings.

273
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,150
You have a sharp tongue.

274
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,120
Your words fail to convey the meaning.

275
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,530
You speak in a particularly mean manner…

276
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,250
You finally got the chance

277
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,000
to criticize me.

278
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,590
What I mean is,

279
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,800
you could actually

280
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,890
be more straightforward

281
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,390
and make it clearer.

282
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,660
Don't be ambiguous all the time.

283
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,050
In fact, Chubby Su is a good girl.

284
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,130
She is worth the effort you put into her.

285
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,310
The female lead of three drama series.

286
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,360
And a popular variety show.

287
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,440
And the endorsement of fashion brands.

288
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,760
Am I getting promoted to the A-list?

289
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:52,870
Are you touched?

290
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,340
Very touched.

291
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,750
But I don't need it.

292
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,290
Thank you.

293
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,720
Don't be in a hurry to reject it.

294
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,760
You didn't get these job opportunities

295
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,130
because of our personal relationship.

296
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,550
It's because I think

297
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,780
that you deserve a better stage.

298
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,500
But I don't want to rely on others.

299
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,760
It is right to rely on yourself.

300
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,070
But this contract

301
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,030
doesn't mean that you can just stay at home

302
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,740
without doing anything.

303
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,720
Instead, it's a better platform

304
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,620
that I provide to you,

305
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,560
where you can showcase your talents.

306
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,280
There is not only a problem

307
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,890
with Leo's planning for you,

308
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,300
but they also get you involved

309
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,220
in the endless internal strife.

310
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,880
I think joining Time

311
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,420
would be a better choice for you.

312
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,540
So, are you advising me to sit idle and enjoy the fruits of others' work

313
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,060
or to shrink back from difficulties?

314
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,910
In one's career,

315
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,420
if there are companions who fight side by side,

316
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,080
then there will be rivals who compete against each other.

317
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,690
Whether it's a blow or an ordeal,

318
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,980
I will have to go through them

319
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,050
on my own.

320
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,190
No one can help me.

321
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,100
But how can my girlfriend

322
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,470
be aggrieved outside?

323
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,630
I won't agree.

324
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,040
Who is your girlfriend?

325
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,270
Not to mention signing you to Time,

326
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,690
even if I'm asked to announce to the public now

327
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,700
that you are the boss lady of Time,

328
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,360
I wouldn't mind.

329
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,670
I'm warning you.

330
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,780
Don't do anything stupid.

331
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,530
I'm not.

332
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,160
I…

333
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,510
I know you are very capable

334
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,100
and you have a lot of resources.

335
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,300
Yes, you can help me

336
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,890
save a lot of time at work

337
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,440
and help me avoid making detours.

338
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,330
-That's true. -But…

339
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,870
I just don't want to rely on you

340
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,700
to take the shortcut.

341
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,710
Because love is not business.

342
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,990
You have said it yourself too.

343
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,740
If you really want to help me,

344
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,500
you should respect my choice.

345
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,990
Let me realize my own values

346
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,310
by myself.

347
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,780
Only then

348
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,890
can I face everything openly,

349
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,430
right?

350
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,360
Got it.

351
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,010
My dear.

352
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,680
Congratulations on your discharge from hospital!

353
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,750
I just had a fever.

354
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,970
Earlier, there was the contract.

355
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,940
And now, there are flowers.

356
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,310
Not only these,

357
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,310
but also Wang.

358
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,790
Hello, Miss Tang.

359
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:09,940
Please get in the car.

360
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,710
He will be your driver from now on.

361
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,069
My driver?

362
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,660
This will make it more convenient for you

363
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,960
to come and go around when I'm not available.

364
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,250
I've also

365
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,220
got an RV for you

366
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,790
so that you can take a rest

367
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,650
when you feel tired on set.

368
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,510
Do you think it's appropriate for me

369
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,200
to have an RV and a driver?

370
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,680
Yes, it is.

371
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:28,850
I don't think

372
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,920
this is interfering in your work.

373
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,190
Wang.

374
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,720
Miss Tang, please get in.

375
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,040
Let's go.

376
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,660
Bye-bye.

377
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,900
I know that he is doing it for my good.

378
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,110
But

379
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,730
wouldn't it be a bit too conspicuous

380
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,640
if I take a driver and an RV to the set?

381
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,990
So,

382
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,290
I made a random excuse

383
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,220
and asked the driver to send me back first.

384
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,790
I think it's fine.

385
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,510
You are not the only one who does this.

386
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,830
Besides,

387
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,140
don't you have to pay for it yourself?

388
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,360
No one would gossip about you on that.

389
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,880
What is the job responsibility of an actor?

390
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,990
Acting.

391
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,300
Why spending time on ostentation?

392
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,620
Have you seen any senior artists

393
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,610
who put on airs like this?

394
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,930
You have a clear goal and target.

395
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,970
But Miss Tang,

396
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,260
you really don't need to care too much

397
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,380
about what others think.

398
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,510
But it's really a bit hard for me

399
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,040
to accept his way.

400
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,620
Wait a minute.

401
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,290
I need to go open the door.

402
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,140
Hello.

403
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,130
Is this Chubby Su?

404
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,810
Here's your flower bouquet. Please sign for it.

406
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:01,780
Okay.

407
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,380
Thank you.

408
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:03,860
You're welcome.

409
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,360
There's no place to put it.

410
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,460
Hey, Wu!

411
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,650
I'll talk to you later.

412
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,220
Bye-bye.

413
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:19,780
Coming.

415
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,070
It's you again?

416
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,360
Here's your package.

417
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,190

418

-Okay. Be careful. -Thank you.

419
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,830
Miss Tang.

420
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,220
Sir.

421
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,450
Sir.

422
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,010
-Why don't you deliver them all at once? -Come on.

423
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,870
Miss Tang. Here.

424
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,230
Wait… wait a second, Sir.

425
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,030
I'm not Miss Tang.

426
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,150
You probably got the recipient wrong.

427
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,390
Don't joke with me, Miss Tang.

428
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,100
Please take a look.

429
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,780
Where should I

430
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,320
put this appliance?

431
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,880
No, Sir.

432
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,640
I'm really not Miss Tang.

433
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,940
Could you please check

434
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,960
if there's someone called Miss Tang next door?

435
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,780
Huangfu Jue.

436
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,250
Why did you

437
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,290
send so many things to my house?

438
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,850
I don't need these at all.

439
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,720
Don't buy or send anymore to my house.

440
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,500
I lack for nothing.

441
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,910
You just acted on your own

442
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,740
and arranged everything

443
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,920
even without asking me.

444
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,990
You are so willful.

445
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,730
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

446
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,000
-How come it's you? -How come it's you?

447
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,870
I come here to play basketball every week.

448
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,010
Why are you here?

449
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
I came for a walk

450
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,500
and saw the basketball court

451
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,580
so I came in to stroll around.

452
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,820
Is your arm okay?

453
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,870
Do you need to go to the hospital?

454
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,990
I was just hit by a basketball.

455
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,780
There's no need to go to the hospital.

456
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,560
Otherwise, I'm really making a fuss.

457
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,140
I'm fine.

458
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,580
Alright.

459
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,990
Are you out alone

460
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,080
because you are in a bad mood?

461
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,310
Or is there something wrong?

462
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,070
No.

463
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,010
I just came out for a walk.

464
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,470
It's time for me to go back.

465
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,420
Su.

466
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,720
I have something to tell you.

467
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,020
What is it?

468
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,230
Actually, there is one thing

469
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,510
that I have never had the courage

470
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,720
nor have I had the chance to tell you.

471
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,110
But every time I think of you,

472
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,350
I feel guilty from my heart.

473
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,440
And this feeling

474
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,110
is becoming stronger and stronger lately.

475
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,480
So I decided

476
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,130
to confess to you.

477
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,120
Hello, Miss Tang.

478
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,630
Could you please

479
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,530
give us an interview?

480
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,190
I'm sorry.

481
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,700
It's not convenient for me now.

482
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,510
When did your relationship

483
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,260
with the director start?

484
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,580
I heard that this is not the first time.

485
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,760
No.

486
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,940
That's not true.

487
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:22,750
I heard that you and Lu Yanzhi

488
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,380
are dating.

489
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:23,970
How did Lu Yanzhi react

490
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,950
after knowing your relationship

491
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,790
with the director?

492
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,390
No.

493
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,310
These are all groundless rumors.

494
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,380
I'm not in a relationship.

495
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,040
Don't

496
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,040
believe the rumors out there.

497
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,190
They are all false.

498
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,590
Why don't you believe me

499
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,430
-but believe those rumors instead? -Though I also have always believed

500
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,500
that there must be some misunderstanding about this matter,

501
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,000
I still didn't dare to step forward

502
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,820
to speak for you.

503
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,020
I don't know what was wrong with me

504
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,750
at that time,

505
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,840
but I actually chose to keep my nose clean.

506
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,500
But afterwards,

507
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,710
I have been particularly regretful all the time.

508
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,700
I had also been looking for you

509
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,750
during the time you disappeared.

510
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,110
I just

511
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,930
want to apologize to you.

512
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,350
I'm sorry, Su.

513
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,300
It's been so long.

514
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,430
It doesn't matter.

515
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,280
Will you forgive me then?

516
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,320
Actually,

517
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,200
I never blamed you.

518
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,150
Thank you.

519
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:21,650
All right.

520
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:22,820
It's not dark yet.

521
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,780
I also got home safely.

522
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,040
Hurry and go back now.

Okay.

Bye-bye.

525
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:28,910
Su.

526
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,380
Do you want to eat something together?

527
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,640
It's going to rain soon.

528
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,830
Go back now.

529
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:38,920
Bye.

530
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,270
Okay.
