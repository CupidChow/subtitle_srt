I must put them back in order,

175
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,350
or I'll give myself away.

176
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,300
This one fell to the ground.

177
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,740
I can't put it back.

178
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,630
How about...

179
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,830
I-I'm just looking.

180
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,040
I won't eat it.

181
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,510
What a strong smell...

182
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,830
Unbelievable.

183
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,320
Fresh king crab goes well with

184
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,350
mustard.

185
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,440
No.

186
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,040
This is my customer's takeout.

187
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,600
I think your customer who

188
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,950
lives in such a posh place wouldn't eat it.

189
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,580
You're right.

190
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,350
It's a pity to throw it away.

191
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,240
I can eat it if he won't.

192
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,320
That's right. Just eat it.

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,480
No!

194
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,150
This is against professional ethics.

195
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,500
But I haven't eaten

196
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,930
for a day.

197
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,760
Are you really not going to eat it?

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,470
It will be very delicious.

199
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,280
[Satisfied]

200
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,660
How is it?

201
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,780
Is it good?

202
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,330
It is.

203
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,920
You ate your customer's sushi.

204
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,010
You should run away right now!

205
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,110
But...

206
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,260
I ate his takeout.

207
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,860
I have to pay for it.

208
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,010
How can I pay him?

209
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,070
[Scream]

210
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,370
What am I thinking?

211
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,000
How many things did you steal?

212
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,420
Your belly looks big.

213
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,250
Take your clothes off.

214
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,760
Take them off.

215
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,040
You pervert!

216
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,560
Take them out.

217
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,810
Stealing?

218
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,230
I didn't!

219
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,690
I'll repeat it.

220
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,560
Take out what you

221
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,340
hide in your belly,

222
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,590
or I'll call the police.

223
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,820
You misunderstood me.

224
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,910
I'm here for your takeout.

225
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,350
The one who spilled it on the way?

226
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,480
Where is my takeout?

227
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,450
I accidentally

228
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,350
ate it.

229
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,940
Interesting.

230
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,100
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,220
I-I didn't mean it.

232
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,450
Tell me then.

233
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,590
How can I make it up to you?

234
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,410
I need to think about it.

235
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,430
I'll see what she's up to.

236
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,190
Appetizer, Golden Caviar Salad.

237
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,740
The olive oil in the salad

238
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,740
should come from Provence.

239
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,350
And balsamic vinegar should have been cellared for 12 years.

240
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,800
The main course, Charollais beef.

241
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,850
Make it half-cooked.

242
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,440
Remember, you should heat the plate first.

243
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,480
Lastly, sprinkle some rose sea salt on it.

244
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,050
That's all.

245
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,960
As for the dessert,

246
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,150
it can be simpler.

247
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,980
I'd like

248
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,400
a Vienna Almond Chocolate Cake.

249
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,590
Noodles with Scallion Oil.

250
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,380
And Dessert, Glutinous Rice Dumplings in Osmanthus wine.

251
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,820
I really don't know how to cook

252
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,160
the dishes you said.

253
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,960
Here's your dinner as compensation.

254
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,400
Have a taste.

255
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,980
How terrible they are!

256
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,950
My cooking skill is not bad.

257
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,850
Why don't you try it?

258
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,730
Who would eat these?

259
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,290
I didn't expect this girl

260
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,150
to be so good at cooking.

261
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,700
So-so.

262
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,480
You can leave now.

263
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,330
Then what about the problem that I ate your takeout?

264
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,510
I'll let it go.

265
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,540
Really?

266
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,210
You're a good person.

267
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,950
Thank you.

268
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,440
Well, sorry.

269
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,150
I stained your apron.

270
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,580
I'll wash it before I leave.

271
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,940
She cooks well

272
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,840
and she's pretty diligent.

273
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,620
It's okay.

274
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,680
Just put it in the washing machine.

275
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,500
The laundry room is in the back.

276
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,340
Okay.

277
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,260
These are much better

278
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,000
than steak and sushi.

279
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,610
Gosh.

280
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,730
Doesn't he know how to use the washing machine?

281
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,180
He's not like that kind of guy.

282
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,840
He looks clean in his appearance.

283
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,420
But actually, he's so dirty!

284
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,710
This girl for takeout is nice.

285
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,760
I haven't eaten this much for a long time.

286
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,520
Do you want to throw away the stuff in your pocket?

287
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,640
Pocket?

288
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,730
What is it?

289
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,740
Nothing.

290
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,750
What are you doing?

291
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,310
I'm washing your apron.

292
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,070
There are so many dirty clothes here.

293
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,020
I threw them together

294
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,060
in the washing machine.

295
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,880
She is pretty nice.

296
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:49,920
Thank you.

297
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,220
Since you've washed my clothes,

298
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,850
iron and dry them for me.

299
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,110
Don't push your luck.

300
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,760
I won't let you work for nothing.

301
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:57,760
I'll pay you.

302
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,810
I don't want your money.

303
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,580
I'll throw them into the washing machine,

304
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,220
and then I'll leave.

305
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,560
There are still a few takeouts left.

306
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,250
How much is a takeout?

307
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,660
5 yuan. What's wrong?

308
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,360
5 yuan? That's too little.

309
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,510
I'll pay you 50 yuan per hour.

310
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,450
Help me clean my room

311
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,120
incidentally.

312
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
50?

313
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,240
Really?

314
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,150
Of course.

315
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,230
But...

316
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,250
Washing, drying, ironing

317
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,020
and cleaning.

318
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,760
It'll take at least 2 hours.

319
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,400
100 yuan.

320
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:28,650
Deal.

321
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,410
Mengmeng, why are you wrinkled?

322
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,320
Can everything be ironed?

323
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,870
Yes.

324
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,690
I have an idea.

325
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,810
What's wrong?

326
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,010
You're really a beginner in life.

327
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,090
Iron plastic in the heat.

328
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,020
How could you do that?

329
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,350
You told me that everything could be ironed.

330
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,530
I mean clothes.

331
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,460
You can iron all kinds of clothes.

332
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,360
Gosh! She's Mengmeng!

333
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,770
Will he recognize me?

334
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,200
She is Yu Mengmeng.

335
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,119
Are you her fan?

336
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,869
Calm down. I can't get caught.

337
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Did you finish your work?

338
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,290
It's too dangerous here.

339
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,140
I need to finish this quickly

340
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,900
and run away

341
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,069
to avoid being revealed.

342
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,210
My Mengmeng...

343
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,170
Why is here so dark?

344
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,890
Gosh...

345
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,330
What is this place?

346
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,170
He is a pervert!

347
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,410
He is probably beyond

348
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,090
a fan.

349
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,440
Sure enough, Mengmeng is the type

350
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,510
that men go for.

351
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:10,910
This is...

352
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,610
How?

353
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,140
How dare you come in?

354
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,740
Why is there a bigger one hidden here?

355
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,320
What does this mean?

356
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,470
Can't you tell?

357
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,520
She...

358
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,940
Did she offend you?

359
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,470
Offend?

360
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,930
Sorry.

361
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,440
Sorry.

362
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,150
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,420
Sorry.

364
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,140
I'll get you a new one.

365
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,060
Sorry.

366
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,530
I'm here for an interview for a weight loss ad.

367
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,380
I'm very nervous,

368
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,560
and I always want to eat something when I'm nervous.

369
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,690
I'll get you a new one.

370
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:17,490
This ad?

371
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,990
[Weight Loss]

372
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,520
Your appearance is not suitable. You can leave now.

373
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,580
Why?

374
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:23,930
You will be suitable

375
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,520
when you gain weight to 75 kilos.

376
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,150
How could I be that fat?

377
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,490
She is sloppy and reckless.

378
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,560
She would do anything to become famous.

379
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,770
That's why I hate her.

380
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,260
Am I so fat

381
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,270
that even those who hate me

382
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,390
can't recognize me at all?

383
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,660
But...

384
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,270
It has nothing to do with you.

385
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:56,920
Yes.

386
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,490
I ironed your clothes.

387
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,330
I'm leaving.

388
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,060
I have yet to pay you.

389
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,180
I don't want it.

390
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,970
Take it as compensation for your takeout.
