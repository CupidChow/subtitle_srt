Exactly.

That's too much.

12
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,880
I recognize that Jue

00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,870
was ill-considered.

00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,090
But back then,

he found Time

00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,000
to try his abilities.

he did a great job.

to Huangfu Group.

as the successor of our group.

Yes.

31

join hands to find CEO

I think she disappeared.

147
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,890
Disappeared?

148
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,410
From the very beginning,

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,840
it was she who acted to deceive others.

150
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,280
Now there is a scandal,

151
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,590
but she doesn't even dare face it.

152
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,090
It doesn't matter.

153
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,600
Even if the scandal is cleared up,

154
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,520
they won't let me

155
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,450
return to Huangfu Group.

156
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,430
This issue involves

157
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,430
too many interests.

158
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,310
Actually, they've long wanted

159
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,170
to kick me out.

160
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,840
That news

161
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,340
was just a trigger.

162
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,860
Why are you looking at me like that?

163
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:39,830
Let's eat together.

164
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,790
This is delicious.

165
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,230
A-Are you really okay?

166
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,780
You're so carefree that

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,190
it makes me a little scared.

168
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,000
I feel relaxed after I was relieved.

I'm full.

170

to be a loser.

172

But...

173

Stop thinking about it.

174
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,710
It's good now.

175
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,240
I can sleep after eating.

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,580
How about your negotiation

177
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,370
with Luo Shi?

178
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,710
I terminated my contract with him.

179
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,310
You don't know

180
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,920
how terrible his expression was

181
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,570
when I threw

182
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,250
my contract at him.

183
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,310
I regret.

184
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,530
I should have asked someone

185
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,190
to take a photo of his face.

186
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,590
He made such disgusting news.

187
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,460
Did Luo Shi

188
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,510
make up that news?

189
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,680
Wasn't it Yu Mengmeng?

190
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,700
I guessed it.

191
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,900
But think about it.

192
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,310
If Yu Mengmeng

193
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,410
schemed it,

194
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,920
she must have jumped out

195
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,800
to gain the public's sympathy.

196
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,460
How could she disappear?

197
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,070
You're right.

198
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:26,980
That makes sense.

199
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,500
Let's take a look at this.

200
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,620
One of each kind.

201
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,730
Won't we...

202
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,160
buy...

203
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,110
too much?

204
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,530
Really?

205
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,830
[So Many]

206
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,500
I prepared all of these

207
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,540
for Su and Huangfu Jue.

208
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,590
As you know,

209
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,570
their current situation is special.

210
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,530
It must be inconvenient for them

211
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,330
to go out shopping.

212
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,700
It's good to prepare more.

213
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,210
Just in case.

214
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,510
Ye,

215
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,780
although you've resigned,

216
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,000
he is your former boss.

217
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,300
Don't be so petty.

218
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,540
Am I petty?

219
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,240
I'm thinking about

220
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,030
how you carry these things

221
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,550
to their home

222
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,420
tomorrow morning.

223
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,240
Aren't you coming with me?

224
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,460
Actually,

225
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,360
I want to tell you this today.

226
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,740
I've received

227
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,420
an offer.

228
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,180
I'm out of this place

229
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,980
tomorrow morning.

230
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,610
So suddenly?

231
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,660
Then...

232
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,570
What about me?

233
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,270
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,260
I should have told you earlier.

235
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,590
But I promise

236
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,710
I will return immediately

237
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,690
after finishing my important work.

238
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,890
I see.

239
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,020
You want to work hard first.

240
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,590
In that way,

241
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,640
my family will accept you,

242
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,210
right?

243
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,180
Ye,

244
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,530
you are so nice.

245
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,780
I love you because you're

246
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,090
handsome and ambitious.

247
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,450
You're so nice.

248
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,460
Su.

249
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,350
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,150
I'm not taking any business shooting lately.

251
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,430
Keep in touch.

252
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,340
Thank you.

253
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,150
What's wrong?

254
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,720
Who is it?

255
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,640
There's a business shoot.

256
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,760
Why don't you agree?

257
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,080
Go! Go!

258
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,160
What is this?

259
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,540
Don't blame him.

260
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,110
He was greatly shocked.

261
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,590
I also lost my job.

262
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,790
-You should have been like this earlier. -You're different.

263
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,840
You don't want to

264
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,150
associate with Leo.

265
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:50,630
Go! Just go!

266
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,850
Now his career is suspended,

267
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:52,930
and he even lost the

268
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,230
right of succession of Huangfu Group.

269
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,670
So what?

270
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,710
You can't stop working

271
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,740
just because of him.

272
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,930
His is in a bad mood.

273
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,500
I can't leave him alone

274
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,420
and go to work.

275
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,820
You're wrong.

276
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,100
His biggest problem is...

277
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,130
Loneliness?

278
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,450
No?

279
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,250
Yes.

280
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,420
It's dispiritedness.

281
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,740
The more he is like this,

282
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,310
the harder you should work.

283
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,190
You should motivate his ambition.

284
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,760
If you stop working

285
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,870
and accompany him like this everyday,

286
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,020
then both of you

287
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,110
will be dispirited.

288
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,240
You're right.

289
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,160
Chubby Su,

290
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,180
go ahead.

291
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,920
I shouldn't let you

292
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,360
become a loser with me.

293
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,860
Look!

294
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,460
He is supporting you.

295
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,750
[Producer Wang]

296
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,730
Hello?

297
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,450
No problem.

298
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,380
Miss Tang will

299
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,570
be on time for the shoot tomorrow.

300
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,670
Okay, thank you.

301
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,420
Bye.

302
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:51,720
Wait.

303
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,330
How could you say yes so quickly?

304
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,660
It's okay, Su.

305
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,340
Consider it as helping me find another job.

306
00:14:59,090 --> 00:14:59,640
I'll be your assistant

307
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,410
when you're working.

308
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:05,610
Cheer up!

309
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,200
There're o many people today.

310
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,790
I predict

311
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,200
they will sclod us severly

312
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,830
in a while.

313
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,410
Are we getting off the car?

314
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,260
You asked me to come.

315
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,030
What's wrong?

316
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,890
Are you scared?

317
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:31,580
Fine.

318
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,770
You can show a poker face to them.

319
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,400
Don't worry about anything after getting off.

320
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,340
Just go straight inside.

321
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,440
If anything happens,

322
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,450
I'll solve it for you.

323
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,790
Even if we are scolded,

324
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,560
we have to be beautiful and cool.

325
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,210
How could I

326
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,180
let you bear it alone?

327
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,570
Let's go together.

328
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,640
OK.

329
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,640
Get ready for running.

330
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,620
Get ready for a poker face.

331
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,540
Three, two, one.

332
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,010
Go.

333
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,100
She's coming!

334
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,940
Su, we love you!

335
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,120
Su, I like you so much!

336
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:05,750
Be strong!

337
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,750
Yes, we trust you.

338
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,270
Take care of yourself.

339
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,880
We all like you.

340
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,920
Cheer up!

341
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,320
Miss Tang, welcome.

342
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,060
This way, please.

343
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,280
Su, don't worry.

344
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,130
[Su, you're the best.]

345
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,150
We will support you forever.

346
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,100
Why is it different

347
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,090
from we expected?

348
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,410
They don't play it by the book!

349
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,520

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,320
You'll miss the flight.

521
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,460
It's okay. The car is at the gate.

522
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,450
See you.

523
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:32,710
By the way.

524
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,090
This is for you.

525
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:39,690
What is this?

526
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,060
Consider it my rent.

527
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,590
I don't want it.

528
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,460
Take it.

529
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:44,940
I don't want it.

530
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,830
Take it.

531
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,500
I don't want it.

532
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:46,970
L'll leave.

533
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,880
Goodbye, Mr. Landlord.

534
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,000
Dear audience,

535
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:00,990
look at me.

536
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,930
I'm outside with such a big antenna

537
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,260
and hot weather.

538
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,170
Give me some gifts, okay?

539
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,530
Small gifts like rockets.

540
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:12,780
Dear audience,

541
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,400
Look, who is he?

542
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,070
Huangfu Jue?

543
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,820
Why are you

544
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,280
eating junk food?

545
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,730
Which one do you prefer,

546
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,310
Tang Su or Yu Mengmeng?

547
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,930
As the owner of an entertainment company,

548
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,540
isn't your life great?

549
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,140
You can be with female artists every day.

550
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,770
Artist.

551
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,640
Get in.

552
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,120
You brat.

553
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,490
You're quite relaxed.

554
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,800
That's impossible.

555
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,860
I'm very busy.

556
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,660
A lot of companies want to hire me.

557
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,290
Have you decided where to go?

558
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,410
No hurry.

559
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,670
There are so many offers to choose from.

560
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,900
I'll take my time.

561
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,540
Are you here to see me?

562
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,370
What's the matter?

563
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,800
I was passing by,

564
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,910
so I dropped by you.

565
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,900
Do you need my help?

566
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,980
You'd better say it

567
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,090
earlier next time.

568
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,030
Where are you going?

569
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,250
I'll give you a ride.

570
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,300
No need.

571
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,510
I have a car.

572
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,800
Playboy.

573
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:13,960
Have some biscuits.

574
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,920
Stop looking at me.

575
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,560
Just cut to the chase.

576
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,820
Do you want to come back?

577
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:28,590
Of course.

578
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:30,880
I can help you.

579
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,490
But on one condition.

580
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,540
What is it?

581
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,890
Break up with Tang Su.
