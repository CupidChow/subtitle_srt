5
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,650
The Huangfu Group

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,620
had significant personnel changes.

7
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,509
The new chairman, Huangfu Jue,

8
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,030
and the new CEO, Chi Ye,

9
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,780
restarted the Blue Sky Project

10
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,170
and spent a large amount of funds

11
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,289
on land restoration.

12
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,380
This move

13
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,610
has restored the investors' confidence.

14
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:57,670
Mom,

15
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,729
you are totally

16
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,800
setting yourself free.

17
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,740
I'm going to

18
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,530
start enjoying my life.

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:04,980
By the way,

20
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,690
your marriage.

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,680
Why are you bringing it up again?

22
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,800
I know what to do.

23
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,250
Don't make me wait too long.

24
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,310
That's it

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,110
for our talk.

26
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,910
Okay.

27
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,910
Have fun.

28
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:16,490
Bye-bye.

29
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,660
Boss!

30
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,030
Are you still worrying about the matter with Tang Su?

31
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,970
It's been so long.

32
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,079
I sent her gifts

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,130
and asked someone to send my words,

34
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,079
but she still ignored me.

35
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,140
I didn't want her to know,

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,280
wasn't it just because I didn't want her to worry?

37
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,920
But she wanted to break up with me.

38
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,050
I won't let her get her own way.

39
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,130
Boss, this is male chauvinism.

40
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,770
I know you are good at Kung Fu.

41
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,250
You punch Superstar Lu

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,320
and kick President Luo.

43
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,920
But on this matter,

44
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,510
you have to calm down.

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,720
Let me give you an example.

46
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,990
What is the word for "have an affair?"

47
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,230
Cheat.

48
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,670
Cheat, right?

49
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,240
It also has another meaning,

50
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,360
which is "to deceive."

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,560
Because women

52
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,680
hate deception the most.

53
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,230
Did I deceive her into having feelings for me?

54
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,680
As long as it's deception,

55
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,640
women will hate it.

56
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,000
The same goes for other things

57
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,030
besides love relationships.

58
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,650
What should I do?

59
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,840
Sis,

60
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,400
it has been a long time

61
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,500
since this matter happened.

62
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,540
Huangfu Jue bought you gifts

63
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,810
and asked me to send his words to you.

64
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,510
You still haven't forgiven him?

65
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,870
He did do something,

66
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,320
but I still

67
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,800
feel wronged from my heart.

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,620
Shouldn't I feel so?

69
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,680
You should, you should.

70
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,860
I think I will look extremely gorgeous

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,680
if I wear this wedding dress.

72
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,740
Wu.

73
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:45,870
Boss,

74
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,150
I have something to tell you.

75
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,300
Are you getting married?

76
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,090
Am I not good to you in general?

77
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,820
Why do you treat me like this?

78
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,790
Apart from being short-tempered,

79
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,850
you are usually quite good.

80
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,240
So I would like to ask you

81
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,140
to be my witness.

82
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,610
What I meant was,

83
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,590
you are getting married while I'm going to break up?

84
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,850
I'm happy when you are sad.

85
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,720
That's not quite appropriate, right?

86
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,470
Of course not.

87
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,640
If you don't help me

88
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,560
settle this matter,

89
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,100
I won't

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,860
be your witness.

91
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,860
This is so unfair.

92
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:24,990
Fine.

93
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,180
If you really want to apologize,

94
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,950
you'll have to do something different this time.

95
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,170
I have a masterstroke.

96
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,210
No matter how big a mistake you made,

97
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,180
it can help you achieve immediate effect.

98
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,030
It's just that…

99
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,110
What?

100
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,700
It's just that you have to make some sacrifice.

101
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,920
Tell me about it.

102
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,960
Actually, I understand what you said.

103
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,300
You don't think Huangfu Jue is sincere enough

104
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,470
in his way of making up for what he did.

105
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,440
I thought

106
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,630
he really went bankrupt.

107
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,700
So I wanted to share weal and woe with him.

108
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,180
-But I didn't expect he… -He has gone too far!

109
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,710
You think so too,

110
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,280
right?

111
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,630
I asked for a Chinese-style cheongsam

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,700
but he actually changed it to a wedding dress.

113
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,980
Wu!

114
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,760
All right.

115
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,800
In the final analysis,

116
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,000
you just don't think

117
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,990
what Huangfu Jue has done

118
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,370
has met your expectation.

119
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,800
How about

120
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,750
I find a way to make him compensate you?

121
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,110
It is best

122
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,940
to take you on vacation to the Faroe Islands

123
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,150
and also

124
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,860
take Ye and me along.

125
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,610
It's not about going on vacation or not.

126
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,680
Back then,

127
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,940
when Chi Ye held back something from you,

128
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,180
weren't you angry too?

129
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,780
Of course I was.

130
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,130
But later,

131
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,170
he coaxed me.

132
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,510
How did he coax you?

133
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,070
He kneeled and proposed on the spot.

134
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,230
Then,

135
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,460
he even bought me a big diamond ring.

136
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,430
If he coaxes me like this,

137
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,480
I will definitely forgive him.

138
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,890
Do you mean the proposal?

139
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,950
Do you think a blockhead like him

140
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,740
will be able to understand?

141
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,130
Su, my takeout order has arrived.

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,680
Would you go downstairs

143
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,500
and get the takeout for me?

144
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:12,950
Sure.

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
What did you order?

146
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,510
Milk tea.

147
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,920
You'll know after you go downstairs.

148
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,190
There's no takeout.

149
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
What is it you want to see me about?

150
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,720
Huangfu Jue! What are you doing?

151
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,960
What are you doing?

152
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,760
Drive.

153
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,750
What are you doing?

154
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,290
Are you trying to kidnap me?

155
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:49,960
Let me get out.

156
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,050
Where are you taking me?

157
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,770
Put me down.

158
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,710
What are you doing? Put me down now!

159
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,950
You have now changed from a bossy CEO

160
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,020
into a despot, huh?

161
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,890
You just kidnapped me in broad daylight?

162
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,830
So secretive.

163
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,620
What do you want to do?

164
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,020
Alright.

165
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,260
Chubby Su.

166
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,960
This

167
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,610
is my apology gift.

168
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,240
Huangfu Jue.

169
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,290
Don't think

170
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,380
that you can make up for your mistakes

171
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,050
with money and jewelry

172
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,740
just because you became the chairman.

173
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,440
It's different this time.

174
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:34,930
Oh my!

175
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,570
Does happiness come so suddenly?

176
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,659
Chubby Su.

177
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,110
I've thought about it.

178
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,540
This blockhead

179
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,540
is finally enlightened.

180
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,500
I'll reluctantly forgive him then.

181
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,800
You want to hand-wash your clothes?

182
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,470
This…

183
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,850
This is an exercise to strengthen the knee joints.

184
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,270
Let me show you.

185
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,230
What about the other one?

186
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,550
I'm afraid that my crown will drop

187
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,500
once I lower my head.

188
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,730
You're not sincere.

189
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,810
Is there anything else?

190
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,429
Chubby Su.

191
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,280
Forgive me.

192
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,330
I'm just a man

194
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,280
I went my own way

195
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,570
and made you worried.

196
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,330
I didn't tell you the truth.

197
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,550
I deceived you, hurt you,

198
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,780
and made you…

199
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,320
Boring.

200
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,550
How can you put a washboard

201
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,920
in the jewelry box?

202
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,600

203
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,070

205
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,160
now I know what I should put

206
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,910
in the jewelry box.

207
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,050

you don't like any of them?

217

Come on. Get another batch.

218
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:50,920
Okay.

219
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,810
So it's on purpose.

220

Yes, it seems so.

Our accessories

228
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,600
need to match formal dresses

229

in order for their beauty to be highlighted.

230
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,040
For example, this one

231
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,450
is particularly a good match for the wedding dress.

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,380
Your hints are so obvious.

240
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,630

not understand?

248
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,920
I've thought about it long ago.

249

Is it unexpected?

Are you touched?

263
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,270
Do you feel a sense of occasion?

and play a dominant role.

302
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,980
The poor male mantises

303
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,570
can only be at their disposal.

304

You really can.

312

I don't even know

313
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,080
how to explain it to Wu.

317
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,160
just say for once that you can do it.

318
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,530
Do you have to hear me say I can?

319
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,980
Huang, marry me.

320
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,620
Yes.

321

Chi Ye,

322
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,410
I felt satisfied with you

323
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,580
at first glance.

324
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
At that time, I already thought

325
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,470
that you would have a bright future.

326
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,450
As expected, today…

327
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,120
That's not what you said back then.

328
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,580
You said

329
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,020
that I wouldn't marry the CEO

330
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,490
but just wanted to marry the assistant.

331
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,150
Wu.

332
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,780
How was that possible?

333
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,230
What I meant was

334
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,080
that a successful CEO must start

335
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,990
as an assistant and work his way up slowly.

336
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,360
Yes…

337
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,300
Without Mrs. Tong's support,

338
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,010
how would I…

339
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,780
You still call me Mrs. Tong?

340
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,330
Mom.

341
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
I wouldn't have come to where I am today

342

without Mom's spur.

to meet a person we love.

426
