take things too seriously.

7
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,650
I always get myself in trouble.

8
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,800
How could I be protected by someone?

9
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,289
Here

10
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,420
is today's entertainment news.

11
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,210
Idol singer Yu Mengmeng

12
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,520
has been rushed to the hospital,

13
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,860
because of an accident during a variety show.

14
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,310
As you can see,

15
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,850
Huangfu Jue, the CEO of Time Entertainment,

16
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,090
escorted Yu Mengmeng to the hospital.

17
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,050
He has been with her

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,910
all the way.

19
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,960
According to reliable information,

20
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,350
this accident

21
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,720
may be related to a food allergy.

22
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,540
The whole incident is a mystery.

23
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,329
-An allergy? -It's said that

24
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,280
this is related to the maid

25
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,620
of Huangfu Jue, the CEO of Time Entertainment.

26
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,340
An allergy again?

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,690
Mengmeng,

28
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,760
I recommended you to the director.

29
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,290
So you gotta impress him later.

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,760
In this way,

31
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,870
we can act together.

32
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,650
Allergy medicine!

33
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,660
Allergy medicine!

34
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,060
Let's go to the hospital.

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,460
Su.

36
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,670
I might not be able to

37
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,400
see the director.

38
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,930
Why don't you go first?

39
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,390
No, I'll take you to the hospital first.

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,790
You just go.

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,130
I don't want to waste your time.

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:00,880
Then...

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,150
Go.

44
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,500
Are you really okay by yourself?

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,180
Yes.

46
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,290
You stay here.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,160
I'll be down soon.

48
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,230
Be careful.

49
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,860
Was Mengmeng behind all this?

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,310
But why did she

51
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,310
do this to me?

52
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,110
I've always treated her

53
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,329
as my close friend.

54
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,390
Have a good rest.

55
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,850
Thank you, nurse.

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,090
We will pay

57
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
for all the treatment fees.

58
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,030
Miss Yu.

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,410
Rest assured to recuperate here.

60
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,060
Rest assured?

61
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,110
Before we came to do the variety show,

62
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,210
we had told you many times

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,390
that Mengmeng is allergic to peanuts.

64
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,670
There should not be any products with peanuts.

65
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,170
How did you arrange it?

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,670
Now...

67
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,730
Mr. Huangfu.

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,140
We're not being unreasonable.

69
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,050
It has already

70
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,279
had a serious effect on Miss Mengmeng.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,440
You must

72
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,350
give us an explanation.

73
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,829
After we find out the truth,

74
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,930
we will give you

75
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,950
a reasonable explanation.

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,870
Why do you investigate?

77
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,310
All the dishes

78
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,660
were made by the chubby assistant.

79
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,730
It must be her.

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,030
I don't think she did it on purpose.

81
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,670
How about apologizing?

82
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,270
Miss Mengmeng,

83
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,409
you are kind,

84
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
but it doesn't mean others are kind too.

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,200
Besides,

86
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,850
this has affected

87
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,190
your health and work.

88
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,450
They must apologize

89
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,200
in front of the media.

90
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,150
Calm down.

91
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,830
I believe Mr. Huangfu

92
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,100
will handle it impartially.

93
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,680
We haven't found out the truth yet.

94
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,330
It's still too early

95
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,770
to say this.

96
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:03,690
Mengmeng,

97
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,280
have a good rest,

98
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,440
we're leaving.

99
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,090
Mr. Huangfu.

100
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,450
If I put you in a difficult position,

101
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,800
it's totally okay.

102
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,260
This will go no further.

103
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,510
Don't worry.

104
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,420
I will give you an explanation.

105
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Please,

106
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,190
please ask your assistant

107
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,300
to help us cook this.

108
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,830
Why do you investigate?

109
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,410
All the dishes

110
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,660
were made by the chubby assistant.

111
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,650
It must be her.

112
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,080
You must be hungry.

113
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,450
How is she?

114
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,350
Sit down.

115
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,480
Did you do it

116
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,360
today?

117
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,560
No.

118
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,100
You don't trust me?

119
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,940
I trust you.

120
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,540
You're hurt.

121
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,830
I'm fine.

122
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,730
Why?

123
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,010
Stop.

124
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,220
Zoom in.

125
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,080
Before we came to do the variety show,

126
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,200
we had told you many times

127
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,340
that Mengmeng is allergic to peanuts.

128

There should not be any products with peanuts.

129
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,270
Thank you.

130
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:49,980
It's ok.

131
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,950
Chubby Su.

132
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,870
Chubby Su.

133
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,940
I knew that I could ask you out

134
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,050
in the name of Lu Yanzhi.

135
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,720
Tang Su, it's been a long time.

136
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,410
Sorry, you have confused me with someone else.

137
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,440
Stop it.

138
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,330
I recognized you long ago.

139
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,720
Chubby Su.

140
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,490
[Tangsu, I knew you were innocent and who did this to you]

141
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,490
[I'll wait for you at Jiaoye Park, Lu Yanzhi.]

142
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,040
Since

143
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,390
you recognized me,

144
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,640
why didn't you tell them?

145
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,280
It wouldn't have come to this

146
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,800
if I had told them earlier.

147
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,220
Mengmeng, we love you.

148
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,960
Mengmeng, we love you.

149
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,570
Mengmeng.

150
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,590
I found it.

151
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,770
The person whom Lu Yanzhi has been looking for

152
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,000
is the maid of Huangfu Jue.

153
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,720
And this maid

154
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,400
is Tang Su.

155
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,050
I see.

156
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,060
So,

157
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,850
from the script scandal

158
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,560
to the food allergy,

159
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,360
you planned all of these things.

160
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,000
So what?

161
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,370
Mengmeng,

162
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,240
did I do something wrong

163
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,680
to you?

164
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,480
Why did you do these things?

165
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,050
I've always treated you

166
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,090
as my close friend.

167
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,630
Close friend?

168
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,010
We

169
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,540
have always only been competitors.

170
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,080
You thought you were kind,

171
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,250
conscientious and hard-working.

172
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,430
Have you ever thought

173
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,420
that I was the same as you?

174
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,770
But as long as you were here,

175
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,910
there was no place for me.

176
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,060
No matter how hard I tried,

177
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,230
I was always your green leaves.

178
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,400
You got all the job opportunities

179
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,290
and applause.

180
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,060
Now I want to show you,

181
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,260
in this world,

182
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,380
not everyone

183
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,540
lives the same life as you.

184
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,030
I didn't know

185
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,750
you hate me so much.

186
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,370
I don't hate you.

187
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,900
Only when you are out,

188
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,140
I can have my place.

189
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,160
You have always been so arrogant.

190
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,160
You thought you were helping me.

191
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,750
In fact,

192
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,960
you were reminding me

193
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,260
that I was not as good as you.

194
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,610
Mengmeng,

195
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,790
I recommended you to the director.

196
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,250
So you gotta impress him later.

197
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:31,650
In this way,

198
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,920
we can act together.

199
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,690
Allergy medicine!

200
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,700
Allergy medicine!

201
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,830
You just go.

202
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,170
I don't want to waste your time.

203
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,230
Go.

204
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,680
Are you really okay by yourself?

205
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,460
Yes.

206
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,530
Be careful.

207
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,170
You always feel wronged.

208
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,010
Others should understand you.

209
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,960
But you never

210
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,040
care about others' feelings.

211
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,890
Sweet Girls came out

212
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,770
as a dark horse this year.

213
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,450
And you

214
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,510
are the most competitive girl group

215
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,620
among the popular groups.

216
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,750
How do you feel?

217
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,640
Thank our company

218
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,040
for the training and cultivation.

219
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,500
Thank

220
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,900
our fans and audiences very much

221
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,270
for your support and love.

222
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,110
I've tried

223
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,580
as hard as you,

224
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,620
or even harder than you.

225
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,670
But you have always gotten

226
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,540
more than me.

227
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,210
Seeing you give up yourself

228
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,140
like an underdog.

229
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,190
It

230
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,410
is so exciting.

231
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,370
Mr Luo, it's not like that.

232
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,030
I can explain it to the media.

233
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,630
The more you explain, the darker it gets.

234
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,600
What you need to do now

235
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,030
is to wait quietly.

236
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,040
The company will

237
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,830
help you solve the problem.

238
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,120
But I never

239
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,110
did such things.

240
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,690
-Why should I? -Su.

241
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,260
Let's calm down first.

242
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,130
Mr Luo,

243
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,170
please give me a chance.

244
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,270
I can explain it.

245
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,660
-That night, it wasn't… -Su.

246
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,800
-I didn't do that. -Calm down.

247
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,460
Su.

248
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
I have a reporter friend

249
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,680
who is very influential in the industry.

250
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,870
I'll ask her out

251
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,980
and you can do an interview to clarify the whole thing.

252
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,180
It might work.

253
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,850
Great!

254
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,770
But you have to promise

255
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,190
not to tell anyone

256
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,120
before the interview is released.

257
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,210
Okay, I promise you.

258
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,630
Thank you, Mengmeng.

259
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,680
Let's go.

260
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,070
I went to the director's room

261
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,520
to do the interview.

262
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,790
But Mengmeng and I

263
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,080
went together.

264
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,030
When

265
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,170
we arrived at the hotel,

266
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,580
-she suddenly felt uncomfortable. -Mr Luo.

267
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,090
I have some ideas about

268
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,010
the event this afternoon.

269
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,860
I think...

270
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,170
Why is Su here?

271
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,120
Mr Luo.

272
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,140
Why don't they trust me?

273
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,660
What the hell is this?

274
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,580
Stop looking at it.

275
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,620
Su, I'm sorry.

276
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,530
I've told Mr Luo

277
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,640
all the good words.

278
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,920
But he still decided

279
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,410
to stop all your work.

280
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,870
Just take it as a vacation.

281
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,720
Take a good rest.

282
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,360
Let's eat something

283
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,500
to distract your attention.

284
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,180
Mengmeng.

285
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,310
It's okay.

286
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,840
I'll always be with you.

287
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,590
I didn't expect

288
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,620
the former superstar

289
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,900
to become

290
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,330
so ugly.

291
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,850
But I didn't figure

292
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,840
that you came back.

293
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,560
You even found a sugar daddy,

294
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,470
Huangfu Jue.

295
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,790
Instead of saying that I'm cruel,

296
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,720
it's better to say you're smart.

297
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,150
Do you think everyone

298
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,140
is like you?

299
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,010
I did all these things for the life I wanted.

300
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,510
So what?

301
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:12,980
Listen.

302
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,359
No matter how much

303
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,569
Huangfu Jue protects you now.

304
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,839
As long as I

305
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,930
crook my finger,

306
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,480
-He will do whatever I say. -Stop it.

307
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,410
The past

308
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,310
doesn't matter.

309
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,950
From now on,

310
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,090
get out of my life!

311
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,430
You're so amazing.

312
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,060
Should I applaud you?

313
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,540
You won't be laughing

314
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,450
in five minutes.

315
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,930
What...what do you mean?

316
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,440
Soon,

317
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,340
your ugly appearance

318
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,550
will be exposed in public.

319
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,460
Let everyone see

320
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,910
the glorious superstar

321
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,350
has become

322
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,340
an ugly girl.

323
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,720
Stop!

324
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,860
She hit me first.

325
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,290
Apologize.

326
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,520
Why should I apologize?

327
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,610
Do you hear him?

328
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,490
Apologize!

329
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,060
I want you to apologize to her.

330
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,450
Me?

331
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,100
Before we find out the truth,

332
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,630
you framed her publicly.

333
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,000
Please apologize to her.

334
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,750
But she is the most suspicious.

335
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,540
Was she the only one who touched the dishes?

336
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,240
You were there too.

337
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,690
You know

338
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
who is the victim.

339
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,980
That's it.

340
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,250
Otherwise,

341
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,310
you'll be the only one to be destroyed.

342
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,220
Let's go.

343
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,300
Stop!

344
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,090
What?

345
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,120
Do you want me to ask these reporters

346
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,740
back?

347
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,700
I'm afraid you got slapped for nothing.

348
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,380
I don't care

349
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
about what happened between you two.

350
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,750
Please remember.

351
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,150
Stop pestering her.

352
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,700
She's mine.

353
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,280
Let's go.

354
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,110
Why are you here?

355
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,800
To save a fatty.

356
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,830
I didn't expect

357
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,920
him to come to save me.

358
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,800
To save a fatty?

359
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,410
Maybe Mengmeng

360
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,490
is right about one thing.

361
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,540
No one cares

362
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,060
about the disappearance of the star, Tang Su.

363
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,430
But they will care

364
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,770
that she becomes

365
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,950
an ugly fatty.

366
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,200
Maybe I can go back to the way I used to be.

367
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,290
For myself,

368
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,010
and...

369
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,640
Was I

370
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,290
childish before?

371
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,570
Not just you.

372
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,440
Tell me.

373
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,950
Why did people change so much?

374
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,870
I used to think she was so wonderful.

375
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,790
But now...

376
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,140
So you don't like her anymore?

377
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,350
Don't think too much.

378
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,980
Look.

379
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,830
That star

380
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,070
is Cygnus,

381
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,670
which only appears in summer.

382
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,860
It's

383
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,230
two hundred and thirty light years away from earth..

384
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,830
It's shining in the dark.

385
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,510
You can imagine

386
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,240
all its brilliance and beauty.

387
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,570
But that's not true.

388
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,450
Yes.

389
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,700
It takes ten thousand years

390
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,880
for the light's image

391
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,630
to be seen.

392
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,710
So what we see now

393
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,090
is just the past image.

394
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,310
To be exact,

395
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,710
just like

396
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,800
the beauty with your love.

397
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,510
To you,

398
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,800
Yu Mengmeng is like the Cygnus in the sky.

399
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,690
She is far way,

400
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,070
beautiful,

401
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,750
but not real.

402
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,300
Maybe

403
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,040
you don't like the person,

404
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,100
but the beautiful feelings

405
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,720
that she gave you.

406
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,170
Once you close the distance

407
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,380
and know the truth,

408
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,910
the beautiful feelings

409
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,070
will vanish.

410
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,550
You're right.

411
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,300
Saying goodbye to my past.

412
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,390
To our past.

413
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,590
Actually,

414
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,350
everyone

415
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,870
doesn't know themselves clearly sometimes,

416
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,280
whether in life

417
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,710
or in love.

418
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,100
Love?

419
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,630
But I haven't

420
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,130
known what love is.

421
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,950
What love is.

422
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,450
The love

423
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,580
is

424
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:19,840
that there's someone

425
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,550
who can make you worry.

426
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,470
Your happiness

427
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,990
comes from her.

428
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,050
You sadness

429
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,820
is caused by her.

430
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,290
You saw her

431
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,220
with other men,

432
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,400
you get jealous and angry.

433
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,100
You'll become very selfish,

434
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,850
ang you don't want anyone to bully her.

435
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,220
You want to protect her wholeheartedly,

436
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,060
and treat her

437
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,520
as your private property.

438
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,040
Chubby Su,

439
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,590
I'm curious

440
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,950
about what kind of person you are.

441
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,380
I don't know why,

442
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,740
when you're with me,

443
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,610
I feel at ease.

444
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,890
If you are happy,

445
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,230
I'm happy too.

446
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,050
If someone wants to bully you,

447
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,680
I want to rush up to protect you.

448
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:35,860
Maybe

449
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,350
I have someone in my heart.

450
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,780
Everything has changed.

451
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,240
Look.

452
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,880
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

453
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,100
