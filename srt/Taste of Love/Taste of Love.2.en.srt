00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,730
Huangfu Jue?

175
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,630
Huangfu Jue,

176
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,840
the CEO of Time Entertainment.

177
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,210
Looks like she needs to know

178
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,740
the consciousness of being a maid.

179
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,600
Alright.

180
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,890
The contract has been signed.

181
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,710
You must remember

182
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,680
every single rule in the contract,

183
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,660
and obey them strictly.

184
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,690
No mistake is allowed.

185
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,110
Rule No.1.

186
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,130
You are a live-in housemaid

187
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,470
with 24 working hours a day.

188
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,640
The room the boss provided

189
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,610
is pretty good.

190
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,250
You come when I call.

191
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,910
Chubby Su, come here.

192
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,160
Coming.

193
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,260
Rule No.2.

194
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,690
Arrange every meal for the boss.

195
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,570
You need to make food look as good as it tastes and smells.

196
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,140
Rule No.3.

197
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,910
You can't disobey your boss.

198
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,840
Do whatever the boss says.

199
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,680
Play the darts.

200
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,320
Aim.

201
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,620
You are good at it.

202
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,100
It's inhumane.

203
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,660
Rule No.4.

204
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,610
You can't sleep earlier than your boss.

205
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,330
Put your boss's worries first,

206
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,870
and you can only sleep when the boss sleeps.

207
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,110
What's wrong, boss?

208
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,750
Rule No.5.

209
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,520
keep every corner of the house clean

210
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,380
and odorless.

211
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,040
at all times.

212
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,080
It tastes like...

213
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,590
Do you know how to make yellow croaker wontons?

214
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,370
What?

215
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:07,780
Nothing.

216
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,520
First,

217
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,990
let's welcome Miss Yu Mengmeng.

218
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,800
Hello, everyone.

219
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,970
Hello, Miss Mengmeng.

220
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,160
Miss Mengmeng.

221
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,160
You're prettier recently.

222
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,480
Just watching a TV show.

223
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,340
Do you really need to be like that?

224
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,840
Next,

225
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,650
let's welcome the most famous star, Lu Yanzhi.

226
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,000
Yanzhi.

227
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,000
Mr.Lu, please have a seat.

228
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,820
Okay, thank you.

229
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,550
Thank you very much

230
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,840
for accepting

231
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,540
our interview today.

232
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,890
I also heard that

233
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,090
the cooperation

234
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,200
between you two is very frequent recently.

235
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,120
People

236
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,060
have been curious

237
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:44,680
about your relationship.

238
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,210
If there's anything

239
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,790
you want to tell us

240
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,700
in the interview?

241
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,420
What kind of question is that?

242
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,870
It's like spreading rumor.

243
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,570
Exactly, it's obviously fake news.

244
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,830
She likes Lu Yanzhi!

245
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,400
Did he notice?

246
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,190
I'm very happy

247
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,840
to work with Yanzhi.

248
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,410
Because he

249
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,510
helped and took care of me

250
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,200
a lot

251
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,380
whether at work

252
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,400
or in life.

253
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,950
So let me take this opportunity

254
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,600
to ask Yanzhi

255
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,470
a question.

256
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,510
Could it be

257
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,790
that question I thought?

258
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,700
Will you

259
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,700
always take care of me?

260
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,370
I knew it.

261
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,100
Will he accept it?

262
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,420
Our famous star

263
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,680
is really charming.

264
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,880
Can't hold her hand, can't hold her hand!

265
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,620
Yes, I will.

266
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,140
Is this an official announcement?

267
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,370
Yanzhi.

268
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,290
What a perfect match!

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,710
-Thank you. -Thank you.

270
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,870
I'm also looking forward to

271
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,080
more cooperation between you two,

272
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,250
and better works from you.

273
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,520
Thank you very much

274
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,720
for accepting our interview today.

275
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,110
-Thank you. -Thank you.

276
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,670
What's wrong?

277
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,350
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,780
I just thought of a story.

279
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,660
What story?

280
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,160
Once upon a time,

281
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,990
there was a stupid monkey who was not so pretty.

282
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,480
She only wanted to catch the moon.

283
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,160
But unexpectedly,

284
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,380
the Moon Prince was surrounded

285
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,230
by so many people.

286
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,080
So,

287
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,200
that fool was thinking it over,

288
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,420
and she came up with a stupid idea finally.

289
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,240
She started to appear here and there

290
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,640
in front of the Moon Prince.

291
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,260
She wanted to attract

292
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,640
the Moon Prince's attention.

293
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,690
Although

294
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,870
this would annoy the Moon Prince.

295
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,380
As long as

296
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,000
she could attract

297
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,450
the Moon Prince's attention,

298
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,320
She

299
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,830
would feel contented.

300
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,120
Just a moment of his gaze

301
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,720
could make me happy for a long time.

302
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,680
It turned out

303
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,920
the light enveloped him

304
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,020
like the moon.

305
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,020
But he was always out of reach.

306
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:57,940
You're right.

307
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
Always out of reach.

308
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,060
You must think this story

309
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,300
is silly and funny.

310
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,500
It's okay.

311
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,040
Just take it as a joke.

312
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,400
It's silly,

313
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,130
but it's not funny.

314
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,010
No one will laugh at

315
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,750
a fool who had tried her best to love someone.

316
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,130
I can't believe

317
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,590
I'm comforted by him.

318
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,080
I've fallen.

319
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,840
Stop crying.

320
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,990
Celebrities

321
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,820
are different when they are not in front of the cameras.

322
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,450
Don't idolize him too much.

323
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,430
Here.

324
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,760
I'm not a fan of him, I...

325
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,330
You are cute for only three seconds.

326
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,140
There's nothing to watch.

327
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,550
Stop watching.

328
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,180
Let's see what they're going to do

329
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,450
Don't watch it.

330
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,119
I want to watch it.

331
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,599
Don't watch it, there's nothing to watch.

332
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,030
No, I want to watch it, I...

333
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:19,750
Don't.

334
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,530
I want to watch it, give it to me.

335
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,590
Why is his heart beating so fast?

336
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,500
And he's looking at me.

337
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,580
So heavy.

338
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,530
Sorry, boss.

339
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:47,980
I'm sorry.

340
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,550
Wait.

341
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,330
What is he going to do?

342
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,160
The face.

343
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,080
The more I look at you, the more I think

344
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,350
Oh god.

345
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,620
Did he recognize me?

346
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,720
you face is so big.

347
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,140
He scared me.

348
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,380
Fortunately, he didn't recognize me.

349
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,000
Yellow croaker wontons.

350
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,380
Why does the yellow croakers have so many bones?

351
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,540
When can I finish cleaning the bones?

352
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,100
Do you know how to make yellow croaker wontons?

353
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,010
What?

354
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,370
Nothing.

355
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,990
I didn't expect

356
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,250
her to remember what I said casually.
