especially with this land.

7
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,340

an excessive amount of chromium

in the soil in the northern part of that land.

13

Yes.

26

It's SG.

27
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,510
I also found out

28
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,250
that the chief manager

how they did it.

34

He is a very cautious person.

35
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,090
He didn't choose to take the risk

36
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,740
just to gain

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,570

You're in such a hurry.

137
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,900
Have you made a lot of moves behind the scenes?

138
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,250
To be honest,

139
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,770
I have invested heavily

140

in the stocks of Huangfu Group.

141
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,380
You always want more.

In two days,

145
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,000
your assets will be doubled.

146
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,840
Great!

147
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,110
Then I will retire early and completely depend on you.

148
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,420
Did he show up again

149
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,720
after Time Entertainment took over?

150
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,750
No.

151
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,480
He looks like

152
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,750
he's just passing time without any motivation.

153
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,400
It's a misfortune for the Huangfu family

154
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,310
that he was born into it.

155
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,660
The fact that he was given the Huangfu surname

156
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,480
was already a great privilege.

157
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,590
He originally came from another family.

158
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,420
Then why did I hear

159
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,160
that the CEO appointed

160
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,400
him to be the heir?

161
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,620
That was in the past,

162
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,520
it wouldn't happen now

163
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,000
or in the future.

164
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,530
Do you think he would accept it?

165
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,760
We have already applied for

166
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,600
the temporary suspension of trading

167
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,760
in the company's stocks for one hour today.

168

At 9:30 in the press conference,

169
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,180

170

the official launch of the Blue Sky Project.

171
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,950
This is today's press release.

172
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,750
I'll put it here.

173
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:55,750
By the way,

174
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,220
I also arranged

175
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,810
an interview with an authoritative media outlet

176
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,810
after the press conference.

177
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,280
Your phone.

178
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,190
You may leave now.

179
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,230
Okay, I'm leaving then.

180
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,380
Hello.

181
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,480
I have to confirm.

182
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,120
[Are] you sure you want to add more 50 times?

183
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,740
[You said] ten times at first.

184
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,110
Yeah, 50 times.

185
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,720
But your account's deposit

186
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,660
can't bear this high risk.

187
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,710
Use all my shares

188
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,710
as collateral.

189
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,860
Okay.

190
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,620
I have internal information.

191
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,750
Has the proposal

192
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,580
been prepared?

193
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,360
Yes.

194
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:06,840
[Press conference]

195
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,300
Jue, what's wrong?

196
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,370
I am going upstairs to deal with something.

197
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,400
Wait for me.

198
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,130
Okay.

199
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,620
What's going on?

200
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,860
We're having a press conference.

201
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,410
Okay.

202
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,240
Got it, Mr. Huangfu.

203
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,060
Good luck.

204
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,530
Good luck.

205
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,950
Mr. Huangfu.

206
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:40,960
Something happened.

207
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,860
Look.

208
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,970
Mr. Zheng, who is in charge of SG,

209
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,780
has been arrested as he's suspected of

210
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,730
being involved in providing fake inspection reports.

211
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,660
The case is under investigation now.

212
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,910
According to relevant sources,

213
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,850
this fabrication

214
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,680
might be related

215
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,050
to an important project in the Huangfu Group.

216
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,350
Let's check the situation there.

217
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,780
No! No!

218
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,010
Don't take photos.

219
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,210
The press conference will begin soon.

220
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,680
I'll get ready.

221
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,030
Aunt.

222
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,530
Is SG's incident

223
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,030
related to the Blue Sky Project?

224
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:24,830
Aunt.

225
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,640
We have a typical employer-employee relationship

226
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,480
with SG.

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,080
They have an issue

228
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,820
in their company.

229
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,840
It has nothing to do with us.

230
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,410
Don't worry.

231
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,390
The press conference is about to start.

232
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,580
Let's go.

233
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,580
Press conference?

234
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,320
Are you going to announce

235
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,660
the official launch of the Blue Sky Project?

236
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,460
Of course.

237
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,660
Isn't this

238
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,550
today's main topic?

239
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,430
Aunt,

240
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,670
are you feeling unwell?

241
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,750
Should I get someone

242
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,750
to send you back to rest?

243
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,580
Now that Mr. Zheng from SG

244
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,390
is arrested for fabricating reports,

245
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,980
if the Blue Sky Project

246
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,280
gets dragged in this,

247
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,750
the announcement you are about to make

248
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,070
will put Huangfu Group

249
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,250
in danger.

250
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,480
Haven't you thought about this?

251
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,320
Aunt, didn't I

252
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,350
just tell you

253
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,730
that this case has nothing to do with us?

254
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,070
Who will take responsibility

255
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,350
if the company's biggest project

256
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,650
in the past five years

257
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,530
has been delayed

258
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,050
just because of this small issue?

259
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,680
I will.

260
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,230
Dad!

261
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,790
Grandpa!

262
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:28,820
Mr. Liu.

263
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,770
The location of this house

264
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,550
and its decoration style

265
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,570
are really good.

266
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,190
It's worth every penny.

267
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,580
[Chi Ye]

268
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,590
Miss Tang.

269
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,030
The client has been waiting for you for a long time.

270
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,350
When will your boyfriend arrive?

271
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:49,880
I'm sorry.

272
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,160
He might have been delayed by something.

273
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,940
I'll contact him again.

274
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:53,910
This...

275
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,550
Mr. Liu, I'm sorry.

276
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,120
[Wu]

277
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,420
Mr. Liu.

278
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,270
But this house

279
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,190
is quite nice.

280
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:03,960
Wu!

281
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,030
Did you contact Chi Ye today?

282
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,030
Yes.

283
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,050
He's out of town.

284
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,450
Out of town?

285
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,080
Okay, I got it.

286
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,170
I'm sorry.

287
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,310
It seems

288
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,030
that you've come here for nothing today.

289
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,350
I'm really sorry.

290
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm really sorry.

291
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,140
Miss Tang, this...

292
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:29,890
I'm sorry.

293
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,390
Mr. Liu.

294
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,080
Mr. Liu.

295
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,010
Grandpa.

296
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,130
The Blue Sky Project is a beneficial project

297
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,470
for the country and the people.

298
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,720
It's a project that will bring honor to the group.

299
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,930
Shut up!

300
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:52,760
Jue.

301
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:53,990
Tell him.

302
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,210
You made a large investment

303
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,860
in the overseas electronic currency market

304
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,740
in January last year

305
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
and ended up losing

306
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,140
a huge amount of money.

307
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,660
Since that time,

308
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,970
you've been thinking

309
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,800
about how to get that money back.

310
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,510
So you targeted the Blue Sky Project

311
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,860
to recoup the losses.

312
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,270
But you didn't expect

313
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,470
that there would be something wrong

314
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,630
in the land.

315
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,540
If anyone finds out,

316
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,270
the Blue Sky Project

317
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,350
will be stopped immediately.

318
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,520
By then,

319
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,310
you won't be able

320
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,000
to pay the money you owe overseas.

321
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,000
So,

322
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,170
you asked Mr. Zheng from SG to fabricate the report

323
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,870
so that

324
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,160
the Blue Sky Project can be implemented.

325
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,390
Grandpa,

326
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,790
there's a misunderstanding.

327
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,410
I did this

328
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,510
only to push forward

329
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,980
the Blue Sky Project

330
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,310
and protect our group's investment

331
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,700
in this project.

332
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,320
You're twisting the truth.

333
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,630
Then why did you buy a lot of stocks

334
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,450
in the market?

335
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,630
By announcing this news half an hour

336
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,580
before the market opens,

337
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,620
aren't you trying to

338
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,730
make a big profit?

339
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,680
You can do anything

340
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,420
for money.

341
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,580
If I'm not mistaken,

342
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,040
you staked a lot of money

343
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,160
this time again, right?

344
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:06,940
Grandpa.

345
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,010
No.

346
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,530
Let me explain.

347
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,970
I didn't do this

348
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,150
for myself.

349
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,240
I did it for the company.

350
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,980
I didn't sell short,

351
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:16,970
I bought long.

352
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,780
Scoundrel!

353
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,620
You still don't know

354
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,720
that this is your fault?

355
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,040
You're breaking the law!

356
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,580
Grandpa!

357
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,250
Grandpa, I was wrong.

358
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,740
Grandpa, I know I was wrong.

359
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,400
I...

360
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,790
I won't do it again.

361
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,300
Please give me another chance.

362
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,070
I won't do it again.

363
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,580
Grandpa.

364
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,820
Turn yourself in.

365
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,550
This is the only way you can protect yourself.

366
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,180
Shut up!

367
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,310
Grandpa.

368
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,370
He hates me.

369
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,160
He harmed me

370
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,080
because I stole his project.

371
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,870
Grandpa,

372
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,030
I'm your grandson.

373
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,710
You can't just watch me

374
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,480
go to jail.

375
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,470
Grandpa.

376
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,490
My grandson?

377
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,840
You're a traitor.

378
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,740
You've completely disregarded the well-being

379
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,270
of the group for your own benefits.

380
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,190
Have ever thought

381
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,720
that the problem in this land

382
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,140
can't be hidden

383
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,130
if the project is launched?

384
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,110
By then, the whole group

385
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,210
would have been destroyed.

386
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,630
I...

387
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,610
Even if no one finds out

388
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,370
about the contaminated land,

389
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,750
how can people live there?

390
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,920
Where are you putting the lives and property

391
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,590
of the people?

392
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,660
You let me down.

393
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,390
Grandpa.

394
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,870
Grandpa, I was wrong.

395
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,480
I won't do it again.

396
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,410
Grandpa.

397
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,390
Grandpa, I was wrong.

398
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:35,780
Jue.

399
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,190
Go.

400
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,240
Got it.

401
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,390
Mom.

402
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,230
Look!

403
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,550
Dear shareholders

404
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,329
and friends from the media,

405
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,069
I apologize for making you wait.

406
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,550
Due to differences within the Huangfu Group

407
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,490
regarding the Blue Sky Project

408
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,010
and a lack of consensus,

409
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,780
I'm announcing today

410
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,470
that the Blue Sky Project

411
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,080
will be temporarily suspended.

412
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,410
What's going on?

413
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,620
What on earth is going on?

414
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,260
The Blue Sky Project will be temporarily suspended.

415
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,530
Su.

416
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,140
Come, let me sit.

417
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,910
What happened?

418
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,040
What happened?

419
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,860
Due to differences within the Huangfu Group

420
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,930
regarding the Blue Sky Project

421
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,380
and a lack of consensus,

422
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,280
Isn't this the Huangfu Jue? -So...

423
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,840
When did he go back? -I'm announcing today

424
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,900
that the Blue Sky Project will be temporarily suspended.

425
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,410
Okay. That Chi Ye.

426
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,510
How dare he lie to me!

427
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,150
Su, we...

428
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,040
Su?

429
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,050
Su!

430
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,520
Why are you zoning out?

431
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,460
Su!

432
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,970
Wait for me.

433
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,370
Here is the latest news.

434
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,550
It was suddenly announced

435
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,270
that the Huangfu Group's biggest project

436
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,200
in the past five years, the Blue Sky Project, has been suspended.

437
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,190
This news caused a sharp drop in the stock prices

438
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,800
of the group in the Shanghai and Hong Kong markets.

439
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,930
Alright. These two guys

440
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,900
teamed up to trick us.

441
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,800
The market reaction shows

442
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,360
concern towards Huangfu Group.

443
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,990
A well-established and experienced company

444
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,660
shouldn't make

445
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,250
such a rushed plan.

446
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,570
It also makes people

447
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,830
doubt the ability of the successors

448
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,780
of the Huangfu Group.

449
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,490
Su.

450
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:14,880
Did you hear that?

451
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,010
Will the Huangfu Group be destroyed?

452
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,680
I don't know.

453
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,430
I just want to know

454
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,470
why he lied to me.

455
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,290
Where are you going in such a hurry?

456
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,150
Tang Su is waiting for me.

457
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,970
Young Master Huangfu, long time no see.

458
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,130
Mr. Luo.

459
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,890
I want to ask you

460
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,940
for a favor today.

461
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,820
Is there anything that Mr. Luo can't do?

462
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,800
I'll get straight to the point.

463
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,040
[Stock Transfer Agreement]

464
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,590
This is Time Entertainment's stock.

465
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,190
I don't want it anymore.

466
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,050
Back then,

467
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,000
you exchanged shares with me

468
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,810
using Tang Su's contract.

469
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,180
Do you want me

470
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,590
to return her contract to you?

471
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,390
I can’t do that.

472
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,250
You got it wrong.

473
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,160
What I mean is

474
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,560
that I'll sell this stock to you.

475
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,190
50 million.

476
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,870
40 million.

477
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,210
20 million.

478
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,340
Two million?

479
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,780
Are you kidding me?

480
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,990
This is Time Entertainment!

481
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,400
200,000.

482
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,940
You wouldn't be standing here now

483
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,050
if you could find a buyer.

484
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,060
Don't forget

485
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,230
that you went bankrupt

486
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,170
half an hour ago.

487
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,120
If you can accept this amount,

488
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,120
I'll sign it right away.

489
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,540
Otherwise,

490
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,150
don't waste my time.

491
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:01,930
Huangfu Jue.

492
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,650
You're incredible.

493
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,960
It seems that Huangfu Xiang

494
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,850
has underestimated you.

495
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,050
Please.

496
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,620
Chi Ye!

497
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,950
How many drinks did you have to get this drunk?

498
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,340
How dare you lie to me now?

499
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,530
-No, no. -Explain what?

500
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,170
What's there to explain?

501
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:29,800
Let me tell you.

502
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,910
Explain what?

503
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,420
Wu, listen to me!

504
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,720
Your boyfriend

505
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,780
is very scheming.

506
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,630
Don't let him fool you.

507
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,020
Chubby Su.

508
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,780
What's wrong?

509
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,820
Why are you doing this?

510
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,990
It's because Luo Shi

511
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,780
is greedy...

512
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,980
I'm not talking about Luo Shi.

513
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,370
I'm asking you.

514
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,810
Why did you hide it from me?

515
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,100
You were not really in any difficulty

516
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,920
or facing bankruptcy.

517
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,740
Why did you lie to me?

518
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
Tang Su, listen to me.

519
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,120
There were a lot of questions

520
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,510
in this matter from the beginning

521
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,390
that I didn't have answers to.

522
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,110
I didn't dare risk

523
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,470
having my plan revealed.

524
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,230
Otherwise, I...

525
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,830
Plan?

526
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,670
So I'm just

527
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
a part of your plan.

528
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,300
Right?

529
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,580
I stupidly thought

530
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,220
that you were done for.

531
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,180
I thought about giving up my career

532
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:32,850
and accompanying you.

533
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,080
In the end...

534
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,310
I'm just a supporting role

535
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,250
in this scene.

536
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,460
But my feelings for you are real.

537
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,300
True or fake,

538
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,490
you didn't even give me

539
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,370
the basic trust,

540
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,430
so how can I believe

541
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,190
that you are sincere?
