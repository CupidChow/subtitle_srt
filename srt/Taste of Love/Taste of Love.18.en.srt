what kind of person

is...

Why not?

29

-I told you. -Didn't answer the phone.

35

60

Actually,

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,050
she...she is not so scary.

62
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,290
It's mainly because

63
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,680
this is your family gathering.

64
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,680

She is invincible

and very tough in business.

77
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,970
People call her

78
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,070
the decision-maker of the Huangfu Family.

79
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,750
I have a bad feeling.

80
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,510
She's probably

81
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,640
coming for you.

82
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,600
For me?

83
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,459
You are not suitable for my son.

84
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,050
Jue is engaged to her.

85
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,070
If you leave him,

86
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,910
this is all yours.

87
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,070
Wu, what should I do?

88
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,860
Help me!

89
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,230
Tell me what kind of daughter-in-law

90
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,400
she likes.

91
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,140
First of all,

92
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,130
you have to be

93
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,600
demure and steady like her.

94
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,400
Next,

95
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,659
you can't be an artist.

96
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,060
Because the exposure of an artist

97
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,159
is too high.

98
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,850
Last,

99
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,270
you can't live together with him before your marriage.

100
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,200
Because she

101
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,330
is a very traditional person.

102
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,470
Alright, Su.

103
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:04,600
I think

104
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,590
you should stop

105
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,550
making unnecessary efforts.

106
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,250
Because in her heart,

107
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,500
you might be

108
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,820
an artist,

109
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,260
living with her son before your marriage,

110
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,750
who is not demure and steady.

111
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,910
So now,

112
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,790
the best way is...

113
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,710
I know.

114
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,180
Run away!

115
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,790
Pack things up for me, Huangfu Jue.

116
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,110
You don't have to go.

117
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,410
Tong Yiwu, why do you scare her?

118
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,220
Auntie, it's been so long.

119
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,420
Long time no see, Wu.

120
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,570
You told me that I got 30 minutes left.

121
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,570
I didn't expect that.

122
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,310
Hello, Ma'am.

123
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,170
I just stopped by.

124
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,120
Auntie,

125
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,580
let me introduce her to you.

126
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,980
She is my best friend.

127
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,110
Her name is Tang Su.

128
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:08,910
She is my girlfriend.

129
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,160
Your relationship is just like a game between kids.

130
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,610
Just have fun.

131
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,860
Let's talk, Jue.

132
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,660
I'll let you talk

133
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,810
and cut you up some fruit.

134
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:48,980
I haven't seen you in a year.

135
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,440
Now you don't know what to call me.

136
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,090
Mom.

137
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,630
How's the Time?

138
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,540
You can see it in the financial report every month.

139
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,940
I've been thinking about...

140
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,070
moving back home recently.

141
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:10,870
You need to prepare the room...

142
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,290
Chubby Su.

143
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,820
Are you done cutting the fruit?

144
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,990
Ma'am, have some fruit.

145
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,420
Wu, come and have some fruit.

146
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,410
Auntie.

147
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,970
I...I have something to do later.

148
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,870
I...I gotta go.

149
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,000
Enjoy your fruit.

150
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:30,920
Bye-bye.

151
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,150
You don't need to do these chores.

152
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,430
We have a maid.

153
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:39,800
No.

154
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,140
I made this cake myself.

155
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,150
It tastes different from store-bought cake.

156
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,750
Try it.

157
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,690
Who gave you this chain bracelet?

158
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,659
I gave it to her.

159
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,890
What are you doing?

160
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,870
Don't you know what I'm doing?

161
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,220
Ma'am.

162
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,320
Although I don't know what happened

163
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,850
between them,

164
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,100
I understand Huangfu Jue.

165
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,610
We have been dealing with family issues

166
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,660
all the time

167
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,120
in our lives.

168
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,270
Maybe they have

169
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,940
hopes and expectations for each other.

170
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,220
But they lack a reasonable opportunity.

171
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,230
But what is it?

172
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:05,790
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,650
Ma'am, I'm sorry to bother you.

174
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,610
You do bother me.

175
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,720
Ma'am.

176
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,390
I'm here today

177
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,500
to return this to you.

178
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,910
I don't know

179
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,050
what it means to you.

180
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,700
But I think

181
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,900
it should belong to you.

182
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,370
Come in.

183
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,430
What's that look?

184
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,670
-What's the matter? -What's the matter?

185
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,670
Mr. Chi.

186
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,710
Please help me.

187
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:52,940
Go ahead.

188
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,790
Let me ask you a question.

189
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,520
When Huangfu Jue was young,

190
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,780
did he grow up

191
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,280
in a single-parent family?

192
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,810
Yes, I know that.

193
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:03,620
Why?

194
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,810
But the kid

195
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,630
who has grown up in a single-parent family

196
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,420
should be close

197
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,320
to his mom.

198
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,660
What happened

199
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,390
to his mother and him?

200
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,540
Actually, I don't know much about this.

201
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,480
Mr. Chi.

202
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,590
You're a great person.

203
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,680
Please help me.

204
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:20,860
Wu,

205
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,640
Say it! Say it! Now!

206
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,950
When his mother was young,

207
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
she fell in love with a poor painter,

208
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,070
although

209
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,710
she was the daughter

210
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,720
of the Huangfu family.

211
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,020
When Auntie was young,

212
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,110
she experienced this.

213
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,510
The family was

214
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,710
against it back then.

215
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,650
However,

216
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,220
his mother still decided

217
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,080
to marry his dad.

218
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,100
Boss

219
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,010
is their son.

220
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,790
They were very happy as a family of three.

221
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,590
Their son.

222
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,370
Don't interrupt.

223
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,590
Later,

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,910
his father passed away in an accident.

225
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,510
This is a turning point.

226
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,290
After that,

227
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,030
his mother was like

228
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,930
a different person.

229
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,780
She became very tough in the company.

230
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,710
And she led the employees

231
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,170
to make thriving careers.

232
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,590
However,

233
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,830
they've gotten

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,750
more and more difficult to stay in touch.

235
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,780
since then.

236
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,750
They have been growing further and further apart.

237
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,900
Rome was not built in a day.

238
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:21,610
Brilliant!

239
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Do you think

240
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,790
Auntie's story

241
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
sounds so familiar?

242
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,820
Don't you think

243
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,660
it's like Huangfu and you?

244
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,240
I don't want him to give up his family

245
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,370
just for me.

246
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,310
The most important task for you now

247
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,060
is to make his mother accept you,

248
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,850
instead of

249
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,240
caring about their relationship.

250
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,910
But this

251
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,460
was caused by me.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,280
And I don't want

253
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,160
him to keep being alienated from

254
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,830
his mom

255
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,750
because of me.

256
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,100
His concerns

257
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,940
are my concerns.

258
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,710
What are you going to do?

259
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,220
Do you know some details?

260
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,760
Like,

261
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,470
are there any good memories between

262
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,770
them?

263
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,730
Good memories?

264
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,890
I'm so surprised

265
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,950
that you realized your mistake.

266
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,890
Mistake?

267
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,780
I think it's crooked.

268
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:15,720
It's not crooked.

269
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,470
It should be aligned

270
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,150
with that line.

271
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:18,730
Look at it this way.

272
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,770
It's so perfect.

273
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:21,970
I guess you are right.

274
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,330
Chubby Su.

275
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,270
It's ready, just as you said.

276
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,990
Thank you, Mr. Chi.

277
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,380
Do you think

278
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,210
they will come?

279
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,040
If you apologize,

280
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,590
I'll let it go.

281
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,020
Chi Ye said

282
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,940
you wanted to talk to me.

283
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,150
Otherwise, I won't come today.

284
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:11,930
Talk about what?

285
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,570
He doesn't want the job.

286
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,760
[Boss]

287
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,470
What's wrong?

288
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,690
Did you bring the medicine?

289
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,330
Relax, relax.

290
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,550
Take a deep breath and relax.

291
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,480
Relax.

292
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,120
It's okay, I'm here.

293
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,620
Relax.

294
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,760
Don't worry.

295
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,730
Someone will find out

296
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,380
the elevator isn't working soon.

297
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,690
Since you'd grown up,

298
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,690
this is the first time

299
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,369
that we have been

300
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,319
so close to each other.

301
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,650
Tang Su returned it to you?

302
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,340
Do you really like her?

303
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,000
To be precise,

304
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,680
I love her.

305
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,070
I still remember

306
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:52,950
that you were so happy

307
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,950
when dad gave you

308
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,380
this chain bracelet.

309
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,640
I know

310
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,500
it is very important to you.

311
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,350
Because it carries

312
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,220
dad's love for you.

313
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,800
But now,

314
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,880
I love someone very much.

315
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,440
I want her

316
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,540
to be as happy as you were.

317
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,090
I like this design a lot.

318
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,490
Do you?

319
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,720
Do we

320
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,430
need to

321
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,520
add a logo here?

322
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,710
-Add it here? -Yes.

323
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,900
No hurry, no hurry.

324
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,880
I'll get the candles.

325
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,220
Okay.

326
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,070
Don't be afraid. Come here.

327
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,140
Don't be afraid. I'll be quick.

328
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,770
-Here. Be good. -The candle is ready.

329
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,420
Be brave.

330
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,170
Don't be afraid.

331
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,480
Don't be afraid. Look.

332
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,360
Is it bright after the candle lights up?

333
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,130
Here.

334
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,440
-Right? -Here's the candle.

335
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,620
Here.

336
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,540
What did you say about here?

337
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,850
Yes, right here.

338
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:46,960
What do you think?

339
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,790
It's good.

340
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,230
You think it's good.

341
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,190
What did you just say it looks like?

342
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,550
Is this pretty?

343
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,520
Is this pretty?

344
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,750
Actually, I'm quite happy.

345
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,530
You're willing to tell me the truth.

346
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,710
But you were not there

347
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,520
when I wanted to say.

348
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,070
Do you want to ask

349
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,350
why I was absent

350
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,220
for so many years?

351
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,900
Maybe I'm really

352
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,180
the mother

353
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,410
who doesn't love her kid.

354
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,480
But do you know why?

355
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,200
After your father passed away,

356
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,920
I didn't dare to face you.

357
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,430
Because you look

358
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,500
just like your dad.

359
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,170
Every move.

360
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,890
Every expression.

361
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,750
You are just like

362
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,870
him so much.

363
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,230
I felt sad when I saw you.

364
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,220
I didn't want you

365
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,360
to see me suffer.

366
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,640
So I worked so hard

367
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,720
to numb myself

368
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,800
and escape from you

369
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,110
But when I found that

370
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,660
you were getting further away from me,

371
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,850
it was too late for me to regret.

372
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,600
But at that time,

373
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,090
I needed you the most.

374
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:42,880
All right.

375
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,840
Let's go out first.

376
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,570
Stand by.

377
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:53,990
Three.

378
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,470
Two.

379
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,340
One.

380
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:56,830
Play.

381
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,510
Happy birthday to you.

382
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,590
Happy birthday to you.

383
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,630
Happy birthday to you.

384
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,720
Thank you, baby.

385
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,540
Thank you, honey.

386
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,550
Let me take it.

387
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:14,980
Okay.

388
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,510
Mom,

389
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,870
what did you wish?

390
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,020
It won't come true if I tell you.

391
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,230
I know,

392
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,190
you want me to get 100 points on the exam.

393
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,050
No.

394
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,070
Mom hopes

395
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,030
you can be healthy and happy forever.

396
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,070
Jue, you know

397
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,210
that mon loves you the most

398
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,340
in the world.

399
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,260
Okay.

400
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,940
Come, have some meat.

401
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,590
Have some meat.

402
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,830
Where is it going?

403
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,530
Bingo!

404
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,400
Your turn, mom.

405
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,190
Come, baby.

406
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,100
Come, let mom do it.

407
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,720
Come here.

408
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,160
Baby, you're so great!

409
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:12,840
Come here.

410
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,320
Dad, what are you doing?

411
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,410
I'm picking fish bones.

412
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,370
Mom, what are you doing?

413
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,050
I'm making your favorite

414
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,090
yellow croaker wontons.

415
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,500
When will it be ready?

416
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,560
I'm starving.

417
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,250
We'll have yellow croaker wontons

418
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,260
tonight.

419
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,950
Sorry.

420
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,300
Maybe this apology

421
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,770
is too late.

422
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,350
It took you a lot of work

423
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,120
to find those videos.

424
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,370
I'm sorry, ma'am.

425
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,510
I took it upon myself.

426
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,160
Since Jue gave it to you,

427
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,850
then it belongs to you.

428
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,430
Thank you, ma'am.

429
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,150
Don't be so touched.

430
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,780
You're a kind girl.

431
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,750
But the thing between you and Jue

432
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,580
is not that simple.

433
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,560
I haven't agreed yet.

434
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,610
I won't give up.
