Boss. Forgive me for

44
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,660
leaving without saying goodbye.

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,070
See you in three months.

Three months?

47
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,270
What happened?

48
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,250
She left without saying goodbye.

49
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,990
And then?

50
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,800
What happened after you kissed?

51
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,060
I fell asleep.

52
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,080
That's it?

53
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,970
No wonder she left.

54
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,160
What do you mean?

55
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,870
You mean

56
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,000
she got angry after I kissed her?

57
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,250
I think she got angry

58
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,480
because nothing happened

59
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,310
after you kissed her.

60
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,870
Nothing happened?

61
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,840
What should happen afterwards?

62
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,850
At least you should...

63
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,350
Forget it.

64
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,840
You won't understand.

65
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,160
It's pointless to talk about it

66
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,180
since she already left.

67
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,730
By the way,

68
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,880
the company's stock price dropped

69
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,150
because of the Yu Mengmeng incident.

70
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,300
Have a look.

71
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,159
It dropped a bit.

72
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,060
More than a bit.

73
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,610
If it continues to drop,

74
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,030
the shareholders will blame us.

75
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,380
Then disclose the evidence

76
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,170
that she staged the whole incident.

77
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,540
Okay.

78
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,020
Wait.

79
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,970
If we make it public, it will never end.

80
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,730
As long as she stops causing troubles,

81
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,460
just let it go.

82
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,800
Boss,

83
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,200
are you still

84
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,960
thinking about her?

85
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,080
She caused

86
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,860
the company to suffer a great loss.

87
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,670
What do you mean?

88
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,930
Why would I think about her?

89
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,540
Is it because of her?

90
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,810
I just don't want

91
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,550
Chubby Su to be bothered by it.

92
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,440
I understand.

93
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,510
Set up free health checks.

94
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,090
We'll offer free allergy testings

95
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,730
to let everyone know the risk of allergies.

96
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
We should be proactive

97
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,330
to deal with this issue.

98
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:28,820
Okay.

99
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,720
Chubby Su, my clothes...

100
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,420
I'll sort out the free health check first.

101
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,220
Have a good rest.

102
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,360
Wait.

103
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,500
Got it.

104
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,750
I'll even dig up the ground.

105
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,390
I will help you

106
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,700
find Chubby Su.

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,610
Don't worry.

108
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,610
Chubby Su.

109
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,690
Where are you?

110
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,090
Come on.

111
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,030
Aim at the target.

112
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,220
I'm sorry, Chubby Su.

113
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,990
Is it because

114
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,260
I made you do a lot of things

115
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,299
you didn't want to do?

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,950
You left without saying goodbye.

117
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,110
Don't worry.

118
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,530
If you come back,

119
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,130
I won't bully you

120
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,670
and force you to do anything.

121
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,170
I won't let you be upset anymore.

122
00:08:59,450 --> 00:08:59,980
Chubby Su.

123
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,510
Chubby Su, you're back!

124
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,030
You're back!

125
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,770
Without you,

126
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,190
I have nothing to wear.

127
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,510
No one will do the laundry for me.

128
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,910
Chubby Su.

129
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,310
Who are you?

130
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,150
Why are you wearing Chubby Su's clothes?

131
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,380
Get out!

132
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,880
I thought you couldn't tell the difference.

133
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,200
Chi Ye.

134
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,490
I don't need a new maid.

135
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,680
Why did you hire

136
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,550
a chubby girl for me?

137
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,470
Are you totally

138
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,460
making decisions for me now?

139
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,080
I made the decision on my own.

140
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,680
But you were used to

141
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,970
somebody taking care of you.

142
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,760
After Chubby Su left,

143
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,360
I don't know when

144
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,900
she will come back.

145
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,470
I have to...

146
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,950
You mean

147
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,470
she will never come back?

148
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,170
That's not what I meant.

149
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,200
I just think it's only a maid.

150
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,670
Just change it back when she returns.

151
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,620
I'm warning you.

152
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,010
Stop looking for a new maid for me.

153
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,040
Do you

154
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,870
like her?

155
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,980
Like?

156
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,350
How is that possible?

157
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,410
How could I

158
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,470
fall in love with a maid?

159
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,450
How is it possible?

160
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,680
Do you think it's possible?

161
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,300
It was just a random question.

162
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,120
You are

163
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,970
overreacting.

164
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,900
I just don't have

165
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,380
a maid who I can bully

166
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,090
and give orders in my life.

167
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,280
I feel a bit bored.

168
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,130
Fine.

169
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,470
You have a unique interest.

170
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,360
You're not busy enough.

171
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,940
This is the song you wrote

172
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,410
for the company's fifth anniversary.

173
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,130
Lu Yanzhi,

174
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,940
are you trying to ruin your reputation?

175
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,860
I stayed up countless nights

176
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,710
to write this song.

177
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,000
You don't like it.

178
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,370
It doesn't mean others won't like it too.

179
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,600
I'm still able to tell

180
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,660
whether it's a good or bad song.

181
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,380
After one minute and 15 seconds,

182
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,880
you wanted to sound futuristic,

183
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,450
but the synthesizer

184
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,400
and strings added

185
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,170
were all fragmented.

186
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,200
Do you think the incompatible orchestration

187
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,900
is suitable for this song?

188
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,410
Since you wanted it to be futuristic,

189
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,220
shouldn't the main vocal

190
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,020
and the chorus create

191
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,930
an extreme contrast?

192
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,790
After three minutes and twelve seconds,

193
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,620
more than a dozen of instruments

194
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,170
and natural sound appeared.

195
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,540
Have you considered

196
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,850
whether this solo verse

197
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,720
goes well with

198
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,320
the mixed sound effect?

199
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:27,970
So in my opinion,

200
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
your song is rubbish.

201
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:29,850
Right.

202
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,360
You're the boss.

203
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,730
But do you have the right

204
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,750
to diminish my work?

205
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,330
Lu Yanzhi!

206
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,250
None of your business!

207
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,250
If you think I'm wrong,

208
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,640
show me your results

209
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,740
to tell me I am wrong.

210
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,440
Stop thinking about

211
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,610
the people and things irrelevant to work.

212
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,610
You are targeting at me on purpose.

213
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,770
Isn't it because

214
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,860
I want to meet your maid?

215
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,560
You have no right to see her.

216
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,210
Do you have the right to forbid me from seeing her?

217
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,550
Huangfu Jue.

218
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,240
Every person is free.

219
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,740
If you don't let me see her,

220
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,530
I will see her.

221
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,800
Enough, stop it!

222
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,460
-Shut up! -Shut up!

223
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,840
Rewrite the song.

224
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,720
In your dreams!

225
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,290
I quit.

226
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,800
Ask whoever you like to write the song.

227
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,050
Yanzhi.

228
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,410
Yanzhi!

229
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,460
Yanzhi!

230
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,390
Lu Yanzhi!

231
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,130
You know the boss's temper.

232
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,280
You're infuriating him on purpose.

233
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,840
He started it. You saw it.

234
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,240
He's just abusing his power

235
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,140
to find faults with me.

236
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,170
Wenwen.

237
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,730
Although the boss

238
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,390
was a bit direct,

239
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,050
his points were sensible.

240
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,230
And he acknowledged

241
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,180
your talent.

242
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,090
If he hadn't found you,

243
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,470
you would still be a singer

244
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,110
at a bar.

245
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,780
All these years,

246
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,800
he has given you the best of everything.

247
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,290
He supported your independent creation.

248
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,090
He thought of ways

249
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,610
to give you the best resources every day.

250
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,520
Think about it.

251
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,670
Yes.

252
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,820
I'm grateful for all that he has done.

253
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,160
So,

254
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,280
I stayed in the company.

255
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,590
But I don't know

256
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,650
when

257
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,120
he became

258
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,050
more and more unreasonable.

259
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,360
I met her to ask

260
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,170
why she had Tang Su's bracelet.

261
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,300
I just wanted to find Tang Su.

262
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,190
That's all.

263
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,010
Is he normal?

264
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,330
Yes, he is.

265
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,350
But he also isn't.

266
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,970
You said

267
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,970
he requested to hold this party.

268
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,790
Maybe he wanted to

269
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,940
fill the void inside of him.

270
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,320
After Su left,

271
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,220
he completely changed.

272
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,060
He's feeling empty.

273
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,930
This way.

274
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,770
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

275
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,040
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,720
Cheers!

277
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,650
Fill it up.

278
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:03,890
Fill it up.

279
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,110
Fill up my cup!

280
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,760
Let's get high!

281
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,590
Get wasted!

282
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,690
Are you crazy?

283
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,090
Let's go. Let's go.

284
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,040
Stop. Stop. Stop.

285
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,700
Sorry.

286
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,480
Who is he?

287
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,440
Don't get angry.

288
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,640
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,400
Don't be angry.

290
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,380
Huangfu Jue.

291
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,820
See a doctor if you're sick.

292
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,080
Why are acting crazy here?

293
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,470
Chi Ye, let's go.

294
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,700
You're leaving too?

295
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,590
I...

296
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,720
Let's go.

297
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:41,880
Fine.

298
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,470
Go!

299
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,390
Go!

300
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,210
Just go!

301
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:06,970
Love?

302
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,720
But I haven't had

303
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,610
a taste of love.

304
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,910
Chubby Su.

305
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,410
When are you coming back?

306
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,940
Come back soon.

307
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,860
Boss, good news.

308
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,260
Say it again.

309
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,770
No. 128, Xishan Villa. It's said that

310
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,950
it's a popular place to lose weight.

311
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,350
The boss is

312
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,320
strange but really good.

313
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,030
Don't let me catch you.

314
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:27,770
Chubby...

315
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,920
Come on.

316
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,060
Come on.

317
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,110
Tang Su, you can do it.

318
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,640
Come on. Come on.

319
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,190
Come on! Come on!

320
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,220
You can do it.

321
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,089
♫Can we depict ourselves in the story♫

322

♫With the tone of our first encounter?♫

I met you.

However, you met me

327

♫Interesting souls with the equally sincere gaze♫

328

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,610
Although you didn't look down upon me,

330

♫Let time freeze and be made a negative for us to keep♫

331
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,230
I was more ordinary than a stone.

332
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,910
But I got frightened

333
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,820
