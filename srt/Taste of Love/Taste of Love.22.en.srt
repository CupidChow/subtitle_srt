I haven't been home for a long time.

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,030
I wonder how he is.

Remember.

They have

13

a secret room in their house.

14
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,090
One day,

15
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,240
I took a peek.

16
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,950
He was playing darts.

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,039
He aimed at Tangsu.

18
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:57,850
Well.

19
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:58,990
Is he...

20
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,520
Is he mentally ill?

21
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,360
Or is he a pervert?

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,310
The people online

23
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,170

They list information clearly.

28
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,320
But I think the most interesting thing

29
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,600
is this comment.

30
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,970
It says that you should break up.

31
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,680
Why did he say that?

32
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,990
Remember.

33
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,880

and treated like garbage.

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,610
As a legit girlfriend,

37
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,010
this thing happens to you,

38
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,260
the less you react

39
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,020
and shout,

40

42
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:36,840
So,

43
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,270
from now on,

44
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,820
you'd better keep a low profile.

have two days free.

50
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,710
I don't think I can take two days of rest.

51
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,220
That's fine.

52
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,260
Then we'll make more money.

You may have forgotten me.

for disturbing you.

65

We still have some doubts

66
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,730
about the thing that happened to Huangfu Jue.

Of course.

Your mother came.

She finally found

110
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,200
the most suitable excuse.

111
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:37,810
No.

112
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,260
It's not an excuse.

113
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,010
It's a bargaining chip.

114
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,020
Your mother is really cautious.

115
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,190
She drew up a contract specially

116
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,850
for this kind of thing.

117

You've finally gotten your career back.

122

I don't want you

123

to fall again because of me.

124

I have nothing now.

and you want to kick me away.

131

Huangfu Jue, how great you are.

132

134
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,900
I will agree without hesitation.

135
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,020
But if you want to break up with me,

136
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,790
just because you don't want to implicate me,

I will never allow you

to sign this agreement.

139
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,190

Wait a minute.

150

Okay, you may begin.

151
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,850
The rumors online

152
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,820
are all fake.

153
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,909
Huangfu Jue and I

154
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,280
are just an ordinary couple.

155
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,400
Our lives are stable and wonderful.

156
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,450
And we won't split up

157
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,590
because of

158
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,190
any fake news.

159
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,740
I hope you won't believe

160
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,510
and spread rumors.

161
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,880
And treat all rumors

162
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,260
with a rational attitude.

163
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,070
Right!

164
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,930
Thank you for your concern.

165
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,590
We're doing well now.

166
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,799

Okay.

172
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,420
I'll be quick.

173
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,280
Time to eat.

174
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,290
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

175
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,270
Yummy.

176

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,530
Is it that delicious?

178
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,690
Of course.

179
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,270
But I found something.

180
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,950
It turns out

181
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,440
that the way you eat has nothing to do with education.

182
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,330
It's only about hunger.

183
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,340
By the way.

184
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,330
Isn't this the rent I gave you?

185
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,410
This is now the living expenses I give you.

186
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,840
I don't need it. Keep it for yourself.

187
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,720
You may kill me, but you may never insult me.

188
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:09,910
How could I

189
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,030
use women's money?

190
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,280
Yours either.

191
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,810
You have some backbone.

192
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,360
I'm going to look for a job tomorrow.

193
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,160
Really?

194
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,750
Can you find it

195

196
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,310
After all,

197
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,300
I graduated from a prestigious university

198
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,480
and have been CEO for many years.

199
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,960
Is it hard

200
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,590
to find a job?

201
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,720
Don't worry.

You are so great.

I'll wash the dishes today.

Don't worry about it.

209

Get some rest.

210
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,730
Can you talk like that for the first time?

211
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,930

instead of on the sofa?

Only when you rest well

can you have a good spirit

No.

346
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,230
No.

347
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,020
200,000 yuan.

348
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,000
20,000 yuan.

349
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,580
What does it mean?

350
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,730
What project only costs 20,000 yuan?

351
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,590
The cover shoot.

352
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,970
The job will be taking two artists

353
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,900
to take photos in the studio.

354
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,380
But 20,000 yuan,

355
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,590
it's not even enough to rent equipments.

356
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,290
I have no choice.

357
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,680
Our company

358
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,220
is small.

359
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,240
The environment is not good now.

360
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,730
Right now,

361
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,280
we'll take the project

362
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,140
as long as we can make money.

363
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,290
I don't think

364
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,210
it's about the bad environment

365
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,810
but your management.

366
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,870
When I came in,

367
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,740
the employees outside

368
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,850
seemed busy,

369
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,640
but actually, they were killing time

370
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,240
by watching dramas, playing games and looking in the mirror.

371
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,950
As the CEO,

372
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,340
you would rather sit

373
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,360
and complain in the office.

374
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,130
But you don't think about how

375
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,460
to make the company bigger and stronger.

376
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,570
I don't think you need

377
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,450
to hire a project manager.

378
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:55,700
You should change

379
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,260
the CEO.

380
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,020
I don't want to hire you.

381
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,140
[Resume]

382
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,839
Okay, I got it.

383
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,579
What did he say?

384
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,819
He has gone to a crappy company

385
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,589
for an interview.

386
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,339
Really?

387
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,900
He has

388
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,480
come to this point.

389
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,320
It's all for Tang Su.

390
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,980
A CEO

391
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,100
is raised by his girlfriend.

392
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,880
It's embarrassing.

393
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,190
Ain't love grand?

394
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,510
I'm so jealous.

395
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,600
But I think it's good.

396
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,170
Clear a barrier.

397
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,300
In this way,

398
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,550
It's better for

399
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,300
our plan.

400
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,170
Come here.

401
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,620
Why are you here?

402
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,600
I'm about to go out.

403
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,430
No need.

404
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,790
You didn't get the part

405
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,240
in the new drama.

406
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,800
Why?

407
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,010
That character

408
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,150
is a modern and inspirational woman.

409
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,900
After getting married, she took care of internal and external affairs.

410
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,530
And she found her husband had an affair,

411
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,580
but she didn't compromise.

412
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,460
She

413
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,330
decided to divorce.

414
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,570
She took care of her child

415
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,900
and built a wonderful life.

416
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,260
The producer said

417
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,440
that you are not suitable.

418
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,310
Do they react so quickly?

419
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,330
Are you new?

420
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:32,930
That day at the door,

421
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,980
you announced all things

422
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,310
to the world.

423
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,350
Why didn't you think of this?

424
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,250
I'm sorry, Wu.

425
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,260
I got you into trouble.

426
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,700
Forget it.

427
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,120
I didn't expect it.

428
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,590
I was so happy

429
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,670
to see that.

430
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,130
You have become

431
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:49,870
an old-fashioned woman

432
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,300
who only compromises

433
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,210
and has no principles,

with personality.

437
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,630
People are saying

438
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,130
that they really want

439
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,940
a girlfriend like you

440
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,490
who can think about the big picture.

441
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,830
Good taste.

442
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,590
Is this a compliment?

443
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,450
Good taste.

444
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,660
You are so generous.

445
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,590
I'm not generous.

446
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,560
I only wear

447
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,870
25-size pants.

448
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,110
You must be joking.

449
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,910
I'm going out for a while.

450
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,610
You go back first.

451
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,380
Is it so hasty?

452
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,490
You know what?

453
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,660
The drink from the Internet-famous restaurant

454
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,390
is quite good.

455
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,520
I already had it.

456
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,910
You're too outdated.

457
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,710
Why didn't you buy it for me?

458
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,210
Would you drink it if I bought it for you?

459
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,260
Boss.

460
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:57,780
Why are you

461
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,800
applying for a job?

462
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
To make money.

463
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,930
I don't think so.

464
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,950
Although you were removed from the company,

465
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,190
you still hold a lot of shares.

466
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,100
Don't talk too much.

467
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,040
Let everyone know

468
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,720
that I'm finding a job.

469
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,100
Okay.

470

471

how is the investigation going?

472
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,490
It's time

473
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,360
to do something for Jue.

474
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,370

I'm not here to confront you.

to release the video.

things would come to this either.
