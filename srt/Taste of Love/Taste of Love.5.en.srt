174
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,200
♫I close my eyes♫

175
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,790
♫and enjoy the baptism of years♫

176
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,480
you'll never be afraid.

177
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,660
♫Even a diamond ring can't replace♫

178
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,890
Your boss.

179
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,560
I'll protect you.

180
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,160
♫The most sincere and deepest memory♫

181
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:07,240
♫It's more beautiful than the fireworks♫

182
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,220
Life is wonderful.

183
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,890
When you think you're

184
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,210
at your worst,

185
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,680
life will give you a surprise star as a gift.

186
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,850
So,

187
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,030
everything is going to get better.

188
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,570
Maybe I can even go back to my previous life.

189
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,780
-Su! -Su!

190
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,260
-You're so pretty! So pretty!

191
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,020
I love you!

192
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,370
Me too.

193
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,750
Can I have your autograph?

194
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,000
Look here! I'm here!

195
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,450
So beautiful!

196
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,610
So beautiful!

197
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,500
-Su! -Su!

198
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,890
-Su! You're so cute.

199
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,850
-That's not her. -Let's go.

200
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,570
Go.

201
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,010
Who is it?

202
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,240
Over there!

203
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,250
Mengmeng!

204
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,840
-Mengmeng! -Mengmeng!

205
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,390
-Mengmeng! -Mengmeng!

206
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,430
I love you so much, Mengmeng!

207
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,420
Mengmeng!

208
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,190
There's no time for thinking of the past.

209
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,010
I'd better run away.

210
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,530
Why are you running?

211
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,680
I need to go to the toilet!

212
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,220
-Mengmeng. -Mengmeng.

213
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:35,960
What should I do?

214
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,100
Should I leave or stay?

215
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,720
What reason will you

216
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,360
give your boss for leaving?

217
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,480
But if you choose to stay,

218
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,550
how can you explain it to your boss

219
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,060
if Mengmeng sees you through?

220
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,140
I think my appearance

221
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,800
has changed a lot.

222
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,910
And now I have a lot of experience

223
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,660
in disguises.

224
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,370
Mengmeng can't recognize me

225
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,170
if I'm careful enough.

226
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,620
You don't even believe

227
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,790
what you said.

228
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,780
However,

229
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,200
even if she recognizes you,

230
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,240
it won't matter.

231
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,350
Isn't she your best friend?

232
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,750
You're right.

233
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,130
What you need to do now

234
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,240
is to wait quietly.

235
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,380
But I'd never

236
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,250
done such a thing before.

237
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,720
Why did they write that?

238
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,000
I'd never done this before.

239
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,590
Su.

240
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,760
I can explain it.

241
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,820
What should I do?

242
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,290
Su, don't worry.

243
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,230
Mr Luo will find

244
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,380
a perfect solution.

245
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,540
But now the thing

246
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,100
has gone too far.

247
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,670
All my announcements and endorsements

248
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,740
have been cancelled.

249
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:38,840
If this continues,

250
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,610
I can't imagine

251
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,590
what will happen.

252
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:41,860
No.

253
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,360
I have to disclose

254
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,180
the truth right now.

255
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,000
Because I

256
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,100
was wronged!

257
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,050
I know.

258
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,940
How about this?

259
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,710
I have a reporter friend who

260
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,130
is very influential in the industry.

261
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
I'll ask him out

262
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,280
for your exclusive clarifying interview.

263
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
It might work.

264
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,320
Really? That's great.

265
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,880
Thank you, Mengmeng.

266
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,560
You're right.

267
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,750
She helped me a lot.

268
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,170
Never mind.

269
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,740
We should take things as they come.

270
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,170
I should be flexible.

271
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,080
This "flexible"

272
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,390
comes too fast!

273
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,680
Excuse me.

274
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,770
I guess she didn't recognize me.

275
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,680
Forget it. I'll find the boss first.

276
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,060
So you are Tang Su.

277
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,360
No wonder you look so familiar.

278
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,800
Chubby Su and Tang Su...

279
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:48,920
Miss Tong.

280
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:49,750
Why are you here?

281
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,350
Are you going to report the problem of Tang Su

282
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,390
to Huangfu Jue?

283
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,650
So you already knew.

284
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,470
Will you promise me

285
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,120
if I ask you to

286
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,390
keep it a secret?

287
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,390
Well,

288
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,490
you'd better give me

289
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
a good reason.

290
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,840
Is that enough?

291
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:14,900
No?

292
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,030
I have more.

293
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,360
Hello.

294
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,250
May I ask where are you going?

295
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,940
I'm looking for Huangfu Jue.

296
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,370
Who are you?

297
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,780
I'm his assistant.

298
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,270
Those who want to enter

300
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,690
are more like assistants than you.

301
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,090
Come on,

302
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,590
I'm really his assistant.

303
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,200
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,570
I really can't let you in.

305
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,380
We have rules.

306
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,440
-How about you call my boss? -Sir.

307
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,600
Let her go.

308
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,670
I know her.

309
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,480
Yes, Miss Mengmeng.

310
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,200
I have something else to do...

311
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,780
Let me take you in.

312
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,000
Are you Mr. Huangfu's assistant?

313
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,340
Then...

314
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,840
You should know who I am.

315
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,400
You're a superstar.

316
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,880
Of course I know.

317
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,270
How long have you been

318
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,010
Mr. Huangfu's assistant?

319
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,330
Not very long.

320
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,080
It's just...

321
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,490
Boss! Boss!

322
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,470
What took you so long?

323
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,730
I was blocked outside.

324
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,620
Hello, Mr. Huangfu.

325
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:24,950
Hello.

326
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,060
Thanks to Miss Yu's help.

327
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,970
Thank you, Miss Yu.

328
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,460
Mr. Huangfu,

329
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,550
didn't you recognize me?

330
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,180
Did I?

331
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,790
Miss Yu.

332
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,810
How's your preparation today?

333
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,680
What kind of dishes

334
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,580
have you prepared today?

335
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,720
I prepared Pink and Green Rice Noodles

336
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,670
and Red Bean Egg Cakes.

337
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,470
Have you tried them?

338
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,830
She scared me.

339
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,510
How was my performance?

340
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,110
Wasn't I enthusiastic

341
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,420
and decent?

342
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,910
Forget it.

343
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,790
You didn't even recognize her.

344
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,850
Don't talk nonsense.

345
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,540
I'm a rational fan.

346
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,250
Rational?

347
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,140
I don't want to talk with you.

348
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,220
Can't you learn from her?

349
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,270
Tender and cute.

350
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,520
She's like an angel in the world.

351
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,550
Yes.

352
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,180
Now the angel

353
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,740
is right in front of you.

354
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,120
You're playing aloof instead.

355
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,940
Hurry up and confess to her.

356
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,920
I'll go.

357
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,360
Go!

358
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,650
I'll go right now.

359
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,070
Hurry up.

360
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,300
I'm going.

361
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,360
Why are you still here?

362
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,220
Mengmeng!

363
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,070
Miss Mengmeng, what should we do?

364
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,829
Miss Mengmeng's assistant

365
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,550
hurt her hand.

366
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,270
But don't worry.

367
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,770
We're working on it.

368
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,069
Mengmeng, are you okay?

369
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,130
Sorry.

370
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,800
I may not be able to

371
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,720
record today.

372
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,329
But...

373
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,260
But everything else

374
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,359
is ready.

375
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,440
The live stream will begin soon.

376
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,940
But I need my assistant

377
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,589
to cook for me.

378
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,410
She's injured now.

379
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
I'm so sorry.

380
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,650
I'm so sorry.

381
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,510
Mengmeng, don't worry.

382
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,650
I'll help you.

383
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,270
Mr. Li,

384
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,230
do we have any other options?

385
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,240
Try to contact them.

386
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,370
Okay. I'll try to contact them.

387
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,990
Who else can

388
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,860
cook the dishes

389
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,620
on today's menu?

390
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,260
Can you?

391
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,070
Can you?

392
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,480
No.

393
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,280
Can you?

394
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,770
I can't.

395
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,790
Miss,

396
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,200
can you cook?

397
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,200
Yeah. How could I forget it?

398
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,040
She can cook,

399
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,040
and she's very good at it.

400
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:00,930
Chubby Su,

401
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,040
go!

402
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,650
Please.

403
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,090
Show up for a variety show?

404
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,980
I'd better tell everyone who I am directly.

405
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,130
I-I really can't.

406
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,680
Mr. Huangfu.

407
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,290
A variety show

408
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,310
contains the efforts of all the staff.

409
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,720
And also, if today we can't begin

410
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,700
the live stream on time,

411
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,320
it will affect the broadcasting of the TV station.

412
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,370
Besides,

413
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,230
this is a project of your company.

414
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,040
Please.

415
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,100
Please ask your assistant

416
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,290
to help us.

417
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:31,810
Chubby Su,

418
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,290
don't be shy.

419
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,880
I believe you can do it.

420
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,180
Is that because I'm shy?

421
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,240
I...

422
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,480
I'll give you 2 months' salary as your bonus.

423
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,010
Okay.

424
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,310
But...

425
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,650
I have a request.

426
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,460
Today

427
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,580
we are honored to invite

428
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,520
Yu Mengmeng here.

429
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,270
Mengmeng,

430
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,590
please introduce yourself.

431
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,700
Hello.

432
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,560
Hello, everyone.

433
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,420
I'm today's food ambassador

434
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,160
of God of Gourmet.

435
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,800
Next, let me introduce

436
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,980
this person to you.

437
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,590
She is my food assistant today,

438
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,350
Chubby Su.

439
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,310
Chubby Su,

440
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,970
please say hello to everyone.

441
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,080
Mengmeng,

442
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,370
your assistant seems very special.

443
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,390
Are your dishes today

444
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,340
special too?

445
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,010
Today I'll

446
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
show you

447
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,630
a specialty cuisine, which is

448
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,820
Pink and Green Rice Noodles.

449
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,740
Then please introduce

450
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,520
your ingredients first.

451
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,420
The most important ingredient

452
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,350
is a fresh piece of chicken.

453
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,210
I regret agreeing.

454
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,270
Standing in front of the camera with a doll costume,

455
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,360
I look like a fool.

456
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,370
Chubby Su is good.

457
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,160
She's not nervous at all standing up there.

458
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,200
Who says I'm not nervous?

459
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,410
I can't mess it up.

460
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:56,890
Mengmeng,

461
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,170
you're usually so busy with work.

462
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,790
I guess you don't have time to cook for yourself, right?

463
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,880
Of course I can't

464
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,950
be the same as before.

465
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:03,980
But

466
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
if there's an important festival

467
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,150
or for someone important,

468
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,910
I'll cook by myself.

469
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,120
Someone important?

470
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,170
Is he Superstar Lu?

471
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,200
Mr. Huangfu,

472
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,830
This fat girl

473
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,940
is good at cooking.

474
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,660
What's more,

475
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,330
she performs well in front of the camera.

476
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,480
She also knows how to design poses.

477
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,590
Not bad.

478
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,830
Of course.

479
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,610
My girl is great.

480
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,690
Have you finished?

481
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,580
The smell is so good.

482
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,670
Yes.

483
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,690
It smells good.

484
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,090
Very good.

485
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,790
A bowl of Pink and Green Rice noodles

486
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,580
is ready.

487
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,440
No wonder it's called Pink and Green Rice Noodles.

488
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,570
The colors are

489
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,430
very rich.

490
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,690
It can get 95 points

491
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,840
only by its appearance.

492
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,930
As for its taste,

493
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,970
let's have a try.

494
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,040
So delicious!

495
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,540
I remember you only added vinegar.

496
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,240
Why does the soup taste

497
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,780
so good?

498
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,960
That's because

499
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,600
we added some secret ingredients.

500
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,000
We...

501
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,530
We added

502
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,050
some local mushrooms in Yunnan

503
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,480
as seasoning.

504
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,580
What's wrong with Mengmeng?

505
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,230
The mushrooms are seasoning.

506
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,390
What's wrong?

507
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,300
Mengmeng, what's wrong?

508
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,180
What's wrong with her?

509
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,590
What's wrong with you?

510
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Are you okay?

511
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,910
If I take off my costume,

512
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,780
everyone will see my face.

513
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,300
There's no time for hesitation.

514
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:47,910
What's the matter?

515
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,620
What did you add to it?

516
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,770
I added... I didn't!

517
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,350
What happened?

518
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,990
-Mengmeng! -Mengmeng!

519
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,890
Alright, stop surrounding.

520
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,790
Go away.

521
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,230
Move.

522
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,210
Mengmeng, are you okay?

523
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,420
I'm so worried.

524
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,450
Chubby Su,

525
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,110
no matter what you encountered

526
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,530
in the past,

527
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,080
I hope from now on,

528
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,740
you won't be afraid anymore.

529
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,570
Your boss.

530
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,050
I'll protect you.

531
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,350
Don't take

532
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,930
things too seriously.

533
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,540
I always get myself in trouble.

534
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,760
How could I be protected by someone?
