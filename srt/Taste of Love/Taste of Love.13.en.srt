00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,050
Is your foot okay?

173
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:45,920
I'm fine.

174
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,860
Chubby Su!

175
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,010
I'm here!

176
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,400
Are you an idiot?

177
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,700
It's raining heavily.

178
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,530
What are you doing here?

179
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,660
I'm looking for something.

180
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,160
It's raining.

181
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,420
Do you want to go to the hospital again?

182
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,020
Why didn't you take your phone?

183
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,550
All right.

184
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,400
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,750
I didn't mean it.

186
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,770
What happened to your leg?

187
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,500
None of your business.

188
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,560
I'll teach you a lesson after we get back.

189
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,380
Go out first.

190
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,020
Slow down. Don't slip.

191
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,280
Why is it locked?

192
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:47,860
Auntie!

193
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,590
Auntie!

194
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,170
Chubby Su, step back.

195
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,110
Stop kicking. Watch your feet!

196
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,050
You stay here with Su.

197
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,260
I'll go find the staff.

198
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:02,850
Okay.

199
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,800
What happened to your hand?

200
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,130
How did you get hurt?

201
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:12,750
I'm fine.

202
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,070
I cut my hand on the wire entanglement.

203
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,260
Let me see.

204
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,910
I'm fine.

205
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,730
You're always so reckless.

206
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,960
I can't even leave you alone

207
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,810
for a moment, right?

208
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,500
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,120
I lost the chain bracelet

210
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,860
you gave me.

211
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,960
So you stay here until midnight

212
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,900
just for a bracelet?

213
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,130
It's just a bracelet.

214
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,310
I can buy you another one.

215
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,060
But that was the first gift

216
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,120
you gave me.

217
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,090
I wonder someone

218
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,080
picked it up.

219
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,730
I've been looking for it for a long time.

220
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,930
Are you an idiot?

221
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,450
It's no big deal,

222
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,810
but you can't endanger yourself.

223
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,400
But that was

224
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,460
the first warmth you gave me

225
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,850
when I hit the lowest point in my life,

226
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,880
and nobody cared about me.

227
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,570
But now I lost it.

228
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,770
I'll find it for you.

229
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,720
What are you doing, Huangfu Jue?

230
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,570
Get down. It's too dangerous!

231
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,090
Stop that!

232
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,200
Come down!

233
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,720
It's dangerous!

234
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,190
Get down. It's too dangerous!

235
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,080
Stop crawling.

236
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,200
Wait for me inside.

237
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,920
Please come down.

238
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,130
It's too dangerous.

239
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,100
I can't bear

240
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,200
to leave you alone in there.

241
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,390
Stop crawling. I beg you.

242
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,150
Be careful!

243
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,220
Huangfu Jue! Are you okay?

244
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,810
How do you feel? Do you have any pain?

245
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,790
Let me check.

246
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,530
Do you have a fracture?

247
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,670
How do you feel?

248
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,490
I'm so useless.

249
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,770
Don't scare me.

250
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,800
What's wrong?

251
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,000
I told you to

252
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,190
stop crawling!

253
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,110
But you insisted!

254
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,990
What if you have a fracture?

255
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,030
If anything terrible happens to you,

256
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,090
what should I do?

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,640
If I fell to death,

258
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,720
you would lose your boyfriend.

259
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,820
♫The most beloved, the dearly beloved♫

260
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,930
Where did you find it?

261
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,130
♫For whom do you keep your naïvety?♫

262
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,680
When I fell just now,

263
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,660
♫Learn to be grateful in laughter and tears♫

264
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,760
I saw it was over there.

265
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,470
Isn't it

266
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,240
a coincidence?

267
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,480
It's so annoying. Who put it there?

268
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,240
♫The happiest person, the lucky person♫

269
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,320
I've been looking for it for so long.

270
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,230
♫Is also a brave person♫

271
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:45,780
♫Bravely chase and seize the fate that is slipping away♫

272
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,520
Chubby Su,

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,240
this bracelet is not that important.

274
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,090
♫Even if our love is not as deep as the sea♫

275
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,800
What counts most is that

276
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,680
you're by my side.

277
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,040
♫It takes root in every inch of my heart♫

278
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,000
♫To my beloved♫

279
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,110
Let me help you up.

280
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,620
What's wrong?

281
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,350
Why is my head so warm?

282
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,550
Huangfu Jue?

283
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,140
What's wrong, Huangfu Jue?

284
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,060
Don't scare me!

285
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,180
Wake up!

286
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,040
Lu Yanzhi!

287
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,550
Lu Yanzhi!

288
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,220
Anyone? Help!

289
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,480
Wake up!

290
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
Don't scare me.

291
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,520
Help!

292
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,500
Hello?

293
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,520
Hello, Chi Ye.

294
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,790
Come and save your boss.

295
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,700
What happened to him?

296
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:06,970
Nothing.

297
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,940
It's Su.

298
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,790
She's locked in the basketball court.

299
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:17,230
♫Who has accompanied me through my youth♫

300
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,230
No wonder neither of them

301
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,050
answered their phones.

302
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,460
Send me their address.

303
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,570
I'll be right there.

304
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,130
Remember to bring some lock picks.

305
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:17,730
Okay.

306
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,170
It hurts.

307
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,330
Why hasn't Lu Yanzhi arrived yet?

308
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,540
Wait for me.

309
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,480
I'll go and find someone for help.

310
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,550
Chubby Su,

311
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,430
don't leave.

312
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,440
I'm not leaving. I'm just looking for someone.

313
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,980
You have to go to the hospital right now,

314
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,640
okay?

315
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:01,950
Chubby Su,

316
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,640
forgive me.

317
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,619
I won't misunderstand you anymore.

318
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,069
I won't impose my thoughts

319
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,190
on you.

320
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,230
It's all my fault.

321
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,619
I'm just an ignorant, arrogant

322
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,180
and short-tempered person.

323
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,140
Stop talking.

324
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,760
I always make you unhappy

325
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,540
without even realizing it.

326
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,250
Sometimes,

327
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,970
I feel like

328
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm not capable of love.

329
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,440
I'm not sure

330
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,810
whether you

331
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,060
like me or not.

332
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:48,980
I think...

333
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,940
I like you.

334
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,650
What did you say?

335
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,060
I like you.

336
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,720
What's going on?

337
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,930
I haven't found any staff.

338
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,980
Did you bring the tool?

339
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,180
Wu takes it.

340
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm holding it.

341
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:20,730
Here.
