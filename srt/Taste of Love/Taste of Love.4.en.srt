Is she

your maid?

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,770
She is my assistant.

9
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,560
I just think

10
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,140
that she looks a little familiar.

11
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,420
She looks like a friend of mine.

12
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,760
Fine, Su. I will let you pretend.

have the right to choose now?

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,110
I can hardly afford to pay the rent.

20
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,180
Then tell me

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,900
where you have been these days,

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,460
what you have been doing,

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,180
why you have grown so fat,

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,460
and why you didn't ask me for help if you were in trouble.

25
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:19,340
Shh…

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,780
All right, all right, Wu.

27
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,930
You asked a bunch of questions.

28
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,140
I can't answer all of them

29

32

is quite good.

And I really

34
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,420
need this job.

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,890
Fine.

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,540
Anyway,

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,090
I've met you this time.

38
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:42,820
I absolutely won't

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,560
let you get away again.

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
How much is your rent?

41
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,829
Let me help you

42
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,600
solve the immediate difficulty first.

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,110
Wu.

44
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,300
You are still so nice to me.

45
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,720
But you still ghosted me

46
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,340
even if you know I'm nice?

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,520
I was wrong.

48
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,740
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,670
I want to ransom her.

50
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:08,920
Name a price.

51
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,430
Do you two know each other very well?

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,850
I just went to the bathroom.

53
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,550
How did everything become like this?

54
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,010
We two…

55
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,040
Just now,

56
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,100
I was chatting with Miss Tong.

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,740
Miss Tong said

58
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,120
that she is in great need of a maid.

59
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,290
Did you forget

60
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,329
that we had a contract?

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,180
Boss.

62
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,410
I absolutely won't job-hop.

63
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,990
You…

64
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,710
Miss Tong.

65
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,360
Thank you for your kindness.

66
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,490
I suddenly feel thirsty.

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,110
Do you have coffee here?

68
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,130
You…

69
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,740
Sorry, Miss Tong.

70
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,710
Is this

71
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,080
the legendary

72
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,540
love at first sight?

73
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,590
My heart is beating out of my chest.

74
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,710
Miss Tong.

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,450
Miss Tong.

76
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,540
How do you know my surname is Tong?

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,740
Have we met before?

78
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,380
Hello.

79
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,490
I am Chi Ye.

80
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,070
It's my honor to meet you.

81
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,360
Hello, Mr. Chi.

82
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,659
Why does he keep staring at me?

83
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,040
Is she…

84
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,870
Look at me. Look at me.

85
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,190
Yes! He looked at me.

86
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,620
Well.

87
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,280
You come on a blind date with me

88
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,480
but you are actually looking at my assistant.

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,580
Don't just stand there.

90
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,790
Come and sit for a while.

91
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:01,610
Okay.

92
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,810
Come here and sit, too.

93
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,330
Do you feel hot?

94
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,260
Would you like some water?

95
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:16,750
Thank you.

96
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,530
Have some water, too.

97
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,560
By the way,

98
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,140
do you normally learn about the signs of the zodiac?

99
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,620
I'm a Leo.

100
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,230
I'm a Sagittarius, Miss Tong.

101
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,570
What a coincidence!

102
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,890
We are both fire signs.

103
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,130
Actually,

104
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,900
you don't need to call me Miss Tong.

105
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,460
Just call me Wu.

106
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,080
I'm 22. I was born in the Year of the Rabbit.

107
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,030
I'm 162 cm tall.

108
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,200
Why don't you talk about

109
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,360
your usual hobby?

110
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,880
My usual hobby

111
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,850
is reading the scripts of murder mystery games,

112
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,080
the ones about solving puzzles and criminal cases.

113
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,490
Really? What a coincidence!

114
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,600
Do you like it too?

115
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,650
Our boss likes it too.

116
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,159
We can play together sometime.

117
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,450
But those are too simple.

118
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,700
I have finished all of them long ago.

119
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,710
We can continue to play the scary ones

120
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,520
if you are done with the ones

121
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,480
about solving puzzles and criminal cases.

122
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,130
Those with NPCs (non-player characters)?

123
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,590
Yes.

124
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,590
I heard that many players

125
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,060
were so scared that they developed psychosis.

126
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,550
Recently, I have a case.

127
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,200
It's about my friend.

128
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,260
Do you know?

129
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,210
She was wronged

130
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,200
by another friend of mine.

131
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
Do you know how wretched

132
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,140
her life has been lately?

133
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,200
She not only lost her job

134
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,790
but was also cheated.

135
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,290
And she owed so much money

136
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,760
that she even has to sell herself now.

137
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,300
I clearly know that she was wronged,

138
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,850
but I have no evidence.

139
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:43,870
What's the matter with you?

140
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,940
Did you catch a cold?

141
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,830
Do you need me to take you to the hospital?

142
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,430
I…

143
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,490
I'm fine. I just choked.

144
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,980
No. You have to go.

145
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,100
Don't you have a meeting

146
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:53,830
in half an hour?

147
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,770
What meeting?

148
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,340
There's a meeting.

149
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,300
Yes…

150
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,430
Go now. Go quickly.

151
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,720
Work is more important.

152
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,160
Let's go.

153
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,770
Sorry.

154
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,660
Don't you have a meeting?

155
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,540
Hurry up.

156
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,990
I…

157
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,790
Why did you drag me away?

158
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,400
You were the one who wanted to leave first, okay?

159
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,350
Besides, you do have a meeting later.

160
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,340
That's because I felt like

161
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,300
you were on the blind date.

162
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,080
Miss Tong is indeed quite good.

163
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,350
She's cute and straightforward.

164
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,430
And she looks prettier than she is on TV.

165
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,020
Is there any difference?

166
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,760
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,820
It is indeed too hard for you.

168
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,610
You are the only one

169
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,530
who knows about this.

170
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,390
He has face blindness?

171
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,310
That's why.

172
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,350
He has met me several times,

173
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,550
but he always acted as if he had never seen me.

174
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,780
Not only is he unable to recognize you,

175
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,330
but he is also even unable to recognize his mother.

176
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,800
This is the last time.

177
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,760
Don't make me go on blind dates again.

178
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:05,720
I don't have that much time

179
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,880
to deal with those women.

180
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,490
Even if you give me all the islands

181
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,290
in the Pacific Ocean,

182
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,440
I won't go on a blind date again.

183
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:12,950
What's wrong?

184
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,990
Why don't you talk?

185
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,470
Madam.

186
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,290
Young Master's face blindness is getting worse and worse.

187
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,780
He doesn't even recognize you.

188
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,670
[Medical Records]

189
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,799
So,

190
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,900
he doesn't know

191
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,809
that you are Tang Su yet.

192
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,260
I have gained so much weight.

193
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,060
Even the most familiar people around me

194
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,270
might not be able to recognize me,

195
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,180
not to mention him.

196
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:49,980
Right.

197
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,760
So, tell me first.

198
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,120
You have disappeared for so long.

199
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,910
What have you been doing since then?

200
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,150
Why have you grown so fat?

201
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,110
There are benefits of being fat.

202
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,140
I won't be afraid of the cold in winter.

203
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,250
I don't need to worry about losing weight either.

204
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,570
I can eat whatever I want.

205
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,470
What?

206
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,710
Do you mean

207
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,530
that you are not going to lose weight?

208
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,780
You will just give up on yourself?

209
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,530
That's not what I meant, either.

210
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,830
I really don't understand.

211
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,670
What on earth is so good

212
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,930
about Huangfu Jue

213
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,240
that a former superstar

214
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
is totally willing to be his maid?

215
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,570
Su,

216
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,720
you shouldn't be like this.

217
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,610
I can help you if you want to leave.

218
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,250
If Huangfu Jue doesn't let you go,

219
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,130
I will confront him to the end.

220
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,430
It has nothing to do with him.

221
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,500
It's just that incident before…

222
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,840
You know that those matters before

223
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,580
were false.

224
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,580
How can you

225
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,230
let the rumors and gossip

226
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,680
get you down?

227
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,700
Although that incident

228
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,360
has been a long time ago,

229
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,950
now

230
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,550
I am still

231
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,640
in the eye of the storm.

232
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,720
If I am a bit careless,

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,470
someone will mention it

234
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,150
and trample over me again.

235
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,010
Huangfu Jue cannot recognize me,

236
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,390
that's exactly why his house is like a safe haven.

237
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,610
It makes me feel safe.

238
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,180
A safe haven?

239
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,500
He has such a bad temper.

240
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,550
Can you have a good time

241
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,630
in his house?

242
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,420
Actually, he treats me

243
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,130
in a way that isn't bad.

244
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,100
Look.

245
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,660
I don't have an educational background.

246
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,600
Nor do I have work experience.

247
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,100
Besides singing and dancing,

248
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,110
I can do nothing else.

249
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,460
Working in his house

250
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,890
allows me to broaden my horizons

251
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,250
by seeing the things that I don't usually see.

252
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,070
Moreover,

253
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,540
he said

254
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,370
that he would arrange

255
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,870
a more promising job for me in the future.

256
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,380
What?

257
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,440
Is he willing to invest in

258
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,430
a cleaning company?

259
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,220
I really don't understand.

260
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,180
Anyway,

261
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,470
you owe me

262
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,630
a reason that can convince me.

263
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,450
Fine.

264
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,620
In fact,

265
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,460
the real purpose of my stay

266
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,450
in the Huangfu family

267
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,150
is to become the goodwife of the household

268
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,500
someday in the future,

269
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,020
then the person and the company

270
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,980
will both be mine.

271
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,110
Nice. That's it.

272
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,690
I surrender.

273
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,710
I'm going to the bathroom.

274
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,710
Okay. I'll wait for you at the door.

275
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,500
Miss Tong.

276
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,140
What a coincidence.

277
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,020
I said,

278
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,620
you can just call me Wu.

279
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,130
Okay.

280
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,070
Today, I'm really sorry

281
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,460
that my boss had to go to a meeting all of a sudden.

282
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,900
It's okay.

283
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,180
I was just here

284
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:31,910
as a mere formality.

285
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,760
Your company is quite big.

286
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,980
Yes. Haven't you been here before?

287
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,010
No.

288
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,240
You didn't sign me to your company.

289
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,870
Didn't Leo Culture

290
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,980
steal a march on us?

291
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,530
By the way,

292
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,060
your contract

293
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,920
hasn't expired yet, right?

294
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:50,990
Not yet.

295
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,620
But if I want to terminate the contract,

296
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,290
I can do so anytime.

297
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,170
At worst,

298
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,320
I will pay the contractual penalty.

299
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,750
Wu.

300
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,930
Wu.

301
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,730
Wu.

302
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,740
The escape room with NPCs that you were talking about earlier,

303
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,640
what is that?

304
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,320
Have you played that before?

305
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,150
Yes.

306
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,730
There are several levels,

307
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,040
such as not-very-scary

308
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,320
and semi-scary.

309
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,570
There are also super-scary ones.

310
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,840
Those are terrifying!

311
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,570
Wu.

312
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,350
Wu.

313
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,320
Wu…

314
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,290
Time Entertainment

315
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,570
and Leo Culture, the company you are from,

316
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,150
are the two leaders of the industry.

317
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,240
Time Entertainment invests in fields like movies, dramas,

318
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,990
artist management, albums,

319
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,430
entertainment marketing and so on.

320
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,540
Now,

321
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,690
it mainly operates three sections.

322
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,160
They are film and television entertainment sections

323
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,930
represented by business

324
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,470
like artist management and more.

325
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,470
Let me show you around

326
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,320
our recording studio.

327
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,410
Sure.

328
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,810
Yanzhi.

329
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,090
Who are you?

330
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,050
Sorry, I'm in the wrong place.

331
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,270
Who exactly are you?

332
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,410
I… I'm your fan.

333
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,440
I was passing by and was just curious so I came in to take a look.

334
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,200
Then why would you

335
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,130
have this chain bracelet with you?

336
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,950
This is originally mine.

337
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,970
You are lying.

338
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,530
This is the chain bracelet

339
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,330
that I gave to my friend.

340
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,290
It has her name abbreviation

341
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,050
engraved on it.

342
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,810
Where did you get it?

343
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,120
This is…

344
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,640
Someone gave it to me.

345
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,330
Someone?

346
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,410
You know Tang Su?

347
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,550
What Tang Su?

348
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,060
I don't know what you are talking about.

349
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,180
Then why would you

350
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,220
have her stuff?

351
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,270
You know where she is, right?

352
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:48,330
[Recording Studio]

353
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,940
Tell me where she is.

354
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,720
Tell me where on earth she is.

355
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,050
Why are you looking for Tang Su?

356
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,290
There's something

357
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,380
I must ask her in person.

358
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,680
Please tell me

359
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,210
her contact information.

360
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:04,910
Thank you.

361
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,260
Since

362
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,990
she has been avoiding you,

363
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,240
maybe she doesn't want to see you at all.

364
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,240
Sorry, I can't help you.

365
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,820
Who exactly are you?

366
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:23,980
Let go!

367
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,820
You haven't answered my question yet.

368
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,080
Don't touch her.

369
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,570
This is my business.

370
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,660
Boss, I hope you will stay out of it.

371
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,060
She works for me.

372
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,530
I would like to ask you not to cross the line, either.

373
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,290
Let's go.

374
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,670
In fact, being an NPC

375
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,410
is very dangerous.

376
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,680
Once,

377
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,630
an NPC

378
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,820
suddenly jumped out and stood in front of me.

379
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,230
We were facing each other.

380
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,860
Just as close as this.

381
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,430
That certainly frightened me,

382
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,920
and I threw a punch at him.

383
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,470
Really? What happened then?

384
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,250
Then,

385
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,660
he was taken to the hospital.

386
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,910
But that was my first time

387
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,890
playing escape rooms.

388
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,800
I was inexperienced.

389
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,760
So, when I

390
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,730
play escape rooms for the first time,

391
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,810
you will have to hold me back.

392
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,800
Otherwise, I'm sure

393
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,310
I would beat them up

394
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,550
just like you did.

395
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,400
Don't worry.

396
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,020
I'm not afraid of this kind now.

397
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,870
I can even play

398
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,350
the super-scary ones that involve single-player missions.

399
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,420
What kind of single-player…

400
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,440
Boss!

401
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,110
That's it for today's blind date.

402
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,720
We are not a good fit for each other.

403
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,430
Great!

404
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,300
I was just about to say that.

405
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,400
What do you mean?

406
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,860
Where are you taking her?

407
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,410
Boss!

408
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,500
Why is he

409
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,460
so impolite?

410
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,270
He is probably irritated by something.

411
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,060
Give me the chain bracelet.

412
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,599
No.

413
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,599
Then tell me

414
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:21,910
why

415
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,069
you have Tang Su's stuff.

416
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,329
What's your relationship with her?

417
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,590
Fine.

418
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,510
I'll admit it.

419
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,650
Actually,

420
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,750
I am

421
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,480
a fan of Tang Su.

422
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,410
I got the chain bracelet

423
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,590
from a raffle in the fan club before.

424
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,670
Earlier, you said that you are a fan of Lu Yanzhi.

425
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,390
Now you are saying that you are a fan of Tang Su.

426
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,040
Exactly which one of your words is true?

427
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,310
If you are just a fan,

428
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:58,850
why did he

429
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,380
treat you like that just now?

430
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,690
Lu Yanzhi…

431
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,660
I just passed by

432
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,740
and saw him recording a song.

433
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,000
I was curious,

434
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,170
so I went inside to have a look.

435
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,870
What are you curious about?

436
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,210
I told you before

437
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,090
that celebrities are different

438
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,870
onstage and offstage.

439
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,670
He had an ambiguous relationship

440
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,440
with Tang Su before.

441
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,590
Now he is on friendly terms with Yu Mengmeng.

442
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,560
Today, he asked you about Tang Su.

443
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,660
What is he doing?

444
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,910
Being fascinated by the new while holding on to the old?

445
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,720
Maybe

446
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,330
he just wanted to

447
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,700
ask after his old friend.

448
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,720
Old friend?

449
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,330
Is that his attitude to ask after an old friend?

450
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,210
What does he think he is doing?

451
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,010
Acting in an idol drama?

452
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,870
Isn't he

453
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,310
an artist from your own company?

454
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,070
Thinking about getting more

455
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,780
while he still has something in his own hand.

456
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,410
This is even more unacceptable

457
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,120
for an artist from my own company.

458
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,520
Then maybe

459
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,290
you don't know him at all.

460
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,500
I don't, indeed,

461
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,930
but I can distinguish between good and bad.

462
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,070
What chain bracelet with the name engraved on it?

463
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,500
It sounds very heartfelt.

464
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,650
Perhaps

465
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,790
he simply customized a hundred of them

466
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,660
and gave one

467
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,290
to each of the old friends he knew.

468
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,270
And Tang Su.

469
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,040
She received a gift from someone,

470
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,850
and then she gave it to her fan.

471
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,540
Isn't this offering a favor at the expense of another?

472
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,870
They are really birds of a feather.

473
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,430
What are you doing?

474
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,770
Why do you throw away my chain bracelet?

475
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,480
I thought you were

476
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,770
a gentle and elegant boss.

477
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,750
I didn't realize

478
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,970
that you are just an arrogant, mindless,

479
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,570
and short-tempered petty man.

480
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,540
Yes.

481
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,650
I am a petty man.

482
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,270
So, don't let me see anything

483
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,710
related to them in the future.

484
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,460
Your self-righteous look

485
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,580
is really annoying.

486
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,760
Don't think that you can control my life

487
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,350
just because I owe you money.

488
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,050
No way!

489
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,930
Arrogant. Mindless.

490
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,240
Fastidious. Selfish.

491
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,670
Unreasonable.

492
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:58,790
Fussy.

493
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,770
You are here.

494
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,000
Su. Happy Birthday!

495
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,550
Thank you.

496
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,770
This is my birthday present for you.

497
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,080
Is it my name on it?

498
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,900
Let me put it on for you.

499
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,380
Thank you.

500
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,470
I will definitely cherish it.

501
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,780
Hello, Boss.

502
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,090
I want to shut out Lu Yanzhi.

503
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,390
Because of Yu Mengmeng or the maid?

504
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,120
He is our own artist.

505
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,020
Are you

506
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,170
making things difficult for yourself by doing this?

507
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,650
That seems to make some sense.

508
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,820
But there's another problem.

509
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:40,970
Your affair

510
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,540
has already been circulated in the company.

511
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,280
Now everyone is saying

512
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,310
that the boss does not hesitate to offend the No. 1 artist of the company

513
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,890
in order to protect the chubby maid.

514
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,270
And it really looked like…

515
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,300
Looked like what?

516
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,880
Looked like

517
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,310
you were fighting for the maid's favor.

518
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,200
Did I?

519
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,350
How is that possible?

520
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,530
Why are you here?

521
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,510
What are you doing?

522
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm taking a walk.

523
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,750
The weather is so nice.

524
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,800
Are you looking for the chain bracelet?

525
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,440
No, I'm not.

526
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,760
What chain bracelet?

527
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:53,880
Stop looking for it.

528
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,830
I have searched this whole area.

529
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,850
I can't find it.

530
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,060
No, I'm not.

531
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,220
I'm not looking for the chain bracelet.

532
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,260
Don't you have mysophobia?

533
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,310
Don't you mind that it's dirty?

534
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:19,800
It's not bad.

535
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,760
A centipede!

536
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,400
So annoying.

537
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:38,960
Why don't you go cook?

538
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,880
You are so stiff even when you are caring about others.

539
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,640
Boss.

540
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,270
Let me ask you a question.

541
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,150
You didn't

542
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,450
recognize Miss Tong

543
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,720
as a member of Sweet Girls?

544
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,860
So ordinary. Who would remember that?

545
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,450
So,

546
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,810
do you

547
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,470
have face blindness?

548
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,670
Chubby Su, you are toast.

549
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,930
Boss, I forgive you.
