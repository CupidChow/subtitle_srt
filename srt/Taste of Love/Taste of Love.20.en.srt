♫When I got close to my previous dream♫

172
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,310
Be good.

173
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,210
Alright.

174
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,580
It won't take long.

175
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,510
♫I tamed my youthful indiscretion♫

176
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,580
♫Looking back at the silent rainy seasons♫

177
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:59,680
♫Like daisies bloom secretly by the road♫

178
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,720
Chi Ye said that he will

179
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,690
go to the police with you after breakfast.

180
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,610
I want to hear what you think.

181
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,290
Of course I'm angry.

182
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,390
I can't wait

183
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,450
to throw her in jail right now.

184
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,620
But at the same time, I'm worried.

185
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,630
Worried about what?

186
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,950
Your mother.

187
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,360
Last time,

188
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,340
you lost such an important project

189
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,490
because of me.

190
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,070
I can never forget the angry

191
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,900
and disappointed look on your mother's face.

192
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,070
If she knows about this,

193
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,140
she definitely won't

194
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,820
let us be together.

195
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,510
Then,

196
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,330
let this matter end here.

197
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,460
You mean…

198
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,520
Terminate the contract,

199
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,220
okay?

200
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:22,890
Okay.

201
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,390
Terminate the contract.

202
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,770
I've said

203
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,070
what needs to be said

204
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,170
on the phone.

205
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,900
I'm here today

206
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,430
to terminate the contract.

207
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,820
Impossible.

208
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,600
Tang Su is our most valuable artist

209
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,660
at Leo Culture.

210
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,790
There's no way I will let her go.

211
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,790
What do you want?

212
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,460
Just tell me.

213
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,970
Sure.

214
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,680
Mr. Huangfu, since you are so forthright,

215
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,700
I also won't beat around the bush then.

216
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,880
Trade your Time Entertainment for her.

217
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,950
You're so greedy.

218
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,200
I was just saying.

219
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,140
Of course I know how important

220
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,450
Time Entertainment is in your heart.

221
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,510
But I know even better

222
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,760
how important Tang Su is in your heart.

223
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,130
So,

224
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,050
it's up to me whether I say it or not,

225
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,720
and it's up to you whether you listen to me or not.

226
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,800
When did you start having the idea

227
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,240
of taking Time Entertainment from me?

228
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,790
I've been paying close attention

229
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,260
to the leader of the industry.

230
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,230
But I'm not as unrealistic

231
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,220
as you think I am.

232
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,550
The whole Time Entertainment is too big

233
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,330
for me to take from you.

234
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,080
But it's still worth it

235
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,050
to trade your shares

236
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,610
for Tang Su, right?

237
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,550
[Individual Shares Transfer Agreement]

238
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,900
Ma'am, you wanted to see me?

239
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:49,990
Sit down.

240
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,140
In order to terminate your contract,

241
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,670
Jue traded his shares in Time Entertainment

242
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,690
with Luo Shi.

243
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,460
It can be said

244
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,230
that his painstaking effort these years

245
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,910
is all gone

246
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,030
because of you.

247
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,270
Where is he now?

248
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,569
I'm going to see him now.

249
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,280
What are you doing here?

250
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:38,700
It hurts.

251
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,490
You hit me so hard.

252
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,800
Not as hard as you.

253
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,640
I did agree to terminate the contract.

254
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,460
But I didn't ask you

255
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,300
to give up Time Entertainment to others.

256
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,470
Calm down.

257
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,420
Sit…

258
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,070
Sit down.

259
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,930
Let's celebrate.

260
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,870
Finally free.

261
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,430
It's too costly for you

262
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,110
to do so for me.

263
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,730
Don't be so petty.

264
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,310
Look.

265
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,220
How beautiful the view is here.

266
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,000
You've lost your company.

267
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,310
How can you still have the mood to enjoy the view?

268
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,820
It's just a subsidiary.

269
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,430
If I could found the first one,

270
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,280
I can also found a second one.

I've been much better.

that I can be discharged in two days.

I can tell

333

whether you are happy or not.

334
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,010
I know

335
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,100
it's not easy for you to be out there alone.

336
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,000
And you are competitive.

337
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,430
So don't work too hard.

338
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,930
And don't put too much pressure

339
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,060
on yourself.

340
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,970
If you live a simpler life,

341
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,850
you will be happier.

342
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,590
I hope you can

343
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,870
always be happy.

344
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,690
Grandma,

345
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,560
don't worry about me.

346
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,560
A couple days later, when I'm on leave…

347
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,210
Grandma.

348
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,380
Grandma.

349
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:49,950
Grandma!

350
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:51,530
Grandma!

351
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,490
Miss Mengmeng, where are you going?

352
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,940
Something happened to my grandma.

353
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,780
I'm going home.

354
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,670
I already got it.

355
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,460
Good.

356
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,230
Since Yu Mengmeng has been so hesitant,

357
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,820
she can't blame me for not giving her a chance.
