5
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:05,810
Are you okay?

6
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,310
How could she be okay?

7
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,919
How?

8
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,680
It's raining heavily outside.

9
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,560
She lied to me first.

10
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,260
Lied to you?

11
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,730
That's because

12
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,640
you always say

13
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,290
you hate Tang Su.

14
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,329
If you were her,

15
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,010
would you admit it?

16
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,890
Why not?

17
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,710
Is it more important to play up to me

18
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,140
than be herself?

19
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,510
Why should she play up to you?

20
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,310
To be your maid,

21
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,930
she had to take care of your daily life

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,300
and comply with your complaints.

23
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,170
If I remember correctly,

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,390
you forced her

25
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,410
to be your maid.

26
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,110
If it wasn't for you,

27
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,460
she could always

28
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,380
disguise herself with

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,180
her fat figure.

30
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,700
Then Yu Mengmeng wouldn't

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,780
have a chance to hurt her.

32
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,900
Yes.

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,410
I forced her to be my maid.

34
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,880
But how could I

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,730
let go of what she said?

36
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,310
It is said that

37
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,270
she came here today

38
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,600
to see you.

39
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,790
She took a risk to get here.

40
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,310
Poor Chubby Su.

41
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,650
It's raining heavily outside.

42
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,970
And she came here alone.

43
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,980
Will she be in danger?

44
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,890
That's enough.

45
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,620
Are you singing a duet?

46
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,340
Find her right now.

47
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,230
Are you okay?

48
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,880
Why are you here?

49
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,700
♫Do you believe it?♫

50
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,620

♫We spend our whole life just for our meeting♫

I'm sorry.

61

I should be the one apologizing.

62

♫Don't be childish♫

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,350
I couldn't contact you

71
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,520
after you were shunned,

72
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,149
♫We tried our best to love each other♫

73
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,540

74
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,450
and the time we were together.

♫We enjoyed the pain of love♫

78

♫We won't regret that we loved each other♫

79

Go.

Go.

Su.

108
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,540
You'd better take charge of Yu Mengmeng.

109
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,200
I'm the one who got beaten.

110
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,830
None of my business!

111
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,130
Su, let's go.

112

Wu.

113
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,410
Tell me.

114
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,600
Am I really

115
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,910
annoying?

116
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,320
Su,

117
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,170
how could you

118
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,980
say that?

119
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,200
Whether you're a star or a maid,

120
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,650
fat or slim,

121
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,020
I believe

122
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,940
your heart has never changed.

123
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,830
You are always yourself,

124
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,520
brave and kind-hearted.

125
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,690
As for Huangfu Jue,

126
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,980
he's a total idiot.

127
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,560
But why do I

128
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,770
always make mistakes?

129
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,409
No matter what I say or do,

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,470
people always misunderstand me.

131
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,980
No matter how I explain it,

132
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,770
no one can hear me.

133
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,950
Take it easy, Su.

134
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,380
You still have me.

135
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,010
I always trust you.

136
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,060
I'll never misunderstand you.

137
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:52,680
Su,

138
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,640
no matter whatever you say

139
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,750
or whatever you do,

140
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,720
I'm always by your side.

141
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,920
Why are your hands so cold?

142
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,000
You can warm my hands when they are cold.

143
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,130
But what if my heart is cold?

144
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,410
Is that

145
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,350
a pick-up line?

146
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,000
Good girl. Good girl.

147
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,800
It's okay.

148
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,750
To be honest,

149
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,370
I can feel that

150
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,590
Huangfu Jue cares about you.

151
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,120
He just doesn't dare to admit it.

152
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,700
He is

153
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,730
a kind person in nature.

154
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,830
But his stubbornness constantly

155
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,470
enlarges some problems.

156
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,200
Look.

157
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,809
When Yu Mengmeng

158
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,070
came to make trouble with you today,

159
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,140
he rushed out immediately

160
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,970
and helped you out.

161
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,610
If he didn't care about you,

162
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,490
why did he wait for you?

163
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,150
If he didn't care about you,

164
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,780
why did he fight for you?

165
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,500
But...

166
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,400
Why did he

167
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,680
blame me

168
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,660
for no reason?

169
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,030
He didn't even

170
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,070
listen to my explanation.

171
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,510
He...

172
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,290
Stop thinking about that.

173
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,490
What you need to do now

174
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,550
is to take a bath

175
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,530
and go to bed.

176
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,380
If there's something important,

177
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,740
you can deal with it tomorrow morning.

178
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,480
Okay?

179
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,540
If you hit Lu Yanzhi harder,

180
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,680
you would ruin his face.

181
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,790
Terminate the contract with him immediately.

182
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Just for him putting on a coat

183
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,210
for your maid?

184
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,400
I'll repeat it.

185
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,090
She's not my maid.

186
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,240
Then who is she?

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,490
Boss,

188
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,780
are you too sensitive

189
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,860
to his behavior?

190
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,230
If I was the one who

191
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,390
put on the coat for Chubby Su...

192
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,390
You can't, either.

193
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,150
Fine. I know.

194
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,800
Wu sent Chubby Su back home.

195
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:54,850
She will be

196
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,760
with her tonight.

197
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,790
Get me another maid tomorrow.

198
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,610
So stubborn.

199
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,120
I've sent you

200
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,350
Tang Su's address.

201
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,930
These are all exclusive photos.

202
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,730
If you want more,

203
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,560
I'll send them to you tomorrow morning.

204
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,390
Mengmeng.

205
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,180
Mengmeng.

206
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,760
Mengmeng.

207
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,300
Mengmeng!

208
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,270
Mengmeng!

209
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,390
Su, your phone is so noisy.

210
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,280
[Calling: Chubby Su]

211
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,700
Su, your phone is ringing.

212
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,600
Su.

213
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,410
Su.

214
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,340
Huangfu Jue,

215
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,880
Su is missing!

216
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,000
What?

217
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,170
Are you blind?

218
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,790
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,070
Gatch him! Gatch him!

220
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,080
Thief!

221
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,090
It's him!

222
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,900
Auntie, let me do it!

223
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,660
It's him!

224
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,760
Catch him!

225
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,190
Catch the thief!

226
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,090
Let me go!

227
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,790
Let it go!

228
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,660
Let it go!

229
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,290
Catch the thief!

230
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,260
Let me go!

231
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:24,820
Catch the thief!

232
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,790
Give me the bag.

233
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,220
Let me go!

234
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:26,810
Give it to me!

235
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,310
Catch the thief!

236
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,930
Let go!

237
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Guards! Catch the thief! Catch the thief!

238
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,470
Help! Catch the thief!

239
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,350
Let me go! Or I'll let you try this.

240
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,350
Let me go!

241
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,300
Help!

242
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:35,660
Let me go!

243
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,100
Catch the thief! Catch the thief!

244
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:37,630
Let go!

245
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:37,980
Chubby Su!

246
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,900
Catch the thief!

247
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,580
My eyes!

248
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,020
Let go of me!

249
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,640
Don't move!

250
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,070
Arrest him!

251
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,830
Let me go!

252
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,500
Don't move!

253
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,870
Hurry up!

254
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,980
Catch him! It's him!

255
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,930
My eyes!

256
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,880
Hurry! It's him!

257
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,270
Catch him!

258
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,020
Chubby Su, are you okay?

259
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,460
Huangfu Jue?

260
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,250
Huangfu Jue, is that you?

261
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,780
Don't be afraid.

262
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,290
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

263
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,400
♫Do you believe it?♫

264
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:01,900
Let's go.

265
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,030
About those things...

266
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,780
♫We spend our whole life just for our meeting♫

267
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,630
I've never done anyone of them.

268
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,670
It's Yu Mengmeng who did that.

269
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,510
Okay, stop talking.

270
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,380
Let's go to the hospital.

271
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,920
♫No matter how many scenes change♫

272
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,590
♫No matter we are sad or happy♫

273
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,410
♫No matter we have quarrels or peace♫

274
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,290
♫The simplest plots♫

275
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,840
♫The most memorable experience♫

276
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,420
How is Su?

277
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,520
What happened?

278
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,590
Doctor, how is she?

279
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,690
The patient is in

280
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,550
stable condition.

281
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,060
But this kind of spray

282
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,810
contains a lot of hazardous substances,

283
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,040
which may have caused damage to

284
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,850
her eyes.

285
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,420
So we are cleaning

286
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,360
her eyes.

287
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,630
Will it affect her eyesight?

288
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,480
Not sure yet.

289
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,850
Please go through

290
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,670
the hospitalization procedure first.

291
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,450
Okay.

292
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,180
Don't worry.

293
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:58,720
Huangfu Jue,

294
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,560
are you happy now?

295
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,550
So what if you know

296
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,300
she is Tang Su?

297
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,940
Can a name change

298
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,040
her identity?

299
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,850
Everything you know so far

300
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,220
is just rumours.

301
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,750
What a nice girl she is!

302
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,810
You've been together for so long.

303
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,860
-Can't you feel it? -Wu, calm down.

304
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,290
That's enough.

305
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,460
Go find the best eye doctors.

306
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,670
Chinese medicine or Western medicine.

307
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,380
No mattter they're from domestic or overseas.

308
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,110
I just want to find

309
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,000
the best doctors in this world.

310
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,580
Okay.

311
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,730
You're so impulsive and stubborn.

312
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,320
If anything terrible happens to Su,

313
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,510
I won't forgive you.

314
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,310
Yanzhi.

315
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,340
You're awake.

316
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,020
How did you get hurt?

317
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:04,680
Nothing.

318
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,440
How do you feel?

319
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,560
Do you want some water?

320
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,390
Here.

321
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,190
I thought you ignored me.

322
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,089
Even if I ignored you,

323
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,690
you don't have to

324
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,660
get my attention this way.

325
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,390
I'll call the doctor.

326
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,610
Don't leave.

327
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,180
It wasn't me who did those things.

328
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,010
It was my assistant

329
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,170
who wanted to stand up for me.

330
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,190
I really didn't know about that.

331
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,220
Let it go.

332
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,330
Now you have to take care of yourself.

333
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,220
Even if all the people don't trust me,

334
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,970
I hope you can believe me.

335
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:56,900
Alright.

336
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,440
Take it easy. I'm not leaving.

337
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,660
I'll stay here with you.

338
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,080
Did something happen to Tang Su?

339
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,490
You'd better take charge of Yu Mengmeng.

340
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,180
Stop pestering her

341
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,130
from now on.

342
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,310
You like her?

343
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,370
Yes.

344
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,740
Does she like you too?

345
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,240
Of course.

346
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,090
Are you sure?

347
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,650
I don't know what happened between her and you

348
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,720
when she was fat.

349

But

350
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,900
as a boss,

351
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,610
you'd better not interfere with

352
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,730
your employees' private life.

353
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,280
Whether she is a celebrity

354
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,360
or a maid,

355
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,060
they're the same.

356
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,250
Remember.

357
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,780
She's not a maid.

Much better.

Let me take your temperature.

Your fever is gone.

403
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,090
If there's nothing serious,

404
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,350
you can remove the gauze in a few days.

405

Okay, thank you.

406

Miss Tang,

there is

408
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,070
a charity event in our community,

409
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,170
to provide the disabled

410
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,810
with some working places.

411
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,710
Several social workers have been

412
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,330
assigned to our hospital.

413
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,810
They will provide every single patient

414
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,170
with nursing services.

415
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,060
Of course,

416
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,670
the government will pay for it.

417
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,810
What service?

418
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,110
They'll work around the clock.

419
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,970
If you need any help,

420
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,940
you can ask them to help you at anytime.

421
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,350
Do you need...

422
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,650
Sure.

423
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,150
I want someone to talk to.

424
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,250
I'll

425
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,190
call him over now.

426
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,980
Okay.

427
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,840

429
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,040
May I know your name?

430
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,460
My name is Huang Yousu.

431
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,110
Huang Yousu?

432
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,530
Isn't it the homophony of "Huang You Su"(Huang with Su)?

433
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,570
The voice changer is so silly.

434
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,470
Hello, Mr Huang Yousu.

435
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,450
Hello.
