5
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,670
How was your rest yesterday?

6
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,220
If you're not used to staying in a hotel,

7
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,000
you can come home.

8
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,820
I'm fine staying in the hotel.

9
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,040
Do you think Tang Su...

10
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,390
By the way,

11
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,120
what do you think about

12
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,770
the Blue Sky Project of our group?

13
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,220
The concept of environmental real estate

14
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,740
was first brought up many years ago.

15
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,750
But the fact of the matter is

16
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,170
that they construct apartment buildings

17
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,200
in the name of environmental protection.

18
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,770
That's also the main reason

19
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,790
why this kind of project has been criticized

20
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,390
these years.

21
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,829
If our group wants to do things for the environment,

22
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,450
we must do something concrete and practical.

23
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,420
I want to leave this project in your hands.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,100
But there are a lot of things in Time.

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,410
Some things are just for fun.

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,220
A hobby is a hobby,

27
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,370
but business is business.

28
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,800
Don't forget

29
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,890
you are the heir of the group.

30
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,430
Don't let your grandpa down.

31
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,270
What's wrong?

32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,860
Nothing.

33
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,040
I know the Blue Sky Project.

34
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,280
Why do you have this photo?

35
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,400
I wanted to ask you.

36
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,380
Do you know who he is?

37
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,030
He is Mike,

38
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,620
a big client of Leo Culture.

39
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,510
Mr. Luo is very polite to him.

40
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,690
He must be somebody.

41
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,190
And?

42
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,930
And...

43
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,450
Mr. Luo invited me to dinner.

44
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,760
He said it was an important business event.

45
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,380
But there were only three of us.

46
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,300
I didn't wear a coat.

47
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,360
It was so cold with the air conditioner on.

48
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,620
You don't know how awkward it was.

49
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,870
A business event?

50
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,360
Didn't wear a coat? Awkward?

51
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,200
Is Luo Shi crazy?

52
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,890
No.

53
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,720
Mr. Luo went to

54
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,760
talk serious business.

55
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,880
Serious business

56
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,100
takes place in an office.

57
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,990
There must be something fishy

58
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,650
about the business after dark.

59
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,980
You were smeared before

60
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,400
because you went to the director's room

61
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,600
in the middle of the night, right?

62
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,330
What do you mean?

63
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,170
Why do you bring up

64
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,510
something in the past?

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,230
Besides,

66
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,690
the director

67
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,660
has clarified it.

68
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,550
We were simply discussing

69
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,310
the script.

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,790
I'm just kindly reminding you

71
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,089
not to forget the pain after you recover.

72
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,760
Thank you for reminding me.

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,839
I haven't finished yet.

74
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,520
Where are you going?

75
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,220
You can finish it tomorrow.

76
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,130
No need for innuendoes.

77
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,770
That's not what I meant.

78
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,610
But don't attend

79
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,320
such activities anymore.

80
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,830
Especially when I'm not around.

81
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,380
What a bad temper she has!

82
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,370
She knew she was wrong,

83
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,690
but she didn't come to comfort me.

Come.

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,510
Of course.

92
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,000
Why are the fried eggs in this color?

93
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,100
They are the best-looking ones

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,060
among all six of them.

95
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,610
If there were more eggs,

96
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,010
I believe they could look better.

97

What's wrong?

98
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,700

Just now I...

100
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,180
Just now I had a bad attitude.

101
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,470
Do I look like

103
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,350
I'm angry?

104
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,530
But what I want to tell you is

105
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,270
no matter what happens in the future,

106
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,810
don't just walk out.

107
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,170
But I just

108
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,190
went upstairs.

109
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,090
But don't go

110
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,040
out of my sight.

111
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,010
You can cry to me, squabble with me,

112
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,780
or even fight with me.

113
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,670
But don't just take off.

114
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,330
Don't leave our problem unsolved overnight,

115
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,120
okay?

116
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:45,990
Okay.

117
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,370
Now I'm calmly

118
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,980
talking to you.

119
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,860
I don't want you

120
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,540
to attend

121
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,820
those unnecessary social activities.

122
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,550
Because your boss

123
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,510
is not a good boss.

124
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,190
He doesn't know

125
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,590
how to protect his artists.

126
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,900
What about you?

127
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,030
Are you a good boss?

128
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,100
Maybe not.

129
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,740
But I will be

130
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,300
a good boyfriend.

131
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,420
I believe you.

132
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,020
I have to take this call.

133
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:38,870
Eat the noodles.

134
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,890
Hello, Mr. Jin.

135
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,630
I have a few problems to solve.

136
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,560
Will he come?

137
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,510
I'm leaving if he doesn't.

138
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,740
Wu!

139
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,420
Mike specially mentioned

140
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,980
he wanted to meet

141
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,660
all the members of SURAGR GIRL.

142
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,450
Now Tang Su

143
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,220
is sick.

144
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,310
Mengmeng

145
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,380
can't leave from the crew.

146
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,220
You know that.

147
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,810
If you leave too, then we'd...

148
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,160
we'd break the appointment.

149
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,850
Mr. Luo.

150
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,210
He's here.

151
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:16,900
Mike.

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,630
You're late.

153
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,000
It's hard to find this place.

154
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,800
This is...

155
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,630
Tong Yiwu,

156
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,450
an artist of my company,

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,240
and a member of SURAGR GIRL.

158
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:26,900
Miss Tong.

159
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,400
I've heard so much about you.

160
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,700
Wu.

161
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,110
All right.

162
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,030
Now that you've met me,

163
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,100
I'll get going.

164
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,240
Wu.

165
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,170
Miss Tong, you don't care about my feelings at all.

166
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,830
You're leaving when I just arrived.

167
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,030
It's not that she doesn't care about your feelings.

168
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,920
She's young

169
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,950
and a bit inhibited.

170
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,100
She doesn't know what to say.

171
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,270
She's just a little young.

172
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,610
She's too inhibited.

173
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,090
How about this?

174
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,130
Cheers.

175
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,210
Mr. Luo.

176
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,360
Miss Tang Su

177
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,760
I met last time...

178
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,780
Didn't you say she'd come today?

179
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,200
She's not feeling well. She can't come.

180
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,790
Call her.

181
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,450
Tell her

182
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,620
I'll wait for her.

183
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,140
Okay. Okay.

184
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,190
I'll try to

185
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,940
call her then.

186
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,150
Why are you calling her?

187
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,830
I've already told you

188
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,230
she's not feeling well and she can't come.

189
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,840
All you want is to drink, isn't it?

190
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,270
I'll drink with you.

191
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,230
Okay.

192
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,730
I have to take this.

193
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,810
Yeah, solid waste treatment...

194
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,390
Hello.

195
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,310
Su!

196
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,340
What did you say, Wu?

197
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,310
Why did you call me,

198
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:17,950
Su?

199
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,250
Where are you?

200
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:19,950
Listen.

201
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,860
I drank

202
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,060
a lot of wine today.

203
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,660
Don't move.

204
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,460
I'll pick you up now.

205
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,970
Okay?

206
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,470
She's here.

207
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,590
Hello?

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,650
Where did you go?

209
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,700
Why did you go out alone?

210
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,680
I came to pick up Wu.

211
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,460
She's drunk.

212
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,220
I was afraid I'd disturb you,

213
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,900
so I didn't tell you.

214
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,600
Stay where you are.

215
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,270
Send me your location.

216
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,350
I'm on my way.

217
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,670
All right.

218
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,380
Wu!

219
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,430
Wu!

220
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,440
Wu!

221
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,690
How is it?

222
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,160
Wu, wake up!

223
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,510
Wake up!

224
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,510
Let's go home.

225
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,590
Let's go.

226
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,720
Are you in such a hurry to go?

227
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,630
What do you want?

228
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,190
I want to chat with you.

229
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,540
What are you doing?

230
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,860
Can't I chat with you?

231
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,520
Let go.

232
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,130
Chubby Su.

233
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,910
Chubby Su.

234
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,260
Don't touch me! Let go!

235
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,160
So what if I touch you?

236
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,270
Let go!

237
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,810
So what?

238
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,510
Luo Shi, open the door.

239
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,490
Let go of me, Luo Shi.

240
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,090
What?

241
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,890
Let go! Don't touch me!

242
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,570
Let go!

243
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,620
Let go of me!

244
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,200
You scumbag!

245
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,280
Stop!

246
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,140
Chubby Su, are you okay?

247
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,150
Aunt.

248
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,380
Good morning.

249
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:16,920
Where's my cousin?

250
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:17,980
He's almost here.

251
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,610
There's a traffic jam at this hour.

252
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,400
Hope cousin wouldn't be late.

253
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,470
Let's go.

254
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,590
Do you want to leave after hitting me?

255
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,870
If you dare to go out,

256
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,820
I'll call the police.

257
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,610
Do you believe me?

258
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,330
You were up to no good.

259
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,780
The police will arrest you first.

260
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,390
-I'll beat you... -Huangfu Jue!

261
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,550
Don't be impulsive.

262
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,850
If I didn't save him,

263
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,010
he would have drowned.

264
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,940
Can you be blameless if I drown?

265
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,950
You arranged your artists

266
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,160
for drinking and entertaining.

267
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,880
And you got thrown into the sea.

268
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,260
Will you look good

269
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,460
if the word gets out?

270
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,240
Who threw me into the sea?

271
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,370
Wasn't it him?

272
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,770
And my motto

273
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,730
is

274
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,410
what I'm afraid of is not trouble,

275
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,890
but that there is no news.

276
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,020
Of course I know.

277
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,310
I also know

278
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,090
that you love money more.

279
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,280
Back then,

280
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,220
you asked Yu Mengmeng to force herself

281
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,660
to beg for my forgiveness,

282
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,950
you just wanted to reunite SURAGR GIRL

283
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,960
to make money for you, didn't you?

284
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:24,970
Yes.

285
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,920
Since you want to

286
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,820
make a big deal out of it,

287
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,630
let's just go our separate ways.

288
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,170
From now on, there's

289
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,230
no more SURAGR GIRL in Leo.

290
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,180
Are you still aware that

291
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,250
you work for Leo?

292
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,430
Then do you know

293
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,040
which side

294
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,840
you should take?

295
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:40,500
The side I should take

296
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,490
has always been the same.

297
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,200
That's all I have to say.

298
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,060
Think about it.

299
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,160
No need.

300
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,280
I think that is a great idea.

301
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,170
Just terminate the contract.

302
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,270
You...

303
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,960
What are you two doing here?

304
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,600
Are you doing cross-talk?

305
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,580
You're singing the same tune.

306
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,740
I'm the victim.

307
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,620
Understand?

308
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,050
What do you want then?

309
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,080
I don't know what I want.

310
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,060
I have to think about it.

311
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,630
Don't worry.

312
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,110
I won't let you drink the water in vain.

313
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,970
I want more.

314
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,660
Luo,

315
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,650
don't be too greedy.

316
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,500
In terms of greed,

317
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,060
I'm no match for you.

318
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,910
Your goal is the Blue Sky Project.

319
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,240
Mind your own business.

320
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,570
I'll think about it.

321
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,020
He has no sense of time at all.

322
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,380
That's right.

323
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,360
Everyone is here.

324
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,560
We're all waiting for him.

325
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,750
Look at the time now.

326
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,050
So many people are waiting for him alone.

327
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,390
I called.

328
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,700
I can't reach him for now.

329
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,040
Aunt.

330
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,130
Have you reached my cousin?

331
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,450
It's been more than 20 minutes.

332
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,950
The meetings of our group

333
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,110
have never been delayed

334
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,260
for anyone before.

335
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,140
Directors,

336
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,130
I'm sorry.

337
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,410
Jue suddenly

338
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,290
feels unwell today.

339
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,600
So he can't attend

340
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,040
our meeting.

341
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:42,860
Aunt,

342
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,490
don't cover it up for him.

343
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,360
Everyone,

344
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,650
why don't you

345
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,780
look at your phone

346
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,600
and read the news.

347
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,350
Huangfu Jue, CEO of Time,

348
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,710
pushed his rival in love, Luo Shi,

349
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,070
into the sea

350
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,930
because of jealousness.

351
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,480
I didn't expect

352
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,150
my cousin

353
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,440
to be such a man of character.

354
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,040
It was for Tang Su again.

355
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,050
The gossip is not believable.

356
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,140
I hope our board

357
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,200
won't be disturbed

358
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,180
by these boring things.

359
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,180
Yes.

360
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,680
Aunt is right.

361
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,310
Let's not take such boring gossip

362
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,440
too seriously.

363
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,420
Aunt,

364
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,370
about our meeting...

365
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,430
The meeting begins.

366
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,240
About our Blue Sky Project...

367
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,820
About the Blue Sky Project,

368
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,880
I've made

369
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,260
a very detailed proposal.

370
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,500
I'll hand them out to you now.

371
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,880
Then

372
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,620
I'll introduce them in details.

373
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,670
Luo Shi is so despicable.

374
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,470
Su, I'm sorry.

375
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,960
I shouldn't have drunk so much.

376
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,630
It's okay.

377
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,190
Do be careful next time.

378
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,100
Don't come to this kind of party again.

379
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,220
Well,

380
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,940
I have to go.

381
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,500
The meeting of the group directors

382
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,610
is about to begin.

383
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,810
Now?

384
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,650
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

385
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,670
You don't even change your clothes

386
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,670
and haven't prepared anything.

387
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:09,650
It's okay.

388
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,840
I sent Chi Ye a message.

389
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,630
-He'll be here soon. -Boss.

390
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,930
I've brought everything for you.

391
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,380
Get in.

392
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:13,940
Let's go together.

393
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,910
Cousin, why are you so late?

394
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,010
Are you here

395
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,440
to congratulate me?

396
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,310
I've taken over

397
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,990
the Blue Sky Project.

398
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,460
I knew it.

399
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,630
Love makes people confused.

400
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,540
Miss Tang,

401
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,500
I look forward to working with you.

402
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,040
Sorry.

403
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:04,670
This time,

404
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,980
you've gone too far.

405
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,160
Ma'am,

406
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,550
please don't blame Huangfu Jue.

407
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,520
-It was all my fault. -No need to explain.

408
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,290
I told you before

409
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,840
it's not that simple.
