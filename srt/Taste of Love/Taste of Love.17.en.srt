[King of Jealousy in Asia]

5
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,050
Didn't I ask you

6
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,200
to look for Jing Lian's information?

7
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,210
Isn't that it?

8
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,960
But this is obviously Chubby Su!

9
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,150
This is Jing Lian.

10
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,590
What's she doing?

11
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,000
She is the leader of

12
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,350
a new girl group.

13
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,270
And she is recording

14
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,600
a new variety show.

15
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,840
Why is she dressed like this?

16
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,700
In order to show herself more

17
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,090
in front of the camera.

18
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,880
As a rookie,

19
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,160
she has to do something different

20
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,330
to hold the audience's attention,

21
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,140
right?

22
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,250
It seems that she can do anything to get famous.

23
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,100
You just came in time.

24
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,540
I need your advice.

25
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,840
I have something

26
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,730
to discuss with you.

27
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,329
You go first.

28
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,970
What time are you leaving

29
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,730
for the promotion of

30
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,840
Love and Espionage tomorrow?

31
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,320
I want to stagger the time with you.

32
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,610
Why?

33
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,410
If we arrive at the same

34
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,280
time,

35
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,990
the reporters may guess that

36
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,090
we are together.

37
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,180
The supporting actress

38
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,480
fell in love with the producer

39
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,350
when the TV play starts to broadcast.

40
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,400
That would create a bad impression

41
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,500
and will harm the publicity of this TV play.

42
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,050
Am I right?

43
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,200
I understand.

44
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,040
Actually, I thought about it long ago,

45
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,240
but I didn't have time to tell you.

46
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,020
When are you going?

47
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,400
I won't attend it.

48
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,720
Won't you attend

49
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,660
such an important event?

50
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,630
Time Entertainment

51
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,360
has invested in a lot of TV plays.

52
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,210
I have no time to

53
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,200
take part in all of them.

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,570
You're right.

55
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,380
After all, you are the boss.

56
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,460
All right, I have nothing else to say.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,800
Have a good rest.

58
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,660
I'm going to get ready.

59
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,700
Good night.

60
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,410
Boss,

61
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,940
I'll pick you up

62
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,450
at 9 a.m. tomorrow, okay?

63
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,880
I don't need that.

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,750
Have I ever participated

65
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,690
in such activities?

66
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,200
But isn't Love and Espionage

67
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,890
a special one?

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,730
Aren't I busy enough

69
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,160
dealing with the work in the company?

70
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,950
I'll stay in the company tomorrow.

71
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,750
I'm not going anywhere.

72
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,430
Hello, everyone.

I'm the host, Tao.

76
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,740
Now, we are at the scene

77
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,340
of the Love and Espionage launch event

78
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,740
and waiting for the leading roles to show up.

79
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,190
I will continue to report to you.

80
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,930
Here they are!

-The car is here! -The car is here!

82

-So beautiful! -So beautiful!

84

85
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,520
Miss Yu, can you look here?

86
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,560
-Yes. -You're so beautiful!

87
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,950
Okay. Thank you.

88
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,100
So beautiful!

Mengmeng, here!

93
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,760
Look here!

94
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,590
They're so matching!

95
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,270
Thank you to all the media

96
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,030

97
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,980
our launch event today.

98
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,100
Please support

99
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,220
the TV play

100
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,870
I starred in.

101
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,180
-Okay. -Okay.

102
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,700
Miss Tang,

103
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,030
ever since Time Entertainment

104
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,340
invested in Love and Espionage,

105
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:42,920
so to speak,

106
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,220
you went straight from a guest extra

107
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,530
to the supporting actress.

108
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,060
What's the relationship between you

109
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,830
and Times Entertainment?

110
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,490
Tangsu, please tell us.

111
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,380
We really want to know.

112
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,300
Tell us.

113
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:53,909
Tell us something!

114
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,500
Tell us.

115
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,460
Actually...

116
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,700
Here's the thing.

117
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,110
Everyone recognized

118
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,730
Tang Su's acting skills

119
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,670
during this filming.

120
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,170
That's why Time Entertainment

121
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,610
gave her this chance.

122
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,280
So I request all of you

123
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,820
don't doubt her randomly,

124
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:09,700
okay?

125
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,980
So it is.

126
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,580
Miss Tang,

127
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,890
I saw you and Jing Lian

128
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,760
getting along well.

129
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,440
Can you talk about your collaboration at this time?

130
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,270
How do you feel?

131
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,230
I think Jing Lian

132
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,180
is a very professional actor.

133
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:22,870
We had a great time

134
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,750
working together.

135
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,590
Thank you.

136
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,110
Can you two come closer?

137
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,900
Please come closer.

138
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,060
So sweet!

139
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,860
Can you come closer?

140
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,500
-Thank you. -Thank you.

141
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,159
You're like a couple.

142
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,510
So sweet.

143
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,430
So sour.

144
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,580
Orange.

145
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,130
This orange is sour.

146
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,600
Don't be weird.

147
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,060
I'm back.

148
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,610
What are you doing?

149
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:03,740
Su!

150
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,200
Come here quickly! Look!

151
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,450
Breaking news!

152
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,350
Your new TV play became a trending topic

153
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,140
as soon as it started broadcasting!

154
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:09,770
Look.

155
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,560
They even gave

156
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,290
a name to the combination of you two,

157
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,240
"Tang Jing Couple".

158
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,480
What's wrong?

159
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,300
Why do you look so tired?

160
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm really tired.

161
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,590
I keep working for the events of

162
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,420
Love and Espionage these days.

163
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,350
After the end of the event today,

164
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,860
Luo Shi told me to come over and talked to me.

165
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,140
He told me...

166
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,980
I should keep a low-key with my relationship status

167
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,000
and keep a single image.

168
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,750
I should also keep a high-key to propagandize my couple

169
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,960
to get more attentions.

170
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,880
Both high key and low key?

171
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,940
Is he playing a musical instrument?

172
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,320
Don't worry.

173
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,420
It's not my first day to be an artist.

174
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,250
I know what to do.

175
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,630
But...

176
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,660
If I keep my relationship a secret,

177
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,450
I may hurt him.

178
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,020
In my opinion,

179
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,070
he is also

180
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,190
working in the entertainment industry.

181
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,170
He will understand you.

182
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,710
Don't think too much.

183
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,800
Have a good rest.

184
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,660
I'll talk to him.

185
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,230
Okay.

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,179
Why do you stay up so late?

187
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,220
Are you reading?

188
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,660
You stay up late too.

189
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,000
What a full day, huh?

190
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,460
You're the trending topic now.

191
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,590
So jealous.

192
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,910
I think someone is angry.

193
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,230
How could I be that childish?

194
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,020
So you're not angry.

195
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,930
Fine.

196
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,010
I wanted to make it up to you.

197
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:12,750
How?

198
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,100
Go on a date and watch a movie.

199
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,560
Sure!

200
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,940
The one in front.

201
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,190
Can you take off your hat?

202
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,580
Aren't you Tang... Tang Su?

203
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,900
-Tangsu? -Tangsu?

204
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:07,910
That's Tang Su.

205
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,030
She left!

206
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,400
Who is that man?

207
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,170
I don't know.

208
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,280
Tang Su!

209
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,070
Tang su!

210
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,580
Aren't we suitable for dating?

211
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,760
Did you go to a marathon?

212
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,530
-It's so hard. -It's so hard.

213
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,210
So that's what happened.

214
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,060
However,

215
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,810
as public characters,

216
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,480
we will definitely sacrifice

217
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,460
lots of personal time.

218
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,510
Look at Ye and me.

219
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,580
We haven't seen each other

220
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,510
for a long time.

221
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,810
How long is it?

222
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,260
It's been more than 10 hours.

223
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,230
I'm speechless.

224
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,600
You know what?

225
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,870
Don't listen to the words

226
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,930
Luo Shi told you.

227
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,150
Who decided artists

228
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,070
can't date?

229
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,160
The problem is,

230
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,230
I'm an obscure artist

231
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,290
who just made a comeback,

232
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,170
but now I'm dating a boss of the entertainment industry.

233
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,380
What will others think about me?

234
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,500
They may think that

235
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,580
I'm doing this for rapid ascent.

236
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,420
Then it'd be useless no matter how hard I try.

237
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,670
Besides, I don't want other people

238
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,520
to misunderstand Huangfu Jue.

239
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,100
Have you asked Huangfu Jue about his will?

240
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,960
Does he want to hide it too?

241
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,260
I have yet to ask him.

242
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,200
But he didn't even attend

243
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,780
the launch event.

244
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,270
He probably doesn't care about it.

245
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,480
I don't think so.

246
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,530
I think

247
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,920
he's becoming more jealous than before.

248
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,600
But nothing happened

249
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,300
between Jing Lian and me.

250
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,870
Of course I know.

251
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,030
But

252
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,720
as your boyfriend,

253
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,520
when he sees the news online,

254
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,740
I'm sure he will

255
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,530
feel uncomfortable.

256
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,490
Then what should I do?

257
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,780
Tang Su and Jing Lian are like a sweet couple.

258
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,810
I follow their TV play every day

259
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,970
just to see them.

260
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,880
I'm praying that they can be a real couple one day.

261
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,760
Tang Jing Couple is the sweetest in the world!

262
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,680
There are so many news about my couple.

263
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,330
If this continues,

264
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,420
Huangfu Jue will go crazy.

265
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,050
Tang Su,

266
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,040
you will go viral soon.

267
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,870
So it would be best if you

268
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,810
seize this opportunity.

269
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,880
I don't need these hot topics

270
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,550
to hype myself.

271
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,700
I want to prove my ability with my works.

272
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,700
Can you be more professional?

273
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,420
I can be professional.

274
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,820
But I hope

275
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,460
you can stop hyping me.

276
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,400
I don't want to cooperate with it anymore.

277
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,270
I know. I know.

278
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,920
You are just tired.

279
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,130
You know?

280
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,470
Go back and have a good rest.

281
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,220
Chubby Su!

282
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,610
What's wrong with you? It's so early!

283
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,980
I want to talk to Chubby Su.

284
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,950
Don't you know that she went out for filming

285
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,050
early this morning?

286
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,070
Filming?

287
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,590
Did she get a new TV play?

288
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,610
I think

289
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,150
you don't care about

290
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,190
Su's schedule at all.

291
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,090
She's filming an extra story

292
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,970
for Love and Espionage.

293
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,460
Stop disturbing me.

294
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,410
Bye.

295
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,820
So, she is with Jing Lian again.

296
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,760
When you make contact with the agents,

297
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,270
never ask questions that

298
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,470
don't concern you.

299
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,160
Don't interfere in matters

300
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,590
that don't concern you.

301
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,090
I know, Mengyao.

302
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,460
Don't worry.

303
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,320
We will survive.

304
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,830
Okay, cut. It's okay.

305
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,290
Thank you for your hard work.

306
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,070
Let's go to eat lunch.

307
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,680
-Okay. -Thank you, Director.

308
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,650
Thank you.

309
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,400
Let me do it.

310
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,000
It's okay.

311
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,810
-No need. -I…

312
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,260
Wait, let me do it.

313
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,700
Thank you.

314
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,120
You're welcome.

315
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,380
The chicken is very delicious.

316
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,750
Thank you.

317
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,330
I don't like it.

318
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,060
Did I do something

319
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,160
that made you unhappy?

320
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,560
We're just colleagues.

321
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,300
You don't have to be so attentive.

322
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,650
And I don't want to

323
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,060
continue our business couple anymore.

324
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,070
But our company...

325
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,710
I know the company

326
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,850
gave you instructions.

327
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,000
You may think

328
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,220
this is your career plan.

329
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,960
But I think,

330
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,310
if you want to go far,

331
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,680
you must rely on your professional ability

332
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,140
instead of

333
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,020
those fake things.

334
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,660
Besides...

335
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,430
It's okay. Let's eat.

336
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,290
Why are you so serious?

337
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,800
I don't care about the tactics

338
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,790
or instructions.

339
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,300
I just want to

340
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,120
talk to you about old times.

341
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:04,950
Old times?

342
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,350
When you fell

343
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,140
on the stage,

344
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,460
it's me who watched you from behind.

345
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,700
So,

346
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,350
you were that person who

347
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,130
watched me behind the scenes!

348
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,170
Yes, it's me.

349
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,470
I was so embarrassed.

350
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,460
Don't worry, Senior.

351
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,800
I won't laugh at you

352
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,160
even if everyone laughs at you.

353
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Okay, you're sincere. I believe you.

354
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,030
Really!

355
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,220
I'm sorry.

356
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,720
I misunderstood you.

357
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,520
It's okay.

358
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,300
Miss Tang.

359
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,360
Miss Tang,

360
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,110
could you please come here?

361
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,590
I'll leave first.

362
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,620
Okay. Cheer up!

363
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,470
Mr. Huangfu?

364
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,520
You should know who I am.

365
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,790
Of course I do.

366
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,750
You are the investor of this play.

367
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,080
Speaking of which,

368
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,500
I should thank you.

369
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,310
Thanks to your investment,

370
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,840
I can have the chance

371
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,330
to be with Tang Su.

372
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,230
Think about it carefully.

373
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:07,610
OK.

374
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,490
You should thank me a lot.

375
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,000
Why are you here?

376
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,070
Where are you going?

377
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,190
Huangfu Jue?

378
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,080
Where are you going, Huangfu Jue?

379
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,190
Huangfu Jue?

380
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,990
Huangfu Jue!

381
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,170
Where are you going?

382
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,960
You just came here.

383
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,890
I think you don't want me to come.

384
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,330
Why are you so angry?

385
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,750
I'm your

386
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,400
real boyfriend,

387
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,820
but I don't even have the right to make it public.

388
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,260
Everyone is saying

389
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,030
you and another man

390
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,660
are a matching couple.

391
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,430
Everyone is saying

392
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,300
how sweet and happy you are.

393
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,390
How can I not be angry?

394
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,350
Why can't you understand?

395
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,960
This is just my job.

396
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:52,900
I understand.

397
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,710
But it doesn't mean I can accept it.

398
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,630
I'm sorry.

399
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,710
I thought you didn't mind.

400
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,500
How could I not mind?

401
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,990
I thought

402
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,930
you were acting.

403
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,619
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

404
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,349
I wouldn't have known

405
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,220
you were so close.

406
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,060
Tell me.

407
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:07,740
How could I not mind?

408
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,270
It's not like that.

409
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,500
He's just...

410
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,750
I don't care who he is.

411
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,180
He is not important to me.

412
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,619
What matters is you.

413
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,180
I know you're avoiding suspicion.

414
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,540
If it weren't for you,

415
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,859
I would have told the whole world

416
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,369
you are my girlfriend.

417
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,410
I know you work so hard

418
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,000
to become a better artist.

419
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,270
I know

420
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,220
you refused my help

421
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,020
because you don't want others to look down on you.

422
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,060
But I don't care

423
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,960
what others think.

424
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,500
I only care about your feelings.

425
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,370
As long as you

426
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,030
accept our relationship,

427
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,660
I'll respect your decision

428
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,480
whether you want to make it public.

429
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,530
Let's go.

430
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:53,850
Where are we going?

431
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,590
I suddenly found that

432
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,310
to wait for the so-called

433
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,500
"a suitable opportunity"

434
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,010
is a waste of time.

435
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,560
Most importantly,

436
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,480
we need to cherish

437
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,090
what we have now.

438
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,850
Huangfu Jue,

439
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,230
I'm going to

440
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,070
announce to the world that

441
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,600
you are mine.

442
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,050
Excuse me.

443
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,910
I want to announce something.

444
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,880
From now on,

445
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,190
I will no longer be alone.

446
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,970
I have him

447
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,090
by my side.

448
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,780
-Bravo! -Bravo!

449
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,830
Bravo!
