00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,770
that a miracle happened on you.

172
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,050
As you can see,

173
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,640
you have a very special place

174
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,460
in my heart.

175
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,570
Stop lying.

176
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,950
It must be Wu who has secretly informed you.

177
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,410
Wu?

178
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,310
It's all in your head.

179
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,800
Whether you are fat or thin,

180
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,170
I can recognize you in the crowd

181
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,670
at a glance.

182
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,240
Chubby Su.

183
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,810
I very much look forward to

184
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,850
seeing you with your mask off.

185
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,890
But…

186
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,300
what if

187
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,850
I look different

188
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,130
from what you imagine?

189
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,450
Take off your mask.

190
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,040
What is she doing?

191
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,120
Chubby Su?

192
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,140
You have lost a lot of weight recently.

193
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,910
How did you know?

194
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,900
Actually, I knew it long ago.

195
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,090
I have checked you out.

196
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,170
I know

197
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,050
that you are not yet ready

198
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,940
to tell Boss.

199
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,510
Don't worry.

200
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,980
I won't snitch in advance.

201
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,080
In fact,

202
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,620
I didn't mean

203
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,780
to hide it from you.

204
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:12,850
I just…

205
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,540
Let's not mention the past

206
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,420
anymore.

207
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,470
It's okay.

208
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,700
I understand.

209
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,860
Thank you, Chi Ye.

210
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,670
I'm leaving.

211
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,970
You are recovering quite well.

212
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,030
How come it's you again?

213
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,390
I really underestimated you.

214
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,060
I didn't expect you

215
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,120
to lose weight so quickly.

216
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,540
You can recognize me

217
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,540
even when I'm wearing a mask.

218
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,860
It seems that I have a pretty important place

219
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,780
in your heart.

220
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,900
Whether you are round or square,

221
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,850
a celebrity or a maid,

222
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,290
I can recognize you at a glance.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,500
It has only been a moment

224
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,810
but you are already worrying about her?

225
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,140
She lost weight because of me.

226
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,700
Don't flatter yourself.

227
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,010
If I didn't force her to come,

228
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,870
do you think you would be able to see her today?

229
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,300
You should think about

230
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,260
how to thank me.

231
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,560
All right.

232
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,170
I will ask Chi Ye to treat you to a meal.

233
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,090
And I will pay for it.

234
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,740
No need to pay for it.

235
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,210
How about

236
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,330
giving him two more days off?

237
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,390
Well,

238
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,730
your relationship is developing so fast.

239
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,180
Alright, stop being garrulous.

240
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,600
Hurry up and go find her.

241
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,250
It's been such a long time.

242
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,280
You have recovered long ago.

243
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,660
For whom are you pretending like this?

244
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,420
Guess.

245
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:43,990
Yu Mengmeng,

246
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,260
you make a fuss of yourself

247
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,880
all the time,

248
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,020
why haven't you won the Best Actress yet?

249
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,520
You think so highly of me.

250
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,010
How can I let you down?

251
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,430
Say it.

252
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,040
You came back after losing weight,

253
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,470
isn't it because you want to re-enter the entertainment industry?

254
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,390
It has nothing to do with you.

255
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,070
I don't care, either.

256
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,940
Then,

257
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,120
let's be frank today.

258
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,750
As long as you can leave Huangfu Jue

259
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,370
and give up your career in the entertainment industry,

260
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,040
I will consider letting you off.

261
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,390
In your dreams!

262
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,620
I already

263
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,520
knew your true colors.

264
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,270
So, I won't have even a tiny bit of consideration

265
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,580
for your face or feelings.

266
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,900
As for the team friendship in the past years,

267
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,860
I will just take it as a life experience.

268
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,510
You are a rat crossing the street

269
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,870
but you are talking so arrogantly.

270
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,390
I was wondering

271
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,490
what capabilities you have.

272
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,550
In the end,

273
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,990
aren't you just

274
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,350
leaning on the big tree called Huangfu Jue?

275
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,520
Yes, you are right.

276
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,140
I am leaning on this big tree

277
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,750
called Huangfu Jue.

278
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,370
He has money and influence.

279
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,320
He will be my greatest backer

280
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,250
in the future.

281
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,780
Just you wait.

282
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,880
I will make you

283
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,850
watch me laugh while you are crying.

284
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,410
Don't you regret it.

285
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,220
If you dare to do anything

286
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,640
that hurts Huangfu Jue,

287
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,800
I definitely won't let you off.

288
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:14,940
What's wrong?

289
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,070
Sorry

290
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,150
to disturb you all.

291
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,880
Yu Mengmeng.

292
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,350
Why is Yu Mengmeng here?

293
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,160
Yu Mengmeng.

294
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,200
I came here today

295
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,780
to seek justice

296
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,710
for myself.

297
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:46,870
Yu Mengmeng,

298
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,030
what in the world is wrong with you again?

299
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,050
Miss Yu.

300
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,940
Everyone

301
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,770
has to be legally responsible

302
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,950
for what they say or do.

303
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,360
So, think carefully

304
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,770
before you speak.

305
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,730
Mr. Huangfu,

306
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,010
are you threatening me?

307
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,080
In order to frustrate Leo Culture,

308
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,580
Time Entertainment

309
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,140
did not scruple

310
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,050
to harm the artist of Leo Culture.

311
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,820
As the CEO,

312
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,590
shouldn't you give the public

313
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,300
an explanation?

314
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,760
Miss Yu, do you mean

315
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,700
that this variety show incident

316
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,490
was a business activity?

317
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,460
Whether or not it was a business activity,

318
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,370
they themselves

319
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,130
will have to explain it clearly.

320
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,200
There is no need.

321
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,610
I believe that my employees

322
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,710
would never

323
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,420
do such a thing.

324
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,980
If you shield your employees like this,

325
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,980
how can you convince the public?

326
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,000
It has been three months since the incident happened,

327
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,450
and that employee

328
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,110
just disappeared for three months.

329
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,060
Isn't it because of a guilty conscience?

330
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,900
Disappeared for three months?

331
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,650
As far as I know,

332
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,500
that employee

333
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,010
should be right here now.

334
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,900
Do you dare to ask her to come out

335
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,560
and make it clear?

336
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,090
I said, there is no need.

337
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,390
It is

338
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,640
the annual party of Time Entertainment today.

339
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,310
I don't think

340
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,130
Miss Yu

341
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,230
is on our invitation list.

342
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,990
Are you driving me away?

343
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,810
It's been three months.

344
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,170
All I want is an apology.

345
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,570
Since the incident,

346
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,580
my body hasn't gotten any better.

347
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,790
My job and my reputation

348
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,520
are also under great threat.

349
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,770
If she is indeed innocent,

350
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,160
why can't you let her come out

351
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,880
and make it clear?

352
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,540
Yeah. That's right.

353
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,800
Why not just make it clear?

354
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,620
It's her. It's her?

355
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,170
As far as I know,

356
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,510
the employee who participated in the variety show

357
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,450
should have been a fatty.

358
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,600
Why…

359
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,450
Yes.

360
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,450
I was that employee.

361
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,180
Since you say you are,

362
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,020
can you

363
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,260
tell us the ins and outs

364
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,220
of what happened on that day?

365
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,240
Yeah.

366
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,250
This incident has nothing to do with me.

367
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,100
It has nothing to do with Time Entertainment either.

368
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,330
I have even less reason to harm Yu Mengmeng.

369
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,410
It was not you?

370
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,300
Then, did Miss Mengmeng

371
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,240
do it to herself?

372
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,109
Exactly.

373
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,160
Miss Yu is allergic to peanuts.

374
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,190
As her assistant,

375
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,500
you should know about that, right?

376
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,990
So what if I do?

377
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,260
Since you know about that,

378
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,720
then why did you still

379
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,020
buy the chocolate that contains peanuts?

380
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,500
Really?

381
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,030
I found

382
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,060
this piece of chocolate

383
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:31,600
in Yu Mengmeng's dressing room.

384
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,460
And it just happened that the camera in front of the vending machine on site

385
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,870
has recorded

386
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,980
the video of you buying the chocolate.

387
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,220
There's a video too?

388
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,740
It was really her.

389
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,650
So what if there's a video?

390
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,410
Maybe

391
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,490
she bought it for herself.

392
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,340
Or maybe

393
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,810
she bought it for other staff.

394
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,250
Then, I wonder

395
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,720
if Miss Yu's DNA

396
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,190
would have been left

397
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,580
on this half piece of chocolate.

398
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,370
DNA?

399
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,520
I have already taken it to a DNA comparison test.

400
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,910
Miss Yu, if you are confident,

401
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:07,990
would you mind

402
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,490
if I tell the result to everyone now?

403
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,310
I'm sure

404
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,580
everyone is familiar with this word.

405
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,750
[Matched]

406
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,860
Matched…

407
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,380
Was it really her?

408
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,710
Impossible! This is fake.

409
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,950
The result is here.

410
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,770
You still want to deny it?

411
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,660
I'm not denying it.

412
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,630
It's absolutely impossible.

413
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,660
Miss Mengmeng did not

414
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,290
touch the chocolate at all on that day.

415
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,820
It was I who broke it off and gave…

416
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,770
It was really her.

417
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,990
How dare you collude with outsiders

418
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,750
to frame me?

419
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,020
Miss Mengmeng, I didn't.

420
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,600
Miss Mengmeng…

421
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,070
How many years have you been with me?

422
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,070
How did I treat you?

423
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,620
How could you do this to me?

424
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,160
Tell me.

425
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,240
How much did they give you?

426
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,430
You were the one who made me do it.

427
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:44,960
You made me…

428
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,670
Huangfu Jue!

429
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,990
You framed me!

430
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,110
You think you are protecting her.

431
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,850
You are wrong.

432
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,060
She has been lying to you all along.

433
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,710
You don't know who she is at all.

434
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,740
What does that mean?

435
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,010
Are you tired of wearing a mask all the time?

436
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,500
I believe

437
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,640
everyone wants to know

438
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,880
why she set me up.

439
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,940
Because she is not

440
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,970
Huangfu Jue's maid at all.

441
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,490
She was a member of Sweet Girls back in the days.

442
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,170
She is Tang Su,

443
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,620
a liar whose mouth is full of lies.

444
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,420
Yu Mengmeng, what do you mean?

445
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,370
Wu! Wu!

446
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
You are filing a suit first to pre-empt the action of the victim, aren't you?

447
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,540
Whether or not she is Tang Su,

448
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,740
we will know after she takes off her mask.

449
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,420
What?

450
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,670
Are you that ashamed to face people?

451
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,910
It's Tang Su.

452
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,360
It's Tang Su.

453
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,750
It's really Tang Su.

454
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,500
I can't believe it's Tang Su.

455
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,170
Should I call you Tang Su

456
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,680
or Su Tang?

457
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,400
I'm sorry.

458
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,170
I know I lied to you.

459
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,970
But I was really trying

460
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,120
to find a suitable time…

461
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,610
What counts as a suitable time?

462
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,700
It feels good to make a fool of others, right?

463
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,490
You were having a good time

464
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,290
seeing me jumping up and down like a clown,

465
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,600
weren't you?

466
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,270
Sorry, I…

467
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,950
You should know

468
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,390
how much I dislike you, right?

469
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,520
But you actually stayed by my side

470
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,290
for so long,

471
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,260
taking good care of me

472
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,300
and making compromises.

473
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,000
You were disguising yourself so well.

474
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,120
I'm sorry.

475
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,990
Since you dislike me so much,

476
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,650
I will leave you.

477
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,170
You cling on to me, this big tree.

478
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,700
You climb up this tree.

479
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,150
You use me as a bargaining chip.

480
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,240
You do so to return to the entertainment industry.

481
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,610
Tang Su, you really want to be famous,

482
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,090
by hook or by crook.

483
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,830
Huangfu Jue.

484
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,710
What are you doing?

485
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,770
Since you use me as a bargaining chip,

486
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,060
I want the equivalent exchange.

487
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,080
Huangfu Jue.

488
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,040
Huangfu Jue.

489
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,890
You jerk!
