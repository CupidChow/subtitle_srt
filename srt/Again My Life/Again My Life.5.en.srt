Again My Life

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,110
Episode 5
We oppose the restructuring of Mirae Automobiles.

6
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,260
- We oppose!
- We oppose!

7
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,230
The company's compulsory liquidation should not be allowed.

8
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,370
- Do not allow it!
- Do not allow it!

9
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,430
We oppose the sell-off.

10
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,470
We oppose! We oppose!

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,060
We oppose the restructuring of Mirae Automobiles.

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,490
Mirae Automobiles was dissolved after it was sold to a foreign company

13
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,470
as the result of a labor-management conflict.

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,980
I know what’s going to happen with Mirae,

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,890
but I can’t do anything right now.

16
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,780
- We oppose the sell-off.
- We oppose it!

17
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,730
- We're oppose it!
- We oppose it!

18
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,760
We oppose the restructuring of Mirae Automobiles.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,920
We oppose it! We oppose it!!

20
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,370
Where is Kang Man Cheol these days?

21
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,060
Are you referring to the Kang Man Cheol from the Progressive Labor Party, sir?

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,370
That's right.

23
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,780
He's at the protest camp at the factory in Byeongtaek.

24
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,350
- Let's go to Byeongtaek.
- Sorry? Right now?

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,850
Let him know I'm on my way. I want to have a cup of coffee with him.

26
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,590
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,980
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop,

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,330
I heard if you go to the Blue House, even the President himself will scramble to greet you.

29
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,990
But here you are in this shabby tent to share instant coffee with me!

30
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,290
I don't expect you to scramble to meet me.

31
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,630
So at least get yourself some new shoes. It looks like you're putting on a show.

32
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,800
I live by the teachings of Lao Tzu. Isn't it about having fewer possessions?

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,050
Having a lot is chaotic.

34
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,430
Chaos can be fun too.

35
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,760
I heard your son got into Harvard?

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,090
I thought people of the Juche faction

37
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,180
generally sent their kids to places like Byongyang University.
(Juche supports North Korean political ideologies.

38
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,830
Do I get to decide which school they go to?

39
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,780
They figure it out themselves.

40
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,730
That's true.

41
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,850
Time flies when I talk to you.

42
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,330
Coming to the point. This strike... let's wrap it up..

43
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,410
- Neatly.
- What?

44
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,430
You are holding something big.

45
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,080
Then just enjoy it by yourself. Why are you trying to get us involved?

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,580
Is there a deal that would favor such a fringe party like ours?

47
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,570
This is all to save workers and businesses. What other deal do you need?

48
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,530
I’m curious. I'm really curious.

49
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,960
Also, for how long are you going to be the party representative?

50
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,060
Parliamentary Negotiation Body. Floor leader. It's time you take those positions.

51
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,660
Last time you took three seats.

52
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,620
- If you consider the proportion, it's just one seat.
- That's why!

53
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,080
No more graceful concessions every election season. Sure, you can say it was for unification.

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,150
But in reality, you're just treated as window dressing for the Daehan Party.

55
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,740
Are you already preparing for the general elections?

56
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,180
Saving the economy. Bipartisan. Cooperation?

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,630
You are aiming for that, I see.

58
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,480
Even if your opponent's ranking rises, yours will as well,

59
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,870
and you can keep an eye on the main opposition party.

60
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,610
Just how many birds are you killing with one stone?

61
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,110
I don't like it, but it's good.

62
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,520
All I have to do is take a picture next to you.

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,820
How can I reject this?

64
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,500
What an offer!

65
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,270
Jo Tae Seop!

66
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,510
Jo Tae Seop!

67
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,340
Jo Tae Seop!

68
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,880
They made this decision for the good of the country.

69
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,140
A big round of applause!

70
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,520
From now on, we'll work

71
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,570
to make an environment where workers and companies can coexist...

72
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,430
Mirae Automobiles is going to Cheonha?

73
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,320
This is a different story from my previous life.

74
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,340
Until the dramatic conclusion of the Mirae Automobile strike,

75
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,400
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop raised his voice at the party meeting

76
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,740
to focus on revitalizing the economy with a bipartisan mindset.

77
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,290
The Daehan Party preparing for the general elections ...

78
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,480
The goal is not the general election, but the presidential election.

79
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,790
Ridiculous stuff.

80
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,130
It once again hit an all-time high. The next news.

81
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,020
A horrific thing happened when a friend of 40 years went home

82
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,150
and killed his friend for not paying money back.

83
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,980
The police arrested the suspect, Mr. Park, and are investigating other details.

84
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,540
This case...

85
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,730
Mr. Park's fingerprints were found on a weapon at the crime scene.

86
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,930
The investigation is focused on the possibility of a crime of revenge.

87
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,870
An on-site inspection is expected to be conducted today.

88
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,140
Here, take the knife.
Victim

89
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,470
From here. Like this.

90
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,420
Like this. Do it, just like you did last time.

91
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,560
I didn't do it.

92
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,090
Are you going to change your position here? It will complicate things for us.

93
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,990
Don't you remember this knife?

94
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,350
That, that is ...

95
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,500
It's the one that I held,

96
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,230
but when I thought of my son, I did not stab him.

97
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,210
How can you do this here? There's proof also.

98
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,260
If you continue this, only your sentence will increase. Your sentence!

99
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,930
It's not me. Really!

100
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,790
I did not kill him.

101
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,340
He's coming out. There he is!

102
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,150
They should at least show his face. Heaven will punish him.

103
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,700
You killed someone for some money.

104
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,650
Raise your head if you are confident, you bastard.

105
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,160
Where were you going, really?

106
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,650
Dad! Father! My Dad did nothing wrong.

107
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,160
It's not him! Catch the real culprit! Why is it my dad?

108
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,560
Dad! Dad!

109
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,960
Dad! Dad!

110
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,030
Dad!

111
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,460
Dad!

112
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,940
Dad!

113
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,950
Park Sang Man?

114
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,930
- You are Park Sang Man, right?
- Yes. What is it?

115
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,910
- Who are you?
- I'm the one who will prove your dad's innocence.

116
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,040
In exchange, return to school tomorrow.

117
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,670
You, come over here.

118
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,410
Why did you take off your backpack? Stand here.

119
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,200
The real culprit of this case is revealed after 10 years.

120
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,700
Believe me and continue your studies, Park Sang Man.

121
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,920
How can he study?

122
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,380
Do you think he will be first in the school?

123
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,330
Hey, be careful.

124
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:52,150
That punk might stab you for rolling your eyes, just like his dad.

125
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,950
It won't take too long. Bear it and get through it.

126
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,830
I know it's hard to believe unless I show you the results.

127
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,690
But believe me.

128
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,290
There's nothing you can do to help your dad now anyway.

129
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,320
Again My Life

130
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,980
Drinking when you feel like it's not enough... will it fill what's not there?

131
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,870
Ohh, my kid brother!

132
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,230
- Sunbaenim!
- Yeah.

133
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,230
What's the matter? Sit down.

134
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,030
Please take a look at this case.

135
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,610
Daesin News: "Man who killed his friend of forty years, arrested due to his fingerprints found on the weapon."

136
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,880
What about this?

137
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,490
It's the father of a friend I know.

138
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,840
I feel like the police have missed something.

139
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,680
Hey, Kim Hui Wu. Why are you meddling?

140
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,780
Murder case arrest rate in Korea?

141
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,040
It's almost 100%.

142
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,690
Here!

143
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,310
- They found the murder weapon, right?
- Yes.

144
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,100
- They got fingerprints there.
- Yes.

145
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,440
- There is a grudge.
- That's right.

146
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,630
- Gosh! He was drunk?
- Yes.

147
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,890
That's it. There's no need to dig deeper.

148
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,910
That's the problem.

149
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,240
- Murder weapon, motive, and fingerprints. Everything came out very perfectly and quickly.
- What?

150
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,110
There was so much evidence

151
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,550
that they didn't even feel the need to prove his innocence.

152
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,760
Take a look at this.

153
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,700
Now, look here.

154
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,410
- What's this?
- It's the clothes my friend's father wore on the day of the murder.

155
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,370
If you check the CCTV in the vicinity, you can confirm it.

156
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,320
What's the probability of not having blood stains on your clothes when stabbing someone?

157
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,810
Zero! As you see, the clothes are clean.

158
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,940
And there is no evidence that it was washed or erased.

159
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,730
Other than this also, there are many ways to confirm it.

160
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,010
Wow!

161
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:55,850
Sunbaenim, wasn't the law actually made for the suspect?

162
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,460
I learned that avoiding unfair punishment comes first.

163
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,040
If this is true, then there's a gaping hole in the police force.

164
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,230
And the prosecution is filling it?

165
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,850
Then, the story becomes splendid!

166
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,360
Do you know anything else in detail?

167
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,570
Of course!

168
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,150
Okay, Ms. Lee Seon Yeong.

169
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:28,970
- You are Hong In Pyo's wife, right?
- Yes.

170
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,490
I heard that you often said you wanted to kill your husband.

171
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,730
- Is that right?
- Please call my lawyer.

172
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,030
Right. Of course.

173
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,810
But before that...

174
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,370
Here.

175
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,380
What is this?

176
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,730
You must be glad to meet him.

177
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,560
The affair itself began with a breach of trust.

178
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,470
How can you have faith in that? Let's hear what happened on the day of the murder.

179
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,690
That day... I received a phone call late at night.

180
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,420
Why are you calling a person who was on his way out?

181
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,040
What this? Have you lost your mind?!

182
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,320
You said... you needed money, right?

183
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,820
This man's property is ours now.

184
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,530
We are going to be rich now.

185
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,500
This...

186
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,830
Quickly take this far away and burn it.

187
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,390
This knife too. Hurry.

188
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,990
Did you kill your husband Hong In Pyo?

189
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,910
Yes. I did it.

190
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,610
Why?

191
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,820
It was a good opportunity.

192
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:46,640
Pay me back at once. My 100 million won! The money I worked so hard for.

193
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:53,550
Hey... friend. How can I pay back what I don't even remember borrowing?

194
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,980
Do you have proof that you loaned me money?

195
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,380
You... How could you do this to me?

196
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,010
Stab me.

197
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,260
Go ahead and stab me!

198
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,990
Stab me!

199
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,780
If you want to ruin your son, Sang Man's future, try and stab me!

200
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,110
That bastard deserved worse than death.

201
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,100
He only thinks about himself.

202
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,120
He would often disregard the weak and beat them.

203
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,020
You're right. That's why I have always wanted to kill him.

204
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:11,100
And I was afraid that I would be caught in my infidelity too.

205
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,120
Prosecutor, I'll be pardoned right?

206
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,950
If you're not careful, you'll take the fall for everything. So think wisely.

207
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,700
1 day ago
- That will never happen.
- All right.

208
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,870
- Where did you hide it?
- Sorry? Hide what?

209
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,360
You're giving it away by acting surprised like that.

210
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,050
The evidence from the scene of Hong In Pyo's murder. You're the one who hid it!

211
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,000
Prosecutor, you shouldn't count your chickens before they hatch.

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,920
There's a trend in those who hide those types of things.

213
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,060
Nowadays, kimchi refrigerators?

214
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,950
They tend to hide them there.

215
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,720
If I find it, and recover it. You'll be charged with concealing evidence,

216
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,770
and negligent homicide, and conspiracy, no—

217
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:28,030
Never mind. I'm just going straight for homicide.

218
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,420
If you confess now and ease the load of work on my subordinates,

219
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,200
t would help reduce your sentence, yes? Here ...

220
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,710
Prosecutor, I will tell you everything.

221
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,160
Hey, wrap it up.

222
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,320
- Yes, sir.
- Prosecutor.

223
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,330
Prosecutor!

224
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,750
Everything was exactly as Hui Wu had said.

225
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,240
Pressure the wife's lover first.

226
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,280
It's something he can use to hold leverage over her. So he clearly must've hidden it somewhere.

227
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,830
I'm half-joking, but

228
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,510
they say there's a trend in where those things are hidden.

229
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:21,630
First-time offenders tend to follow what's depicted in videos or movies.

230
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,890
For example... I mean, I'd hide it in my kimchi refrigerator.

231
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,020
- Gosh.
- Joking.

232
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,070
But you never know.

233
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,580
Kim Hui Wu, who the heck is he?

234
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,470
what the hell is he?

235
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,960
- Oh, Prosecutor Jang.
- Oh, yes.

236
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,430
- Well done! I just heard it.
- Ah yes.

237
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,340
It'll be a big thing when the media hears about it!

238
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,550
There are great expectations of you.

239
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,720
Thank you, sir!

240
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,210
Hey, Kim Hui Wu, thank you.

241
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:20,170
I feel really awkward being in the position of owing you.

242
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,780
But it's actually not bad.

243
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,300
Seonbae, you just need to keep marching on the smooth, obstacle free road.

244
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,110
I'm just your lumberjack.

245
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,650
Hey! I have to say you're really growing on me.

246
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,490
You need to keep your wits sharp. Hui Wu is quite extraordinary.

247
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,930
If he becomes a prosecutor, surely he'll be soaring here and there.

248
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:44,480
I know. You'll help me out later on, right?

249
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,190
Oh! I'm embarrassed. I'm still lacking.

250
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,250
Hey, don't be so modest.

251
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,490
You can be aptly arrogant, and as long as your work can back it up,

252
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,710
that's way cooler.

253
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,980
Hey, Kim Hui Wu, how did you know?

254
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,820
Sorry?

255
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,800
How would I know?

256
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,880
No, I mean you said it was a favor,

257
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,290
said it was half a joke, and everything you told me was exactly correct.

258
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,160
And what's more, you sounded professional.

259
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,810
I was merely earnest and was lucky.

260
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,660
You listened to me, Sunbae-nim, and even resolved it.

261
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,500
I am just so very thankful.

262
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,530
Here. With this atmosphere, let's all have a shot, guys!

263
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,950
We'll be saying cheers.

264
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,650
And we'll continue zooming straight down. (Onomatopoeia for drinking was used as a pun)

265
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,600
It was the first case I worked on as a prosecutor. Of course, I know everything about it.

266
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,170
- Go all out.
- And you need to work a bit harder.

267
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,030
- Over here!
- Honey!

268
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,410
Father!

269
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,520
Honey!

270
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,540
Don't worry! I'm fine. You must have been worried sick.

271
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,500
Honey, it must've been so hard.

272
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,580
- Oh you're so gaunt.
- No it's okay.

273
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,030
You must've suffered so much.

274
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,870
You look so skinny.

275
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,790
I feel so bad for you, Honey.

276
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,210
- Are you okay? How's your health?
- I'm fine.

277
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,560
You were the one who saved your father.

278
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,780
It took ten years.

279
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,690
Please prove my father's innocence.

280
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,750
Please help me, Prosecutor.

281
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,520
So at least your face doesn't look as bad.

282
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,750
It must have been hard because of me.

283
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,580
The ten years that it took to reach the truth,

284
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,970
use them solely on yourself this time, Park Sang Man.

285
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,380
It's so nice since you're finally out.

286
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,360
Wishing you perfect scores on the CSAT

287
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,440
- Fighting!
CSAT, even if you guess may it be correct. Let's go! Let's go to college!

288
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,640
With the wisdom you have acquired, we hope you get a high score.

289
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,470
CSAT, 18th Testing Site

290
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,820
Fighting! You can do it!

291
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,900
Kim Han Mi!

292
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,620
What? Have you come to wish me luck?

293
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,600
This early morning? In this weather?

294
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,490
You deserve it.

295
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,380
- As a woman?
- As my student.

296
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:17,140
- Your defense is unbeatable.
- Just do as you've prepared, don't get nervous.

297
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,130
- Were you this nervous too?
- Don't worry,

298
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,150
you studied hard, so expect good results.

299
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,360
What? Are you scared?

300
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,350
I expected as much, so I prepared something for you.

301
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,000
- For me?
- Yes.

302
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,860
- What is this?
- Let's call them good luck charms.

303
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,780
I used these pens last year.

304
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:49,960
They're filled with the energy of a student who got into Hankuk School of Law.

305
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,420
♫ Waking up in darkness ♫

306
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,450
- Your arrogance is overflowing.
- Of course it is.

307
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,760
♫  frozen time ♫

308
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,540
The CSAT pens filled with the energy of arrogant Hui Wu. It's a nice feeling.

309
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,590
♫ I'm lost somewhere it is pitch black in front of me ♫

310
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,130
♫ And if I get another chance ♫

311
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,020
Don't worry too much.

312
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,800
You're my student who's smarter than anyone else.

313
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,820
Do well on your test. Then I'll be off.

314
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,530
♫ In the suffocating smoke ♫

315
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,270
♫ I wanna rise higher ♫

316
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,940
♫ Under the blackened sky  ♫

317
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,920

Kim Han Mi

352
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,120
- Yes?
- You got accepted into all the colleges you applied for.

353
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,220
- Yes.
- You can go to Songwha Women's University Dept of English.

354
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,150
Aren't congratulations in order for things like this?

355
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,330
- I thought you weren't interested and out of the blue—
- Kim Han Mi.

356
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,910
- Are you afraid of me turning out well?
- What?

357
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:01,550
I put in my own effort to get accepted, can't I decide for myself on the school and major?

358
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,520
Did you forget? Live quietly.

359
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,110
Don't select a job where your name will become known.

360
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,470
You cannot go into media or public service, even more so.

361
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,510
Do as you're told

362
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,080
if you'd like to continue to live in a country where you at least speak the same language.

Yes.

366
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,470
You chose well. You'll become a good reporter.

367
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,930
Huh? What?

368
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,880
How did you know?

369
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,300
I haven't told anyone yet.

370
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,620
Well, just...

371
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,690
Don't kids who go to the Department of Mass Communication usually dream of being a journalist?

372
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,840
Oh... Good point.

373
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,950
Proud of you, Kim Han Mi!

374
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,360
I am proud of you too! For not giving up on me.

375
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,090
Thanks to your determination, I was able to come this far.

376
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,170
Thank you!

377
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,790
No, this is just the starting point.

378
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,110
- You haven't reached anywhere yet.
- Ugh.

379
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,920
Gosh!

380
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,180
Just when I start to like you, you have to ruin the mood.`

381
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,960
I like that.

382
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,990
Anyway, be thankful later.

383
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,100
- Pay me back when you become a journalist.
- Okay!

384
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,190
I am sure there will be a day when I'll pay you back big time.

385
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,380
- Cheers!
- Okay!

386
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,190
Waiting for that day! Congratulations, Han Mi!

387
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,150
It doesn't suit me to be this happy.

388
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,330
If it doesn't suit you, who would it suit?

389
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,750
Do you want me to cover you thickly with happiness?

390
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,880
- How?
- Order another side dish.

391
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,040
- Wow... it's so easy.
- Yes it is.

392
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,190
If I order a side dish here and it tastes good, I feel so happy!

393
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,360
I feel really good!

394
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,410
Why is your expression like this then?

395
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,370
Don't you know?

396
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,770
Why I'm unable to fully enjoy this?

397
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,860
Did I want to be acknowledged?

398
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,660
Mom, Dad! Today was hard wasn't it?

399
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,700
How can I help you?

400
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,080
What's with the mood?

401
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,030
Business wasn't good today, right?

402
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,440
My baby boy!

403
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,320
Son!! So... that is...

404
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,100
What's the matter?

405
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,110
You got a draft notice.

406
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,580
Gosh! Why would I receive the draft again...

407
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,000
Draft Notice To Mr. Kim Hui Wu

408
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,080
Oh my God, my son has grown so much. Now he is going to serve in the military.

409
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,400
Yes.

410
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,770
Th-The military is a thing.

411
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,150
Of course, it's is a thing. All countries have one.

412
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,050
Our country has a draft system.

413
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,220
That... if you pass the exam, you can become a military judicial officer.

414
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:45,000
- Oh right, the military judicial officer.
- I think it would be good for you to take it on like a man, without any delay.

415
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,270
Yes. I will do so.

416
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,530
By the way, I was from the Special Forces.

417
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,760
When I was parachuting, I was able to shoot at a peanut and hit it.

418
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,310
When I was a diver, once I got into the water, I came out the next day.

419
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,440
What are you saying? You were the military cook, weren't you?

420
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,170
- In every letter, you whined about not wanting to peel onions.
- I was the Special Forces cook.

421
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,820
There was also a time when I had to peel 1000 onions in one sitting. When your mother came to visit at that time,

422
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,760
she was touched that I was crying and did not go home that day.

423
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,200
That's cool!

424
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,070
That's when you were made.

425
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,290
Stop it!

426
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,510
What? Military?

427
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,590
You subtly keep doing whatever you want.

428
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,260
Subtly? This is on the face. Who gives only a two-day notice?

429
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,980
Like someone here. I am upset.

430
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,970
- Like you'd be more upset than the guy going to the army a second time.
- What?

431
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,080
Yes. What? Why?

432
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,520
But, why are you getting angry?

433
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,420
- We are just flustered!
- We are just flustered!

434
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,090
Aren't you nervous? How come you are always in a far-sighted mood?

435
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,430
- Why would I be nervous when it's my second time?
- Then again...

436
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:55,460
It's not like you're going twice. Finish it short and sweet.

437
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,430
Meanwhile, we will become old-fashioned seniors.

438
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,750
Okay!

439
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,980
If you come in as my junior, you are dead!

440
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,560
I will make it hard for you, so be prepared.

441
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,030
Anytime.

442
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,610
I am speechless.

443
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,610
By the way, what did you say earlier? Like someone?

444
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,350
- Don't you know yet? Hui Ah...
- What?

445
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:20,670
She is going abroad to study. The day after tomorrow.

446
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,600
Oh, okay.

447
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,470
Yes, esteemed elder.

448
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,870
What, elder?

449
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,430
He has so many secrets. What's with the elder?

450
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,590
- Do you notice anything?
- Not sure...

451
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,300
He doesn't open up about his private life.

452
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:49,790
Wow, he is so charming, Hui Wu. He is the first guy to make me this curious.

453
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,220
Okay, everyone! I have a dinner appointment, I will take my leave now.

454
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,750
- His cool nature. Wow.
- Where are you going?

455
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,910
Aren't you having a farewell drink? You should have a farewell party.

456
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,080
Why is going to the military a farewell? Time will fly.

457
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,040
Anyway, I'll be back safely. I'll see you on the other side, Sunbae.

458
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,360
I'll be back!

459
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,530
Does he think of the military as a 4-day retreat?

460
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,850
Not even a retreat, but a Templestay, maybe?

461
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,200
Real Estate

462
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,890
I am going to the military.

463
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,800
So? No need to tell me about it.

464
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,820
About the money you gave me. Because it's such a large amount

465
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,110
leaving it quietly for two years doesn't feel right.

466
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:56,270
I couldn't think of a way to manage it safely.

467
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,950
That's why...

468
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,370
Here you go.

469
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,750
Please watch over it.

470
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,400
Do you think I'll readily accept money that I've already given away?

471
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,740
Also! How do you when what will happen to me?

472
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,440
But no matter how I think about it,

473
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,070
you're the only one who can handle this money.

474
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,830
Is that so?

475
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,730
There are some real estate properties I have my eyes on.

476
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,510
Where are they?

477
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,220
Mapo.

478
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,820
As expected!

479
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:37,480
Seeing how you're not questioning me, I take it you have a gut feeling about this.

480
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,930
I already felt that you were not a normal guy.

481
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,780
Please take care of it.

482
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,720
Alright. I'll at least ease your concerns before you go to the military.

483
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,310
Master! Thank you!

484
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,400
Loyalty!

485
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,060
A life is given to me again.

486
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,330
Mom, Dad.

487
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:23,530
- Kim Gyu Ri!
- Don't try to repay in the wrong way.

488
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,550
You are my friend, right. We are all your friends!

489
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,310
I am a freshman. Computer Engineering Major. Kim Hui Ah. And you?

490
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:34,980
Do you know what real estate is? You see only money if you started with that as a goal.

491
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,900
Thank you.

492
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,970
I am changing the lives of precious people around me and the future.

493
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:48,410
♫ Give up, I warn you so ♫

494
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,870
♫ Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm ♫

495
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,810
I, Jo Tae Seop, will help you.

496
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,980
- I am Jo Tae Seop.
- Jo Tae Seop! Jo Tae Seop!

497
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,410
I need to let my son, Hyeon Seok, go.

498
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:11,890
Even Jo Tae Seop's life is changing a little bit.

499
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,440
♫ I don't care what they say ♫

500
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,010
♫ At the end, They'll know there's no where to hide ♫

501
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,760
And...

502
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,040
Han Ji Hyeon...

503
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,940
♫ Oh I'll wait for now  ♫

504
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,410
♫ Let them get what they want ♫

505
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:39,480
♫ At the end, I'll get that chance to beat them ♫

506
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,310
Will you be alright alone?

507
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,020
Why am I tearing up?

508
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:03,530
If both of you accompany me, I don't think I can leave.

509
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,910
Let me just say goodbye here.

510
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,720
Be healthy. Don't hurt yourself.

511
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,100
Okay.

512
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,680
Please sit down. Let me bow to you.

513
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,410
Okay, let's see it.

514
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,530
Mother and Father, I'll be back safe and sound.

515
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,430
Why didn't you tell me?

516
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,200
It's upsetting.

517
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,860
And you?

518
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,450
Same reason, then?

519
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,810
Aren't you leaving?

520
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,540
Yes, I should.

521
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,590
- Hey?
- Keep quiet.

522
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,120
You're supposed to play dumb at times like these.

523
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:09,580
Besides my dad, you're the first man whose arm I've held.

524
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,950
This is the end.

525
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,130
Goodbye, Kim Hui Wu. Let's meet again.

526
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,080
Alright. Let's meet again.

527
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,760
Go safely.

528
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,390
You too.

529
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,880
- I'll get going.
- Yeah.

530
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,130
Seven Years Later

531
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,700
Gangwon District Prosecutors' Office, Gimsan Branch Office

532
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,920
Hello. I am Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

533
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,790
Branch Chief Jeon Seok Gyu

534
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,590
- Kim Hui Wu?
- Yes.

535
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,950
- Top at the training center?
- Yes.

536
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,670
So why have you come here?

537
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:24,240
I came here to take you to Seoul.

538
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,250
- Me?
- Yes.

539
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,670
Is it not to keep an eye on me?

540
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,110
You're mistaken.

541
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:37,110
- About what?
- You're not even worth keeping an eye on.

542
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,320
- Is that so?
- Yes.

543
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,450
Now I'm curious. I'm a throwaway prosecutor, and you're here to take me to Seoul for no good reason?

544
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,510
Good reason? I can make you one.

545
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,300
Got it. You can find your office, right?

546
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,420
Detective Oh Min Guk will assist you with any questions. Let's have a drink once Prosecutor Ji Seong Ho's back.

547
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,790
- You can go.
- Sure.

548
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,670
- Top at the training center?
- Yeah.

549
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,810
I've never seen a top-rated prosecutor in my 15-year career as an investigator.

550
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,310
And the funny thing is that he applied to come here.

551
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:22,570
Really? The head of the training center class chose our branch?

552
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,710
That's what I'm saying!

553
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,610
But why? Isn't it a given to apply to Seoul with such a resume?

554
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,800
Yeah! It's strange, isn't it?

555
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,820
For sure! Why would someone apply to a rural area unless they've lost their mind?

556
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:38,780
I hope he's not an over-achiever. Those are the ones who always get into trouble.

557
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:45,540
Don't worry. There's nothing to over achieve about here.

558
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,300
The Branch Chief is living proof of that.

559
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,630
- True.
- I love it.

560
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,640
Hello. I am Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

561
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,830
Hello Prosecutor, I am Investigator Oh Min Guk.

562
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,600
Oh right, it's nice to meet you.

563
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,100
Oh, I work for Mr. Ji, so.

564
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,540
- Is that my desk?
- Yes.

565
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,330
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

566
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:23,520
I organized your desk with the basics. If you need anything, just tell me.

567
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,550
It's my first day. Can I still take your offer?

568
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,230
Of course, you can. Would you like some coffee?

569
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,940
No. I can get coffee myself.

570
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:40,880
Gather all the cases from the last six months, whether they're criminal or civil, and report them to me.

571
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,530
- Pardon?
- You told me I could ask for anything.

572
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,930
Ah, ah, right, yes.

573
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:58,400
What is this unnerving sensation?

574
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,800
We have a newbie, right?

575
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,740
Oh, yes. I am Kim Hui Wu.

576
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,380
There's no need for that. Follow me.

577
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,800
Wow! The Regional Prosecutor is here!

578
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,490
Have a seat first.

579
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:28,290
So that's where all of you were.

580
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,180
Your face has become better, Hyeong-nim. I guess you're living comfortably now.

581
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,640
- Yes
- The mayor.

582
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,360
We're busy handling all of the cases

583
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,230
so you must have a lot of free time.

584
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,760
Police precinct head officer.

585
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,060
You're right.

586
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,150
Since it's been a long time since we last met, you should have a drink, yeah?

587
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,160
Assemblyman.

588
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:59,690
And that gaudy-looking guy is the community leader, but he's a gang leader.

589
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,970
Everyone was born and raised here.

590
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,720
Here.

591
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,510
Thank you.

592
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,180
I love it a lot. I love that the regional prosecutor is able to drink so well!

593
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,980
You're doing so well.

594
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,070
I'm putting in a good word to the superiors for you, so there's going to be good news soon.

595
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,260
Shouldn't you go to a better place when you leave here?

596
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,120
Thank you.

597
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,520
You saw right? That's the country for you.

598
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,990
In the country, your connections come before the law.

599
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:41,020
They're all so tied up together, so they're mean to outsiders.

600
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,530
These sons of bitches.

601
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,710
What's up with you today? Throwing out these grievances.

602
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,110
I just wanted to say it.

603
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:53,000
I didn't want the rookie to take me lightly.

604
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,850
That's what makes you look easy.

605
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,300
You could just follow my concept.

606
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,490
It's because your politics are neither here nor there

607
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,580
that you're like this.

608
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,950
What's so cool about being a lone wolf?

609
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,450
There are no ropes to rescue us.

610
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:13,050
This guy's drunk again. Come to your senses, kid.

611
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,650
Yes.

612
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,750
Team Leader,

613
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,510
don't you want to go to Seoul?

614
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:28,300
Why do you keep nagging at my side about Seoul?

615
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:34,760
The way I see it, although you've been exiled here because you upset your superiors,

616
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,210
I don't think the fire from your youth is gone.

617
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:43,870
Are you drunk too? The arrogant talk from earlier is all I need.

618
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:47,250
But you want to go, don't you?

619
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,860
Seoul. Seoul. Seoul.

620
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,750
Pretending you don't.

621
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,720
I'll send you. To Seoul.

622
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,180
- Stop.
- Regional Prosecutor—

623
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,540
Be quiet while you're here.

624
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,910
Then why would I have bothered to come here?

625
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:08,060
What, is there something you want here?

626
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,490
- Yes.
- What is it?

627
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:15,370
As for that, I'll report to you once I've sorted it out.

628
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:19,860
Your motivation might be overflowing, but there won't be much for you to do.

629
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,660
- Can I act freely?
- As freely as you want.

630
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,940
If you give me permission, starting from when I start and end work?

631
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:31,230
Do as you please! Even if you come to work, there's nothing for you to do at this regional prosecutor's office.

632
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,170
- Want a drink?
- Yes.

633
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:00,420
It's been a few days, so what do you think about Prosecutor Kim? You were worried that he'd be hard to work with.

634
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,820
I thought so too, at first. So I was really nervous.

635
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,510
And?

636
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:10,150
Don't be surprised. He really, truly does absolutely nothing.

637
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,770
- He aggressively does nothing.
- Nothing?

638
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:14,420
Right. On some days he doesn't even come to work.

639
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,690
In some ways, he does even less work than the regional prosecutor.

640
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,420
Even the first place in the training institute is helpless in Gimsan.

641
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,320
No, he could be really smart on the flipside.

642
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,680
As a reward to himself for studying all these years, he came on vacation. Paid vacation.

643
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,460
Or he could be a weirdo.

644
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,760
Weirdo.

645
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:38,930
What is all this, Prosecutor Kim?

646
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:42,220
Please reorganize all of these files.

647
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,330
- All of this?
- Yes.

648
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:49,650
When I looked over all the files you gave me last time, I thought this was a quiet neighborhood,

649
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,580
but there were a lot more cases than I thought.

650
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,710
When am I supposed to—

651
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,970
When do you think? Before you clock out today, of course.

652
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,950
Before the end of the workday? How can I—

653
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,880
Oh by the way have you heard of the Yuchae faction?

654
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,770
Yes, they run a few of the entertainment joints. They're the neighborhood gangsters.

655
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,770
Neighborhood gangsters...

656
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:12,770
So when I looked at the investigations, all the cases relating to the Yuchae faction weren't closed.

657
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,480
So will you reinvestigate them all?

658
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,150
Yes. I will.

659
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,190
I will be working offsite for a couple of days.

660
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:33,140
Ah, and send all of the information you organized to me by mail.

661
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,260
I'm supposed to reorganize all of this?

662
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,210
He was a weirdo.

663
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:49,800
Yes, Elder. Have you been well? It's Hui Wu.

664
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:55,140
Yes. I was going to see you. Right now.

665
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,590
Hello!

666
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:01,250
Oh my! What brings this old man here?

667
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,550
I came to meet you, old man.

668
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,790
Well, I'm naturally an old man.

669
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,320
Sure.

670
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,950
What about Sang Man?

671
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:15,140
Yeah. Well, I did take him in because you earnestly asked for it, but...

672
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,230
What about it? He should be a good kid.

673
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:22,690
He's good and all, but he doesn't respect the elderly. Talks back.

674
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:28,160
Wow, you sure have a lot of energy. And you pour all of that energy to insult me?

675
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,880
Look at the way he talks. So rude.

676
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,570
- It's time for your medicine.
- I won't take it, you brat.

677
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:39,450
Please take it. Straight down.

678
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,760
Hyeong-nim. Did you have a safe trip?

679
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,340
Indeed. Could you be any slower to greet me?

680
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,940
Elder needs a lot of help.

681
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,570
I don't know where he sold off his manners.

682
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,660
Please teach him well until I finish at the institute.

683
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,860
Hello. I am Park Sang Man.

684
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,570
Got it.

685
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,330
So are you here to take him back?

686
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:15,970
Yes, I am.

687
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:19,140
- You're ready, right?
- Yes. Let's go.

688
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,550
Oh, are you sad to see me go?

689
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:23,510
Leave quietly or I'll tie you down.

690
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:26,550
Wow, I'm so scared. I'll be back!

691
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,480
While I'm gone, be sure to take your medicine well.

692
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,250
Yes, be well.

693
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,780
Yes.

694
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,450
Then, we'll get going.

695
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:06,420
This is great. Now that I'm in the field. It's so refreshing.

696
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,500
I brought the money like you asked, but where will you spend it?

697
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,080
Are you going to buy that building?

698
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,050
Don't get too ahead of yourself. Elder was concerned about you.

699
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:21,370
I sought you out because I wanted to repay you and maybe stake my life on you...

700
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,420
Mr. Kim Hui Wu?

701
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,120
Park Sang Man, how did you...?

702
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,180
Did you think that I wouldn't be able to find you?

703
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,630
Well, you did spend ten years finding the criminal. I must've been easy...

704
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:43,240
I wanted to meet you Sunbae-nim. Let me greet you formally.

705
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,000
I am Park Sang Man!

706
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,070
I'm also a student at Hankuk University and I'm studying computer science,

707
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,560
and I was a scholarship student until last semester.

708
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,970
But I still haven't had a campus romance. But

709
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:56,860
after receiving the enthusiastic support of my professors and male classmates, I stand before you...

710
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,480
He's much brighter than I expected.

711
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,110
Why are you laughing?

712
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:04,650
No reason. It's nice to meet you.

713
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:09,670
I came to pay you back for saving my father.

714
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,090
From now on, these hands and feet

715
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:16,240
"are yours," was what I wanted to say...

716
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,810
Helping the elder is the same as helping me,

717
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,830
so learn everything thoroughly.

718
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,470
Nagging here and nagging over there.

719
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,250
I thought something interesting might happen when I went in the field.

720
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:38,310
Something interesting will happen soon. Take the bag.

721
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,590
What?

722
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:56,420
I heard there's a house nearby.

723
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:01,480
What? There's nothing like that here, so go on your way.

724
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,820
Now then...

725
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,880
I really shouldn't do this.

726
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,690
Let's have a little taste.

727
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:25,510
By the way mister, you shouldn't make an estimate just based on the size of the building.

728
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,640
It's really big.

729
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,940
I'll escort you, Hyungnim!

730
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,880
This way, please.

731
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,390
Good shot.

732
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:05,120
The bag with the money...

733
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,050
Welcome, Boss.

734
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,470
The next time you visit, just ask for Ms. Kim.

735
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,820
Okay. I'll do that.

736
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,750
Let's go.

737
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,060

♫ I won't back down again.  ♫

766
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,670
This is the most popular game.

767
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:13,020
The rules are simple. All you have to do is match the number on the dice.

768
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:17,660
But as you can see, the odds are different for each number.

769
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,950
If you hit 7, the number with the highest odds, you get six times the bet.

770
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:26,830
If you hit 2 or 12, the numbers with the lowest odds, you get 36 times the bet.

771
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,260
Easy, right?
Yes, well. There's nothing too hard about it.

772
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,460
You're not playing any tricks, are you?

773
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,320
Of course not. We're a local business.

774
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,410
Have fun.

775
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,960
We will.

776
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,980
Here, here, come on ten!

777
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,870
Nine! Nine!

778
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:46,790
It's an 8.

779
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,960
It's an 8.

780
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,700
What the matter?

781
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,580
Ugh, really?

782
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,850
- Seven! Seven!
- A hundred thousand won (100 USD).

783
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:07,760
Ten! Ten! Four! Ten!

784
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,130
Come out, come out.

785
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,180
Seven.

786
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,120
Seven.

787
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,750
It's a six.

788
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,020
Eight!

789
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,040
It's a seven.

790
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,090
- Five.
- It's a seven.

791
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,490
- Eight. Five.
- It's a seven. It's a nine.

792
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,780
Will you keep going?

793
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,460
Of course.

794
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,890
- Sang Man!
- Yes?

795
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,610
Go exchange the rest of the money for more chips.

796
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,830
- Okay.
- Also ...

797
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:03,860
Oh! And...

798
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:11,310
Let's keep going.

799
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,810
I have a good feeling.

800
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,400
Seven. All in.

801
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,500
- What?
- All in?

802
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,180
How much would that be if he's right?

803
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,050
It would be 42 million won (42,000 USD).

804
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,240
Hold on.

805
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,560
I'll change it to six.

806
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,430
Six?

807
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:03,040
Are you sure you would like to change your choice to six?

808
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,330
The corners of her mouth curved up.

809
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:09,120
I'm not sure. It also feels like it could be an eight.

810
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,750
It's an eight.

811
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,530
Or maybe a six?

812
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,150
She's relaxed. Then maybe...

813
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,720
Seven!

814
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,450
Please make a final decision.

815
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:32,550
Oh. Sorry. I guess I'm just being overly cautious since I bet everything.

816
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,240
Hold on.

817
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:37,870
Six.

818
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,300
No,

819
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,220
let's go with seven.

820
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,090
Hold on.

821
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,880
I'm sorry.

822
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,180
I'll change it for the last time.

823
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,260
Let's go with six.

824
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,210
It's a seven.

825
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:27,120
- Why did you change it!?
- Wow, just a single round and you're already bust.

826
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,250
Would you like to stop?

827
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:41,760
Yes. I've spent all the money I brought with me.

828
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,330
Good game.

829
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:55,260
You lost on purpose, right?

830
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,290
You kept changing your choice on purpose.

831
00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:00,380
Being indecisive doesn't suit you.

832
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:03,440
So I watched the dealer.

833
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,660
As I kept looking, I found a pattern.

834
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,930
When you changed your number at the end,

835
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:13,710
It was subtle, but I saw her moving from hell to heaven.

836
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,670
How astute.

837
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,030
After spending so long with Elder, it feels like I've only gotten better at gambling.

838
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,810
At least you got better at something. Great job.

839
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:25,480
You're not the kind of person to spend money recklessly.

840
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,920
You're also not the kind of person to do it to impress a pretty dealer.

841
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,020
Don't you think I could win her heart without doing anything?

842
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:36,090
You don't miss a chance to show off. I respect that.

843
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:39,420
What is it? You even called me to go along with you.

844
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,710
It's boring if you know everything.

845
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,410
You'll see as we go along.

846
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:49,140
Either way, I'm on my way to Seoul.

847
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,490
- Turn off the lights.
- Okay.

848
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,140
Could we share the bed?

849
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,220
- Don't cross the line.
- Okay.

850
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:10,600
Oh? You're here early.

851
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,310
Yes. I read all of the materials you e-mailed me.

852
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,090
What about them?

853
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:19,800
Reorganize everything focusing on these events, one more time.

854
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:24,690
I've picked out the ones that had slight weaknesses in the police investigation.

855
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:26,750
Ah... I see.

856
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,080
When do you need it?

857
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,440
Before you leave work, of course.

858
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,100
You can send it via email.

859
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:49,380
Oh, right! I'll be working outside of the office for a few days.

860
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,650
That crazy...

861
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,090
He's driving me insane.

862
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,610
What's good here?

863
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:09,990
No need to deliberate too much. The flounder is the best this time of year.

864
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,570
- I'll take that.
- Okay.

865
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,310
I'm Do Ah Jin.

866
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,880
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

867
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,420
You lost on purpose yesterday.

868
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,590
As if.

869
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:29,130
If I won, I would have gotten 40 million won.

870
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,590
What do you want to say?

871
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,370
Good game.

872
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:44,960
I have something to say.

873
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,410
I have something to say.

874
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,730
If you're looking for a partner to cheat with, I'll leave now.

875
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:52,720
It's similar, but I have my own angle.

876
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,680
A personal interest?

877
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:59,100
I went through a lot of trouble to pick you out, but you keep disappointing me.

878
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,450
Do I look that simple to you?

879
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:03,960
Let's keep your point short and sweet.

880
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,890
Information on the Yuchae gang who run the gambling house.

881
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,000
What are you?

882
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,070
I'm Kim Hui Wu, the prosecutor at the Gimsan Branch Office.

883
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,820
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

884
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,850
Why are you calling me at this hour?

885
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:37,400
The Yuchae gang. I'll wipe them out.

886
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,260
What?

887
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:42,070
Hey, what did you just say?

888
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:44,540
I said I will wipe out the Yuchae gang.

889
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,950
Do you have evidence?

890
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,180
I can make it now.

891
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,330
What's the matter with you?

892
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:52,000
They are running an illegal gambling house.

893
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,900
That alone is reason enough. I'd like to call for police assistance.

894
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,430
Hey, punk, listen up.

895
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:02,270
I don't know what you're up to, but it's dangerous. Don't do it.

896
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:04,010
My job is prosecutor.

897
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:07,360
If I stop because it's dangerous, then I should quit.

898
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,390
Does he have to be so direct?

899
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:11,210
Hey, you saw them when we were drinking, right?

900
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:14,140
They're gangsters, right? But those bastards think they're civil servants.

901
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:17,850
They're in cahoots with the cops. They're so chummy I bet they even prepare kimchi together.

902
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:21,470
Police assistance is what they would ask for. Don't do it.

903
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,320
You don't know this place well. That's not how it works.

904
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,960
I'll try to do as you did in Seoul.

905
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,170
What?

906
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,360
Hey, Kim Hui Wu!

907
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,640
I'll report to you again.

908
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,690
Hey. Hey, Kim Hui Wu!

909
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:37,600
Hey!!

910
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,790
That rock-headed punk.

911
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:46,650
Billiards

912
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,970
Hyung, will this really be okay?

913
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:51,900
It's not okay, but if I go, it will be okay.

914
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,320
Why? Because it's me.

915
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,670
You're sexy.

916
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:57,290
Want to get married to me?

917
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:59,380
Oh, that's bad luck. Want me to slug you?

918
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,190
You're handsome.

919
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:04,480
Stop talking bull and be sure to be on time.

920
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,610
Yes!

921
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:07,520
Billiards

922
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,500
I am going.

923
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,410
You're so cool.

924
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:21,030
Billiards

925
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,430
Designated Smoking Area

926
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:33,390
Gimsan Billiards

927
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:52,370
Aigoo, nice to see you.

928
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:53,880
You came again.

929
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,450
What'll it be this time? Craps again?

930
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,890
- No.
- Then?

931
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:01,840
Attention everyone here!

932
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,880
Attention!

933
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:09,160
I'm from the Gimsan Branch Prosecutor's Office.

934
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:14,720
Everyone here is under arrest for violation of Articles 246 and 247

935
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,610
in flagrante delicto.

936
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,870
Quiet! Quiet!

937
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:24,010
I see you were a prosecutor all along.

938
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:27,750
But what's wrong with you? How can such an educated person be so senseless?

939
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,660
- Do you have a warrant?
- Nope.

940
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:32,890
For in flagrante delicto, I learned a warrant is unnecessary.

941
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:33,950
Oh is that so?

942
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:37,760
You seem to be a little uneducated about being in the field.

943
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,270
However, I'm very good at understanding such things.

944
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:46,670
Okay, I understand that you, the young prosecutor, are upset because of what happened yesterday.

945
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:49,440
You can just tell us you're upset in a more positive tone.

946
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,120
What is all this? You're giving everyone a hard time with losses.

947
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,320
Here, here.

948
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:58,410
It's okay, it's okay.

949
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,040
Good.

950
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,910
Good, good.

951
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,370
Let's add bribery charges.

952
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,410
I guess you're serious.

953
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:13,520
Hey, prosecutor, you're really going to be in trouble.

954
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,250
This is Gimsan.

955
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:18,670
Do you know why Gimsan's shrimp are so plump and delicious?

956
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:21,640
It's because they grow up eating human corpses.

957
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:26,220
Would you like to be dipped in the shrimp habitat out front in the ocean?

958
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:31,260
Now you're threatening a prosecutor?

959
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:33,840
I'm adding obstruction of government duties.

960
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:38,200
You're going to get a lot of jail time. Huh? Huh?

961
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:41,960
Why you...!

962
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:47,890
I tried talking to you nicely,

963
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:51,620
but you won't accept my sincerity.

964
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,450
Hyeon Jong, give me the tool.

965
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:58,020
Oh no, oh my.

966
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,690
You should kick the can instead.

967
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:03,510
Don't you know if you come at me with a knife, it'll add to your sentence?

968
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:05,950
I never learned it, you fucking prosecutor.

969
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:07,420
Crazy bastard.

970
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,360
One moment.

971
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:18,940
Looks like you have more than enough manpower.

972
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,950
Hey, it's me.

973
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,890
Now.

974
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:30,220
What? Turn on the light! Who did this!?

975
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:33,160
What? Which punk did it? Hey!

976
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:37,590
N-Not yet...

977
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:39,610
Hey, Sang Man!

978
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:51,310
Everybody freeze!

979
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,730
Hey, Sang Man!

980
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,170
What's going on?

981
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:58,710
Ajusshi, stay still!

982
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,490
Who are you, Ajusshi? Show me your ID!

983
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:02,100
Who are you?

984
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,350
Sang Man...

985
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:05,240
Hyung!

986
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,570
Investigator Oh, what happened?

987
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:09,700
I came as the backup from the District Prosecutor's Office

988
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,980
and this guy was suspiciously hanging around in front of the breaker.

989
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,950
That's understandable. It's not exactly something I should be doing with confidence.

990
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:18,740
You two are on the same team.

991
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,940
He said we are on the same team!

992
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,480
Same team?

993
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,740
Anyway, I still have some things to take care of, so make sure you're both safe,

994
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:28,380
and I'll see you later. Okay?

995
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,060
Yes.

996
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:34,910
You didn't need to come out just to greet me.

997
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,980
Let's go in.

998
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,200
Why are there so many workers in such a tiny business?

999
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:57,600
Hey. Do you guys get a dedicated break room working here? Huh!?

1000
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,680
I'm a Korean prosecutor. I guess that won't work on you guys.

1001
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,830
Hey. I don't have time.

1002
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:06,320
Let's get things started.

1003
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,400
Come here!!

1004
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:19,260
♫ Hey, you're so cold. That evil leer ♫

1005
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:23,110
♫ You clearly intend something nasty ♫

1006
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:26,550
♫ Lie lie lie gradually it will come out ♫

1007
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:28,570
♫ Standing up better watch ♫

1008
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:30,730
♫ Gonna let you know ♫

1009
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:34,800
♫ You make me bad with cowardly words ♫

1010
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:38,620
♫ I’m a piece of threat bet you can’t break it ♫

1011
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:40,150
♫ Try, Try, Try, ♫

1012
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:41,970
♫ Even if you look like you're struggling ♫

1013
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,940
♫ Standing up, standing up,  ♫

1014
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:45,980
♫ standing up ♫

1015
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:49,830
♫ What kind of gang came at me? ♫

1016
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:54,650
- Bastards... I'm exhausted.
♫ Stopped in your tracks. Stay there and wait just for me ♫

1017
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:56,440
♫ Even if you fool everyone else with that innocent face ♫

1018
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:01,490
What do you think? Seems like we took enough care of it, right?
♫ You can't get away from me. ♫

1019
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,620
Yes, of course.

1020
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,920
Okay then. Let's go.

1021
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,380
Okay.

1022
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:09,070
♫ Oh, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on ♫

1023
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:11,540
♫ Oh Yeah ♫

1024
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,710
♫ Bring it on Bring it on ♫

1025
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:20,790
There's an office next to the gambling parlor's chip exchange.

1026
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:23,260
It's the base of the Yuchae faction.

1027
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,380
It's an office, but even we can't go in there.

1028
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:31,600
I bet you'll find what you're looking for there.

1029
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:38,880
Oh. Here they were.

1030
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,580
- Investigator.
- Yes?

1031
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:44,600
Begin seizing every document that's in this office.

1032
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,660
Okay, I understand. I'll bring some boxes.

1033
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,640
Sang Man, hack the computer password and compare it to the books.

1034
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,680
Okay.

1035
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:59,260
Do you think hacking the computer password will be...

1036
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:00,970
possible.

1037
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:06,890
What was I worried about? He broke through the prosecutor's office server in order to clear his father's name.

1038
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:09,000
Who are you?

1039
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:18,570
Staff Only

1040
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,390
Are you okay, Investigator?

1041
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,550
I'm o-o-okay.

1042
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:45,240
- Sang Man.
- Yes!

1043
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,090
Hey, it's good to see you, Lee Yeon Seok.

1044
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:59,380
- Do you know me?
- You're the reason I'm here.

1045
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,450
Of course, I know you.

1046
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,260
Then you must know who my master is.

1047
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,990
I do. Very well.

1048
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:06,970
But, you should work for me from now on.

1049
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:10,120
I know that you want to use your fists to fight for something meaningful.

1050
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,900
Seems like that mouth of yours will be torn soon by the sound of it.

1051
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:18,620
How come you speak in such a scary manner? I'm scared.

1052
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:21,320
Fine.

1053
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,520
I'll win for your sake.

1054
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,170
If I do, you have to listen to me. Okay?

1055
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:28,530
Sure, Hyeong.

1056
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:31,060
Then even if your trap is ripped open, we're even.

1057
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,800
Deal.

1058
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:12,260
Lee Yeon Seok.

1059
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:16,780
If he's left like this, he'll become the best fist in the whole country.

1060
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:20,240
This time,

1061
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,050
I won't leave him to live life like that.

1062
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:33,010
You bastard, seriously.

1063
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,000
- Sang Man!
- Yes!

1064
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,290
- This guy.
- Should I kill him?
- What?

1065
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,540
That's what they do in movies.

1066
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:43,090
I almost lost! What are you talking about?

1067
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:45,060
We should get him a job.

1068
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,980
- Where?
- Working under you.

1069
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:47,960
Excuse me?

1070
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:51,890
We need a new employee anyway. He can be your bodyguard too.

1071
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:55,980
I'd need a guard to protect me from him first.

1072
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:59,020
He doesn't bite. Don't worry. He'll listen to you.

1073
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:00,510
Educate him well.

1074
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:02,280
But...

1075
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,460
Okay, Hyungnim!

1076
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,900
H-H-Hey,

1077
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,000
get up.

1078
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,390

1088
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:24,380
Because I just wanted to see the ocean.

1089

I will be sure to personally quarter and skin you.

Go ahead, apologize.

1093

Isn't it?

Kim Hui Wu? I'll present it directly to the chief prosecutor.

1096
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:46,210
