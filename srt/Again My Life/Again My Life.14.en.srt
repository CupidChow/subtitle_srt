1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,820
Lee Joon Gi

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,860
Lee Kyung Young

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,560
Kim Ji Eun

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,990
Again My Life

5
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,360
Sir!

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,340
I brought in the powerful Jo Tae Seop

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,540
to show what trash he really is.

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,430
I look forward to the hand you'll play.

9
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,650
Okay, to the end.

10
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,110
I have completed the task.

11
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,890
I'll take care of it as you ordered.

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,450
If you had another life, would you use it again to catch Jo Tae Seop?

13
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:10,370
Promise me. Can you show him hell?

14
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,910
To catch him, my life began again.

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,690
3 days ago

16
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,260
Do you know me?

17
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,240
Then our conversation will be brief.

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,280
I'll give you an opportunity.

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,340
An opportunity for you to achieve your father Lee Jae Hun's unfinished dream.

20
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,250
How would you like to meet Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

21
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,670
Tell him. When I'm ready, I'll come see him.

22
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,890
So you're saying Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's people reached out to you first?

23
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,040
Right.

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,950
And you met Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

25
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,410
Yep.

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,890
Welcome.

27
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,820
One Day Earlier

28
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,610
You resemble him.

29
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,350
That gaze. It's similar to your father.

30
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,950
You said you'd come see me when you're ready.

31
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,860
Yes, I had to prepare myself.

32
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,640
It's because I understand the significance of standing before you.

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,940
Whenever I meet young prosecutors, I always ask this.

34
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,640
What do you think the relationship between an assemblyman and a prosecutor is?

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,130
A shitty one.

36
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,210
- Shitty?
- A relationship where they use each other and form cartels of power.

37
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,060
If this isn't shitty, what is?

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,980
And you had a hand in making it that way, sir.

39
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,020
Do you realize what you're saying right now?

40
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,090
I told you that I prepared myself to come here.

41
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,080
Okay. Then let me ask.

42
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,500
- Will you stand beside me?
- Yes.

43
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,850
You might have to do things you don't want to do.

44
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,200
Can you keep Kim Hui Wu in check?

45
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,160
Of course.

46
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,820
If you order me to, I can get him, too.

47
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,180
- You can get him?
- Yes.

48
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,960
- In return.
- In return?

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,430
give me Jeon Il Bo.

50
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,850
Give you Jeon Il Bo?

51
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,010
Is it because of your father?

52
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,500
Yes, I feel you must resolve the past to live in the present.

53
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,710
Jeon Il Bo unjustly accused my father of accepting bribes.

54
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,590
Thanks to him, my father spent the last days of his life in a mental hospital.

55
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,020
I've lived up to now entangled in the past, unable to think about the future.

56
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,270
So I'd like to first resolve the past.

57
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:28,740
Sir, I've already told you I'd even arrest Kim Hui Wu with whom I've spent a long time.

58
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,840
- To have me—
- I too must pay a price?

59
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,110
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,060
Do you realize how arrogant you sound?

61
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,390
Then I'll leave.

62
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,400
And I will continue to live tied to the past.

63
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,280
Don't worry, I don't intend to speak about what happened here.

64
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,820
But I'd like you to keep one thing in mind.

65
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,300
While there are many that can replace Jeon Il Bo,

66
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,150
I am probably the only prosecutor who can keep Kim Hui Wu in check.

67
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,920
I'll ask this.

68
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,380
After resolving the past, what would you like to do?

69
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,010
Well, I have never thought about the future.

70
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,450
Get Jeon Il Bo.

71
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,910
I will draw out your future.

72
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,180
- I see.
- Entertaining, isn't it?

73
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,710
Isn't it something you couldn't have imagined?

74
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,450
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop and me.

75
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,360
Yes, it's entertaining.

76
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,400
That's not what your expression reads.

77
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,130
I'm a bit worried too.

78
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:11,760
But, to me, who's already declared war, is it okay for you to expose all your thoughts?

79
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,420
Is this a way to balance out the game?

80
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,180
It is.

81
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,410
You're shooting lasers out of your eyes with that glare.

82
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,020
As promised, let's first catch Kim Seok Hun.

83
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,430
After that, we can fight.

84
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,960
There's a problem with Kim Seok Hun's wife.

85
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,820
Let's finish Kim Seok Hun quickly.

86
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,700
Again My Life

87
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,930
Here, Executive Director Kim Yeong Il's stocks in Cheonha Holdings.

88
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,060
Now, it has finally found its true owner.
Episode 14

89
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,750
Leave your evening schedule free two days from now.

90
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,890
You'll receive a notice of your appointment as Prosecutor General.

91
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:20,120
Please tell the Assemblyman that he can look forward to a new Prosecutors' Office.

92
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,440
Speaking of which, the assemblyman had something to say about that.

93
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,290
A new prosecutors' office and that beginning.

94
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,660
An incident to show the people.

95
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,070
In order for the Prosecutors' Office to show it won't bend to political pressures and that the law is equal for all,

96
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,890
how about investigating Cheonha Group's Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's daughter, Kim Hui Ah?

97
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,400
It's a good story.

98
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,250
I'll take my leave.

99
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,060
I got it. I'll buy it next time, for sure.

100
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,710
And then jjajangmyeon (black bean sauce noodles) next?

101
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,990
That was Executive Assistant Kim Jin Wu, right?

102
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,960
Yes.

103
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,480
I wonder why he came?

104
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,990
We can't find out the details, but one thing's for sure.

105
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,170
Jo Tae Seop has selected Kim Seok Hun as prosecutor general.

106
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,770
Then, what about you?

107
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,690
I'll probably be fired.

108
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,420
Before becoming prosecutor general, he will want to show what happens to a prosecutor who has lost favor.

109
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,510
No, that won't happen.

110
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,890
What do you mean?

111
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,060
I will have him lose the nomination before then.

112
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:11,420
Kim Seok Hun will be unable to escape this time.

113
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,720
Yeah, Han Mi.

114
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,080
Okay.

115
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,980
Have a look at this.

116
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,390
Prosecutor General Nominee Kim Seok Hun's Corruption Exposed

117
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,280
What is that?

118
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:44,100
Recently, I received an anonymous letter.

119
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,170
The source requested anonymity.

120
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:57,850
You'll probably remember the Gimsan drug and human trafficking case that put the country in an uproar.

121
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,610
It's testimony from someone related to that.

122
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,960
As a person related to the drug and human trafficking incident in Gimsan,

123
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,130
which once caused a stir across the country,

124
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:13,200
he stated he wanted to accuse the one person who had escaped that case.

125
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,630
A key figure who received protection from the authorities was

126
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,760
Assemblyman of Gimsan, Gu Wuk Cheong.

127
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,960
The authority who protected Assemblyman Gu Wujk Cheong

128
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,980
is the nominee for the next prosecutor general and

129
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,640
the current chief prosecutor of the Seoul Central District, Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

130
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,220
As I inspected the verifiable documents and persons,

131
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,200
I understood the seriousness of the case

132
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,590
to stand before you after discussing within the party.

133
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,040
I, Daehan Party Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong,

134
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,570
for conflicts of interest in business, receiving commercial favors, sex favors, etc,

135
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,920
destroying the prestige and honor of an assemblyperson,

136
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,650
beg that Democratic Party Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong and

137
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:04,310
Central District Branch Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun be indicted by the prosecution.

138
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,050
Gu Wuk Cheong! Finally!

139
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,190
That's right. Used train ticket from Gimsan to Seoul should be thrown away. (He was their ticket to Seoul from Gimsan).

140
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,390
Now, this is only the beginning.

141
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,860
Oh, she's coming out.

142
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,650
Eastern District Prosecutor Kim Gyu Ri.

143
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,390
I am Kim Gyu Ri of the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

144
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,180
Most recently, the Eastern District, while investigating

145
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,200
white collar crimes and tax evasion among the upper class,

146
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,530
What's this?
Possible Instances of JQ Gallery Tax Evasion

147
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,630
Give it to District Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi

148
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:49,510
District Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is trying to use Choi Kang Jin to hunt District Prosecutor Yun.

149
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,780
And that these documents will become his shield.

150
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,690
We have found evidence that Seoul Central District Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun's Wife, Pak Min Yeong,

151
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,150
used various methods of money laundering and tax evasion

152
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,080
during the process of trading high-priced art.

153
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,080
JQ Gallery where Ms. Park is CEO,

154
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,090
fabricated accounting books when selling high-priced art to dealers,

155
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,790
Kim Seok Hun, you dare hunt me?
thereby evading corporate taxes.

156
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,580
The warrant has been just issued by the court.

157
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,320
We've launched a search and seizure of JQ Gallery,

158
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,950
I can't die by myself.
which is being run under Pak Min Yeong's sibling's name.

159
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,410
Let's die together, Seok Hun.

160
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,710
Is it Yun Jong Gi's doing?

161
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,270
I'm confirming.

162
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:41,080
First, Hwang Jin Yong, and now Eastern District Prosecutors' Office. Something's off.

163
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,860
I'm getting a sense that this isn't the end.

164
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,340
I'm sure he knows that I'm behind Kim Seok Hun,

165
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,790
and that blocking this is nothing for me.

166
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,870
Sir, it's District Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

167
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,820
- Tell him to come.
- Yes.

168
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,010
Yes, please send him in.

169
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,900
What could it be?

170
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,250
It feels like something bigger has been prepared.

171
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,610
Gu Wuk Cheong's incident, followed by his wife's case...

172
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,590
Will Kim Seok Hun be able to survive this time, too?

173
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:34,430
It could be a difficult issue for Kim Seok Hun to get out of, but it's not at all threatening to Jo Tae Seop.

174
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,830
But Jo Tae Seop will probably be conflicted.

175
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,430
He can pull him out of the swamp again,

176
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,790
but is Kim Seok Hun worth going that far for?

177
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,620
Kim Seok Hun will go to see Jo Tae Seop.

178
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,720
He'll try to survive, but in the end,

179
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,440
the visit will cement his downfall.

180
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:01,840
The last shot is aimed at Kim Seok Hun's heart.

181
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,750
Above-named will transfer 550,000 shares to transferee.
All fees arising from transfer will be paid by above.

182
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,830
Park Sang Man

183
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,740
Okay. The stock transfer process

184
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,660
is complete now.

185
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,520
Sang Man. No... CEO Park.

186
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,820
You've worked hard.

187
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,020
Don't say that. It was an opportunity for me to see you, too, and—

188
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,170
Hold on.

189
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:51,230
Hi, Hui Wu. Yes, I just took care of Kim Yeong Il's stocks.

190
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,970
Oh. I'll do that. Thanks.

191
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,530
Secretary Park, before it's made public, let Park Dae Ho get the wind of the fact that

192
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,730
Cheonha Holdings shares which JQ Construction owned

193
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,770
are now in my hands.

194
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,330
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,390
District Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun
JQ Gallery

196
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,130
Yes, I understand.

197
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,400
Sir, that was Park Dae Ho.

198
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,180
He said that the Kim Yeong Il's stake in Cheonha Holdings that were put up as collateral have been collected.

199
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,420
- What?
- The problem is that the holder of security rights, Park Sang Man, the CEO of PSM Investments

200
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,490
disposed of the stock.

201
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,150
Who bought the stocks?

202
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,890
The Managing Director of Cheonha Group Strategic Management, Kim Hui Ah.

203
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,540
Collateral?

204
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,290
Did Kim Seok Hun really not know?

205
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,140
Sir, Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is here.

206
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,910
Come in.

207
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,540
I apologize. I really didn't know.

208
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,370
I'll get my wife right away as well as Kim Hui Ah.

209
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,410
Five days. If you just give me five days...

210
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,360
- Five days?
- Yes, sir.

211
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,500
I'll take care of Gu Wuk Cheong for you. You take care of your family matters.

212
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,730
Yes, sir.

213
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,070
I don't intend to block your appointment.

214
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,110
There are many things you need to do as the prosecutor general,

215
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,870
so hang in there until you reach the position.

216
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,490
Yes, sir.

217
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,010
Pardon?

218
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,080
Sir, there is something you should see.

219
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,410
- The situation is serious.
 - Hello,

220
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,130
my name is Kim Han Mi.

221
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:51,250
I am the illegitimate child of Prosecutor General candidate Kim Seok Hun.

222
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:57,510
My mother Kim Yeong Hui supported Kim Seok Hun while he was preparing for the exam to become a prosecutor.

223
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:03,550
But after passing the exam, he abandoned my mother.

224
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,560
So, this was it.

225
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,590
Under pressure never to reveal the truth in Korea, I was registered under my mother's family register

226
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,920
and have been hiding my biological father's identity until now.

227
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,800
I wasn't able to have a normal life since early on,

228
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,070
- Was this it?
 - so I had to give up the freedom to make my own choices.

229
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,360
- After focusing public attention on the corruption of Gu Wuk Cheong and his wife
- From college to career choice,

230
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,940
- a child born out of wedlock comes to land the final blow.
 - candidate Kim Seok Hun threatened me

231
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,020
never to call attention to myself,

232
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,200
but I've endured until now with the determination that I must escape that threat.

233
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,410
The reason that I am standing before you right now is because...

234
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,100
What do you think about what that young lady is saying?

235
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,090
I find it laughable that such a guilty person should be investigating someone's corruption.

236
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,940
Candidate Kim Seok Hun,

237
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:50,140
please don't make light of the Republic of Korea any longer!

238
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,280
I guess she's not making it all up.

239
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:04,710
Sir, I'll take care of it.

240
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,750
Don't kneel!

241
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,640
It's just one more thing we have to resolve, that's all.

242
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,390
Leave.

243
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,740
Go and take care of it like a prosecutor should.

244
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,350
Tell Kim Hui Wu.

245
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,160
To arrest Kim Seok Hun.

246
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,250
What can I do about a child who's already been born?

247
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,830
Yes, sir.

248
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,940
This is the assemblyman's order. Arrest Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

249
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,640
I've delivered the message.

250
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,420
- Did he ask why?
- No.

251
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,400
He just said that he understood.

252
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,210
He's not asking for a reason this time either?

253
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,890
No.

254
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,390
- This is Oh Min Guk.
- It's me.

255
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,890
I didn't think I would live to see the day that I would wait for your call.

256
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,240
I'm busy, so I'll skip the pleasantries.

257
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,870
There is something I need you to look into.

258
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,000
I also saw it on TV.

259
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,070
Do you need other crimes on Gu Wuk Cheong in addition to the corruption charges?

260
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,870
Yes. You're right.

261
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,190
I already put it together thinking it could be useful one day.

262
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:05,420
I found out that he bought a painting from JQ Gallery.

263
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,670
And he even played golf with Kim Seok Hun.

264
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,550
I just sent you an email, so good luck putting the pieces of the puzzle together.

265
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,380
Okay. Thank you.

266
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,000
Sure.

267
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,320
Sunbae, I'll head out first. Please send the investigators down to the first floor.

268
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,670
Sure. Go ahead.

269
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,480
Prosecution Service

270
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,910
I apologize.

271
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,380
It's okay. Go ahead.

272
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,000
Kim Seok Hun, you are being arrested without a warrant for abuse of authority.

273
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,550
You have the right to remain silent and the right to request an attorney.

274
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,760
From now on, everything you say can be used against you in a court of law.

275
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,430
- Do you admit to the charges?
- How do you feel?

276
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,470
Give us a comment, please.

277
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,540
Please say a word! A word!

278
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,550
It's fine if you express your right to remain silent.

279
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,950
But I'm sure you're well aware it can be disadvantageous,

280
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,050
so I will stop the conversation and ask my questions.

281
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:38,200
Have you ever covered up corruption by Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong?

282
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,050
At the time when I was Gimsan Branch's Branch Prosecutor, I Jeon Seok Gyu

283
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:12,770
right before the press conference on Gimsan Drug Smuggling and Human Trafficking, received a phone call.

284
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:17,680
An order to take Gu Wuk Cheong, whose corruption was clear, off the list of criminals.

285
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:23,470
That order was given by then Seoul Central District Deputy District Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun, who is now the District Prosecutor.

286
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:29,520
I, Jeon Seok Gyu, following those orders excluded Gu Wuk Cheong from the list of criminals.

287
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,200
And I'm the other witness.

288
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:48,960
As you know, the list of people involved in the sexual favors scandal revealed by Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong

289
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,400
and the list you gave me were different.

290
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,600
That decision wasn't mine.

291
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,470
You know very well.

292
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:09,420
Are you trying to trying to rope that person into this?

293
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:18,880
Allegations regarding JQ Construction and Gallery will be jointly investigated with the Eastern District.

294
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,650
You must've received instructions as well.

295
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,260
To take me down.

296
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,320
It'll be difficult to get out of it this time.

297
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,400
Also, about Kim Han Mi.

298
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,660
A long time ago, in order to save Han Mi, who was in trouble,

299
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,380
you came to the police station.

300
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,840
How do you know that?

301
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,750
I'm the friend who helped her that day.

302
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:01,720
I don't know what Han Mi means to you, but she's a dear friend of mine.

303
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,130
The decision of going public with the truth

304
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,450
was an agonizing one for Han Mi.

305
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,420
I hope you know that.

306
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,640
I'll ask you the questions now. Do you admit to the charges?

307
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,760
I do.

308
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:00,490
Prosecution Service

309
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,420
Hello. I'm Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu from the Central District Office.

310
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:14,440
I'll announce the results of Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun's investigation.

311
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,840
We at the Anti-Corruption Investigation Department,

312
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,970
arrested and indicted him for inappropriate reduction of criminal charges, concealment of crimes and abuse of authority.

313
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:30,540
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun concealed the crimes of Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong.

314
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:37,010
Moreover, he committed similar crimes to protect the assemblymen who were involved in the sexual bribery case.

315
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,960
- Manager Han.
- Yes, sir.

316
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,920
Have you ever seen a tree that was perfectly smooth without a single flaw?

317
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,540
No, sir.

318
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:52,840
- Same here. Kim Hui Wu can't be an exception. Find his flaw.
- Yes, sir.

319
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,430
He knows mine, so I should know at least one of his, too.

320
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,460
Shall I look into bribery?

321
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,770
No, not that. He said he came to me because of his convictions.

322
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,840
- Anything material wouldn't work. Find something else.
- Yes, sir.

323
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,050
What do you think about making Yoon Jong Gi Prosecutor General?

324
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,520
I think he's the best option we have.

325
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,910
I haven't found any issues in his personal life or with this family.

326
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,320
Nor did he have any political connections prior to Kim Jong Taek.

327
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,880
And I didn't find any ties to Hwang Jin Yong based on the press briefing today.

328
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,710
What about the chief prosecutor position at the Central District Office?

329
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,830
I'm not sure.

330
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,190
Manager Kim?

331
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,320
What about Jeon Seok Gyu?

332
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,420
Jeon Seok Gyu?

333
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,060
He's never been taken care of by someone in power.

334
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,660
He's an honest man. Once he's loyal to you, I doubt he'll betray you.

335
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,930
Arrange a meeting.

336
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,770
Yes, sir.

337
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,770
- Secretary Han.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,020
Tell Yun Jong Gi I'd like to have dinner with him.

339
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,430
Yes, sir.

340
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:59,390
What should I do about Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong? He keeps calling.

341
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,580
Leave him be. Now's not the time to worry about small fry.

342
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,450
Yes, sir.

343
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,620
Jeon Seok Gyu.

344
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,760
How do you feel about arresting Chief Prosecutor Kim?

345
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,910
I'm not sure.

346
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,420
Our partnership ends today.

347
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,060
Shall we grab a drink to celebrate?

348
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,340
I'm sorry, I've got plans.

349
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,620
Plans? With whom?

350
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,260
Don't look at me like that. It was my choice.

351
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,490
I should've tried harder to stop you. I'm sorry.

352
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,880
Why are you apologizing?

353
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,350
It must've been a tough decision. Good job.

354
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,250
Do you know how I feel right now?

355
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:16,270
For the first time since I was born, I feel relieved.

356
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,430
What? Do I look pitiful to you?

357
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:24,860
I said I'm fine. Seriously. I'm totally fine.

358
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,270
All right.

359
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,890
Mom

360
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,740
That's enough drinking for me today.

361
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,860
I should go comfort my mom.

362
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,190
I feel good, but I don't think she does.

363
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:46,430
Things are going to get really tough from now on.

364
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,040
Why? Because people know who I am now?

365
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,120
Maybe this is my chance to go into show business.

366
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,160
Didn't I look pretty good on screen?

367
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,490
Come on, punk. I'll see you.

368
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,110
Were you disappointed?

369
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,490
No, sir.

370
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:26,960
I was disappointed. The secret investigation on Kim Seok Hun's wife.

371
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,930
You should've at least given me a heads up.

372
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,420
I'm sorry, sir.

373
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,060
I thought a man like Kim Seok Hun didn't deserve to be Prosecutor General.

374
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,910
- The reason?
- Kim Seok Hun always said something.

375
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,250
"To make a prosecution that doesn't compromise with politics."

376
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,100
To me, that sounded like Kim Seok Hun

377
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,980
would one day hinder your political career.

378
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,660
All right, I understand.

379
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Chief Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi.

380
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,960
Yes, sir?

381
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:08,120
The prosecution office you dream of. Try to make it a reality.

382
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,850
- Pardon?
- Prepare for a hearing. You'll get a call sometime tomorrow.

383
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,460
A-Assemblyman...

384
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,290
Thank you.

385
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,980
Try your best.

386
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,910
JQ Constructions Case Report

387
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,020
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun Concealment Charge Case Report

388
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,190
I've cut off Kim Seok Hun, Jo Tae Seop's right-hand man.

389
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:57,050
Next, I'll have to cut off Park Dae Ho, his purse strings.

390
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,910
Kim Seok Hun's wife and son have been arrested.

391
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:04,550
JQ Construction will be out on the market soon.

392
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,110
Take it over.

393
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,930
The construction business will flourish again soon.

394
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,450
JQ Constructions will play many roles.

395
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,410
Yes, sir.

396
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:18,470
- Don't make any mistakes. Be on standby and don't miss the timing, okay?
- Yes, sir.

397
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:24,140
Also, your Cheonha Holdings shares. I'll need them soon.

398
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,960
So get prepared.

399
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,790
Manager Han.

400
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,570
Yes, sir.

401
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,850
I need to make a visit to Cheonha Group.

402
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,570
Shall I contact Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun?

403
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,150
No, contact Kim Hui Ah.

404
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,280
Yes, sir.

405
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,070
Cheonha

406
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,590
Director Kim Hui Ah

407
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,790
It's been a while.

408
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,650
I was about to visit you soon, but you beat me to it.

409
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,330
Is that so?

410
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,190
Why did you do it?

411
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,130
The special investigation by National Tax Service.

412
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:06,270
You say you care about the nation's economy, but your actions say otherwise.

413
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,720
- Do I?
- Yes.

414
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,530
Why didn't you come by and ask me yourself like you are now?

415
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,700
Or do you have too much pride to do that?

416
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,910
Of course not. A businessman has no pride.

417
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,760
The National Tax Service investigation won't stop easily.

418
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,210
Products, chemicals, and shipbuilding. They'll dig into everything.

419
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,650
Do you want to stop it? There's only one way then.

420
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,590
Until when do you plan to keep the chairman's seat empty?

421
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:48,490
Make Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun the chairman. That's my offer.

422
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,960
You're revealing your anxiety for the first time.

423
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,410
You must be worried that I have Kim Yeong Il's shares.

424
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,730
You're worried I might use those shares to become chairwoman.

425
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,500
You're mistaken, Director Kim. I'm here to make my last offer.

426
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,990
Last offer?

427
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:15,060
Yes. The three of you didn't know your duties and responsibilities as the children of Chairman Kim Geon Yeong.

428
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,540
You're engaged in a power struggle to become the chairman.

429
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,240
The world is changing quickly, but you're fighting to fulfill your personal ambition.

430
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,520
How much longer should I wait? There's a limit to my patience.

431
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,910
My father taught me something.

432
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,190
"Don't do business that'll bring you loss."

433
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:45,870
If you want to make a deal, bring me something beneficial, instead of a threat.

434
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,740
Think wisely. You don't have much time.

435
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:58,270
Once the prosecution stabilizes, who do you think their next target will be?

436
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,980
Shall I repeat myself? Threats will not work.

437
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,820
Thank you for the coffee. Let's go.

438
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm going out to eat.

439
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,260
Sure, go ahead.

440
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,950
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

441
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,100
Aren't you going to eat? Let's go get some food.

442
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,740
Sure.

443
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,190
Where's Branch Prosecutor Jeon?

444
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,010
I'm not sure. He rushed out after getting a phone call.

445
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,000
Who do you think will get the chief prosecutor position?

446
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,980
I can't say. I'm not sure.

447
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,100
If only he wasn't disliked by the higher-ups.

448
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,910
It would be nice if Prosecutor Jeon went from the Central District Prosecutor's Office all the way up to prosecutor general.

449
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,290
That would be nice.

450
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:04,100
What should we eat?

451
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,350
Let's have soup today.

452
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,940
How does fish soup sound?

453
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,730
Sounds good!

454
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:23,080
Your junior prosecutors follow your lead, right?

455
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,470
This is the first I'm hearing about that.

456
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,420
I'm just an incompetent prosecutor.

457
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,550
You're humble too.

458
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,890
Why did you call for me?

459
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,180
The Chief Prosecutor position is empty.

460
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:55,620
I think that prosecutors meeting up with politicians to talk about prosecutor business is extremely inappropriate.

461
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:01,070
What's wrong with two people who share a worry about the welfare of the citizens meeting?

462
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:04,200
Today can be the first day of our bond.

463
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,440
You and I?

464
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,780
Why would that be a problem?

465
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,940
I'm thinking of making you

466
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,640
the head of the Central Prosecutor's Office.

467
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,780
But, I have a condition.

468
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,250
Get Hwang Jin Yong out of politics.

469
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,220
And new wine should be poured into new wineskins.

470
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,730
So cut off all of the current allies that you've been working with.

471
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,040
Keep Choi Kang Jin by your side. That's my condition.

472
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,320
Why me?

473
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,540
Precisely that.

474
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:51,470
When opportunity knocks, everyone desperately tries to grab onto it, but you ask why.

475
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,100
It must be because you're careful and have a strong sense of responsibility.

476
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,060
Once you make a decision, you don't change your mind.

477
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,480
Chief Prosecutor.

478
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,710
If you're a prosecutor, it's a position you must have dreamt about at least once.

479
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:11,700
You must know that the opportunity doesn't come to just anyone.

480
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:18,030
Depending on what you do, you could even become prosecutor general.

481
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,480
Prosecutor's Office

482
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,930
I thought you said you had a meeting. Did you only eat and come back?

483
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,590
Yeah.

484
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:40,480
Sir, by any chance, did anyone offer you the chief prosecutor position?

485
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,270
What?

486
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,730
Why are you so startled?

487
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,820
What kind of nonsense is that?

488
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,500
I heard the prosecutors from the 1st investigation division team talking in the break room.

489
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,210
- About what?
- They were saying that you were a candidate for the chief prosecutor position.

490
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,250
It seems like a lot of prosecutors support you.

491
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,360
Stop saying nonsense. How did the indictment reports from today go?

492
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,940
Yes. I'll go and report those now.

493
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,000
Prosecution

494
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,790
Born in Haesan, Gyeonggi Province. Hankuk University Law Graduate.

495
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,470
The prosecutor of conviction, Jeon Seok Gyu.

496
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:26,780
He simply hasn't had the chance to abandon his convictions, that's all.

497
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,420
Jeon Seok Gyu knows now. He's older so he'll understand

498
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,160
what it means to live with conviction.

499
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,650
But why did you instruct him to keep Choi Kang Jin by his side?

500
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,790
You said that they don't get along.

501
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,720
If you want something, you have to put up with some things you dislike.

502
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,340
If he can't follow this level of instruction, I can't make him my person.

503
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,910
Why have you gotten so much better at hitting?

504
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,800
Really?

505
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,780
What do you think? Is this good enough?

506
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,080
It's good enough to be considered professional level.

507
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,910
That's a relief.

508
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,580
There is someone I want to face off with at least once.

509
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,460
Do you have someone like that?

510
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,080
Yes.

511
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,680
You'll probably be able to see him soon.

512
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,680
Really?

513
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,230
Hwang Jin Yong

514
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,660
Hello, sir.

515
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,750
Did you want to speak to me?

516
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,990
Have a seat.

517
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,800
Yes, sir.

518
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,990
Congratulations on becoming the head of the party.

519
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,910
Thank you.

520
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,460
You're the one who pushed me, but I think the reason I got that position

521
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,030
was because of public sentiment.

522
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,070
They say that public sentiment is divine will.

523
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,670
That's why I feel like there's such a heavy weight on my shoulders.

524
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,780
Please become a good party leader.

525
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,160
Yes, I must.

526
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,360
Ah, about the chief prosecutor.

527
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,880
Yun Jong Gi from the Eastern District Prosecutor's Office,

528
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:59,200
I think he'll become the prosecutor general.

529
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:05,670
It's as predicted. Since he's one of Jo Tae Seop's people.

530
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:10,680
But, the trust between the two of them probably won't be deep.

531
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,880
Jo Tae Seop knows that Yun Jong Gi was working with Kim Jeong Taek.

532
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,430
And Yun Jong Gi knows that Jo Tae Seop used Kim Seok Hun

533
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,380
to target him.

534
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,840
You're saying that once trust is lost, it breaks.

535
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,900
Yes.

536
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:34,220
Before that, we have to hit Jo Tae Seop again.

537
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,530
We should.

538
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,730
The Central Prosecutor's Office.

539
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:43,680
The decision still hasn't been finalized, but Branch Prosecutor Jeon's name

540
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,230
has been floating around the National Assembly.

541
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,740
It would be good for you to keep that in mind.

542
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,640
Let's go get some food.

543
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,710
Sure. Where's Branch Prosecutor Jeon?

544
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:58,600
I'm not sure. He rushed out right after getting a phone call.

545
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:10,160
Prosecutor's Office

546
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,150
What brings you here?

547
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,190
Sir.

548
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,120
This is the list of assemblymen who received sexual bribes that were omitted by previous Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

549
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,830
A re-investigation is unavoidable.

550
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,630
Of course!

551
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,140
I'll take care of these.

552
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,790
Okay.

553
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,040
Seonbae, how about we have another Gimsan team unity meeting today? It's been a long time.

554
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,580
Sounds good to me.

555
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,950
Sir, shall we have a drink?

556
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,570
Sir?

557
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,370
Sir!

558
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,650
Oh? Yes. What?

559
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:01,130
Are you sick? You've been acting strange since yesterday.

560
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,720
Sir, let's have a unity meeting today.

561
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,900
I'll treat you to Korean beef.

562
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,610
Count me in!

563
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:14,400
Sir, the youngest is offering to treat us. We definitely have to go.

564
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,590
Today is my wife's birthday.

565
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,930
You drink amongst yourselves.

566
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:30,040
Right! His wife's birthday is in the summer, though.

567
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,590
I am getting a feeling.

568
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,560
Something has slightly changed in him.

569
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,200
Why?

570
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,340
It's suspicious. Something is off.

571
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,230
But, are you really buying today?

572
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,830
Sure. Of course.

573
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:52,880
Where should we go? You should get ready.

574
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,810
I can't arrest Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong.

575
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,030
Are you rejecting my offer for the position of Chief Prosecutor?

576
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:32,450
If someone is guilty, I would lock them up even if it's my own kid.

577
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:36,460
But I can't arrest someone who's innocent.

578
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:40,710
Are you still that naive about the world?

579
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,020
I heard your juniors are outrunning you.

580
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,300
Aren't you embarrassed about falling behind?

581
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,180
I'm not ashamed at all.

582
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,510
I'm sure you vetted me.

583
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,340
I was born this way.

584
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,800
Coming to Seoul was a struggle for you.

585
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,450
It seems you'll have to move to an ocean-view office again.

586
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:02,710
I like the ocean.

587
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,750
Did you think those threats would scare me?

588
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:14,400
I get why the junior prosecutors respect you.

589
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,230
Chief Jeon. You have a unique talent of intriguing people.

590
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,180
I reject your offer to live as a dog. Goodbye.

591
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,040
Sit down.

592
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,000
If you leave now, it won't stop with exile.

593
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,510
You may lose everything from trying to uphold your principles.

594
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,320
You asked why I chose you, right?

595
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,580
I need a man I can trust.

596
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:04,040
Not some punk who sweet talks and conjures tricks to ride my coattails.

597
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,000
That's not what I'm looking for.

598
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,130
I need a talent who's honest and upright like you.

599
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:14,220
Then guarantee this for me.

600
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:18,170
For the Central District Office to have independence over investigations and personnel.

601
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,540
I'll reconsider then.

602
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,710
You want me to give way this time?

603
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,250
That's right.

604
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:29,260
Aren't you afraid of laying down such a condition with me?

605
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,980
It wasn't a condition, but a right.

606
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,730
A right?

607
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,860
Get back to work then.

608
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,420
A right?

609
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,720
I said I would buy you Korean beef.

610
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,910
Nonsense.

611
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,460
So this is where you ended up without me?

612
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,050
I thought you were buying beef.

613
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,070
- Chief!
- Chief!

614
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,460
I knew you would be here.

615
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,360
Now, this is loyalty.

616
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,010
How could we eat Korean Beef without you?

617
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,550
I appreciate it, my boys.

618
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:40,820
By the way, do you know you've been acting strange recently?

619
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,710
How so?

620
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,120
Are you okay?

621
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,650
I'm hungry.

622
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:50,020
Even with a feast laid out, I couldn't eat because I was dining with someone uncomfortable.

623
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,420
- You mean your wife?
- No, Jo Tae Seop.

624
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:59,030
Was it about the Chief Prosecutor position?

625
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,840
So the rumors were true?

626
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,580
So? What happened?

627
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:08,260
A fancy hat (position) won't ever exist in my life. I was turned down.

628
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,680
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is detained in the Eastern Detention Center.

629
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,500
Even if he's acquitted in trial, he's been deemed immoral due to his illegitimate child.

630
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,270
It will be hard for him to make a comeback.

631
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,740
Kim Seok Hun.

632
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,950
I had shared my inner thoughts with him and trusted him quite a bit.

633
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,210
But...

634
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,920
I shouldn't have relied on his greed.

635
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,440
Can I trust Kim Hui Wu then?

636
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:57,980
Manager Han. Did you prepare a leash that suits Kim Hui Wu?

637
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,090
I have, sir.

638
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,610
- Go ahead then.
- Yes, sir.

639
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:15,660
I said I was fine. Why did you drag me out so early on my day off?

640
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,450
They were worried about you. They kept whining about bringing you out.

641
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,580
Nuna.

642
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,570
What is this?

643
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,420
It's a gift from me and Yeon Seok. I paid more.

644
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,020
You were pretty on TV, but your skin looked dry.

645
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,280
What are you saying? I'm trending for my beauty.

646
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,340
Where?

647
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,660
Do you not have internet access?

648
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,830
I didn't see anything.

649
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:50,550
I'm already pretty as is, but I'll be even prettier with this. What to do?

650
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,630
What a stunner.

651
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,130
Thanks.

652
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:00,750
You took a break from work, right? Don't just stay home and go somewhere.

653
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,030
You're the only friend who worries about me.

654
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:06,540
I was planning to go somewhere far away to get some air.

655
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,140
How about Bali? A paradise full of passion and romance.

656
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,430
Father, it's still cold outside. Aren't you cold in that short-sleeve shirt?

657
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,840
Gosh, you know why he's wearing that?

658
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,070
Let me tell you. The next-door shop owner gave it as a souvenir from a trip.

659
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:25,630
He's braving the cold so Hui Wu would see it.

660
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,870
Gosh, you're making me uncomfortable.

661
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,630
Hui Wu. I have one for you too.

662
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:32,650
- Seriously?
- Here, what do you think?

663
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,120
How do I look, guys?

664
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,820
- You look great!
- I do?

665
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,520
- Bali's man.
- That's enough.

666
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,050
Bali is amazing. You should go on a family trip.

667
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,740
You've been to Bali before?

668
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:48,140
Their oceans and sunsets are amazing.

669
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,170
I love the Pacific Ocean, yet I've never been to Bali.

670
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,550
I get a feeling something will happen in Bali. (TN: Referring to a hugely popular drama in 2004.)

671
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:56,500
Then let's all go after this case is over.

672
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,970
We'll have a family trip.

673
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:00,150
Really? When?

674
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,730
Soon. I'll take you there soon.

675
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:05,640
I'll start practicing Bali dance then.

676
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,930
- It's belly dance.
- Same thing.

677
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:12,160
You're flexible.

678
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:15,300
Welcome.

679
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,980
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

680
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,120
Whichever dish you choose, you won't be disappointed.

681
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,280
- Okay.
- You won't be joining the trip.

682
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,780
Come on.

683
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:31,960
- Han Mi, delicious food will help you de-stress. Eat up.
- All right.

684
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,690
Thanks. I feel better thanks to you.

685
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,500
Don't mention it. Get home safely.

686
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,880
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

687
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:50,500
OPEN / 11:00 AM
CLOSE / 10:00 PM

688
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,280
Are you done?

689
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:57,460
Let me ring you up. It's 18,000 won.

690
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,670
- Here.
- Okay.

691
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:04,560
Thank you.

692
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,020
I'm staying at this hotel.

693
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:11,760
I came because people said the food was good. But I don't know how to get back.

694
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,060
Shall I call you a taxi?

695
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:18,660
I want to walk. Could you just tell me the directions?

696
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:22,510
Sure. Follow me.

697
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,960
- If you go this way, you'll see an art center.
- Okay.

698
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,340
Turn right from there and walk two more blocks. You'll see your hotel.

699
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,920
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yes.

700
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,820
I've made contact.

701
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:53,520
Tell the assemblyman I can do this.

702
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,040
I'll make a promise.

703
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:07,620
If you can put a leash on him, our army will use your company's helicopters.

704
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:15,840
You want me to seduce a man? You chose the wrong person.

705
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,890
I'm not some low-life opportunist.

706
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:22,960
Do you think that's how I view you?

707
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,370
And does he look like a low-life to you?

708
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:30,140
A mere prosecutor, with no titles for that matter.

709
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,950
He's not upper-class for sure.

710
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:37,060
Don't judge a book by its cover. He's not an easy target.

711
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,680
You really think so?

712
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,510
Men grovel to win me over.

713
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:54,790
Especially, those who seek power.

714
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:59,930
Because having me means they'll have the best accessory.

715
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,760
You said your name was Jung Seo Yeon?

716
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,970
Men who covet power want to have you?

717
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,070
Then answer me this.

718
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:19,460
Do I...

719
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,370
want you?

720
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,950
What an arrogant statement.

721
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,820
Just get him to fall for you.

722
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:40,320
This man will be the key to your business.

723
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,750
Got it?

724
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,600
It's easy.

725
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:52,560
My goodness! What?

726
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,460
What? What is it? I lost my heart.

727
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,620
- What?
- Are you interested?

728
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,760
It's the first time seeing you stare at a woman.

729
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,930
That's right.

730
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:09,140
Nuna Hui Ah, Nuna Han Mi, Nuna Gyu Ri ... there are a lot of beauties around you...ha?

731
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:15,260
Ah, the reason why you have been single is that you like that style.

732
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,840
A bit of a femme fatale style, isn't it?

733
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,810
It's not.

734
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:24,020
If that's the case, Nuna Han Mi isn't that easy.

735
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,320
Be honest, you enjoy this, don't you?

736
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,560
- I'm jealous when your eyes wander elsewhere.
- I see.

737
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,230
Enough with the nonsense.

738
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,430
Yes, Hui Ah?

739
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,250
Gosh, Hui Ah.

740
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,650
Now?

741
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,690
Sang Man too?

742
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,650
I think JQ Construction will be on the market soon.

743
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:02,930
But only one company will jump in to buy it.

744
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:05,670
Jo Tae Seop threatened all the other companies

745
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:09,350
not to get involved with JQ Construction.

746
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:12,800
Then which company will get involved?

747
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,970
A paper company that has zero records until now.

748
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:20,520
The CEO is just a puppet. Someone else is running the finances.

749
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,480
Don't tell me it is...

750
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,150
Yes. Park Dae Ho.

751
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,720
So once he buys JQ Construction ...

752
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:32,270
He'll give their projects away and sell it to another company at a high price.

753
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:35,350
Then he'll use that black money

754
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,440
to buy Cheonha Holdings' shares.

755
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,340
If we don't move now, we might fail to acquire JQ Construction.

756
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,660
You're right.

757
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:49,430
He'll be the only one bidding, so Park Dae Ho will have his guard down.

758
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,940
That's why I'm here to support you.

759
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,180
This rich nuna would like to make an investment.

760
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,070
What do you say?

761
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:01,260
We would love that.

762
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,290
Letter of Intent

763
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,240
Is this for real?

764
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,420
Are you sure you have the funds?

765
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,870
How could I buy a company without it?

766
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:12,480
I put down a little more than the market value.

767
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,170
Another company is interested in buying it too.

768
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,820
You think they would guarantee your job?

769
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,950
How dare you?

770
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,870
If you help me out until the end,

771
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:31,880
I promise to secure your future.

772
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:38,500
So before I see to it myself, convince the other board members.

773
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,990
This is CEO Park Sang Man.

774
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:44,130
Please read this.

775
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:48,160
He has a positive outlook on our company.

776
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:53,490
This is CEO Park Sang Man.

777
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:54,820
Read this, please.

778
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,900
He has a positive outlook on our company.

779
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:02,010
Please help us out this time.

780
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,590
What? A fly jumped into the bidding war?

781
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:10,740
Yes, sir. The company is called PSM Investment. I think they offered 300 billion won.

782
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,610
We'll just outbid them.

783
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:16,090
Go to JQ Construction and tell them we'll pay whatever they ask.

784
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,950
Nor will we ask for a discount.

785
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:20,630
And get the extra money from Bando Bank.

786
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,860
Yes, sir.

787
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,680
CEO Park Dae Ho

788
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,890
Prosecution Service

789
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:42,180
Let's start investigating Bando Bank.

790
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,280
Records of Illegal Loans from Bando Bank

791
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,790
We ended Kim Seok Hun's career.

792
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:51,300
It's Bando Bank's Park Dae Ho's turn now.

793
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,790
Hold on.

794
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,260
Now isn't a good time.

795
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:02,620
That's never been an issue for us.

796
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:07,340
Kim Seok Hun's been arrested and Yun Jong Gi has been nominated as Prosecutor General.

797
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,380
There's too much going on at the office. Let's read the situation before we make a move.

798
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,820
Yes, sir.

799
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:20,000
But I'll be preparing for it.

800
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:28,690
They offered 320 billion.

801
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,440
They did?

802
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:34,790
Let's bet 400 billion then.

803
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:36,100
What?

804
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,280
Hey, 400 billion?

805
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,350
Yes.

806
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:41,140
I don't have that much money.

807
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:45,980
You don't? I thought a conglomerate would.

808
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,350
I'm saying it won't be easy getting that money on such short notice.

809
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:53,820
Hey, you better not be asking to use company funds.

810
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,800
Forget it, I was kidding.

811
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,920
- You don't have to prepare anything.
- What?

812
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,610
I just need you to get some smoke starting.

813
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:06,030
So Park Dae Ho can dig his own grave.

814
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:12,320
Also, there's someone I'd like to meet.

815
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,260
Director of the Financial Supervisory Service?

816
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,470
The director always attends the Federation of Korean Industries' meetings.

817
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,930
Oh, there's a meeting tonight.

818
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:28,620
Should I set something up?

819
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:32,840
No, the intel you gave me is more than enough.

820
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,970
It was an honor meeting you, sir.

821
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:53,070
- I'll see you around.
- Yes, sir.

822
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:55,200
Goodbye.

823
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,860
Cleaning

824
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:31,010
Gosh, I've always wanted to meet you.

825
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:33,950
Director Kim Yong Min of the Financial Supervisory Service.

826
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:39,430
Nice to meet you. I'm Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu of the Central District Office.

827
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,940
This contains files on Bando Bank. They have a lot of issues.

828
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:50,230
It must be the result of the FSS' negligence when they should be monitoring banks.

829
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:54,820
So? Are you planning on arresting me?

830
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:56,350
Gosh, no.

831
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:59,760
How could a mere prosecutor arrest you?

832
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,670
You can't. So bow politely and leave.

833
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:07,210
I'll pretend this never happened then.

834
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:11,850
The general election is coming up soon.

835
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:18,920
As always, politicians will hurl negative comments at each other.

836
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:26,100
But what would happen if Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong gets a hold of this?

837
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,370
I heard your term lasts three years.

838
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:35,680
I wonder if you'll finish your term though.

839
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,180
Are you threatening me now?

840
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,120
I'm asking for cooperation.

841
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,080
I just need you to do one thing.

842
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:50,040
Then the opposition party won't ever get this file.

843
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,600
Sir.

844
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:08,490
Sir. We failed to pull money from Bando Bank.

845
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:09,660
What are you talking about?

846
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:14,160
The FSS notified Bando Bank to maintain the asset to equity ratio.

847
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,580
What? Out of nowhere?

848
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,610
How much can we utilize then?

849
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:20,240
Only 200 billion.

850
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,230
What about DH Money?

851
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,730
Less than 50 billion, sir.

852
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,720
What should we do?

853
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,230
Don't make any mistakes.

854
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:33,320
Park Dae Ho will be scared of Jo Tae Seop.

855
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,530
He failed to secure Kim Yeong Il's shares.

856
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:42,930
And Bando Bank received a sanction from the Financial Supervisory Service for failing to satisfy a BIS recommendation.

857
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:49,990
Park Dae Ho. The CEO of Bando Bank.

858
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:53,990
His true identity is a thug.

859
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:57,580
Once he's cornered, that side will resurface.

860
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,770
That thug mentality of his.

861
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,070
Yes, sir?

862
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,890
The Central District's Chief Prosecutor has been decided.

863
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:17,850
It's Chief Jeon Seok Gyu. This is good news to you, right?

864
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:20,760
Fancy titles won't ever exist in my life.

865
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,750
I was turned down.

866
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:33,090
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

867
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,370
The Chief Prosecutor is coming in.

868
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,200
- Congratulations, sir!
- Congratulations, sir!

869
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,290
Let's go, sir.

870
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:11,450
♫ Dear, All your things you've done ♫

871
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,710
♫ We are here to wreck it up ♫

872
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:21,030
♫ Who knows, how will it go? ♫

873
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,540
♫ Hiding in black and white ♫

874
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:31,720
♫ We are here to find the truth ♫

875
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:38,010
♫ Give up, I warn you so ♫

876
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:42,710
♫ Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm ♫

877
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:46,370
Again My Life

878
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:50,640
We have one life and get to make only one decision.

879
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,380
Hand over Kim Seok Hun's case.

880
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:56,410
If I were Park Dae Ho, I would ask Jo Tae Seop for help.

881
01:06:56,410 --> 01:07:00,450
Jo Tae Seop always calculates his next move.

882
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,520
He's a strong man.

883
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,290
Jo Tae Seop is looking into Sang Man.

884
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:09,990
In political battles, you always go after the opponent's Achilles heel.

885
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,400
No!

886
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,110
I'm going to get you.

887
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:18,980
♫ Oh I'll wait for now ♫

888
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,750
♫ Let them ♫

889
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,650
Again My Life
