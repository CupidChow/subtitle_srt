Episode 19

4
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,960
We are coming!

5
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,030
Open the door!

6
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,300
Bingbing

7
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,100
It's time for our wedding.

8
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,760
Bingbing I'm coming to get you.

9
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,630
No no no.

10
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,230
How can you two

11
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,960
get our two girls so easily?

12
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,830
Yanran,

13
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
I heard you drank with three Big Drinkers

14
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,100
of Perseids State in your tour.

15
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,700
Your Majesty

16
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,900
how can you blow the gab.

17
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,960
Shame on you. Drinking fight?

18
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,560
After all these years,

19
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,100
I finally know your true colors.

20
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,230
Three Big Drinkers of Perseides State

21
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,230
We didn't know Constellation Lord Xie has such a capacity for liquor.

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
We admire you!

23
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,160
Bingbing, let us in.

24
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,230
Bingbing

25
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,630
Prince Tang, how dare you

26
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,030
order your wife-to-be.

27
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:00,900
You're right!

28
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,830
There is no way

29
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,430
to take the two girls

30
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,160
away so easily.

31
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,030
No way.

32
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,030
So what do you want?

33
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,830
Look at them, my bro.

34
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,230
Girls, please open the door.

35
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,700
We will be late.

36
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,900
We can't miss the blessed hour.

37
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,030
Cut the crap.

38
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,960
Just stop talking and break the door.

39
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,030
Yes, break the door.

40
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,630
No no no, you can't do that.

41
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,030
If you break the door,

42
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,100
Your Majesty will change a new one.

43
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,700
What cost changing the door!

44
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,100
What are you afraid of?

45
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,030
When we get Feifei back,

46
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,830
it won't cost too much.

47
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,360
I can pay for it at the worst.

48
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,230
I must take Xia Bing home today.

49
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,630
Bingbing, open the door.

50
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,430
Or I can move the door.

51
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,160
Great, great.

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,430
Bai Wuchen, how can you help them?

53
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,630
I'm telling you, if you move the door,

54
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,230
I won't mind the father of my child is disabled.

55
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,230
Well done, well done.

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,630
Listen up.

57
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,360
Bride-to-be Feifei said,

58
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,560
there is nothing

59
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,360
that cannot be solved in the world.

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,230
If there is,

61
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,830
just pay more money.

62
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,300
So you know

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,630
Take out the money.

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,360
And I will let you take your brides home.

65
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,030
Take them home.

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,960
That's words of wisdom.

67
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,900
Thanks for your compliment.

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,230
But I don't have any money.

69
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
That's none of my business.

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,030
Bro, we were in a hurry when leaving the house.

71
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
We didn't take enough money.

72
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,960
How about not getting married today.

73
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,160
Let's go.

74
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,900
Let's go home.

75
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
Dragon Egg, don't leave.

76
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,830
Dragon Egg.

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,360
Bingbing

78
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,230
Shang Yu

79
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,560
Shang Yu

80
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,900
Shang Yu, wake up.

81
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,630
Shang Yu

82
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,360
Shang Yu, wake up.

83
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,430
Shang Yu

84
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,700
Shang Yu, who did this?

85
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,030
Who did this?

86
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,900
Who did this to you?

87
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,030
Shang Yu, Shang Yu

88
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,030
It's my fault, I shouldn't let you go alone.

89
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,160
Shang Yu

90
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,560
Shang Yu

91
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,830
Shang Yu

92
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,630
You stay here.

93
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,360
I'll go find the killer.

94
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,230
Lie, let's go.

95
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,160
We'll revenge for the attendant.

96
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,830
Yu, I will revenge for you.

97
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,960
Feifei.

98
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,700
Tang Tang, Xia Bing.

99
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,430
From now on, you must support each other.

100
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,700
And govern Zodiac State well.

101
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Empress changes the way she calls Grandma-Empress and serves tea.

102
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,100
Please have tea, grandma.

103
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,430
Please have another cup of tea, grandma.

104
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:11,960
Thank you, grandma.

105
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,830
Missy never suffers wrong.

106
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,630
Bingbing

107
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,430
Hurry up and serve tea to our Grandma-Empress.

108
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,560
You can get gifts.

109
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,760
Grandma-Empress, please have tea.

110
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,360
Your sister-in-law took all the gifts,

111
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,700
I will send you a hundred pieces of silks and ten thousand C-Coins.

112
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,430
Thank you, Grandma-Empress

113
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,700
Why don't you tell me?

114
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,560
If you tell me

115
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,030
you can give me money, why am I taking these?

116
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,430
They are so heavy.

117
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,960
Your Majesty, Empress

118
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,630
Prince Tang, Princess Consort

119
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,430
Please come to Constellation Lord Palace.

120
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,830
The ceremony will begin.

121
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,300
Feifei.

122
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,230
I have a stomachache.

123
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,560
I need to go to the toilet.

124
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,430
Go.

125
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,430
I can go with you.

126
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,430
That's fine. I can go by myself.

127
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,230
Relax.

128
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,230
Your Majesty

129
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,100
Let's go.

130
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,430
Your Majesty, the message came that

131
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,030
the army of the Orion State

132
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,430
had been stationed in the border of our State.

133
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,500
You go to check it.

134
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,230
Report.

135
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,300
Master, nothing happened with our enemy.

136
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,560
The blessed moment of the ceremony is coming.

137
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,560
We worry about it too much.

138
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,630
You take the wine

139
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,560
and check with me.

140
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,160
Yes, sir.

141
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,030
Msater, there is no one here.

142
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,700
They treat me with their hearts.

143
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,830
I can't do this.

144
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,100
Bingbing

145
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,960
What are you doing here?

146
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,430
Everyone is looking for you.

147
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,430
Bingbing

148
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,360
If Prince Tang bullies you,

149
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,500
just tell me

150
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
and I will teach you kungfu.

151
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,230
We can beat him.

152
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,630
You should go. They are coming.

153
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,500
Hurry up.

154
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,230
Where are we going?

155
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,760
People of the Orion State have come.

156
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,230
Just go.

157
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,630
People of Zodiac State are doomed. Go!

158
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,100
No one can leave here.

159
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,960
They are not our targets.

160
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,030
Let them go.

161
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,700
None of their people can leave here.

162
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,230
Xia Bing, Prince Tang treat you well

163
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,960
but you...

164
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,630
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,830
I will stall them.

166
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,160
Hurry up and leave.

167
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,960
Dali

168
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,700
You have to go.

169
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,960
No.

170
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,960
Hurry up and inform the Emperor.

171
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,160
I will explain to the Lord myself.

172
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,730
Dali, watch out.

173
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,760
Dali

174
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,560
I always want to be

175
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,160
the one who protects you.

176
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Unfortunately, I don't have any chance anymore.

177
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,430
Being around you,

178
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,960
I feel safe.

179
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,760
I don't regret.

180
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
You idiot.

181
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,030
You fool.

182
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,360
What a pity that we'll never see

183
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,430
our child.

184
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,230
Lie.

185
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,230
It is too late to kill me.

186
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,300
We've already poisoned the liquor.

187
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,700
Xunxian.

188
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,700
You haven't had the liquor I bought you yet.

189
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,300
Hold on.

190
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm fine.

191
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,560
Go and save His Majesty.

192
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,430
Go, what are you waiting for?

193
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,360
Go and save them.

194
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,960
Moran

195
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,100
I might break my promise this time.

196
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,430
What happened to Bingbing and Tang Tang.

197
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,430
Time won't wait.

198
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,700
What about we start the ceremony first.

199
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,830
When Prince Tang comes back,

200
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,560
they can give a salute again.

201
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,430
OK.

202
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,830
So many people are watching.

203
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,830
Let's do it or it'll be a mess.

204
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,230
Emperor and Empress please come into the Palace.

205
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,230
My name is Luo Feifei,

206
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,900
one of the ordinary people.

207
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,360
The man next to me

208
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
is my husband.

209
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,030
He is the Emperor of this country

210
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
as well as the love of my whole life.

211
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Feifei.

212
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,630
You are the Empress-to-be.

213
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,560
Why are you still so careless?

214
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Empress is kind and extraordinary.

215
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,160
Empress is kind and extraordinary.

216
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,900
As the mother of the whole world.

217
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,560
As the mother of the whole world.

218
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,630
It's the fortune of us.

219
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,430
It's the fortune of us.

220
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,160
First bow to Constellation Emperor.

221
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,960
Second bow to the late emperors.

222
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,230
Emperor and Empress bow to each other.
