1
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:01,500
Oh! My Emperor

3
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 9

4
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,430
Dali.

5
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,700
What you just called me

6
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,360
would really hurt my feeling.

7
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,630
Didn't I tell you to stay away from me?

8
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,230
Is this far enough?

9
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,100
Bai Wuchen, what else can you do

10
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:41,960
besides  joking around?

11
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,860
Many things, actually.

12
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,030
Shut up! I'm warning you, Bai Wuchen.

13
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,430
I'm not joking with you today.

14
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,430
You're following me all day,

15
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,230
it's infuriating!

16
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,630
Let's make it clear.

17
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,430
I never like you.

18
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,560
Not before.

19
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,360
Not ever.

20
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,300
Understood?

21
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,960
He always wants to kill me. I don't care about him.

22
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,500
But I'm a paramedic,

23
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,430
not saving him doesn't feel right.

24
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,230
But I'm not a paramedic now,

25
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,830
I can do whatever I want.

26
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,960
Help yourselves. Here. Eat.

27
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,030
You scared the hell out of me.

28
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,960
Take me to the emperor.

29
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,100
The emperor?

30
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,700
He left the palace.

31
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,830
He's not in the palace?

32
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,500
Yeah, he just left.

33
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,430
I'm still a little too late.

34
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,560
Where are you going?

35
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,560
Are you ready?

36
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,300
Yah.

37
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,360
Yah.

38
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,830
Yah.

39
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,560
Brother Donkey.

40
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,160
Can you hear me, Brother Donkey?

41
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,560
I told you this is important.

42
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
It's a matter of life and death.

43
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,900
You have to understand its importance.

44
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,960
I don't care if you're a donkey, alright?

45
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,560
You can run as fast as a horse.

46
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,760
Brother Donkey, please speed up.

47
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,560
Thank you. Come on, Brother Donkey!

48
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,500
Yah.

49
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,560
Oppa, oppa.

50
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,630
Oppa Gangnam style.

51
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,510
Then I'll-I'll smack your behind?

52
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,430
I'm going to do it, Brother Donkey.

53
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,230
Yah.

54
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,030
This place is exactly what I remember from our childhood days.

55
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,030
Nothing's changed.

56
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,360
Why can't we

57
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,160
return to the good old times?

58
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,830
Say something, you two.

59
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,630
It takes me lots of effort to take you both here.

60
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,100
Tangtang, what are you saying?

61
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,900
Brother.

62
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,030
Uncle.

63
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,230
Will you stop fighting?

64
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,630
We used to come here to hunt everyday in our childhood.

65
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,830
See that broken stone?

66
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,030
We wanted to eat the small fish upstream

67
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,430
and decided to push the stone down.

68
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,700
However,

69
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,900
after a whole day of pushing, it didn't move at all.

70
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,760
I cried.

71
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,430
And you laughed at me.

72
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,760
I don't understand.

73
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Even the broken stone can't stop the river.

74
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,560
Then what kept us apart?

75
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,030
Was it the throne?

76
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,760
Tangtang, that's what you wanted to say?

77
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,900
Brother, do you remember that year?

78
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,030
The year when Uncle got injured during a hunt

79
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,500
and you carried him back.

80
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,830
Brother.

81
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,030
Uncle.

82
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,700
Do you remember that year when my brother was sick?

83
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,830
You were the one who tended to him every minute.

84
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,230
Don't you remember?

85
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,560
What's wrong with you two?

86
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,430
Never mind. I choose to drop out of

87
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,500
the next three Constellation Tournaments.

88
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,160
I don't care anymore. Do whatever you want.

89
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,360
Who's that?

90
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,230
Yah.

91
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,760
Yah. Yah.

92
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,100
Yah.

93
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,030
Yah.

94
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,630
Beitang Yi, wait for me!

95
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,100
Don't run away. There's an ambush ahead.

96
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,160
Brother Donkey, hurry.

97
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,900
Brother Donkey, run!

98
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,930
Yah.

99
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,560
Run, Brother Donkey.

100
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,160
Come on, Brother Donkey.

101
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,230
Hurry up, Brother Donkey.

102
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,960
Brother Donkey, speed up.

103
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,430
Yah. Yah. Yah.

104
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,400
Soo. Soo.

105
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,760
They would come here.

106
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,560
Beware.

107
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,560
Wait!

108
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,830
Brother Donkey, you can't do this!

109
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm being serious, Brother Donkey!

110
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,760
Brother Donkey!

111
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,900
Missy.

112
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,760
Why does she come?

113
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,830
Hurry up.

114
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,630
Missy.

115
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,600
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

116
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,300
What are you doing here?

117
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Are you dumb or something?

118
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,630
How can I catch up with you riding a donkey?

119
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,230
What were you thinking?

120
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,230
We encountered a couple of assassins

121
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,360
we were chasing after them.

122
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,760
Assassins? Have you forgotten about the business?

123
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
That day, I heard there's going to be an ambush here.

124
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,830
Let's hurry.

125
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,760
Hurry up. Go.

126
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,300
Let's go, Missy.

127
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,430
Hurry.

128
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,360
My donkey...

129
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Leave it. Let's go.

130
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,830
Wait, I haven't brought my donkey.

131
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,900
Look out!

132
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,900
Oh my god.

133
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,230
Look out!

134
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,560
Feifei.

135
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,360
Feifei, are you alright?

136
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,630
Stay here.

137
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,030
Take her away, now!

138
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,030
Let's go.

139
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,630
Kill!

140
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Feifei.

141
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,560
Hey, we're all friends here.

142
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,300
Just go. Pull back. Stop fighting.

143
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,300
Friends.

144
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,100
I told you, all of us are friends,

145
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,230
why don't you listen?

146
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,830
After seeing all these dead bodies, you're still fighting.

147
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,500
Listen to me, don't go. Ask your men to stop.

148
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,160
Listen to me.

149
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,430
Stop.

150
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,630
Or I'll kill her.

151
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,830
It seems that you are of some use after all.

152
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
No, no, no. I'm utterly useless.

153
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,230
Don't move. Or I'll kill her.

154
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,630
Let's go.

155
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,430
Go.

156
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,560
Brother, Missy is captured.

157
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,760
But the Misty Forest is ahead.

158
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,030
Go rescue her.

159
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,430
I'll deal with them.

160
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,500
I haven't exercised for a while now.

161
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,960
I can't run anymore. I'm too tired.

162
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,230
No more running. I'm exhausted.

163
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,100
Get up. Up!

164
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,760
I told you,

165
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,160
we're friends.

166
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,430
My knees are chafed.

167
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,430
And my hands are injured.

168
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,430
Why does it have to be like this?

169
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,560
That's too weird!

170
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,360
Get up. Quickly.

171
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,430
Release her. Release.

172
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,830
There! There they come.

173
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,300
Don't come closer. One more step and she'll be dead.

174
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,560
Do it, then.

175
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,230
She's just a dancing girl.

176
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,230
Kill her if you want to.

177
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,160
Beitang Yi, is there a shred of humanity left in you?

178
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,500
I just saved you, Beitang Yi.

179
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,560
Don't move.

180
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,360
You two, release her.

181
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,830
I promise that you won't be hurt.

182
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,030
I heard that you two don't exactly see eye to eye.

183
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,560
Kill the bastard emperor now,

184
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,500
and I'll return her to you.

185
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,160
I actually care about my country and my people.

186
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,630
Uncle, I won't prevent you from saving this beauty.

187
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,500
So you just give up?

188
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,360
Beitang Yi, you're a jerk.

189
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,360
Release her.

190
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,100
I'm willing to exchange my life for hers.

191
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,560
Feifei.

192
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,500
Don't. Don't touch it.

193
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,960
It hurts.

194
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,760
Let me see your wound.

195
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,300
What for? You don't know how to cure it anyway.

196
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,900
Don't. You don't know how.

197
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,760
You're still doing it.

198
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,160
Please don't. It hurts.

199
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,030
Don't touch it.

200
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,430
I told you not to touch it.

201
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,360
Thank you.

202
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,830
Why don't you ask me what I thank you for?

203
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,630
For what?

204
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,430
For telling those men that I'm unimportant.

205
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,430
So that they don't want to kill me.

206
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,830
Yeah.

207
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,830
For not going away.

208
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,430
Yeah.

209
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,700
For patching me up.

210
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,960
Yeah.

211
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,830
All you've got to say is "Yeah"?

212
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,760
Still the same old jerk, I see.

213
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,360
I'm the Son of Heaven, the Dragon Seed.

214
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,160
Dragon Seed?

215
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,360
Alright.

216
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,160
Dragon Egg.

217
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,360
Dragon Egg is fine.

218
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,560
I'll kill your whole family after we return to the palace.

219
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,830
Until we return, then.

220
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,360
That man ran from the back of the Dragon Chasm.

221
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,830
Let's go back first.

222
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,360
And then chase after him on horseback by a shortcut.

223
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Ok.

224
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Feifei.
