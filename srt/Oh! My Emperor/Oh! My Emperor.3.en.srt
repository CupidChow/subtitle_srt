1
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,630
Oh! My Emperor

Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd.

00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 3

4
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,700
Why is this man following me?

5
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,430
is he a pervert?

6
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,700
No, I have to get rid of him.

7
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,500
Fan Shengnan, Senior General of Leo with the Roar of Lion skill.

8
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,760
Where...

9
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,830
I'm here.

10
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,230
Dali,

11
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,760
Don't worry, I'm here.

12
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,830
I was asking you about where the girl was.

13
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,630
Dali.

14
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,430
Dali. Dali.

15
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,560
Don't call me Dali.

16
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,030
Call me Chu Shengnan.

17
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,630
And

18
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,960
don't you follow me again.

19
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,030
If you do,

20
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,430
I will break your leg.

21
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,760
Stop!

22
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,700
You bloody fool!

23
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,430
How could you forget that today is the Auspicious Day.

24
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,760
I did see her walk in here just now.

25
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,100
Where is she?

26
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,360
Probably there.

27
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,560
How could I get found hiding here?

28
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,300
Who are you? Get out of here.

29
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,700
Be quiet.

30
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,700
Don't you know today is the Auspicious Day.

31
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,100
I just forgot.

32
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,560
Why are you hiding here, Missy?

33
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,830
None of your business.

34
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,760
If you ask too much,

35
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,760
you will be like a dog trying to catch a mouse.

36
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,630
Mind yourself.

37
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,030
This man is handsome with these great white teeth.

38
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,630
Only his smile is a bit foolish.

39
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,830
Beat it.

40
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,300
Do you want to get out?

41
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,500
You got a plan, Missy?

42
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,160
Take off your clothes.

43
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,430
I'm not that kind of person.

44
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,900
I'm not either.

45
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Stop! girl.

46
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,360
Stop, stop!

47
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,830
Stop!

48
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,360
Missy, stop!

49
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,030
Stop!

50
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,830
Come back.

51
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,630
Prince Tang.

52
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,500
Prince Tang.

53
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,160
Boss, boss.

54
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,430
Boss, boss.

55
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,760
Come on in.

56
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,230
Do you want to have something to eat or stay overnight?

57
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,560
Stay.

58
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,700
Wait a minute.

59
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,360
Here you go.

60
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
Fist room upstairs.

61
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,760
Thank you.

62
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,500
It seems like

63
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,830
we need to sleep together tonight.

64
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,030
What's the matter, boss?

65
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,160
See?

66
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,030
Her clothes belong to the royal family,

67
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,430
and they don't fit her,

68
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,230
so she is probably a female thief in men's clothes.

69
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,360
Look, you keep watching, I will report to the authority.

70
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,300
Okay.

71
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,430
Keep watching.

72
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,960
Dali.

73
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,360
Dali.

74
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,160
You look so gorgeous today.

75
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,360
Shut up!

76
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,300
All right, you've got guts.

77
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,430
Watch out, Dali.

78
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,700
Are you Ok?

79
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,500
I didn't mean to.

80
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,030
I will kill you, Bai Wuchen.

81
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,960
Let's go! let's go fishing.

82
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,630
There are many fish in the pond.

83
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,760
Right.

84
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,300
Many people are there angling near the city moat ever day.

85
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,160
So many of them.

86
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,030
Let's go.

87
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,100
City moat is supposed to be for the protection of the imperial palace.

88
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,360
The fish must have come from the palace,

89
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,160
so is it possible that the pond is connected to the palace?

90
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,030
Hey, pretty boy!

91
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,560
Here.

92
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,430
What were you talking about?

93
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,830
We said that we would go fishing.

94
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,960
Do you want to come with us?

95
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,960
Why don't come and play in my room?

96
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,430
Both of us?

97
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,430
General Chu, you finally come.

98
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,160
The thief you told me to keep my eye on

99
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,830
is upstairs.

100
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,830
This way. This way.

101
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,960
Lower, lower.

102
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,230
Slow down.

103
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,560
Slow down more.

104
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,230
Damn it,

105
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,430
she escaped by water.

106
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,900
I failed to finish my job.

107
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,360
I lost her.

108
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,300
Doesn't matter.

109
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,700
I'm just surprised that

110
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
Missy Luo could have escaped

111
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,960
right before General Chu's eyes.

112
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,830
I find it strange, too.

113
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,700
The two citizens I met today

114
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,500
said she jumped into the water,

115
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,560
which is just outside the inn.

116
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,760
Wherever she is,

117
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,230
she is gonna come to the palace anyway.

118
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,360
You just pay more attention to

119
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,230
the situation of the palace.

120
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,430
Yes.

121
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,560
After so much time,

122
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,630
I'm still stuck in the garden.

123
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,300
This way.

124
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,430
So many guards even at night.

125
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,230
No, I need a place to hide in.

126
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Not again.

127
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,230
What is this place?

128
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,560
So bright even with no one here.

129
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,630
Stand down.

130
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,700
Yes.

131
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,430
Come out.

132
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,830
Tangtang, now that you are back,

133
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,030
why do you try to avoid me?

134
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,100
You are still so childish,

135
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,300
You always say

136
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,830
seeing the person is not seeing his heart and vice versa.

137
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,760
When can you really grow up?

138
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,030
All right.

139
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,760
Recently, Uncle Chen has been more aggressive and arrogant.

140
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,960
My father started keeping him at hand

141
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,960
at an early age,

142
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,160
saying that he was smart as a kid,

143
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,360
someone that I could rely on later.

144
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,230
But now, I'm constrained by him in all respects,

145
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,430
and you're the only one I can count on.

146
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,100
Brother.

147
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,230
Surprised?

148
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,230
You are here,

149
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,300
then back there...

150
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,360
There?

151
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,230
Guards.

152
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,160
Aye.

153
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,430
What is it?

154
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,230
Take him.

155
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,030
Aye

156
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,160
You.

157
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,030
Jia Cheng,

158
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,300
how can you be here?

159
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,300
Let her go.

160
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,630
So you come for me.

161
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,630
He...

162
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,230
Well, he is my older brother,

163
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,830
the Emperor,

164
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,760
Do we resemble each other?

165
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,760
Emperor?

166
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,630
Take her away and behead her.

167
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,700
Wait!

168
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,960
Brother, this girl looks so cute.

169
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,900
I know her.

170
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,560
Jia Cheng, did you lose your mind

171
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,630
when you came here?

172
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,700
How long have you been here?

173
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,560
Stop, what's this about?

174
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,630
Let her go.

175
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,560
Did you not come for me?

176
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,830
I...

177
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,230
Jia Cheng, you really don't remember me?

178
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,160
I'm the one who helped with your stitch,

179
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,160
when you were hurt that day and I helped you sew up your wound.

180
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,030
Brother, you were hurt?

181
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,500
Don't you remember that you were behind me?

182
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,230
No.

183
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,960
Don't you remember?

184
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,830
Were you hurt badly?

185
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,360
Tell me.

186
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:38,900
You were behind me.

187
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,160
Brother.

188
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,430
Are you all dead?

189
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,300
Jia Cheng, Jia Cheng?

190
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,430
Seems like I need to use my ultimate strategy.

191
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,630
Who caused the tension?

192
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,630
Who abandoned his belief?

193
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,030
Who willingly accepted to be enchained?

194
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,360
Who learned to conceal himself?

195
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,230
Who drew back to his western-style house?

196
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,560
Who roamed the square,

197
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,160
brooding over the past?

198
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,430
Yet his shoulders can't be reached,

199
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,630
worrying about the unknown future.

200
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,900
Why don't just be joyful?

201
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,900
Bravo!

202
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,830
Jia Cheng, you remember now, right?

203
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,500
Why didn't you mention it earlier, I got so exhausted.

204
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,630
When you sang this song, you said

205
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,630
you would alway love us.

206
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,230
Take her away.

207
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,360
Get out.

208
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
No, no way.

209
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,300
Jia Cheng.

210
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,030
Brother,

211
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,500
isn't it dulcet?

212
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Jia Cheng,

213
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,430
Jia Cheng.

214
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,160
Are you really going to kill her?

215
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,030
You can give her to me if you don't want her.

216
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,360
Nonsense.

217
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,030
Move.

218
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,430
His Majesty directly ordered to put her in jail,

219
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,830
but Prince Tang wanted to protect her.

220
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,030
Keep an eye on her carefully.

221
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,230
Understood.

222
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,560
Help, help!

223
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,100
Help, help me!

224
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,100
The Ophiuchus guy has gone mad. Gone mad!

225
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,960
Quick.

226
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,560
Another one has gone mad.

227
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,560
Separate them.

228
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,900
Missy,

229
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,760
I can't believe you can suppress

230
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,300
this mad Ophiuchus guy.

231
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,830
Impressive.

232
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,630
Not a big deal.

233
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,830
A great success.

234
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,630
Nice move.

235
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,160
Princess!

236
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,630
General Chu.

237
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,360
What's your good news this time?

238
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,360
Not exactly.

239
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,700
As you predicted,

240
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,760
Missy Luo infiltrated into the palace

241
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,960
and offended the Emperor.

242
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,630
She's been put into prison.

243
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,030
When did this happen?

244
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,630
Last night

245
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,160
Nice move.

246
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,360
Lord Su, you are about to lose.

247
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,030
But since

248
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,630
our Emperor has no soft spot for cute girls,

249
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,160
maybe

250
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,160
he has killed her.

251
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
No wonder the Emperor avoided meeting me yesterday.

252
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Is she alive?

253
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,500
Her life is not in danger for now.

254
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,900
Send the message,

255
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,360
I will go to the palace.

256
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,360
Brother, what business did Uncle Chen

257
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,230
come to you for?

258
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,560
Same as you.

259
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,900
Are you really going to kill that Missy?

260
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,560
Just give her to me.

261
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,430
She's really pathetic.

262
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,560
If she went to the palace to kill me,

263
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,830
would you still find her pathetic?

264
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,360
Of course not.

265
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,230
Anyone who wants to hurt my brother

266
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,960
is my enemy.

267
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
Your Highness.

268
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,760
Spare me this.

269
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,960
I need to see the Emperor for an urgent matter.

270
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,430
Prince,

271
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,960
the Emperor is discussing important political matters inside.

272
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,300
What could be more important than mine?

273
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,030
If there is any,

274
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,700
then I should participate

275
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,300
to provide guidance

276
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,030
and strategies.

277
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,430
You are a senior servant.

278
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,160
Don't you forget,

279
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,830
our deceased Emperor has trusted me

280
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,960
with the duty to provide assistance in national affairs.

281
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,030
Forgive me.

282
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,430
Please wait a minute.

283
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,230
I will notify the Emperor right away.

284
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,100
Your Majesty, Prince Chen has come to visit again.

285
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,160
He's outside the door.

286
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,230
Let him in.

287
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,230
Aye.

288
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,100
Uncle,

289
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,900
what's the matter?

290
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,630
I heard that Your Majesty

291
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,830
had imprisoned my dancer.

292
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,160
She intended to infiltrate into my place

293
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
and tried to assassinate me.

294
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,100
Do you think I shouldn't have imprisoned her?

295
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,960
Your Highness, there must have been a mistake.

296
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,360
Her character has always been a quite naughty one.

297
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,760
I will take her back and get her disciplined.

298
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,960
Naughty character and the intention of treason

299
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,830
are two different concepts.

300
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,230
The whole world is yours,

301
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,830
monstrous deeds like treason,

302
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,030
no one would dare to do it.
