00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,600
Oh! My Emperor

Episode 14

4
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Sister, great news.

5
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,050
A baby was born.

6
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,950
What great news?

7
00:02:59,950 --> 00:02:59,970
Every time a child is born,

8
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,950
Every time a child is born,

9
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,650
the villagers celebrate it together.

10
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,150
It's the happy event of the whole village.

11
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,150
Grandma, I want to have a look.

12
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,150
So do I.

13
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,850
Your Majesty,

14
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,300
it's not easy for you to go out of the palace,

15
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,120
won't you observe the conditions of people?

16
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,600
Let's go.

17
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,700
It's magical, right?

18
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,020
I'm recovered suddenly. Amazing!

19
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,020
The baby was born. It's a boy.

20
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,020
He's chubby.

21
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,020
Capricorn has a good fortune.

22
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,220
Any constellation is good

23
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,220
except the Ophiuchus.

24
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,220
What are you scattering?

25
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,670
Grains. We all scatter these

26
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,220
when a baby is born.

27
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,600
Grandma calls it sowing new life.

00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,050
It's really delicious.

50
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,350
Delicious, right?

51
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,970
Sister, can we meet again?

52
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,800
Of course.

53
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,450
You can come to see me

54
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,400
if you miss me.

55
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Or I come to see you.

56
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,800
But grandma said it was dangerous outside.

57
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,270
It's only safe to stay in the village.

58
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,270
Thank you.

59
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,120
Go back to the palace with me.

60
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,750
Goodbye.

61
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,120
Go back.

62
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,800
Goodbye.

63
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,850
Please go back.

64
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,420
Goodbye.

65
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,920
What's wrong,Your Highness?

66
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,100
It seems to be the emperor across the way.

67
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,800
You must have misread it.

68
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,550
Probably.

69
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,800
Brother, what are you thinking about?

70
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,000
You've been tetchy recently.

71
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,400
It's dry.

72
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,820
I don't believe you.

73
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,770
When did you get so close to Xie Yanran?

74
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,570
You caught sight of this.

75
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,570
Boring.

76
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,870
I want to help you given that

77
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,020
you make slow progress

78
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,600
with the missy.

79
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,250
It's just your own idea.

80
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,520
Brother,

81
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,670
how are you feeling with the missy?

82
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,300
It's a feeling

83
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,020
of limp and numb.

84
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,020
I feel powerless all over.

85
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,420
That's right,the feeling.

86
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,600
Limp and numb,limb weakness.

87
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,070
Sometimes your brain doesn't work.

88
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,070
It's your brain.

89
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,250
Limp and numb

90
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,330
Got it?

91
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,850
That's the right way of kabe-don.

92
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,460
You chump.

93
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,330
Xiaomihu,

94
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,530
with big eyes and giggling.

95
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,930
and silly smile.

96
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,460
It's really like her.

97
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,330
Your Majesty.

98
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,800
Your Majesty.

99
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,000
Your Majesty.

100
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,860
Your Majesty.

101
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,260
It's all of a sudden.

102
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,730
I'm not ready.

103
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,200
No, it's not this feeling.

104
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,600
Weird, why's not?

105
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,200
I'd better go for Feifei.

106
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,400
Dragon Egg.

107
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,670
Why are you here at a late night?

108
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,470
No...nothing.

109
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,550
If so,I'll go back to sleep.

110
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,550

Say it neatly.

146
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,100
You don't have to repeat this sentence.

147
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:45,850
You don't have to repeat this sentence.

148
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,450
Fine.

149
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,300
I had feelings for you

150
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,800
When I saw you for the first time.

151
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,570
Fine.

152
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,950
I had feelings for you

when I saw you for the first time.

154
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,620
You don't have to say"Fine".

155
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,620
It would be reluctant when you're saying "Fine".

156
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,350
You see?

157
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,220
I had feelings for you

158
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,220
when I saw you for the first time.

159
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,120
I wanted to kill you

160
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,300
when I saw you for the first time.

161
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,220
What are you doing?

162
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Can't we be serious?

163
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,700
Didn't I say a word then you repeat it?

164
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,250
Why is "kill me"?

165
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,250
I'm done.

166
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,920
Alright.

167
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,900
Let's start over.

168
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,400
Start again?

169
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,870
you must be serious.

170
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,050
You mainly focus on your

171
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,470
breath and eyes.

172
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,100
Both of them, got it?

173
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,770
I had feelings for you

174
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,420
when I saw you for the first time.

175
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,400
I had feelings for...

176
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,150
I can't,I...

177
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,150
I still can't say it.

178
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,070
I can't.

179
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,650
You chump!

180
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,570
You chump!

181
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,220
Why am I always thinking about it?

182
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,500
Luo Feifei,

183
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,200
don't be good-for-nothing!

184
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,600
Why you are thinking about that chump!

185
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,020
No, I have to calm down.

186
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,970
I gotta apply a Xiaomihu mask.

187
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,770
It's pretty rare in ancient times.

188
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,800
I should've taken them more if I'd known my leaving.

189
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,050
Dragon Egg.

190
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,300
Your Majesty,

191
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,300
I'm here to give my regards.

192
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,900
You all may leave.

193
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,400
Let her do it.

194
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,800
Let me work for you?

195
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,450
Fine, I'll do it.

196
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,570
Do you know how to work?

197
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,050
I'll teach you.

198
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:08,950
You must sweep the

199
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,650
furniture lightly.

200
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,870
Especially the tables,

201
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,270
they're quite dirty.

202
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,570
You must sweep them.

203
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,600
I've done all your work.

204
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,220
OK,

205
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,700
then I'll go back.

206
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,700
Stop it!

207
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,020
Are you reluctant to part with me?

208
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,550
Grind the inkstick for me.
