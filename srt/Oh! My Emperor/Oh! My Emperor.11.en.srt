1
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:01,700
Oh! My Emperor

2
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,700
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co.,Ltd

3
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,710
Episode 11

4
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,400
You're the Constellation Lord for Ophiuchus.

5
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,360
Please accept my kowtow.

6
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,900
Your action will shorten my life.

7
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,770
You don't have to do this. Please stand up.

8
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,240
Constellation Lord, no.

9
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,950
I can't accept it.

10
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,660
Unhand me.

11
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,310
You can't do this.

12
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,690
I'm going home. Don't pull at me.

13
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,800
Don't look for me later

14
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,430
or ever.

15
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,020
I'm so angry.

16
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,190
I have to go back and put on a facial mask.

17
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,780
Is she the new lover of His Highness?

18
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,020
What's in your hand?

19
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,270
It's a facial mask.

20
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
Simple Xiaomihu facial mask.

21
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,730
It's natural water can permeate in your skin.

22
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,760
Do you know what is Water Supplement?

23
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,150
Xiaomihu moisturizing mask with hyaluronic acid.

24
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,610
It's 3D form is more suitable for your face.

25
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,250
With its hyaluronic acid,

26
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,980
it's better for moisturizing.

27
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,320
I'm so jealous of my talent.

28
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,430
I really should be a salesperson.

29
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,710
You can see me?

30
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,580
Who is out there?

31
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,180
Feifei.

32
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,190
What do you want?

33
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,380
No, nothing.

34
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,960
Your Highness, someone was peeping you at bath.

35
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,660
Why are you standing here?

36
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,170
Why don't you pursue her?

37
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,380
What if she is an assassin?

38
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,560
I have already found her.

39
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,770
Already found her?

40
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,990
Your Highness, I'm not the assassin.

41
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,760
I'm really not. I'm a passer-by.

42
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,960
Literally.

43
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,370
His Highness, please let me explain.

44
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,460
What else do you want?

45
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,400
How is it?

46
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,720
It tastes pleasant and you can feel its sweet after taste.

47
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,680
Moran.

48
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,810
Did you lose your mind by this cup of tea?

49
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,960
Su Xunxian.

50
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,410
Do you really believe I know nothing?

51
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,210
This cup of tea you gave me

52
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,000
is from the pot you gave to Feifei.

53
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,580
Your Highness.

54
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,340
Look at this, Feifei.

55
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,470
What are you doing?

56
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,270
My big brother, why are you so calm?

57
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,670
It's so boring!

58
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,060
If you get bored, write out the book on the art of war

59
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,260
No, I need to talk business with you.

60
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm telling you

61
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,140
Ladies like men to hold her with arms from the back.

62
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,850
So they can feel the beat of the heart.

63
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,580
It will feel like they can rely on you

64
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,850
and feel secure.

65
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,150
Stop reading that book.

66
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,880
If you are like this, you won't win the heart of Missy.

67
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,030
Cut it out and give it back.

68
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,280
How about I set an example.

69
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,740
Watch me.

70
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,400
How is that? Can you feel it?

71
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,960
Yes.

72
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,650
Disgusting.

73
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,780
That's because I'm not a lady.

74
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,220
Just do as what I've told you,

75
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,280
and you will be fine.

76
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,800
And then? Do you finish?

77
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,200
Can't you become worried?

78
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,240
What am I worried about?

79
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,300
My big brother, you are just like this.

80
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,520
Silly wood.

81
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,130
What book are you reading?

82
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,600
Oh my god.

83
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,830
You need to read this.

84
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,080
That's all. Bye.

85
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,400
Miss Luo.

86
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,570
Eunuch Hai.

87
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,310
Why does Your Majesty summon me to the palace ?

88
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,200
Your Majesty is unpredictable.

89
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,960
I don't dare to say anything.

90
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,540
This way, Miss Luo.

91
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:01,860
I'm done.

92
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,990
Is it because last time I said he is a dragon egg?

93
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,230
He is not only a poker face,

94
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,280
but also a petty.

95
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,630
Go down on your knees, you shrew!

96
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,050
Offend me and get me angry.

97
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,350
I want to punish you hard.

98
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,500
Your Majesty.

99
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,970
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

100
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,870
I knew it was wrong. I won't do that again.

101
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,970
I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

102
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,510
Your Majesty.

103
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,420
My dear god.

104
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,170
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

105
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,160
Your Majesty, don't hit me in the face.

106
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,910
Don't.

107
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,530
Miss Luo. Miss Luo.

108
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,070
Miss Luo. Are you alright?

109
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,370
I'm fine.

110
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,180
This way please.

111
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,810
Wait. If the Dragon Egg wants to kill me,

112
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,870
he can issue a decree.

113
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,760
What if he...

114
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,190
I won't punish you ever.

115
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,100
That's annoying.

116
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,390
Please.

117
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,580
Miss Luo, this is the place.

118
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,900
Constellation Service Department.

119
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,760
Your Majesty decrees me to take you here.

120
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,620
Pharmacist Bilian, Miss Luo is all yours.

121
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,410
I have to report back to Your Majesty.

122
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,410
Pharmacist Bilian, where can I stay?

123
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,230
You can stay there.

124
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,520
This bed is so shabby.

125
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,030
That's good.

126
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,330
But it doesn't look firm.

127
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,080
That will be enough for you.

128
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,720
How can you be so picky?

129
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,060
It's just when I sleep,

130
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,890
I will talk in my dream, burp, grind my teeth and fart.

131
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,110
I'm afraid I will disturb all of you.

132
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,400
You may have poor sleeping quality.

133
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,800
If that so.

134
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,440
There is a room next to the toilet

135
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,340
you can sleep in.

136
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,830
I'm just kidding. Don't take it seriously.

137
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,880
No more nonsense!

138
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,340
Tidy up all your belongings.

139
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,500
And get to work now.

140
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,960
She is so scary.

141
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,040
A man who loses his power will be belittled.

142
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,490
I can live with a shabby bed.

143
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,030
Your Majesty.

144
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,710
Feifei Luo has been taken to

145
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,330
Constellation Service Department.

146
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,130
You can deal with trifling matter like this by yourself.

147
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:17,970
Is this a trifling matter?

148
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,960
What do you mean?

149
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,100
I mean...

150
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,280
Everything about Your Majesty is important.

151
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,240
Especially your relationship.

152
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,120
I am nothing like you.

153
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,650
You just care about romance.

154
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,920
Of course not.

155
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,740
If you do,

156
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,930
you will be with Miss Luo by now.

157
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,020
Nonsense.

158
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,410
Luo Feifei oversteps her authority

159
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,940
and is not graceful and conservative.

160
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,470
How can I be with a girl like that?

161
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,260
My Dali.

162
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,770
You are not married yet.

163
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,960
I don't mind. Sooner or later, we will get married.

164
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,810
Do not disturb me.

165
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,270
Where was I?

166
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,430
Your Dali.

167
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,990
Yepp, my Dali

168
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,200
shuts the door upon my face and kicks my ass,

169
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,610
nothing like the daughter from an eminent family.

170
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,340
I still like her.

171
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,400
Sometimes I am wondering,

172
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,760
she is not like others.

173
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,520
But

174
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,620
I meet her,

175
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,120
consider her as the one,

176
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,760
fall in love with her

177
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,120
and I never forget about her.

178
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,210
Once I am in love,

179
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,460
I want her to have everything.

180
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,970
I am willing to give her everything I have.

181
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,180
Meet her and consider her as the one,

182
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,170
fall in love and never forget.

183
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,800
Come here!

184
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,860
Come here.

185
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,930
Pharmacist Bilian.

186
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,830
Bring me all buckets.

187
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,920
Clean them all.

188
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,270
Don't push your luck.

189
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,630
Clean the bucket? That's easy.

190
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,910
I can do it.

191
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,320
It's a trifling matter.

192
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,800
I'm good at cleaning buckets.

193
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,070
Everyone, do your own work.

194
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,870
Their works are like those.

195
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,410
My works are like these.

196
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,000
Luo Feifei, come on.

197
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:57,860
You are the fattest.

198
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,130
I really want to go home.

199
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,580
Clean this again.

200
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,460
Let me tell you this,

201
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,130
if you can't clean them by the end of the day,

202
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,840
you won't get any sleep.

203
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,170
Your Majesty, you need some rest.

204
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,990
You can take a rest.

205
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,360
Your Majesty, I don't need a rest.

206
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:41,960
I'm not tired.

207
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,810
Just go and

208
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,540
take a rest.

209
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,060
Your Majesty,

210
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,550
I was standing by your side for so many years,

211
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,280
every time when you have trouble,

212
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,710
you always practice calligraphy.

213
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,800
All these years, so many nobles and ladies

214
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,150
want to get close with you,

215
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,500
but you never give them a chance.

216
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,780
And now, you finally have feelings for Miss Luo,

217
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,520
but you intend to have distance.

218
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,860
I don't know what Your Majesty is worried about.

219
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,260
I'm useless but I hope to help Your Majesty.

220
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,580
I can't do anything about it.

221
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,190
But you think you can?

222
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,550
That's not what I mean.

223
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,900
But Your Majesty knows nothing

224
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,870
about the romance.

225
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,440
Although I'm

226
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,760
an eunuch.

227
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,770
But I know a few

228
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,880
about that.

229
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,790
If Your Majesty is willing to tell me.

230
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,250
No, I am not.

231
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,030
OK

232
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,090
What are you doing?

233
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,180
You did that on purpose.

234
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,510
Yes I am. Do you have any problem?

235
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,890
Of course I have a problem.

236
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,610
Clean all of these.

237
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,390
And then pull way the water from that bucket.

238
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,590
No.

239
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,540
I want to pull away the water first.

240
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,290
What happen to Feifei?

241
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,030
She can't even walk.

242
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,650
What else she can do?

243
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,630
Let's go have lunch.

244
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,310
All of you.

245
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,500
Just bully me.

246
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,110
Wait for my revenge.

247
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,960
How dare you make me pour away the water?

248
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,480
I will pour away the water for you.

249
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,330
Watch this.

250
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,630
Luo Feifei!
