Episode 14

4
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,760
I'm not gonna work.

5
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,360
Stay with me.

6
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,760
Okay! Okay! Okay!

7
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,030
I'm gonna sleep.

8
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,830
Sleep here again?

9
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,760
Of course.

10
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,960
There're so many things I wanna talk to you.

11
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,360
Listen,

12
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,960
Today, I came to Meimei

13
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,360
for that glossy ganoderma.

14
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,630
he had that thing in his arms,

15
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,700
I came to rob it and he hid from me,

16
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,360
again and again.

17
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,430
I kept chasing him,

18
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
and he kept running.

19
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,760
Then I chased he without break, so does he.

20
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,960
Then I,

21
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,560
Dali

22
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,300
Dali helped me get it from him,

23
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,230
so he was pissed off.

24
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,360
Did you hear?

25
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,760
What's going on?

26
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,230
I'll take a look.

27
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,630
No! No!

28
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,560
Why?

29
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,430
They're

30
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,700
busy!

31
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,960
That's scream!

32
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,830
You didn't hear?

33
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,030
I'm concerned. Wait a second.

34
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,830
They're doing their business!

35
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,960
Word games?

36
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,100
You thought I got lower education?

37
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,160
Nope!

38
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,360
It's, it's

39
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,430
It's hard to say.

40
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,230
Hard to say?

41
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,630
Well,

42
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
or we?

43
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,760
We what?

44
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,560
Bai Wuchen!

45
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,360
You have any shame at all?

46
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,700
My buns.

47
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,630
Feifei,

48
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,230
why you're so fat?

49
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,430
You crushed the bed.

50
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,500
Fat?

51
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,360
Just a little bit edema!

52
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,760
Why blame me?

53
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,230
Alright! You sleep here tonight.

54
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,160
Like this?

55
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,560
What about you?

56
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,230
Examine the memorials.

57
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,830
There are a lot of them.

58
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,830
Wuchen.

59
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,960
Dali.

60
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,430
Wuchen.

61
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,560
Dali.

62
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,960
Wuchen.

63
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,830
Dali.

64
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,960
Wuchen.

65
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,030
Dali.

66
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,630
You wanna do that? Or not?

67
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,760
I'm

68
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,630
This is my first time.

69
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,900
You you meant I'm so experienced?

70
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,700
Okay! Stop it!

71
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,560
No! No! No!

72
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Here.

73
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,630
My hair!

74
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,100
My hair, hair!

75
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,830
I'm

76
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,830
I'm sorry, sorry.

77
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,100
I'm sorry!

78
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,960
The conditioning because I'm a swordsman.

79
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,430
Well.

80
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,160
Stop? I'll back.

81
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,230
Please don't go.

82
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,960
I'll do that without my hands.

83
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,560
Okay?

84
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,360
Dali! Dali!

85
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,630
No! No!

86
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,900
I'll got you

87
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,700
today!

88
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,430
Dali!

89
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,560
Help!

90
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,630
Moran,

91
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,830
you go so far this time.

92
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,030
You sure you don't need me?

93
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,630
I wanna stay alone.

94
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,760
After all these days,

95
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,230
there's a issue

96
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,430
stuck in my heart.

97
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,430
Time will tell.

98
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,830
I know.

99
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,100
So,

100
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,960
Moran, do you think

101
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,160
you never get it,

102
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,830
that's why you're so persistent.

103
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,760
But who knows.

104
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,300
Because I'll never know the answer. Forever.

105
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,100
In that case,

106
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,960
wish you go safe,

107
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,700
and your life without trouble.

108
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,960
Thank you.

109
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,360
Xunxian, you know,

110
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,100
I've admiring you.

111
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,300
It seems that you are stupid,

112
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,300
But you're not, you see through the world more than everyone.

113
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
Moran, you're wrong.

114
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,430
I'm

115
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,560
just a fool in the world.

116
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,500
You wanna walk out the dreams all the time.

117
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,760
But I think,

118
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,630
some dreams

119
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,230
I'm willing to indulge in them.

120
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,760
It's good, too.

121
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,830
Alright, no more words.

122
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,560
I'll waiting for your back.

123
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,630
then we drink together again.

124
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,830
Today, there're two things.

125
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,830
The first one is

126
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,430
recently we had several frictions with the Orion state.

127
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,630
I was thinking to attack them.

128
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,760
But the Grandma-Empress will not allow me to do that.

129
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,230
So I chose to solve the problem peacefully.

130
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,430
Now, the Orion said they wanna promote our relationship

131
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,160
by marriage.

132
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,630
I do.

133
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,030
Sounds like you can get marry right now.

134
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
What's the second thing?

135
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,430
The second thing,

136
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,760
it's about you too.

137
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,430
Since Luo Feifei succeeded the Lord of Ophiuchus,

138
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
I haven't reporting to award you.

139
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,560
I'm not married.

140
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,630
I need a person who help me to take care of the things of the  imperial harem

141
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,030
So I'll honor you

142
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,830
I do.

143
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,160
I didn't say.

144
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,430
Whatever you say. I do.

145
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,760
I'll make you to be first-level female official.

146
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,630
Congratulations, Lord Luo.

147
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,430
Congratulations.

148
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,700
Thanks.

149
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,030
Thank you.

150
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,160
Prince Tang, It's very late.

151
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,560
What's matter?

152
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,360
Bingbing,

153
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,430
this time, why do you come here for the marriage?

154
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,560
What's your purpose?

155
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,500
What do you mean? Prince Tang.

156
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,360
Bingbing,

157
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,300
If you wanna kill me,

158
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,560
whenever you can take my life.

159
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,360
But if you want to hurt my brother

160
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,230
and Missy.

161
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,760
I'll not let you do that.

162
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,160
Don't worry, Prince Tang.

163
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,430
If I want to kill you,

164
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,160
You've died

165
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,160
in desert.

166
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,830
It makes sense.

167
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,430
Bingbing,

168
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,960
will you hurt my brother and Missy?

169
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,300
I came here for marriage.

170
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,560
and for peace of my people.

171
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,630
Bingbing, I believe in you.

172
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,560
Prince Tang, what are you doing?

173
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,960
Why you use your power suddenly?

174
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,560
I was thinking

175
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,960
why my power is clone.

176
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,300
Now I think I know.

177
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,030
Why?

178
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,900
I can see you clearly in every direction.

179
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,160
I go back first for rest.

180
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,230
Dragon egg,

181
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,830
I don't wanna be that female official.

182
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,100
There will be so many matters

183
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,160
with a group of girls.

184
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,630
Even playing pokers, they'll use so many reasons to refuse.

185
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,030
Not cool.

186
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,700
When you announced your order in the morning,

187
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,900
I thought you would say you wanna marry me.

188
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,630
I can't believe that you give me this position.

189
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,230
You really want to marry me?

190
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,500
How good to be the Empress.

191
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,960
Everyday, what you have to do is eating and sleeping.

192
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,160
Eating

193
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,560
and eating.

194
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,430
So you wanna marry me

195
00:12:59,230 --> 00:12:59,960
or to be Empress?

196
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,760
To be the Empress.

197
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,560
You can get both at same time.

198
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,760
Don't focus on that meaningless things.

199
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,830
It makes no sense.

200
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,560
You're too naive.

201
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,630
You need to manage more things and people if you become the Empress.

202
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,160
According to the formula,

203
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,700
the first thing is mill the powder out.

204
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,030
Missy.

205
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,030
Big white tooth.

206
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,630
What're you doing here?

207
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,430
You look unhappy today.

208
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,700
You took the new official post

209
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,630
and I come to see you.

210
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,630
You know what I'm worried about.

211
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,960
Where's my present?

212
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,230
What present?

213
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,760
You came to see me without a present?

214
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,360
I forgot it.

215
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,560
I'll buy it right now.

216
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,360
Nope.

217
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,230
You don't need to use your money.

218
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,030
Just help me to do something.

219
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,300
Uh-huh.

220
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,700
I'm teaching the maids to do the cosmetics.

221
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,230
But you know,

222
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,230
they're girls.

223
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,760
they're not strong to do something.

224
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,630
I think maybe you can help us?

225
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,030
I need to work?

226
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,760
Okay!

227
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,160
Someone's gone,

228
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,230
there's no one can help him.

229
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,230
Alright! Alright!

230
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,160
You win.

231
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,160
But,

232
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,960
I must ask others accompanying me.

233
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,230
Deal.

234
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,160
Keep the air inside.

235
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,560
Add some of his liquor then.

236
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,160
We can then make perfume successfully.

237
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,430
perfume?

238
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,230
That

239
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,100
Stop!

240
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,100
I won't tell you what's perfume.

241
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,960
Oh! Perfume! I know!

242
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,100
It's good smell water.

243
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,900
Smart boy.

244
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,560
Beitang Tang,

245
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,830
this is lipstick.

246
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,230
I know you're worried about your date.

247
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,560
Send this one to her.

248
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,630
I promise you the girl will definitely like it.

249
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,500
Put them down here.

250
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,300
Okay, leave.

251
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,160
Yes, Prince Tang.

252
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,100
Bingbing,

253
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,230
come here.

254
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,830
I prepared lots of good stuff for you.

255
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,160
Look at this!

256
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,960
The great liquor from Su Xunxian.

257
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,560
And this one,

258
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,560
the delicious dishes made by the royal chef.

259
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,500
And these

260
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,700
all made specially for you.

261
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,900
You like it?

262
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,830
What's this?

263
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,760
This is

264
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,230
This is lipstick, Missy invented it.

265
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,830
It's so pretty when you put it on the lips.

266
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,230
I'll show you.

267
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,960
You thought I'm foolish?

268
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,560
I'm foolish! Not you!

269
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,560
Bingbing, why are you so cruel!

270
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,830
It hurts!

271
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,760
Something's wrong!

272
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,760
Grandma-Empress! Something's wrong.

273
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,960
What happened? What is wrong?

274
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,300
You've already a Lord of constellation.

275
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,360
Why always like a monkey!

276
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,430
Grandma-Empress! Something's wrong.

277
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,830
His Majesty can not get up!

278
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,430
We can't wake him up!

279
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,500
What happened to His Majesty?

280
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,960
Did you call the doctor?

281
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,760
I remember you can cure him with your Mercury retrograde.

282
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,560
It's useless?

283
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,430
Come with me to take a look.

284
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,360
Yi.

285
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,430
Doesn't matter.

286
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,430
Yi.

287
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,230
Yi.

288
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,030
Where's the doctor?

289
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Where's Dehai?

290
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,830
Why are they not here to look after His Majesty?

291
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,560
I asked them go.

292
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,630
Because I think

293
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,360
It looks like His Majesty is sick.

294
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,760
He's haunted!

295
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Haunted?

296
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,900
Moreover,

297
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,360
he always call a woman's name in the two days.

298
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,900
Sounds like Xiaohong, it's very annoying!

299
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,100
I don't know what he did behind my back.

300
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,760
Xiaohong is my maiden name.

301
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,700
You?

302
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,230
Is it Grandpa-Emperor?

303
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,830
It's him!

304
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,900
Yeah! Yeah!

305
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,760
Yi.

306
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,030
You never lie to me.

307
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,360
Does Luo Feifei ask you to do that?

308
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,430
Xiao Xiaohong.

309
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,160
Yi should be get married.

310
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,160
Okay!

311
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,030
Okay!

312
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,560
How are you doing?

313
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,100
What do you need?

314
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,160
I send it to you.

315
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,160
Your Majesty.

316
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,230
Send it. All of it.

317
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,030
I ask you,

318
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,030
do you know the consequence of lying to Grandma-Empress?

319
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,830
I know.

320
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,560
See, there' nothing happened!

321
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,160
And,

322
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,230
Thank you.

323
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,700
Or I'm gonna die.

324
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,700
Thank you.

325
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,500
You're so smart!

326
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,100
So cool!

327
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,630
No more.

328
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,360
I'm so tired. Pay respect to me and go.

329
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,160
Grandma-Empress,

330
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,500
You can't let His Majesty marry with that woman.

331
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,230
I can't?

332
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,430
Why?

333
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,360
I know you.

334
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,700
I gave you a chance,

335
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,760
but

336
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,960
you disappointed me.

337
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,160
Grandma-Empress,

338
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,630
I'm not begging for myself.

339
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,760
Luo Feifei is too restless.

340
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,700
There will be so many troubles if you keep her.

341
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,630
You may go.

342
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,160
Yes, Grandma-Empress.

343
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,100
What do you want to say?

344
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,900
Grandma-Empress,

345
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,360
you might be stay here too long

346
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,360
to forgot our country's mission.
