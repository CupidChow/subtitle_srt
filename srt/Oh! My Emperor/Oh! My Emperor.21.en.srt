1
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,360
Oh! My Emperor

00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 21

4
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,360
Listen up.

5
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,230
Aye.

6
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,760
Carry out the order from His Majesty,

7
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,360
go!

8
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,630
The king was shot in the chest, so his heart was hurt,

9
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,830
I'm afraid...

10
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,830
What?

11
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,830
Arteriorrhexis is likely to happen,

12
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
the king could die due to excessive hemorrhage.

13
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,430
Let me do it.

14
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,960
You two have some rest.

15
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,960
You.

16
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,160
Let me stay to help.

17
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,430
Leave us.

18
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
I can make it

19
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,760
Let's go.

20
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,360
Prince Tang, is it proper

21
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,960
That girl is nobody but just an ordinary nurse.

22
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,630
I trust her.

23
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,030
Feifei,

24
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,100
Dragon Egg.

25
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
You are the master of Serpent star.

26
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,630
Why did you hide it from me for so long?

27
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,160
Dragon Egg, I didn't lie.

28
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,030
I just

29
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,830
knew it not long ago.

30
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,700
And before that

31
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,760
do you know what the people of Serpent star did?

32
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,430
I would rather have not ever seen you.

33
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,900
Move away!

34
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,430
Move away!

35
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,830
Missy.

36
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,830
Missy.

37
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,760
What about my brother?

38
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,560
Your Majesty, are you okay?

39
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,900
Leave me alone.

40
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,960
Are you ok, brother?

41
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,760
Missy has cured you,

42
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,760
she is the master of Serpent star.

43
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,960
What?

44
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,960
The master of Serpent star?

45
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,960
Is that why

46
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,160
you drove her away?

47
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,960
Brother, does it matter

48
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,830
she didn't choose to be it

49
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,160
She has accompanied you for such a long time

50
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,300
has she done anything to hurt you?

51
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,830
You love her

52
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,230
and

53
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,630
she's done so much for us.

54
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,160
You still don't believe her

55
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,300
I don't get it.

56
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,100
Why did you drive her away?

57
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,560
Tangtang,

58
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,360
I have to let her go,

59
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,100
I'm not only Beitang Yi,

60
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,300
but the eldest son of our father.

61
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,700
and the ruler of the whole kingdom.

62
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,230
and it's the best timing.

63
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,230
to let her go.

64
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,560
When war ends,

65
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,230
do you think grandma will let her go?

66
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,030
Go.

67
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,560
Put my cloak

68
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,160
on her.

69
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,900
Missy,

70
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,160
don't let anyone see the mark on the shoulder.

71
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,830
Take care.

72
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,700
Dragon Egg, bastard.

73
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,230
don't want to see me

74
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,100
did want that

75
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,960
what's wrong with being the master of Serpent star

76
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,760
what's wrong?

77
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,430
Why did you drive me away?

78
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,030
Bai Wuchen,

79
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,760
watch my back this time.

80
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,960
Rest assured.

81
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,960
I've got your six

82
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,430
charge.

83
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,760
Something big is about to come.

84
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,100
Dali.

85
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,360
Your Majesty.

86
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,300
Shang Yu, are you all right?

87
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,030
Your Majesty,

88
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,960
when I was investigating Serpent star with Xifeng Lie,

89
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,630
we found all these men were drugged,

90
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,230
Xifeng Lie is under controlled too.

91
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,760
I can't bring him back.

92
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,960
Zhang Tianzheng.

93
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,360
Aye.

94
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,760
Go.

95
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,830
Feifei.

96
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,300
Missy.

97
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,760
What's the matter, how come she is the master of Serpent star?

98
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
the almighty energy

99
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,960
is she a spy on the king

100
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,360
Nonsense, she is not.

101
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,700
Brother

102
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,030
Your Majesty, Feifei.

103
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,030
Dragon Egg.

104
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,360
Feifei.

105
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,760
Beitang Yi , I didn't lie to you.

106
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,160
No, I didn't.

107
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,100
His Highness,

108
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,030
so what should we do with Luo Feifei?

109
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,760
Let the king make the decision

110
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
he's the real emperor now.

111
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:04,230
In the 33rd year of Xingyao period, a turmoil occurred as the master of Serpent star, Luo Feifei, and her people were drugged. The king, Beitang Yi led star masters and managed to curb it, then Beitang Moran gave back the king the military power by the will of the deceased king Beitang Yi united the military power and political power as the people of Serpent star were all imprisoned, so called Serpent Suppression.

112
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:09,560
The military and political unity begins now.
