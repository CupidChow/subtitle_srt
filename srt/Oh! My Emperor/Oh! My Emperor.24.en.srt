00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,630
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

2
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,700
Production Company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd

3
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 03

4
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,430
So, this is the kid

5
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,030
who cured you?

6
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,960
I'm not a kid.

7
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,760
I'm Chongchong. Chongchong. Chongchong.

8
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,960
It's Chongchong.

9
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,830
So,

10
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,760
you getting cured

11
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,830
has nothing to do with

12
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,500
the motley bunch Uncle found?

13
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,700
That's right.

14
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,230
The superpower corresponding to each constellation

15
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,960
has its own restrictions.

16
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,900
I told you,

17
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,830
Ophiuchus' power of retrograde is different

18
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,230
from the twelve constellations' power of attack

19
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,030
in that it can also heal people.

20
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,960
You like my sister?

21
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,430
I know.

22
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,160
You're that fierce-looking guy.

23
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,030
Shut up.

24
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,760
Grandpa, are you alright?

25
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,900
I'm okay.

26
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,360
Don't be afraid, Chongchong.

27
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,500
Feifei. Your Majesty.

28
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,160
Xiang Wentian, your hand.

29
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,900
Us Ophiuchus'

30
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,630
consume our life force

31
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,830
while healing others with the superpower.

32
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,300
That's the price.

33
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,760
Grandpa. Grandpa.

34
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,960
Xiang Wentian.

35
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Grandpa. Grandpa.  Xiang Wentian.

36
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,230
Grandpa, are you alright? Grandpa.

37
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,360
Xiang Wentian.

38
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,830
My lord, you're not cured yet.

39
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,500
Keep doing this and you'll be dead.

40
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,760
My lord.

41
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,630
Stop wasting your energy.

42
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,230
I've depleted my life force.

43
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,560
Regrettably,

44
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,230
I won't be able to witness the day

45
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:42,830
when us Ophiuchus' name is cleared.

46
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,430
Xiang Wentian, you will.

47
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,760
Just, hold on. Hold on.

48
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,030
Many years ago,

49
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,300
the Zodiac State was at war with the Orion State.

50
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,300
Our family's

51
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,100
last Constellation Lord

52
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,030
sensed that the late Emperor was infected with virus,

53
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,560
and went to

54
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,430
discuss with other Constellation Lords.

55
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,960
But no one believed him.

56
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,700
And then,

57
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,900
in the Palace,

58
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,700
the late Emperor went crazy.

59
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,830
Out of desperation,

60
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:52,160
our last Constellation Lord killed him.

61
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,360
But he was considered by others a kingslayer.

62
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
For that,

63
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,760
our last Constellation Lords was killed

64
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,100
by other Constellation Lords.

65
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,630
From then on,

66
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,100
us Ophiuchus

67
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:31,630
were abolished from a thousand-year lineage,

68
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,030
and were seen by others

69
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,630
a foreign kind.

70
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,700
It seems that,

71
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,830
someone tried to put the blame on us Ophiuchus

72
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,560
and plant these nonexistent evidence

73
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,430
forcibly on us Ophiuchus.

74
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,430
I, Luo Feifei, would never let it happen.

75
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,630
But we don't have any proof.

76
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,160
Bei Tangyi.

77
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,630
Bei Tangyi, say it.

78
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,230
Say that you'll clear the name for us Ophiuchus.

79
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,430
Say it, please.

80
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
I

81
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,300
will definitely clear the name of Ophiuchus'.

82
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,230
If that's the case,

83
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,360
I won't

84
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,160
die

85
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,430
in vain.

86
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,430
Grandpa.

87
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,030
Grandpa.

88
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,760
Grandpa.

89
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,160
Grandpa. Grandpa.

90
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,700
What's wrong with her?

91
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,230
I followed her to the Ophiuchus Village.

92
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,160
To treat the crazies,

93
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,230
she fainted.

94
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,830
So now, Your Majesty

95
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,500
believes that the Ophiuchus'

96
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,300
were poisoned,

97
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,630
instead of plotting the treason?

98
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,360
Without a doubt.

99
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,830
But your medicine seems to be ineffective, Uncle.

100
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,760
I've already sent men to find Tang Tang and Shang Yu.

101
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,360
Let's hope it's not too late.

102
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,700
But Your Majesty, please don't go any further.

103
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,830
The consort's bedchamber is ahead

104
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,560
and it's not appropriate for Your Majesty to step inside.

105
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,630
What are you doing?

106
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,560
It seems fun.

107
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,500
They're picking the flowers in exchange for money.

108
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,300
They're picking what?

109
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,360
You wanna try it?

110
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,560
Fill the basket with flowers

111
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
within 15 minutes.

112
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,030
Or there will be no water or food for you today.

113
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,700
A piece of cake.

114
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,630
From now on, this is our safe distance.

115
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,630
What if I trespass it?

116
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,160
Then I'll cut down that body part

117
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,360
and feed it to the camels.

118
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,560
Come. For Sister Xia Bing...

119
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
No, show off for Xia Bing.

120
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,030
See?

121
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,560
That's called the Sun and Moon Walk.

122
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,160
Then what's your superpower?

123
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,430
It's a secret.

124
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,300
Are you for real?

125
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Thanks.

126
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,360
Thank you. Thanks.

127
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,430
Thank you.

128
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,030
Feifei, you're awake.

129
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,760
Xiaojiao, quickly. Call His Highness in.

130
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,960
Yes.

131
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,760
Feeling better?

132
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,360
I was worried sick.

133
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,630
Prince Consort, His Highness has arrived.

134
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,700
Don't call me that.

135
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,030
It sounds weird.

136
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,960
His Highness addresses you like this,

137
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,900
and we wouldn't dare to do otherwise.

138
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,560
He does that to save me.

139
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,560
Please call me Feifei instead.

140
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,630
Do you hate the title "Prince Consort" that much

141
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,760
or

142
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,560
do you prefer being called the "Queen"?

143
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,830
Your Highness, I haven't had the chance

144
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,900
to properly thank you for saving my life.

145
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,430
I owe you big time.

146
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,760
Actually I'm pretty embarrassed about it.

147
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,960
But I will clear this up as soon as possible,

148
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,630
and prove your innocence.

149
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,900
You're...

150
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,430
Your Highness mentioned the marriage

151
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,430
just to save me.

152
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,760
Don't take it seriously.

153
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,560
Your Highness, Pharmacist Bilian asks to see you.

154
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,430
Under the order of Grandma-Empress,

155
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,560
Prince Chen, Beitang Moran,

156
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,760
daughter of Prime Minister Xie, Xie Yanran,

157
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,160
and Luo Feifei are summoned to the palace.

158
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,830
Aye. Aye.

159
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,300
Be careful, Aunt.

160
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,630
Thanks, Nephew.

161
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,160
I ask you to come today,

162
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,830
not for anything else,

163
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,500
but for a family dinner.

164
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,560
Thank you for the meal, mother.

165
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,100
Thank you for the meal, Grandma-Empress.

166
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,030
Yanran.

167
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,560
You must know

168
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,760
why I ask you to come here today.

169
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,560
Now the army and the government are united, and the country is prosperous.

170
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,100
All His Majesty needs is someone

171
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,900
to discuss business matters with someone like you.

172
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,360
Grandma-Empress, I have something to say.

173
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,360
Please say it.

174
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,700
I know that I don't deserve to be Queen,

175
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,960
and I hope Grandma-Empress can revoke the order.

176
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,760
Yanran.

177
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,500
You are the daughter of the Prime Minister.

178
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,830
You are brought up by myself.

179
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,430
Who else is more suited for the role?

180
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,830
Don't be too modest.

181
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,230
I know that Grandma-Empress has great expectations for me,

182
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,160
but my heart belongs to another, and I don't deserve to be Queen.

183
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Grandma-Empress, please revoke the order.

184
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Yanran.

185
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,160
I've spoiled you all these years.

186
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,030
How dare you speak against me in public!

187
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,760
Luo Feifei, are you trying to play the hero?

188
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,030
Shall we do it the hard way then?

189
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,630
I haven't said anything yet.

190
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,360
Feifei.

191
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,430
I have something to tell you.

192
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,560
Your Highness, Yanran.

193
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,630
If you don't mind.

194
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,430
Alright. We'll wait for you outside the Palace.

195
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,300
Feifei.

196
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,360
Call me Aunt.

197
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,960
Are you still mad at me?

198
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,760
I wouldn't dare,

199
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,500
even if I'm your aunt.

200
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,230
Since you're the emperor and all that.

201
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,160
No. I wouldn't dare.

202
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,560
What are you doing?

203
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,960
Getting hand on me?

204
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,360
Believe it or not, I'll file an assault charge against you.

205
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,960
Come on.

206
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,160
I finally find the time to talk to you.

207
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,300
Talk, then.

208
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,830
The Grandma-Empress now considers you Ophiuchus'

209
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,430
enemies of the Zodiac State.

210
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,430
Thanks to Uncle's quick wit,

211
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,830
I used the excuse of "Amnesty for All"

212
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,830
to take you in the palace,

213
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,630
preventing you from the worst case scenario.

214
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,560
But rest assured,

215
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,830
I'll definitely find a way

216
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,560
to clear Ophiuchus' name.

217
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,030
You believe we're innocent?

218
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,360
I believe in you.

219
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,230
So I'm willing to

220
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,030
believe Ophiuchus' are also innocent.

221
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,230
Why?

222
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,960
Does that need any reasons or proof?

223
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,900
But your grandma insists on marrying me to Prince Chen

224
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,760
and you to Yanran.

225
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,960
I will never agree to that.

226
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,900
But she's still your grandma.

227
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,960
I can still abdicate the throne if it comes to that.

228
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Is it worthy though?

229
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,560
Dragon Egg, do you know why,

230
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,360
even though Uncle is more handsome and more polished,

231
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,830
I still like you?

232
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,430
Perhaps you're blind.

233
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,430
What?

234
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,230
How could you say something so contradictory to your own mind

235
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,100
if otherwise?

236
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,760
How is he more handsome than me?

237
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,100
More talented?

238
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,630
Feifei.

239
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,630
Grandma-Empress is still angry

240
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,230
with His Majesty and His Highness?

241
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,300
My boys used to be so obedient.

242
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,630
How come after Luo Feifei,

243
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,300
each and every one of them would stand up against me

244
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,960
and give me headaches?

245
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,030
As simple-minded as I am,

246
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,430
though I don't know if I can be of help to you,

247
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,630
I would say if you give Prince Chen your blessings,

248
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,160
many problems would be resolved.

249
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,900
Bilian, you know me too well.

250
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,700
Blessings.

251
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,230
Indeed.

252
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,430
I shall bless them with a grand wedding ceremony.

253
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,430
Do you know how much money

254
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,560
Uncle spent just to cure you?

255
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,700
I don't.

256
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,830
Yeah.

257
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,230
Lord?

258
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,700
Two hundred.

259
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Two thousand.

260
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,830
Don't tell me it's twenty thousand.

261
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
That hurts.

262
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,160
So.

263
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,230
You should treat him better.

264
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,160
Don't behave like he owes you something.

265
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,560
Money can be repaid.

266
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,160
But affections,

267
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,630
are hard to be returned.

268
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,830
I would say Moran is as good as the Emperor, if not better.

269
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,160
There's plenty of fish in the sea.

270
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,430
And there's no need to get attached to one person.

271
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,960
What do you say, Miss Luo?

272
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,830
Let's talk about something else, Master Su.

273
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,900
Your skin doesn't look so good recently.

274
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,900
Nonsense.

275
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,030
My skin is taken care of by specially-assigned people.

276
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,360
It's probably because I used the wrong skincare product.

277
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,030
Let me recommend one for you.

278
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,760
What's this?

279
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,160
Simple Xiaomihu facial mask.

280
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,430
Natural water-permeable facial skin.

281
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,560
You would know this?

282
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,360
Great.

283
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,560
Where the hell is this place?

284
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,560
Xifeng Lie. Xifeng Lie.

285
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,960
Xifeng Lie.

286
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,360
This is your burial site.

287
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Miss Xia, why did you capture me?

288
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,360
Lord Shang, why couldn't I capture you?

289
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,300
You know who I am.

290
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,700
Who the hell are you?

291
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,630
Shang Yu. Xifeng Lie.

292
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,560
I've come to your rescue.

293
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,960
Prince Tang.

294
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,500
You messed with the wrong people today.

295
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,230
I'm Bei Tangtang, or Prince Tang,

296
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,630
a member of Pisces, the Beitang Family

297
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,760
from the Zodiac State.

298
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,630
If you're clever, you should put down your weapons.

299
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,230
What did he say?

300
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,960
Leave when I'm not furious,

301
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,500
and I'll spare your lives

302
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,360
for the sake of

303
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,630
the God.

304
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,430
Take him away.

305
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,030
Your Highness, why are you here?

306
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,360
Can't you see?

307
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,560
I am here to save you guys.

308
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,360
I honestly can't.
