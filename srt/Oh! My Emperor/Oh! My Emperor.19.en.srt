00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,360
Oh! My Emperor

Episode 19

4
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,160
These standards for students are guidelines, handed down to us by Ancient Stages.

5
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,560
First, obey and care for your parents, and then practice true brotherhood.

6
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,960
Learn to be careful and honest, and cherish all living begins. Draw near to good-hearted people.

7
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:14,960
Repeat.

8
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,760
Anyone who's lost a lunch box?

9
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,760
Who?

10
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,100
Well.

11
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,360
What about your teacher?

12
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,700
Maybe.

13
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,900
Go on!

14
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,030
Thank you, Miss.

15
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,160
What' the matter with your foot?

16
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,160
Let me see, little bunny.

17
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,500
Brother, are you ok?

18
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,500
It's okay. Just an little bruise.

19
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,030
I'm sorry!

20
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,300
Well, the tournament will start soon,

21
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,900
but you seemed absent-minded recently.

22
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,830
I'm fine! You go back first.

23
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,560
Finished cleaning?

24
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,230
What happened with your face?

25
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,230
It's normal for a man.

26
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,030
Wait, I'll take the medicine kit.

27
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,900
Toxic bruise.

28
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,560
Should you suck the toxic substances out?

29
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,030
What' re you waiting for?

30
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,560
I like you.

31
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,300
What?

32
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,830
I said I like you.

33
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,760
I wanna move to your heart.

34
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,700
The greater gravity you have.

35
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,630
I wanna travel into space with you.

36
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:27,100
We get in the time machine to see the galaxy.

37
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,630
I undertake you indifference and arrogance.

38
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,160
You need to accept my unreasonableness.

39
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,030
Your faintly smile

40
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,360
sweeten the air.

41
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,100
I feel like fell into the Aegean sea.

42
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,830
Whether you have expectation?

43
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,500
I wanna feel your breathe frequency,

44
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,830
and experience all your emotions.

45
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,430
Please hold me in your arms.

46
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
My brother with so much potential!

47
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,560
He came up such an idea

48
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,760
to create a perfect time

49
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,760
to bound with Missy.

50
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,700
How scared of a serious crush man.

51
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,030
I wanna move to your heart.

52
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,230
The greater gravity you have.

53
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,160
I wanna travel into space with you.

54
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:46,030
We get in the time machine to see the galaxy.

55
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,630
I undertake you indifference and arrogance.

56
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,830
You need to accept my unreasonableness.

57
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,560
Your faintly smile

58
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,830
sweeten the air.

59
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,560
I feel like fell into the Aegean sea.

60
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,500
Whether you have expectation?

61
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,100
I wanna feel your breathe frequency,

62
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,360
and experience all your emotions.

63
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,900
I feel like fell into the Aegean sea.

64
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,360
Sing a love song for you.

65
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,030
Use the best examples for you.

66
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,230
Keep them in my mind.

67
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,760
Just let me fall into the Aegean sea.

68
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,360
It's hard

69
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,830
to see you distract.

70
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,160
Are you still worrying His Majesty?

71
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,100
If he win,

72
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,630
I will not hate him.

73
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,830
So, you don't care the result?

74
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,630
No. I have to win.

75
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,760
I said I like you.

76
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,500
Feifei.

77
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,630
I got an good idea.

78
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,630
What?

79
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,430
You can go in place me!

80
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,230
I voted for His Majesty.

81
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,030
But I don't want to upset His highness.

82
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,430
You attend the tournament instead of me.

83
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,430
Yanran,

84
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,430
are you crazy?

85
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,900
The finals begin.

86
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,160
Come on in!

87
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:40,030
The whispering audiences.

88
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,960
Your Highness is so handsome!

89
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,560
Cheer up!

90
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,230
The victory belongs to us!

91
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,230
Yes!

92
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,030
Cheer for Prince Chen!

93
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,100
Hooray!

94
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,830
Cheer for Prince Chen!

95
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,560
Hooray!

96
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,360
Cheer for Prince Chen!

97
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,360
Hooray!

98
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,160
Your Majesty, we're assembled.

99
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,230
Wait for your order!

100
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:16,830
Xie Yanran.

101
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,230
The tournament's starting soon, what' re you doing?

102
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,830
Why did you run?

103
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Why cover your face? Come here!

104
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,030
Big white tooth, don't pull me!

105
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,830
Quickly!

106
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,960
Missy?

107
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,160
What' re you doing here?

108
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,700
Not me! Not me! Not me!

109
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,560
Where' s Xie Yanran?

110
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
She's

111
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,630
got a stomachache.

112
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,500
You guys think this is a joke?

113
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,430
She was all right in the meeting yesterday!

114
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Why can't she come today!

115
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,830
I don' t know.

116
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,360
I think she' s not got a stomachache

117
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
and can't not come here.

118
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,500
You at the back, right?

119
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,560
She doesn' t come

120
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,360
and you can stir up trouble, right?

121
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Bullshit!

122
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,760
What's "stir up trouble"?

123
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,030
I tell you that I' m here,

124
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,300
we're sure to win!

125
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,630
Xunxian, after a while,

126
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,160
you lead the attack from the left.

127
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,430
Yes. Your Highness.

128
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,100
Tianzheng.

129
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,030
Yes, Your Highness.

130
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,160
You lead the attack from the right.

131
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Yes. Your Highness.

132
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,030
General Chu and Master Bai.

133
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,360
You go straight on the middle

134
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,030
to deal with the commander.

135
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,560
Yes. Your Highness.

136
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,960
Well, I'll be waiting for your good news

137
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,960
in the tent.

138
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,360
Your Highness, please be assured!

139
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,500
All out!

140
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,630
His Majesty is our commander,

141
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,960
that's why he have to stay in the encampment

142
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,300
and we need to protect him.

143
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,430
What about us four guys?

144
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
We have to divide into three groups.

145
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,960
Master Fang in the first group

146
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,900
ought to fight over bottom

147
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,560
The other group is Master Mei

148
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,830
who control the top.

149
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,630
Little Prince, you're responsible for the middle.

150
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,160
And I'll be jungling in the jungle.

151
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,960
Jungling?

152
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,830
Foraging wild food? I'm hungry.

153
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,630
Missy? What did you say?

154
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
But it sounds cool.

155
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,960
I mean

156
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,230
"jungling" is boosting economy.

157
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,030
I'm in the jungle behind your teams' s back whatever and whenever you want.

158
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,830
And

159
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,430
I can give the treatments in the first time.

160
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,700
Blood transfusion.

161
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,100
But, Your Majesty,

162
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,360
Luo Feifei is the lord of Cancer.

163
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,430
Will that be a violation if she attend us?

164
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,500
But if not,

165
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
we're not enough.

166
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,960
It will be deemed a waiver.

167
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,430
Do it.

168
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,760
Exactly Your Majesty.

169
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,300
I tell you that I never lose in game.

170
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Luo Feifei stay here with me.

171
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,100
Your Majesty, I really

172
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,230
That's the deal.

173
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,560
Kill them!
