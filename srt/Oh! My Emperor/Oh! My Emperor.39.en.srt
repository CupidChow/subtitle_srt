1
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,360
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

2
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,630
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co.,Ltd

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,560
Episode 18

4
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,030
Your pose is kind of weird.

5
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,560
Not at all.

6
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,830
What's weird is that you choose Su Xunxian to draw this picture.

7
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,960
As the saying goes, methods may vary while the principle remains the same.

8
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,030
I can comprehend by analogy.

9
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,960
Don't question my painting skills.

10
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,360
My mother taught me that personally.

11
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,230
Do you know who my mother is?

12
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,830
Who is his mother?

13
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,430
His mother is the top timber dealer in Zodiac State.

14
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,430
A timber dealer?

15
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,360
And you are sitting there for drawing?

16
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,830
What's wrong with the timber dealer?

17
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,960
Arts are interconnected.

18
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,430
Like making a profit, it is a kind of art

19
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
isn't it, Master Mei?

20
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,230
I can't agree more.

21
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,960
What a big profit you are making.

22
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
Just this picture

23
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,300
can help you earn thousands of constellation coins.

24
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,160
Okay.

25
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,760
Alright.

26
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,830
You are all artists, aren't you?

27
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,100
Then let me check how

28
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:18,960
you work.

29
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,900
I just draw it roughly.

30
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,100
Still need more details.

31
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,430
This is your mother painting skills?

32
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,700
What do you mean?

33
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,230
I mean

34
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,160
this is your mother's painting skills?

35
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,700
Watch your mouth, lady.

36
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,700
Look at the face, the movement...

37
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,100
neither is like ours.

38
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,160
Yeah.

39
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,830
This mole,

40
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,100
where is it?

41
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,430
If you are so unsatisfied,

42
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,700
turn to Master Wang.

43
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,430
That's it.

44
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,630
I have nothing to say.

45
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,700
Let's go.

46
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,160
Your Majesty.

47
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,300
They just go away.

48
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,230
Would you like one too?

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,030
Do you pay for it?

50
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:13,830
No, you pay for it.

51
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,700
Save your words.

52
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,100
What's wrong?

53
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,030
None of the dozens of things

54
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
is going well these days.

55
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,700
Take your time and don't worry.

56
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,830
Take my time?

57
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,430
Our wedding day is coming.

58
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,230
I have sent soldiers to look for Yanran and Uncle Chen.

59
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,230
I wonder their current situation.

60
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
Dragon Egg, my right eye has been twitching lately.

61
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,160
They all said,

62
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,830
twitching of the left eye forecasts fortune while the right disaster.

63
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,360
Do you think this means...

64
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,160
Stop overthinking.

65
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,230
I have learnt about the wedding schedule.

66
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,960
We will poison all the wine in the whole city that day.

67
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,700
They will be all dead by then.

68
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,560
Good job.

69
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,500
I received a pigeon mail just now.

70
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,430
Our army has been hiding among the people.

71
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,760
They can dispatch troops at any time.

72
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,900
National Master

73
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,760
Constellation Lords of Zodiac State are not villains.

74
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,160
Is there any possibility of recruiting them?

75
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,500
Xia Bing

76
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,230
Leaving the source of trouble leads to a hidden danger.

77
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
Don't ruin it with your petty kindness.

78
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,900
I understand.

79
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,030
National Master

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,160
As for Beitang Tang,

81
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,560
he is not a threat to us.

82
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,430
Can you...

83
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,230
I promise you that I won't hurt him.

84
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,560
After this, you are the hero of the Orion State.

85
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,300
And I will marry you two in person.

86
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,630
Thank you, National Master.

87
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,630
Xia Bing

88
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,360
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

89
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,960
We meet again after a long separation today.

90
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,430
Stay and have dinner with me.

91
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,160
Thanks, National Master

92
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,760
But Feifei...

93
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,630
Luo Feifei is having a Bachelor Party tonight.

94
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,100
I have to show up or they will...

95
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,300
Fine,

96
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,630
leave now.

97
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,430
Yanran, there you are.

98
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,160
I thought you would never be back.

99
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,300
Dragon Egg said you are far away from me.

100
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,030
I'm so worried about you.

101
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,300
Alright, I miss you too.

102
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,630
It's your Dragon Egg that asked me to surprise you.

103
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,560
I will definitely come back.

104
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,030
You idiot Beitang Yi,

105
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,100
I'm telling you

106
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,430
from now on,

107
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,300
my Feifei is all yours.

108
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,760
If you treat her unfairly,

109
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,630
I will teach her

110
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,500
108 ways of killing husband which I learnt

111
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,630
from the book.

112
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,630
Be considerate and treat her kindly, will you?

113
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,760
Constellation Lord Xie

114
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,830
is always dignified and noble in front of everyone,

115
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,430
but you are so cute and active in private.

116
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,430
Don't tell anyone.

117
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,030
If you do,

118
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,760
I will torture you with

119
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,430
108 ways of torment

120
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,230
which I also learnt from a book.

121
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,360
No, I dare not to.

122
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,360
108 ways of torment.

123
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,630
I'm sure

124
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,830
they will cost a lot.

125
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,630
At least 5 C-Coins for each one.

126
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,830
It will cost 540 C-Coins

127
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,230
for 108 ways.

128
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,160
Do you need me to calculate for you?

129
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,430
In my opinion,

130
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,830
as for spending money,

131
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,300
Constellation Lord Xie prefers Su Xunxian

132
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,430
instead of you the miser.

133
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,960
Hope I can be the star and you the moon.

134
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,300
flowing light and lightening each other every night.

135
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,430
Unfortunately,

136
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,030
you two losers were

137
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,230
invited to this party.

138
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,030
That's really unfortunate.

139
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,230
Where is Prince Chen?

140
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,230
I thought he was back too.

141
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,830
Prince had a bad cold because of the long journey.

142
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,030
He couldn't make it today.

143
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,630
Hope you can excuse him.

144
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
How about this

145
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,430
let me tell you some gossip.

146
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,230
Today,

147
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,230
Xia Bing went to Grandma-Empress'.

148
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,430
Big white tooth escort her

149
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,300
all the short way to the Palace.

150
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,500
Pamper too much?

151
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,560
Hey hey hey

152
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,430
Missy

153
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,830
Don't speak ill of me in front of everyone here.

154
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,030
My dear wife is fierce.

155
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,230
Take care of yourself.

156
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,300
Big white tooth,

157
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,430
don't you know your dear wife will sleep with me tonight?

158
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Besides,

159
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,360
Bingbing

160
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,830
put in words,

161
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,230
against him or me?

162
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,100
Even so

163
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,560
three women of you can't win.

164
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,030
Who said that?

165
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Even though I'm pregnant,

166
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,160
I can fight two people at once.

167
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,160
Anyway,

168
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,830
I

169
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,230
I

170
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,630
I

171
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,760
I only fight for my wife.

172
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,500
Good boy

173
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,230
I'm a good boy.

174
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,830
Bai Wuchen

175
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,560
you should stick on the rule that the husband guides his wife.

176
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,560
Xifeng Lie, just give up.

177
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,960
You see, we used to

178
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,700
be divided into Emperor group and Uncle group.

179
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,760
And now

180
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,630
we are divided into male group and female group.

181
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,560
I

182
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,830
I'm in a dilemma.

183
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,560
Why are you in a dilemma?

184
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,030
People like you

185
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,030
have always been a drag in each group.

186
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,360
Save some medical expenses for me.

187
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,430
I, as a Libra,

188
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,760
definitely is a judge.

189
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,560
But you, Daren

190
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,630
are stingy, mean and tightfisted.

191
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,430
You will be kicked out by both groups.

192
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,030
You can only be with Eunuch Hai.

193
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,900
You.

194
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,760
Okay, stop.

195
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,430
Tonight

196
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,560
don't fight anymore.

197
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,500
We only do two things today.

198
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,830
Firstly, drinking.

199
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,360
Secondly, dancing.

200
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,760
Enjoy our last Golden Single Night.

201
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,230
Let's propose a toast.

202
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,560
Cheers

203
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,500
Cheers

204
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,760
Cheers

205
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,230
Just drink.

206
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,230
Let's keep on drinking.

207
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,900
Wait a second.

208
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,160
What's wrong?

209
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,560
I forgot that

210
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,430
I have a present for Miss Xia.

211
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,500
You can go back first,

212
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,900
I will catch up later.

213
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,430
What a late moment!

214
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,630
I will go with you.

215
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,430
It's okay.

216
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
In frontier fortress,

217
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,900
we had an argument with Miss Xia.

218
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,030
In the future, she will be our Princess Consort.

219
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,300
We can start over with

220
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,160
a little present.

221
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,760
You do know how to improve a relationship.

222
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,160
Ok then, come back soon.

223
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,160
Today is a good opportunity

224
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,430
and we can continue our drinking party in my Hongluan Brothels.

225
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,760
Show you the real courtesan.

226
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,030
Su Xunxian

227
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,360
Don't fool me.

228
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,030
That's not possible.

229
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,560
I never fool you.

230
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,700
Okay.

231
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,430
Deal is a deal, I will be back soon.

232
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,630
I feel uneasy.

233
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,160
Come on, there is nothing to worry about.

234
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,160
He is too fast

235
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,830
to get caught.

236
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,230
Wait for me.

237
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:37,960
Come on.

238
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,560
Our Orion State failed once before.

239
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,100
But this time, National Master has been planned thoroughly.

240
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,760
We can't make any mistake.

241
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,630
Did you prepare everything?

242
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,760
Tomorrow is our big day,

243
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,360
we can't miss anything, understand?

244
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,030
Xia Bing is so smart

245
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,560
that she got a message from Luo Feifei

246
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,030
and poisoned the wine.

247
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,900
So we can take Zodiac State

248
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,030
as easy as blowing off dust.

249
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,160
Xia Bing

250
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,360
They are Big Dog and his fellows.

251
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,830
After we killed the Emperor

252
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,830
and all Constellation Lords,

253
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,160
Zodiac State is all ours.

254
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,160
When we take Zodiac State, Hercules State

255
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,830
Bayer State and Lakay State

256
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,100
are also ours,

257
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,230
aren't they?

258
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Damn.

259
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,700
I have to tell them.

260
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,830
What are you doing?

261
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,160
Your Highness

262
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Lie why are you in panic?

263
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,300
Shang Yu is missing.

264
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,430
Did you look for him?

265
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,500
I had been to everywhere,

266
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,360
including all the places Yu used to be.

267
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,700
But I didn't see him.

268
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,560
Have you been to Zhengxing Palace?

269
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,630
Yes.

270
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,830
Miss Xia said she didn't see Shang Yu last night.

271
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,160
Find Su Xunxian.

272
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,630
I had sent a servant to find him.

273
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,230
Master Su will be here soon.

274
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,760
Your Highness, they have already left to get the bride.

275
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,830
Should we go straight to...

276
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,560
Piss off.

277
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,160
We are quite busy now.

278
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,760
Today is the wedding day,

279
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,700
why are you so mad?

280
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,030
Master Su, please help me find Yu.

281
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
He never came back for the whole night.

282
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,430
What happened to him?

283
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,100
Yu

284
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,630
I had told you

285
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,560
his extraordinary ability is the speed.

286
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,360
Cut the crap and help me find him.

287
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,560
Lie

288
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,300
Calm down.

289
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,630
Calm down.

290
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,630
Let me ask around for you.

291
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,360
I had a clue.

292
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,300
Let's go and try to find him ok?

293
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,830
You guys go first,

294
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,830
I'll catch up later.

295
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,900
The decorations are pretty.

296
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
His Highness is coming.

297
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,700
What a good day.

298
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,160
Your Highness, your suit is unique.

299
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,160
This is made by Missy.

300
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,630
I like it anyway.

301
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
I think it's good.

302
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,500
Yeah.

303
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,160
Zhang Tianzheng,

304
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,560
That's enough for our bridegroom,

305
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,230
what are you unsatisfied about?

306
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,360
When you get married

307
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,430
you can make your own comments.

308
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,830
Oh

309
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,900
By the way

310
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,500
By virtue of your looking,

311
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,430
it's hard to find a wife.

312
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:27,960
Master Mei,

313
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,500
You don't have to mock me.

314
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,630
I may get married tomorrow.

315
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,160
You can wait and see.

316
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,830
And my wife will be perfect in this world.

317
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,100
Ridiculous.

318
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,700
Let me bet with you.

319
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,830
Bet on what?

320
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,300
I bet you will never get married.

321
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Sure, let's do it.

322
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,560
Okay, no problem.

323
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,160
Zhang Tianzheng, you lose your bet.

324
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,830
What do you mean Your Majesty?

325
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,030
I know.

326
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,760
Because my brother and I

327
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,900
married the best two women in this world.

328
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,160
Yours can only be the third.

329
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
My Nannan is not the best or the second best,

330
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,630
but she must be top three.

331
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,160
If General Chu can be top three,

332
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,230
I'd better stay single.

333
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,500
Zhang Tianzheng, are you tired of being alive?

334
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,360
How about having a fight?

335
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,960
I know I can't win.

336
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,760
But my Nannan's roar

337
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,830
can make you bleed from all the seven openings of your head.

338
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,700
I forgot you have a lioness.

339
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,430
That's my mistake.

340
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,360
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,630
If you said so, I also want to get married.

342
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,760
They said Yuanniang is great.

343
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,960
What are you looking at?

344
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,900
Can't I just think about it?

345
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,230
Sure.

346
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,160
Feifei.

347
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,830
Sit still. Don't move.

348
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,160
She just couldn't wait for it.

349
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,960
Good for you, Yanran

350
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,630
I'm still here.

351
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,430
How can you say that.

352
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,960
I'll give you a lesson!

353
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,830
Ok, I was wrong. OK?

354
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,030
You are about to get married.

355
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,230
Don't act like that.

356
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,030
Be sedate.

357
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,560
Yes you are right. Be sedate.

358
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,360
By the way, I should have asked you.

359
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,630
How is Prince Chen?

360
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,030
You didn't tell me what's going on.

361
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,560
What's happening?

362
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,160
Don't worry about that.

363
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,630
Today is your big day.

364
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,960
Let's be happy and leave that behind, ok?

365
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,230
Kiss me. Kiss me.

366
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,430
Bingbing

367
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,430
What's wrong?

368
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
You look upset.

369
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,160
No,

370
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,900
It's just when I heard

371
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,360
your old stories

372
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,100
I feel envy at you two.

373
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,230
From now on, it is no more two of us,

374
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
but four of us.

375
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,960
We four are best friends forever.

376
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,230
We will be together forever.

377
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,360
Let me tell you,

378
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,360
If those four fools bully us,

379
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,230
I, Luo Feifei will

380
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,160
Ok, that's enough.

381
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,160
My husband is not a fool,

382
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,230
and he can't bully me.

383
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,830
What does the book say?

384
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,700
Pregnant women will be thickheaded in three years.

385
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,360
You are thickheaded now.

386
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,300
You are right.

387
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,900
What?

388
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,230
Do you have a problem with that?

389
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,430
Ranran, do you have any problem?

390
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,230
Ok, that's enough.

391
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,230
Take it easy.

392
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,160
Don't be angry. It will hurt your baby.

393
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,900
But anyway,

394
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,030
your temper is still bad though you get pregnant.

395
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,160
But my baby

396
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,630
will be like me with a bad temper.

397
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,960
It seems good?

398
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,500
Bingbing

399
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,830
I think you can get pregnant easier than her.

400
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,760
Liten to me,

401
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
you can have many babies with Prince Tang.

402
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,960
I had a plan.

403
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,160
Why did you say that?

404
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,160
I will teach them Kempo

405
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,360
to improve their health.

406
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,430
Don't listen to her if it's a girl.

407
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,230
Do you know

408
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
she fought too much in the childhood

409
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,630
so that all the boys got away from her.

410
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,830
You can't get married if

411
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,760
the groom is not Bai Wuchen.

412
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Is she a monkey?

413
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,430
You are a monkey!

414
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,900
Monkey.

415
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,900
I tell you, she

416
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,230
is just like a princess.

417
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,830
She never left her room and always read her books.

418
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,960
Nerd! She's a nerd!

419
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,360
At least I can protect my husband.

420
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,430
Anything wrong?

421
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,700
Then

422
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,160
my Dragon Egg can also protect me.

423
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,900
Ok, ok, we can all be protected.

424
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,160
Emperor and Prince Tang have arrived.

425
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,560
Did you hear that?

426
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,230
They are coming.

427
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,030
Be sedate.

428
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,100
Be sedate.

429
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,430
Sit! Sit down! Sit still!

430
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,360
Ok, ok.

431
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,630
Let's go.

432
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,500
Go.

433
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,230
Where are you going?

434
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,100
How can your breast look so...

435
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,360
Prince Tang fed me well.

436
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
I ate too much and got fat.

437
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,630
Where is the veil?

438
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,560
The veil.

439
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,500
Where is the veil?
