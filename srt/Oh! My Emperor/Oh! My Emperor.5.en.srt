1
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:01,360
Oh! My Emperor

Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co.,Ltd.

3
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,600
Episode 5

4
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,750
Missy, why don't you give this bag

5
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,750
to the servant and let him send it?

6
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,830
I don't understand. Silly boy!

7
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,230
These are the last several hundred pieces.

8
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,900
Of course I need to hand them to Jia Cheng in person.

9
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,230
You're so....

10
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Something doesn't feel right.

11
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,830
Intuition. Woman's intuition.

12
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,630
I feel nothing.

13
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,030
Fool! I'm just kidding!

14
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,700
Relax. Relax.

15
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,100
I can't!

16
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,360
It is so important to my brother.

17
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,030
I know.

18
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,900
It's of the same importance to me.

19
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,360
That's why I put it in the brush pot

20
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,560
to hide from others.

21
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,560
Something is not right.

22
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,830
Yeah?

23
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,760
You can't fool me!

24
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,630
Big White Teeth, you can't fool me.

25
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,430
It's real!

26
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,560
I'll teach you a lesson!

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,360
Still trying?

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
Who's pulling my skirt?

29
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,960
That's wired. Why is my power

30
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,900
not functional?

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,030
Who's this?

32
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,030
Shangyu.

33
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,360
Give...give me the Book!

34
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,160
Missy,

35
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,360
I count to three and you run.

36
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,360
Big White Teeth, you handle it! I go first!

37
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,900
I'm sorry, Prince Tang.

38
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,830
I am taking my leave.

39
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I won't let you go.

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,760
Let me go!

41
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,560
No!

42
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,630
Beat me down if you can!

43
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,560
Prince Tang, tell you what, I am a really fierce fighter!

44
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,230
Let me go!

45
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,830
Where are your manners?

46
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,360
Though you're both constellation masters,

47
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,630
Tangtang is the Prince Tang.

48
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,160
You guys acted like that.

49
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Are you in contempt of the royalty?

50
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,630
It's my fault.

51
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,900
Prince, please chastise me.

52
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,830
Uncle Chen, you were really light on foot.

53
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,630
But we have got the Book finished,

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,830
and I'll try my best to deliver it to the palace.

55
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,100
The Book represents the public opinion.

56
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,960
Uncle Chen, It's unbelievable that you've sent underlings to steal it.

57
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,960
That's a blatant defiance against the public will.

58
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,430
I really

59
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,230
despise you!

60
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
You may rise.

61
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Haven't I

62
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,430
told you to hold on?

63
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,160
I was too impatient

64
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,160
to wait.

65
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,030
Decayed?wood?cannot?be?carved into anything.

66
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,630
You could rob them even in broad daylight,

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,560
but there shouldn't have been witnesses!

68
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,560
Right? Moran.

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,160
Anyway, don't leave any loose ends next time.

70
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,900
The youngest one Beitang

71
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
now a really grown man.

72
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,700
I did it!

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,160
It felt like a maze.

74
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,430
Which way should I go?

75
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,760
Who are you?

76
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,960
Are you that crazy singer?

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
Yeah...yeah...yeah!

78
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,960
I am the crazy singer!

79
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Prince Tang sent me here .

80
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,230
Prince Tang?

81
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,830
He asked me to give

82
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,500
His Majesty a heart-warming gift.

83
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,630
Do you have a handwritten order?

84
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,030
Token?

85
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,360
You have neither,

86
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,500
then how did you get here?

87
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,430
You must be an assassin targeting His Majesty!

88
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,560
Take her away!

89
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,830
No! No! No!

90
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,630
Look at my eyes! See the sincerity there!

91
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,960
See the sincerity there!

92
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Seriously!

93
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,230
I'm serious!

94
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,230
Put me down!

95
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,960
There is really something important this time！

96
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,360
Put me down!

97
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,430
You said the last batch of signatures

98
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,500
would be here quickly.

99
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,300
It supposed to be.

100
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,960
Could something nasty happen to Missy?

101
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,230
Are you crazy?

102
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,900
How could you leave

103
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,500
such an important thing

104
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,760
to a stranger?

105
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,230
What do you mean by stranger?

106
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,900
Missy racked brains

107
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,030
to collect the signatures

108
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,230
these three days!

109
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,160
In her mind,

110
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,560
she is on your side.

111
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,760
Brother, she's serious about it.

112
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,700
Serious?

113
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,560
It's ridiculous!

114
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,900
Put me down!

115
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,960
Shut up!

116
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,160
Put me down! I am suffering diarrhoea now!

117
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,230
I can't hold it any longer!

118
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,960
Eww! Gross!

119
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,630
Put me down quickly!

120
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,560
Put her down.

121
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,960
Plane!

122
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,030
Where's she?

123
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,300
Catch her!

124
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,830
Brother, calm down.

125
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,030
She's on her way.

126
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,760
Just a minute.

127
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,760
Calm down.

128
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Your Majesty!

129
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,760
She is coming!

130
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
She is here!

131
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,960
It's her! Brother.

132
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,430
It's her!

133
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,760
Prince Chen has come.

134
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,230
Your Majesty.

135
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,430
Prince Tang.

136
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,630
Your Majesty.

137
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Spare me the courtesy.

138
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,360
I heard that His Majesty had got the Book.

139
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,300
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

140
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Would Your Majesty do me a favor to show it?

141
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,560
Uncle Chen, it's here.

142
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,030
Would you like to make a count?

143
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,760
Fine.

144
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,160
I talked too much!

145
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Please count slowly.

146
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,500
Feifei, come here quickly!

147
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,630
I need to tell something to His Majesty

148
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,100
while they are counting.

149
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,630
You want the army leadership back,

150
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,760
the next test is the one with constellation masters.

151
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,830
A bunch of ducks are swimming under the bridge in front of the door.

152
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,360
Come here and count them.

153
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,430
Two, four, six, seven, eight.

154
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,560
Ok, I'll shut up.

155
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,630
The constellation master test,

156
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,430
a tradition in Zodiac State,

157
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,830
decrees that If the Emperor wants to recover the army leadership and

158
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,760
reign all constellation masters, he must

159
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,700
defeat the four masters of earth, water, wind and fire.

160
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,030
There are no such exciting things

161
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,300
for so long in Zodiac State.

162
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,430
I would like

163
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,560
to see battles with the four masters.

164
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,830
His Majesty represents earth,

165
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,760
and please do not be eliminated

166
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,230
in the first round.

167
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,030
Your Majesty, Prince Chen and Prince Tang.

168
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,700
We have finished it.

169
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Are there ten thousand signatures?

170
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,560
No, it's 521 signatures short.

171
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,560
521.

172
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,960
We still have time.

173
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,630
I believe His Majesty

174
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,160
can get all the signatures.

175
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,630
Signatures are coming!

176
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,560
Signatures are coming!

177
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,360
Here you go!

178
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,560
Feifei!

179
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,100
It still seems to lack a signature.

180
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,760
There are 521 signatures,

181
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,760
and I will add mine.

182
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
Enough?

183
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,230
Your signature doesn't count.

184
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,760
She's one of the dancers in Uncle Chen's mansion,

185
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,360
so she is one of the people in Zodiac State.

186
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,030
Why does her signature doesn't count?

187
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,030
Alright.

188
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,760
In that case, His Majesty have collected enough signatures,

189
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,830
and I have to prepare

190
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,030
the next test.

191
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,230
I am taking my leave.

192
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,900
Thank you, Uncle Chen.

193
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Great!

194
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,360
It's like I adore the Moon ,

195
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,630
yet the?Moon?shines on?another one.

196
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,300
Tangtang.

197
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,430
What?

198
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,700
You've worked hard these days.

199
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,960
Just did what I should do .

200
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
However, it is Missy that Your Majesty should be grateful to.

201
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,360
We couldn't have collected

202
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
the signatures so fast

203
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,700
without her.

204
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,360
What do you mean?

205
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,830
She came up the ideas

206
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,830
and worked continually these days almost without sleep .

207
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,030
Anyway, she made a lot of efforts.

208
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,160
You wouldn't be able to imagine the excitement.

209
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,160
Why people would sign it?

210
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,830
Well, the process

211
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,230
doesn't matter now as long as

212
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,500
it has ended well.

213
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,960
Anyway, Your Majesty

214
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,630
should give her some handsome rewards for her efforts.

215
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,560
Be assured, I know it.

216
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,160
You need to take some rest.

217
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,030
I would like to have a few words with her.

218
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,160
Ok. Then I am leaving, brother.

219
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,360
Who are you?

220
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,830
Why did you help me?

221
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,560
What's your purpose on earth?

222
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,230
Prince Tang.

223
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Did you see a girl run inside?

224
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,830
You mean "Miss Luo"?

225
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,830
We didn't know who she was .

226
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,300
We arrested her because she looked unfamiliar.

227
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,630
But she was so cunning

228
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,630
that she escaped.

229
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,830
Luckily, she escaped.

230
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Otherwise, it would have messed our plan.

231
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,360
Ok, I see.

232
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,500
Now stand down, all of you.

233
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,430
Yes.

234
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,360
Jiangcheng, Jiangcheng.

235
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,160
Good night.

236
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,430
Jiacheng, why are you here?

237
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,830
I haven't washed my face.

238
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,960
Why are you here?

239
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,900
Luo Feifei!

240
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,160
Such monstrous crime you have committed!

241
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,760
And now you pretend you don't remember.

242
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,230
Give it to me!

243
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,230
What made Jiacheng act crazily so early this morning?

244
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,430
Give it to me or not?

245
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,700
What are you doing?

246
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,360
I...

247
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,160
I am gonna give you some reward.

248
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,030
What's that?

249
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,230
Say it, what do you want?

250
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,160
I'll give you anything.

251
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,160
I just have a...

252
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,760
a...

253
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,830
small wish.

254
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,830
Anything you want.

255
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,360
Really?

256
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,430
Of course! Who do you think he is?

257
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,630
He's the Emperor!

258
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,360
Whether you want silks,

259
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,830
jewelries

260
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,630
or other things,

261
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,160
His Majesty can grant your wish.

262
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,560
I...

263
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,360
Just a small wish.

264
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,830
Really!

265
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,100
He will definitely keep his words.

266
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,960
Just say it.

267
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,100
OK.

268
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,160
I wanna take a shower with him in the pool

269
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,430
where we met for the first time.

270
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,030
You...

271
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,960
wanna take a shower in the morning?

272
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,230
Wait a minute!

273
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,160
Miss Luo! Miss Luo!

274
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,030
Please wait for me!

275
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,830
Why are you so slow?

276
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,760
Miss Luo, your skin is so white.

277
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,360
My skin!

278
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,360
I'm a beauty in our hospital.

279
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,230
A beauty?

280
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,230
Come here.

281
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,030
Miss Luo, this is your dress.

282
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,030
This way, please.

283
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,500
Brother, Missy is preparing.

284
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,360
Are you...

285
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,630
Can you stop talking?

286
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,960
Brother, I can see that she really likes you.

287
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,760
Why don't take a try?
