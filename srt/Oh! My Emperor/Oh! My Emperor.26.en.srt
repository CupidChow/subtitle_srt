1
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,960
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

2
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,500
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd

3
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,300
Episode 05

4
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,960
Feifei, are you okay?

5
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,160
Testimony of the witness is Shang Yu who personally experienced.

6
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,100
Physical evidence is the poisonous insect brought by Shang Yu.

7
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,400
If Grandma-Empress still doesn't trust it,

8
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Shang Yu is outside the Palace right now,

9
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,230
and you can find out by asking him.

10
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,600
You!

11
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,030
The Moral Law

12
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,960
causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler,

13
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,620
so that they will follow him

14
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,410
regardless of their lives,

15
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,130
undismayed by any danger.

16
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,800
Heaven

17
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,740
signifies day and night, cold and heat, times and seasons.

18
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,860
Your Highness.

19
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,610
Feifei,

20
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,250
what brought you here? Come in.

21
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,830
Take a seat.

22
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,610
You just healed Xifeng Lie.

23
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,300
Must be weak.

24
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,710
I will let servants prepare some tonics later

25
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,930
and send to your place.

26
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

27
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,260
No need to be courteous with me.

28
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,900
You aren't a stranger.

29
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,980
Right, we aren't strangers.

30
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,190
We are on the same side.

31
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,010
Don't know you three brothers of Beitang

32
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,680
did something wrong in the previous life,

33
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,250
so you would encounter me in this life.

34
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,600
Well, you.

35
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,080
If in that case,

36
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,460
I am willing to do it again in this life

37
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,540
in order to meet you in the next life.

38
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,540
Your Highness,

39
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,430
I am not into you.

40
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,960
I know it.

41
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,210
I know it all the time.

42
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,950
I just believe...

43
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,920
As long as I can keep you around me,

44
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,170
your heart will have a place for me sooner or later.

45
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,010
Love can't be gained by efforts.

46
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,760
You can take a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink..

47
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,360
Actually, you can pay attention to girls beside you.

48
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,010
Someone will be suitable for you.

49
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,090
But the suitable doesn't mean affection.

50
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,990
If there is no feelings, then it's more inappropriate.

51
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,900
The whole thing has been stalled for a long time.

52
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,960
I think if I still don't make it clear to you,

53
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,360
then I am really sick of myself.

54
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,320
Feifei,

55
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,250
Feifei,

56
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,260
did I bother you?

57
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,900
Yes. The better you treat me,

58
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,490
the more upset I get.

59
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,650
Okay.

60
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,370
I see.

61
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,100
In fact, I should have figured out earlier.

62
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,760
However, about the feelings...

63
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,280
It's easy to understand, but hard to let it go.

64
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,300
Forget it.

65
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,580
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,640
Feifei,

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,760
you don't have to say sorry.

68
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,490
It's just my unrequited love.

69
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,970
Just blame me for being so stubborn.

70
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,670
Your Highness,

71
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,090
I don't quite understand the poem you said.

72
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,690
But it's good you know what I mean.

73
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,230
Can I ask you for another thing?

74
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:24,930
Just say it.

75
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,480
Could you talk to Grandma-Empress about

76
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,830
canceling the wedding?

77
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,620
Nope.

78
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,000
Why?

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,150
You just said...

80
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,190
Feifei,

81
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,840
it's not the best time yet.

82
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,700
If I do the talking now,

83
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,420
it will reversely provoke her.

84
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,040
Trust me.

85
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,850
Once the best time comes,

86
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,700
I will definitely bring forward the wedding to Grandma-Empress.

87
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,130
Is it okay?

88
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,160
Your Highness,

89
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,710
you are so kind.

90
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,380
Thanks.

91
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,320
Thank you very, very much.

92
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

93
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,460
I am so nice.

94
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,960
But there is no use to be nice.

95
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,100
Even though we did that, so what?

96
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,830
But you never told me

97
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,880
their death was connected to Orion State.

98
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,480
You are also from Orion State.

99
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,480
Don't you forget your identity,

100
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,960
and the purpose why you married into Orion State.

101
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,770
Orion State was defeated ten years ago.

102
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,350
It can't happen once again.

103
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,080
Feifei, your hiccup is not good.

104
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,210
Watch me, I will demonstrate you.

105
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,500
This hiccup,

106
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,290
is short and stinky.

107
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,300
Feifei,

108
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,770
You are drunk, and you wanna keep drinking.

109
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,500
What did you say?

110
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,360
Nope.

111
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,100
You are saying I can't drink?

112
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,050
Fine, just watch me.

113
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,600
I will show you how much I can drink.

114
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,570
Okay.

115
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,830
Good.

116
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,630
Bravo, go for it.

117
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,780
I...

118
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,110
No, I can't drink any more.

119
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,390
No, I can't.

120
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

121
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,900
I am asking you.

122
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,220
Why do you like Prince Chen so much?

123
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,550
Well, Prince Chen.

124
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,690
Because he is handsome.

125
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,390
You are so superficial.

126
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,040
Superficial?

127
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,370
Then you tell me,

128
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,950
why are you so into that Dragon Egg?

129
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,390
I am superficial, too.

130
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,470
I like his prettiness.

131
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,430
Well, could he equate with Jiacheng?

132
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,430
Oh hell, no. How could him?

133
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,340
Jiacheng is gentle, kind and considerate.

134
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,980
The crucial part is that he gets talents.

135
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,120
Nothing like that annoying Dragon Egg.

136
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,240
Watch me, I am gonna imitate him. Just like this.

137
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,780
Looks like the world owes him five billion.

138
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,230
However,

139
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,640
I still like him.

140
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,210
The look of his foolishness is what I am like.

141
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,970
I, Luo Feifei,

142
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,600
make a statement here.

143
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,830
The emperor,

144
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,080
is mine.

145
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,740
Oh, no.

146
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,230
Not good, I am gonna vomit.

147
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,160
Yanran,

148
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,890
Yanran.

149
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,520
Why does the liquor taste so sickening?

150
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,090
That's right being sickening,

151
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,740
which could make the liquor taste good.

152
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,110
The liquor is spicy,

153
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,830
just like my love.

154
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,300
You tell me.

155
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,510
Your Highness is so amazing,

156
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,390
gentle and considerate.

157
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,700
What's more, he is so concentrate,

158
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,730
and never has ambition to take over power.

159
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,420
All he do is to serve your man with all his heart.

160
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,900
How could

161
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,530
such a perfect man exist in the world?

162
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,800
I like him so much.

163
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,660
Though Your Highness is perfect,

164
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,070
his world is totally different from mine.

165
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,550
I am fond of my Dragon Egg.

166
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,270
Although he is direct and dull when he talks,

167
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,420
having a regular schedule like the elders,

168
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,560
he is so cute with the look of foolishness.

169
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,150
Let's sing.

170
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,700
The vast horizon is my love.

171
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,290
At the foot of the continuous hills, flowers...

172
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,920
Yanran,

173
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,370
Are you hurt?

174
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,090
Just take care of others.

175
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,860
Come on, let's sing.

176
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,500
The vast horizon is my love.

177
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,790
At the foot of the continuous hills, cottons are blooming.

178
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,140
Yanran, it's not the time for cottons.

179
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,160
Why do you care?

180
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,360
Everything is blooming.

181
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,620
I want peach blossom and chrysanthemum bloom.

182
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,080
chrysanthemum blooms when peach blossom is blooming.

183
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,300
Well, peach blossom could bloom.

184
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,300
But it's not good for chrysanthemum to bloom.

185
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,310
Feifei,

186
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,830
You are teaching me something dirty.

187
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,860
What does that mean?

188
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,500
Who is there to peep at Your Highness showered

189
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,160
on the window?

190
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,070
Your Highness, she peeped when you were showering.

191
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,740
It's you who peeked during his shower.

192
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,420
And you said it was me.

193
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,660
You are so naughty.

194
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,700
Beat you back.

195
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,860
Uncle Chen, Yanran peeped when you were showering,

196
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,630
and you didn't notice it.

197
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,370
Seems like your kung fu is not so well.

198
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,920
I... How should I know it's her?

199
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,500
Get a room, shopkeeper.

200
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,950
Is she that female thief?

201
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,760
Here comes another strange person.

202
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,690
Not good, I have to notify the local government.

203
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,720
Dragon Egg, I am thirsty.

204
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,170
Me, too.

205
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,350
I wanna drink water. Go get me some.

206
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,520
Well, anyway, I am an emperor.

207
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,560
what's the song?

208
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,310
I have never heard this kind of song.

209
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,130
This is Jiacheng's song.

210
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:30,100
It's been on the top of Asian list for successive thirteen weeks.

211
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,130
Jiacheng?

212
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,780
Who is he?

213
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,650
Jiacheng,

214
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,910
Jiacheng

215
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,020
is my Mr. Mcdreamy.

216
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,560
He is good-looking.

217
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,480
Got talents and so handsome.

218
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,830
Do not ever mention about other guys in my presence.

219
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,110
Otherwise you will be punished.

220
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,450
But Jiacheng...

221
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,220
Uncle Chen.

222
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,650
Try to fool me?

223
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,370
Looks like I need change the way of punishment.

224
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,300
There are two suspects in my tavern.

225
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,900
The male is obscene,

226
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,860
and the female...

227
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,670
This way, please.

228
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,490
The female is drunk out of consciousness.

229
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,190
It's definitely suspicious.

230
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,520
How dare you!

231
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,740
Your Majesty.

232
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,290
Luo Feifei,

233
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,230
Get up!

234
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,730
Come on! Get out of your bed!

235
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,540
Get up!

236
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,810
Assassins! Assassins!

237
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,330
What assassins?

238
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,500
How could I get back here?

239
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,260
What are you crying about?

240
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,480
What am I crying about?!

241
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,390
You screwed me up this time.

242
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,320
What makes you behave like this?

243
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,040
What happened to me?

244
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,660
I am in this miserable situation because of you!

245
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,140
Okay, okay.

246
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,910
Go away.

247
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,430
Don't want your hug.

248
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,390
Do you know

249
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,610
Grandma-Empress

250
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,490
is asking me to enter into the Palace?

251
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,470
Go away.

252
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,200
An emperor of a state,

253
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,900
A son of Prince Ying,

254
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,700
and a daughter of Prime Minister,

255
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,780
what have you become because this wicked girl led to you?

256
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,370
Stay up,

257
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,690
booze around and night out.

258
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,940
I must teach you a lesson today.

259
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,230
Luo Feifei.

260
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,440
Grandma-Empress, I would take the punishment for her.

261
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,870
Feifei successfully cured Xifeng Lie yesterday,

262
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,690
which made all Constellation Lords relieve.

263
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,090
Drinking yesterday was only to celebrate it.

264
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,500
Please calm your anger, Grandma-Empress.

265
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,310
Please pardon our offense, Grandma-Empress.

266
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,830
It's my bad.

267
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,290
I lost female virtue,

268
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,970
and took Feifei to have a drink and have fun.

269
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,230
Please forgive Feifei, Grandma-Empress.

270
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,230
Just blame me for that.

271
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:05,970
You people.

272
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,600
Especially you,

273
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,120
You were so well-mannered, knowledgeable and reasonable,

274
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,500
who were an example of courteous ladies.

275
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,150
Now, you become coarse with this wicked girl.

276
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,610
I am aware of my guilt.

277
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,500
Just excuse Feifei, please, Grandma-Empress.

278
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,720
Yes.

279
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,450
Yes, yes. I am the wicked girl.

280
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,750
I spread fallacies to deceive people.

281
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,960
I am the reason why they become so rude.

282
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
I am the one who took them out to have fun.

283
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,700
I act on my own will.

284
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,430
Do you want to put me in prison?

285
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,000
I can go by myself. I know the road well.

286
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,690
How dare you!

287
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,140
How come you get this attitude?

288
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,150
You think I don't know

289
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,040
you have a good relationship with jailers of prison.

290
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,150
Well, I just don't let you go in there.

291
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,170
Bilian,

292
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,480
the wicked girl and Xie Yanran are yours.
