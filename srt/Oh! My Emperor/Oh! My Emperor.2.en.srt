1
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,630
Oh! My Emperor

Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd.

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 2

4
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,100
Miss, are you awake?

5
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,160
Who are you?

6
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,500
I'm your maid Xiaojiao.

7
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,830
The Prince Chen sent me to serve you.

8
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Wait, wait.

9
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,900
Serve me?

10
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,230
What is this place?

11
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,630
This is Prince Chen's mansion

12
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,830
in Zodiac State.

13
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,760
Prince Chen brought you back from the palace yesterday.

14
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,030
I'm in a show, right?

15
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,030
A reality show, right?

16
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,500
It's

17
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,230
illegal imprisonment without my permission.

18
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,030
'Cause you brought me here

19
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,830
without my permission to make a show.

20
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,830
You know that?

21
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,700
What are you talking about, Miss?

22
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,760
Were you knocked out of your mind yesterday?

23
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,300
You were.

24
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,900
You can't go.

25
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,560
Please don't put me in an awkward position.

26
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,300
Alright.

27
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,430
No way. I have to find a way to get out of here.

28
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,560
Where is my purse?

29
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,430
It's...

30
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,100
Do you mean the package?

31
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,430
OK, I'll bring it to you right away.

32
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,760
Miss, take a look.

33
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,830
Please look over them.

34
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,360
The electric baton is still here.

35
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,160
Miss!

36
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,830
What are you waiting for? Catch her!

37
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,300
What are you doing here?

38
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,960
Stop running.

39
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,630
Chase her.

40
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,300
Miss,

41
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,430
where are you going?

42
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,360
Miss, please stop.

43
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,960
Don't chase me! What's wrong with you?

44
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,700
Stop! Don't chase me.

45
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
Why are you doing this?

46
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,360
Get out the way! Out of the way!

47
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,830
Sorry, buddy.

48
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,630
I'm sorry.

49
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,700
I didn't do it on purpose.

50
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,630
I am really sorry.

51
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Do you have anything for medical treatment?

52
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,160
Bring it to me. I can treat him.

53
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,630
Let me dress your wounds, Master Fang.

54
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,760
Rise up.

55
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,160
Rise up.

56
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,160
I, as a Lord of Scorpio,

57
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,430
don't think I can't handle you little girl.

58
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,830
You, pound me again!

59
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,900
You guys here like playing so tough?

60
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,030
Cut the crap, do it now.

61
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,560
OK, you all heard him.

62
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,560
I don't want to do this,

63
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,430
but you force me.

64
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,830
You can't blame me if you don't come out of this alright.

65
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,360
I may pound you lightly.

66
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,360
I'll do it lightly.

67
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,300
Lord Fang,

68
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,360
why are you so stinky?

69
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,160
Because the flower has just been fertilized this morning.

70
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,030
Su Xunxian, I...

71
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,630
I won't forget this one.

72
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,830
People tend to remember all kinds of troubles,

73
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,230
but if you want to be carefree, you must forget them.

74
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,300
Lord Su, this girl has witchcraft.

75
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
You can't take the risk.

76
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,230
You...

77
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,030
You gave the flowerpot to me,

78
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,900
and he forced me to pound him.

79
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,900
You knew that.

80
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,960
Fortunately, it's not Bai Wuchen who has been pounded,

81
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,630
or he will commit suicide.

82
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,160
So is Lord Fang on familiar terms with you?

83
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,230
Of course he is. He came into my house

84
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,560
as bold as brass and couldn't

85
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,960
wait to find something out.

86
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,830
Whatever.

87
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,830
Dress his wounds

88
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,560
and send him back where he came from.

89
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,700
Yes.

90
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,560
You,

91
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,430
come along with me.

92
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,760
Please take a seat.

93
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,430
Feel at home.

94
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,900
Would you mind telling me your name?

95
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Luo Feifei.

96
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,160
Feifei?

97
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,900
Good name. It means allow your fancy to run wild.

98
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,300
Allow one's fancy to run wild?

99
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,160
What are you thinking about?

100
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,960
Big brother.

101
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,100
What year is it now?

102
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,500
The thirty-second year of Xingyao.

103
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,430
Xingyao...

104
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,560
I'm very good at history,

105
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,630
but I never heard this reign title before.

106
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,560
What dynasty is it now?

107
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,700
Dynasty?

108
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,500
What do you mean?

109
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,030
The dynasty means...

110
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,160
Whatever.

111
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,300
I have no time playing games with you.

112
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,560
'Cause I got more important things to do.

113
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,560
I gotta go.

114
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,560
Please wait, Miss.

115
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,230
Now that you are here,

116
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,900
why don't you eat something before you leave?

117
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,760
Don't you really know how much wage

118
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,360
will be deducted for hospital absenteeism?

119
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,760
Come on!

120
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,900
Are you really sure

121
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,100
you won't stay and eat something?

122
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,360
OK, I'll stay then.

123
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
She really has a good appetite.

124
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,360
I know you want to ask me

125
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,230
why I saved this girl.

126
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,100
My parents bore me

127
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,160
yet you know me better.

128
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,030
She is the woman I foresaw.

129
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,630
I feel that she will be closely related to

130
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,360
the fate of the future of Zodiac State.

131
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,160
Your Majesty.

132
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,960
Stand up.

133
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

134
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,430
Come here,

135
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,560
Lord Fang.

136
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,360
How is my painting?

137
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,360
I didn't find it out, please punish me, Your Majesty.

138
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Please stand up.

139
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,160
Your Majesty, you asked me to follow that girl,

140
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,760
but when I approached her,

141
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,430
my powers were completely out of control.

142
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,830
So...

143
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,700
so I...

144
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,760
You don't have to blame yourself.

145
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,300
I knew it all.

146
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,900
Go home to recuperate.

147
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,700
Thank you for your concern.

148
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,360
Then I am taking my leave.

149
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,630
Wait,

150
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,900
the painting is yours now.

151
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

152
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,700
According to what you said,

153
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,300
Uncle Chen has never met the girl before?

154
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,300
Yes.

155
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,360
Lord Fang said

156
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,160
although he did not hear much,

157
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,760
the girl was full of crazy words

158
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
and walked in a mad way.

159
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,030
According to these signs...

160
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:35,960
What?

161
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,360
The girl is probably mentally ill.

162
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,430
Wuchen.

163
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,960
Yes.

164
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,160
Pay more attention and inform me at any time.

165
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,030
Yes.

166
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,830
Where is my quail?

167
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,760
Kid.

168
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,560
Whose kid is this?

169
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,560
Stop!

170
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,030
Come back!

171
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,960
Stop here!

172
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,960
Little monkey.

173
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,030
I shouldn't have eaten that much.

174
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,900
So embarrassing to be stuck here.

175
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,030
Who are your parents, little monkey?

176
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,430
Naughty kids shouldn't be kept home.

177
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,560
Keep eating.

178
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,900
Laugh at me again?

179
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,760
Stop laughing!

180
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,960
It's such a shame to turn her loose.

181
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,700
Don't you understand that

182
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,300
give up the tiger so you can lure the snake out?

183
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,230
Then it all depends on you, General Chu.

184
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,430
Who are you?

185
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,430
Who are you?

186
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,500
How dare you kicked my ass?

187
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,230
Who are you?

188
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,160
Ophiuchus people are all disasters.

189
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,160
They should be starved to death.

190
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,630
All Ophiuchus people are beggars. Go.

191
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,630
Miss, do you want a sachet?

192
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,830
Marriage sachet.

193
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,160
What do you mean?

194
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,030
It's our Auspicious Day in Zodiac State toady.

195
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,230
It's useful to buy one

196
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,030
for your lover.

197
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,160
Buy one, Miss.

198
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,700
Is here no city management officer?

199
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,830
Sir, I won't believe your bragging.

200
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,360
Do you know how to get to the palace?

201
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,560
Thank you.

202
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,830
Please buy a sachet.

203
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,160
Please forgive me, Grand-Empress.

204
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,160
I've been too busy arranging

205
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,560
my father's books at home to come here.

206
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,560
So I got you here

207
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:54,230
Xie Yanran, the daughter of the Prime Minister of Cancer, with invisibility skill.

208
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,760
and allowed you some leisure time?

209
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,760
Right, thank you.

210
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,900
It's so annoying to get along with my

211
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,160
dad at home every day.

212
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,100
A grown girl can't be kept at home..

213
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,030
You are 16 years old now.

214
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,360
It's time to get married.

215
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,030
You and Yi grew up together so that naturally

216
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,360
there's a deep emotion between you and him.

217
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,630
Why not marry him

218
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,630
and be his queen?

219
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,230
What's wrong, Yi?

220
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,100
I was just too full.

221
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,360
Do you think I'm right?

222
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,760
I...

223
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,830
Grand-Empress,

224
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,900
I can't do that.

225
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,360
Why?

226
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,100
You don't think Yi deserves you?

227
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,160
I don't think so.

228
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,900
I don't deserve him.

229
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,560
His Majesty has just ascended the throne.

230
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,360
How can I marry him at this time?

231
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,430
I once read a book saying that

232
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,700
a good woman should let her husband focus on his enterprise.

233
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,030
If His Majesty really wants me,

234
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,760
I'll wait until his reign is solid in two years,

235
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,900
then plan on it.

236
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,230
I was really confused.

237
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,430
You're more thoughtful than I am.

238
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,030
No.

239
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,760
It's the Auspicious Day today, and it augurs well for a marriage.

240
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,560
The Grand-Empress was influenced by Heaven to deliver this will

241
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,160
to suggest it.

242
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,230
You are so smooth-tongued.

243
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,360
It's the Auspicious Day today for young people to

244
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,230
give sachets to each other

245
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,900
and forge a good marriage.

246
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,230
Alright.

247
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,830
You young people should talk more with each other.

248
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,230
Yi, take care of Yanran.

249
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,360
I'm going to the garden with Wangyan.

250
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,630
Dehai, where has Tangtang been recently?

251
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:05,100
Bei Tangtang, Prince Tang, the second prince of Pisces with replication skill.

252
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,760
Take it, handsome man.

253
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,900
Give it to me, give it to me.

254
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,760
Thanks.

255
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,560
It's weird. Why did they all give me sachets?

256
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,500
Handsome man, take my sachet.

257
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,230
This way, this way.

258
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,030
Thank you.

259
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,230
Thank you.

260
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,230
Here, here.

261
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,030
He took them all.

262
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,560
Thanks.

263
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,300
Where are you going?

264
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,230
Thank you.

265
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,760
What's wrong, Miss?

266
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,430
You took my sachet.

267
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,230
Thank you.

268
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,100
When will we get married?

269
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,560
If you think the marriage is too complicated,

270
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,100
it will be fine to consummate our marriage first.

271
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,830
Consummate?

272
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,230
Why is that?

273
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,360
You ask me why after taking my sachet?

274
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,360
This day is different.

275
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,030
Don't you know what day it is today?

276
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,630
What is it?

277
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,630
The Auspicious Day.

278
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,560
I almost forgot it.

279
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,560
It's too late.

280
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
You are my type.

281
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,430
All girls are here.

282
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,100
Choose one.

283
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,830
Wait, wait.

284
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,900
Are you going to force me

285
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,760
In bright daylight?

286
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,360
It's illegal to force a man for marriage.

287
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,960
But not today, girls,

288
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,960
take him, I don't want him anymore.

289
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,230
Don't run. Stop. Don't run.

290
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,630
Who are you?

291
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,960
Well, Prince Chen asked me to come here.

292
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,230
Prince Chen?

293
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,630
Where's the token?

294
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,030
Buddy, I forgot to bring it.

295
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,100
I will bring it next time.

296
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,760
I won't forget it next time, really!

297
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,160
Miss, we can't let you in without the token

298
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,760
even though Prince Chen did send you here.

299
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,630
Go away,go.

300
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,300
Plane!

301
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,960
Help!

302
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,160
I will hit you.

303
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,230
I'm going to make a blunt move.

304
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,430
I'm about to shift shape.

305
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,500
Let me go.

306
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,560
You four,

307
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,030
Listen,

308
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,560
I'll inform Prince Chen about this.

309
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,560
Go away.

310
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,700
Otherwise, don't blame us for getting nasty.

311
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,760
Nasty?

312
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,630
Then hit me.

313
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,960
Go ahead, go ahead.

314
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,630
What are you looking at?

315
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,700
Why is this man following me?

316
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,430
Is he a pervert?

317
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,700
No, I have to get rid of him.

318
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:50,900
Fan Shengnan, Senior General of Leo with the Roar of Lion skill.
