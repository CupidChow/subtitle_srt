1
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,600
Oh! My Emperor!

2
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,500
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd.

3
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,000
Episode 13

4
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,270
You are so pure.

5
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,270
Are you worrying about me?

6
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,750
I will give you the Constellation Service Department

7
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,970
as a reward for your treatment.

8
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,850
You will be responsible for

9
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,220
cleaning up the Constellation Palace.

10
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,820
He's really a chump.

11
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,970
Miss,you are amazing.

12
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,770
There is no lack of strength in softness in your painting,

13
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,150
and you control every detail with a brush.

14
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,550
Miss,are you painting with one of

15
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,170
108 unknown skills?

16
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,270
I no longer do that.

17
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,700
It's annoying that you're twittering all the time.

18
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,320
What happened,Miss?

19
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,450
You look really spaced-out.

20
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,000
Did that wicked girl walk over you?

21
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,770
Don't call her a wicked girl.

22
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,200
She's my friend.

23
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,120
Feifei is nice and smart,

24
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,570
and really thoughtful.

25
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,820
You can't say that.

26
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,270
Miss,you're so innocent.

27
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,270
You are the future empress.

28
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,150
She may take the emperor and replace you.

29
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,370
You should get rid of her

30
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,000
in those 108 ways.

31
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,640
I would like to.

32
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,070
What a pity.

33
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,000
If she really likes His Majesty,

34
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,350
I can ask him to accept her as a Noble Consort.

35
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,350
At least I don't hate her.

36
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,400
We can spend leisure time together.

37
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,070
Miss,

38
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,820
I think you're hopeless.

39
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,820
If master knew,he would

40
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,120
blame on me for not helping you.

41
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,120
Xiaohe,

42
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,670
Come here.

43
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,970
Tell me,

44
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,970
is there a way to

45
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,700
promote the affection

46
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,020
between men and women in one night?

47
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,950
Keeping a man and a woman in the same room, for sure.

48
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,870
In the same room?

49
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,120
Miss,

50
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,420
you finally figured it out?

51
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,920
Alright,

52
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,920
I've got a plan.

53
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:14,920
Miss.

54
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,420
So cool.

55
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,620
Finally, I don't have to squeeze into

56
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,520
the same bed with so many people.

57
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,250
I finally get rid of the small wooden bed.

58
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,400
I'm so happy.

59
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,220
You are so easy to get satisfied.

60
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,220
Miss Xie,

61
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,520
when did you come in?

62
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,170
Just now.

63
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,450
You forget my extraordinary ability is invisibility.

64
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,050
Right,invisibility.

65
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,600
Don't call me Miss Xie,

66
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,720
call me Yanran.

67
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,720
"Miss"sounds we're strangers.

68
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,570
Yanran,

69
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,950
Believe me,

70
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,370
your extraordinary ability is amazing.

71
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,250
Come and go like the wind.

72
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,970
You are free to do anything you want.

73
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,000
Not really.

74
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,300
My parents don't let me appear in pubic.

75
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,650
But I'll go hiking few days later.

76
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,150
Would you like to go with me?

77
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,320
I would like to.

78
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,650
But I'm a palace maid now,

79
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,920
I can't go out of here.

80
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,670
I will take care of everything.

81
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,400
You're really nice.

82
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,500
Yanran, where am I going with you?

83
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,220
You're going to visit

84
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,970
the most beautiful place in Zodiac State with me.

85
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,970
You'll enjoy a wonderful day.

86
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,300
It's nice.

87
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,300
I hope Dragon Egg Beitang Yi won't know it,

88
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,300
or I will lose my single room.

89
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,220
He won't know it.

90
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,220
His Majesty won't know it.

91
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,700
Well, it depends.

92
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,750
Why do you plan to go hiking?

93
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,900
Just to enjoy some fun with you.

94
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,900
Tell me what you are doing again?

95
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,420
I really just

96
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,570
want to relax with you.

97
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,900
Brother,have you ever read the Whoring Encyclopedia?

98
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:35,770
No.

99
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,420
Why are you asking that?

100
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,770
I think you need to read it.

101
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,600
Brother,

102
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,120
I want to pee there.

103
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,070
Feifei,wait for me here.

104
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,120
Where are you going?

105
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,620
I'll show you a surprise later.

106
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:46,620
Feifei.

107
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:49,970
Let's go.

108
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:50,650
OK.

109
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:57,870
Brother,

110
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,350
it's beauiful.

111
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,920
How about going there?

112
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:03,920
Alright.

113
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:05,950
You wait here.

114
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,120
Do you remember where it is?

115
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,050
It's a burrow where people used to take refuge in wartime.

116
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,150
The Prime Minister supervised the construction with all his strength.

117
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,020
So it protected so many common people.

118
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,300
Then I have to marry Yanran.

119
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,900
Brother,I know a secret.

120
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:41,750
Look at it,

121
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:44,520
look,

122
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:46,950
there.

123
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,320
Brother,why did you fall so carelessly?

124
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,970
Are you alright, brother?

125
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,600
I'll ask someone to save you.

126
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,170
Beitang Tang.

127
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,170
Tang?

128
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:05,770
Tang?

129
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,520
Go.

130
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:24,770
Here we are.

131
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,900
Xiaohe, come.

132
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,620
Miss.

133
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,050
Miss,I take it here.

134
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,050
Listen...

135
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,000
Go down there.

136
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,670
Be careful.

137
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,750
Why are you here?

138
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,520
You...

139
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,520
What?

140
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,870
Done.

141
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,600
Luo Feifei,

142
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,150
you can't do this to me

143
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,150
though you like me.

144
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,250
Do you think you can do whatever you want

145
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,250
though we're stuck here?

146
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,470
Who told you that I like you?

147
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,450
Don't flatter yourself.

148
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,150
and flaunt like a peacock spreading its tail.

149
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,150
Yanran lied to me.

150
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,370
And I think

151
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,920
you are waiting for me here on purpose.

152
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,500
What is he doing?

153
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,450
Is he doing kabe-don to me?

154
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,620
He is not good at it at all.

155
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:56,900
He is not good at it at all.
