1
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,360
Oh! My Emperor

Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co.,Ltd.

3
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,560
Episode 6

4
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,830
Brother, Missy is preparing.

5
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,960
Are you...

6
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,030
Can you stop talking?

7
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,360
Brother, I can see that she really likes you.

8
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,160
Why not take a try?

9
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,960
If you don't I'd like to take a try.

10
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,030
You guys are crazy.

11
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,030
You're still so coy.

12
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,630
If you didn't like her

13
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,230
you could have given her to me.

14
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,100
Miss Luo, It's time to change clothes.

15
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,900
Just a minute.

16
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,760
We're adults.

17
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,300
You should know.

18
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,500
OK, whatever you say.

19
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,160
After all, this is a first time experience

20
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,230
for His Majesty.

21
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:46,100
Miss Luo, please be gentle to His Majesty.

22
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,760
First time?

23
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,360
It seems his thoughts have gone awry.

24
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,230
Brother, relax.

25
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,030
Let's put it this way.

26
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,560
She likes you.

27
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,560
You are just going to help her dream come true.

28
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,960
She helped you out after all.

29
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,030
Get out.

30
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,500
All right.

31
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,360
Brother, remember she likes you.

32
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,900
Don't be afraid.

33
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,430
Be gentle.

34
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,960
Get out of here.

35
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,030
Be gentle.

36
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,960
Brother, be gentle.

37
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,960
She likes you.

38
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,760
She likes you.

39
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,160
She likes you.

40
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,030
She likes you.

41
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,630
Jiacheng, let's go home together.

42
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,030
Jiacheng,

43
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,760
Why

44
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,900
don't you answer?

45
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,630
Do I need to recover the scene?

46
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,630
Jiacheng, I want...

47
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,630
Stop thinking!

48
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,230
No, I mean I want all the people

49
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,960
that were here that day to come now.

50
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,100
Take a shower together.

51
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,960
Why?

52
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,630
I remember there were Prince Chen,

53
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,430
Eunuch Hai and...

54
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,760
What are you trying to do?

55
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,960
I just wanna...

56
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,760
Jiacheng, where's your scar?

57
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,230
Even if you like me,

58
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,430
you shouldn't be too impudent.

59
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,030
You're not Jiacheng.

60
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,830
You're not Jiacheng!

61
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,560
Who are you? What's wrong with you?

62
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,630
You are such a lovelace!

63
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,630
Liar! I want to go home!

64
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,360
I think I should have my fill first.

65
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,900
Hello.

66
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,230
It's me.

67
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,960
You! You! You!

68
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,960
You thief!

69
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,100
You haven't paid for the room.

70
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,360
How dare you come back?

71
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,160
I owe you?

72
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,500
Boss, tell you what,

73
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,160
it is a misunderstanding.

74
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,900
A big one.

75
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,630
I told you

76
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,160
I was going to take a tour,

77
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,360
and now I am back!

78
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,700
Pay it.

79
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,760
No money, I'll take you to the authority.

80
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,360
What did I tell you last time?

81
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,030
The most important thing is your health.

82
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,960
Take care of your blood pressure,

83
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,960
lung and heart.

84
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,230
Now I'll seek money for you.

85
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,030
I will soon be back with money, boss.

86
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,700
No, stop!

87
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,300
It's just job hunting.

88
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,830
I'm an adult.

89
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,360
How can I be afraid to look for a job?

90
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,830
I'll find a job.

91
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,430
These are completed products.

92
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,760
Send them to Mr Wang.

93
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,560
Hurry up!

94
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,030
Boss Li placed the order yesterday,

95
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,630
Have you finished it?

96
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,430
Look at this.

97
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,160
Niuniu, come here.

98
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,960
What's up? Mom.

99
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,030
You embroider a character "Luo" on this.

100
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,030
Go ahead.

101
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,760
Wait a minute.

102
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,630
Mom, I did it,

103
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,760
Good girl.

104
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,230
Look at this.

105
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,100
You have been embroidering from this morning,

106
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,230
and this is what you got.

107
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,100
Not even as good as a five-year-old girl.

108
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,230
Five years old?

109
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,560
It's no big deal. My work was just a bit slow and ugly.

110
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,500
Pick one.

111
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,700
Miss.

112
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,030
One day has gone, and I haven't found a job.

113
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,630
Do I have to sleep on the street?

114
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,100
Too bad.

115
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,560
Hold on! Miss.

116
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,630
You're so beautiful.

117
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
And you've been hovering around for so long.

118
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,030
Are you in some dilemma?

119
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,760
I am Yuanniang. I can help you.

120
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,560
Yes! I want a job.

121
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,100
No problem.

122
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,160
Just a job.

123
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,030
Follow me, your life necessities will be guaranteed.

124
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,830
Are you working in pyramid selling?

125
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,830
Come with me.

126
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,160
Girls, sing and dance!

127
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,160
Amazing!

128
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,700
Yoga?

129
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,560
I know how to do it.

130
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,560
There are a lot of pretty girls dancing and singing.

131
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,960
What are you doing?

132
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,300
No, I was too excited.

133
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,360
They are professionals

134
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,760
while I'm only an amateur.

135
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,430
I think the show is so good,

136
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,030
and they're so beautiful. I am going...

137
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,560
What?

138
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,100
You wanna leave?

139
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,500
Follow me upstairs obediently.

140
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Change! Change!

141
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,500
Be quick!

142
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,160
Where are you from, bumpkin girl?

143
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Your taste for clothes is so out of fashion!

144
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,500
If our dancers and singers dressed like you,

145
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,430
We would have gone bankrupt.

146
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,230
We're the top class of Donan City.

147
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,360
The competition here is fierce.

148
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,360
You need to improve

149
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,830
your professional and learning abilities.

150
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,960
Start with your demeanor.

151
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,100
What are you looking at? Go ahead!

152
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,230
Come out immediately!

153
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,630
Be quick!

154
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,230
What are you doing?

155
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,360
Smile, come here.

156
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,430
Bring me a cup of tea.

157
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,430
What are you doing?

158
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,500
Why are you so stupid?

159
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,960
You can't do anything well!

160
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,430
Do it sincerely.

161
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,360
Sit down!

162
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,760
Let me show you

163
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,830
what is professional.

164
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,230
Lordling, it's been a while!

165
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,430
Drink up this cup of tea when it's still warm.

166
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,030
Or

167
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,030
shall I feed it to you?

168
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,630
Lordling.

169
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,430
Lordling.

170
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,430
I'll drink it.

171
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,700
This tea

172
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,430
will be beneficial to your health.

173
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,160
Yuanniang.

174
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,160
Yuanniang, I'm sorry!

175
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,760
Sorry! It's my fault!

176
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,100
Yuanniang, I know I shouldn't have done this!

177
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,160
I would like to learn the next trick!

178
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,030
Yuanniang,I would like to learn the next trick!

179
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Yuanniang, we're in trouble!

180
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,630
There's a nasty guest.

181
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,900
Please come here quickly!

182
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,030
What are you shouting about!

183
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,960
Such terrible sound you made!

184
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,560
Bad singing and awful dancing!

185
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
Get out!

186
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,560
I want the most beautiful one!

187
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,900
Otherwise, I'll pull down this place!

188
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,230
What is wrong?

189
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,700
What makes our lordling

190
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,160
so angry like this?

191
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,300
Fuck off!

192
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,830
Keep in mind.

193
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,560
You have to use all the tricks

194
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,760
that I have just taught you.

195
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,360
Did you here me?

196
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,360
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

197
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,360
Hurry up!

198
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,360
Hurry up!

199
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,560
Fuck off!

200
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,360
All of you!

201
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,230
OK! You dare bully me,

202
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,630
then I'll make you regret

203
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,760
and I will destroy this place.

204
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,030
Drunkard?

205
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,760
Look at her and learn from it.

206
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,760
Fuck off!

207
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,700
This one...

208
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,100
Stop drinking!

209
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,560
Get up!

210
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,700
What is she doing?

211
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,160
You...

212
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,300
What?

213
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,160
I'm damned! I'm damned!

214
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,300
I just like this.

215
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,100
Let me go.

216
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,160
Put me down.

217
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,160
Let's get in.

218
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,300
This is terrible!

219
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,900
What do you want?

220
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,830
You will know immediately.

221
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,030
Get out of here!

222
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,500
The day for the test.

223
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,430
You old woman of Ophiuchus

224
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,160
stole my beans and wanna escape.

225
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,030
Give it to me!

226
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,430
It's mine!

227
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,230
It's mine! Give it to me!

228
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,160
You've wronged me!

229
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,960
Give it to me!

230
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,700
My beans!

231
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,430
Give it to me!

232
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,630
You wanna escape with my beans! Give it to me!

233
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,230
My beans!

234
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,830
Mine!

235
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,830
Mine!

236
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,830
You've wronged me!

237
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,760
Get off!

238
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,700
Are you okay? Granny?

239
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,630
I'm fine.

240
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,300
Miss, thank you.

241
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,360
I'm not a thief! This is mine!

242
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,360
What's wrong with you?

243
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,030
What's wrong with me?

244
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,430
You bullied an old woman in broad daylight.

245
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,360
What's wrong with you?

246
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,830
She stole my things.

247
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,760
That's it!

248
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,160
This old woman of Ophiuchus

249
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,760
keeps stealing from others. It serves her right.

250
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,030
Hit her! Kill her!

251
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,960
It serves her right.

252
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,230
You guys.

253
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,630
Have a heart,

254
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,500
Will you?

255
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,630
Can't you see she is down on the ground?

256
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,830
Why don't you lend a hand?

257
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,300
Why there are so many people?

258
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,300
They've blocked the road.

259
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,430
Follow me.

260
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,760
Do you have any sympathy?

261
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,230
The Ophiuchus people are born to be vicious.

262
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,430
It can't go wrong to keep away from them.

263
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,360
Am I right?

264
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,630
Yes! Just kill her!

265
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,900
She also stole our things!

266
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,560
Nonsense, you are lying.

267
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,230
She's the thief!

268
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:00,960
She really stole our things.

269
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,560
Let's go!

270
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,630
I didn't steal his things.

271
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Just ignore him. Let's go!

272
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,630
Stop!

273
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,230
Give me my beans!
