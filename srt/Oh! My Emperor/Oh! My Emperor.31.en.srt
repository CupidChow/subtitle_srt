00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,600
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

2
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,500
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co.,Ltd

3
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,000
Episode 10

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,200
Your Majesty, are you alright?

5
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,470
I'm fine. You may leave.

6
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,070
Yes.

7
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,600
Wait.

8
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,470
Summon Lord Luo to the palace.

9
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,500
I have something important to consult with her.

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,300
Yes.

11
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,070
Right now.

12
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,050
It's very important.

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,370
Yes.

14
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:50,820
Dragon Egg.

15
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,020
Recklessly.

16
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,350
Luo Feifei, Constellation Lord of Ophiuchus, greets Your Majesty.

17
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,700
You may rise.

18
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,100
What's the matter?

19
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,670
Summon me in a hurry.

20
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,000
I was having fun with Meimei.

21
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,870
Then you just called me.

22
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,520
Meimei?

23
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,220
Master Mei.

24
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,220
I've been hanging out with him these days.

25
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,650
We've already become best girlfriends.

26
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,050
Master Mei and you are girlfriends?

27
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,370
What's wrong with you? What is it?

28
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:37,950
I...

29
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,250
I...

30
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,700
Dragon Egg wants to see me.

31
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,570
I didn't expect that he would use this method.

Do your job and be quick.

68
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,700
A worm.

69
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,150
Go clean the candlestick.

70
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,570
To my surprise,

71
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,370
I don't expect the Black Pearl can be found in this place.

72
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,900
Perfect, a Scorpio.

73
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,570
This is the smallest card I have.

74
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,470
Bomb!

75
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,200
You win!

76
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,120
You win! You win!

77
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm the winner. Why are you so happy?

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,220
I'm happy for you.

79
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,850
Come on, come on.

80
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,170
Wait a second.

81
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,450
Any part of the body.

82
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,150
Any.

83
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,500
Any part.

84
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,650
Are we done here?

85
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,300
No.

86
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,600
This game is very funny.

87
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,270
Let's play it again.

88
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,800
Dragon Egg, you're quite impressive.

89
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,450
Pharmacist.

90
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,850
Who ask for it?

91
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,050
Miss Luo is hungry.

92
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,350
His Majesty let us to cook the parridge for her.

93
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,120
And I am about to send it to her.

94
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,320
Just leave it to me.

95
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,570
I'm going to meet His Majesty.

96
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,800
I can send it for you.

97
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,650
Thank you, Pharmacist.

98
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,950
It occurs to me that I need to go to the Qingxin Palace

99
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,720
and fetch something.

100
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,150
You go send it.

101
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Your Majesty, the porridge is for Miss Luo.

102
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,370
I know. You may leave us.

103
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm done.

104
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,970
Don't look at me.

105
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,170
The porridge...

106
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,300
You may go.

107
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,500
Your Majesty, Prince Chen and General Chu present themselves.

108
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:13,670
Your Majesty.

109
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,950
There are some new crazies in the city today.

110
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,200
New crazies?

111
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,200
Yes.

112
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,620
I've already arranged an ambush in the city.

113
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,620
Also, I've found out that

114
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,750
the new crazies have higher speed and stronger power

115
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,000
than the crazies of Ophiuchus before.

116
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,000
More importantly,

117
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,800
no one knows how they got infected.

118
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,900
As long as the source of infection is unknown,

119
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,900
the problem can't be solved.

120
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,900
Can it be...

121
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,920
Can it be the Orion State that played a dirty trick?

122
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,020
Chronicle of Xingyao has recorded that

123
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,450
people of the Orion State

124
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,950
are good at using the instrument Xun to control human beings.

125
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,400
Together with their medicines,

126
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,500
a new way of infection

127
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,870
among people can be created.

128
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,170
Thus it can spread to more areas.

129
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,700
Beitang Tang told me last time that

130
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,500
those who abducted Xifeng Lie

131
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,100
controlled others by sound.

132
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,620
This is serious.

133
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,250
We must investigate it and find out the truth.

134
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,000
Otherwise the consequence would be disastrous.

135
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,400
General Chu, find out the source of infection as soon as possible.

136
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,650
Find a solution and

137
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,650
prevent the situation from getting worse.

138
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,420
Yes.

139
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,600
Childe, you stay here and meet the courtesans.

140
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,100
Master Su went to fetch the money.

141
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,200
Yuanniang, how can I see the

142
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,670
best courtesan?

143
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,150
Can you see these curtains, Childe?

144
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,620
There is a beauty behind every curtain.

145
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,900
If you answer one question correctly, one hand will be withdrawn.

146
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,170
If you answer three questions correctly,

147
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,170
the one left will be the best courtesan.

148
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,300
All right.

149
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,270
The first question is about

150
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,620
our courtesan's surname.

151
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,520
Grass has it while wood doesn't have it.

152
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,050
The character of strength has two hands.

153
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,520
Grass has it while wood doesn't have it.

154
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,070
The character of strength has two hands.

155
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,450
The surname is Su.

156
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,470
Second one.

157
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,750
There is a flower on the inch of the hill.

158
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,070
There is a mouth in the door and the timber in the mortise.

159
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,620
Are you talking about the "Sex Encyclopedia"?

160
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,920
How can a Childe at your age

161
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,920
read about this kind of book?

162
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,220
What a rich experience!

163
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,970
Yuanniang, you got me wrong.

164
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,870
The book was given by your boss,

165
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,520
Master Su without asking me.

166
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,870
And he also gave me book 2 to book 5 of "Sex Encyclopedia".

167
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,420
I didn't take them.

168
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,100
Then let's move to the final question,

169
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,470
which is about the name of our courtesan.

170
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:17,150
There is an unknown person outside the mountain.

171
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,050
It's Xian.

172
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,200
Su Xunxian.

173
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,950
I'm the best courtesan.

174
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,120
How are you?

175
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,270
Did the Imperial Health Institute find the new antidote?

176
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:56,650
Your Majesty.

177
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,050
Those doctors

178
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,000
are trying their best to develop the antidote.

179
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,920
It is what it is.

180
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,820
Now we can only let Feifei lead her Ophiuchus people

181
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,100
to cure the crazies.

182
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:39,870
Your Majesty!

183
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,200
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

184
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,170
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

185
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,620
Prince Chen, His Majesty is having the similar symptom

186
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,900
like the crazies before they get mad.

187
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,420
Your Majesty, listen to me.

188
00:13:59,520 --> 00:13:59,970
Your Majesty!

189
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,150
Please don't be controlled by it.

190
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,720
Be sober!

191
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,400
Tie me up. Just tie me up.

192
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:20,950
What's wrong?

193
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,200
What's wrong with my brother?

194
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,500
His Majesty was infected with the crazies virus.

195
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,000
He asked me to tie him up when he was conscious

196
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,450
so that he wouldn't hurt others.

197
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,250
Feifei, how is he?

198
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,000
The infection is serious.

199
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,120
I'm not really able to resist this power.

200
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,100
Feifei,

201
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,750
your hand...

202
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,650
I'm fine.

203
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm fine.

204
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,050
Beitang Tang, you stay here.

205
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,570
I will go and report to Grandma-Empress.

206
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,550
Alright.

207
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,350
Shengnan, let's go.

208
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,370
Missy, what's the matter with my brother?

209
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,350
It's alright.

210
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,070
Now I've slowed down the

211
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,150
spread of the poison.

212
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,450
When my clansmen arrive, everything will be alright.

213
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,120
Shang Yu and Xifeng Lie

214
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,320
have already set off to notice the Ophiuchus Village.

215
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,320
But I think

216
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
they can't arrive here until tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

217
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,220
The new infected people are going crazy one after another.

218
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,220
What should we do?

219
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,620
Prince Tang, Pharmacist Bilian is here.

220
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,750
Bilian?

221
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,200
What is she doing here?

222
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,200
I've heared that Grandma-Empress

223
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,850
trusted Bilian's medical skill very much.

224
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,070
I think it's Grandma-Empress who sends her here.

225
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,750
Her medical skill?

226
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,320
I will go and drive her away.

227
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,070
Lord Luo is questioning the Imperial Health Institute.

228
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,970
How can the whole Imperial Health Institute

229
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,420
cannot compare with you, the little female doctor

230
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,220
who only serves several days?

231
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,970
Besides, I'm here as the Imperial doctor

232
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,220
by Grandma-Empress's Imperial decree.

233
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,550
Luo Feifei, you held me back several times.

234
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,700
Do you have any complaints

235
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,800
about Grandma-Empress's decree?

236
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:13,970
I do.

237
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,600
You're right.

238
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,020
Good. Then I will go report to Grandma-Empress

239
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,100
that Luo Feifei is questioning the Grandma-Empress

240
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,970
without concerning for His Majesty's health.

241
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,720
And she hindered my treatment to the Emperor.

242
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,550
Wait.

243
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,470
Lord Luo said right word. Actually what she said is impossible.

244
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,450
Grandma-Empress is the wisest.

245
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,550
Please save my brother's life, Pharmacist.

246
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,670
Big white tooth, you're mad.

247
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,370
What are you doing, Big white tooth?

248
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,770
She even doesn't know how to bind up. Why do you keep her?

249
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,470
Stupid!

250
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,150
You can keep an eye on her when she does her job.

251
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,050
If she fails, you can take over.

252
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,650
I don't like to have others around during my treatment.

253
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,870
So Prince Tang and Lord Luo,

254
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,000
you two should have a rest.

255
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,170
I managed to control his poison.

256
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,520
If you use the wrong medicine,

257
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,850
ten clansmen of mine can't save him.

258
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,820
Can you take the responsibility for that?

259
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,250
I'm not leaving.

260
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,420
Alright.

261
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,120
If the Emperor's health is harmed

262
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,600
and Grandma-Empress knows that

263
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,750
it's you, Luo Feifei, who are impeding the treatment,

264
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,420
Can you take

265
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,000
this responsibility for an offence?

266
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,370
Pharmacist,

267
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,620
you're really Grandma-Empress's favorite.

268
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,800
Not only the Constellation Lord but also I, the prince,

269
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,800
should listen to your order.

270
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,450
If I execute you today,

271
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,920
do you think I can take this

272
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,600
responsibility for an offence

273
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,470
or not?

274
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,100
All right.

275
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,100
I will leave.

276
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,100
Bilian, I'm telling you

277
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,100
do cure His Majesty attentively.

278
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,250
Don't move anything

279
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,470
except the handkerchief for cooling.

280
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,350
Don't touch anything.

281
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,100
You understand?

282
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,070
Listen to me,

283
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,670
if you dare to overdo it,

284
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,270
you will suffer pain much worse than death.

285
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,850
See Prince Tang off.

286
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,620
Thank you, Eunuch Hai.

287
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,450
This is my duty.

288
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,920
I will wait for the call at the back of the palace.

289
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,720
Big white tooth,

290
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,720
you were quite handsome just now.

291
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:13,820
Cheer for you.

292
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,170
My brother even hits himself when he goes mad.

293
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,800
If Bilian wants to mess about,

294
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,220
she just shames herself.

295
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,220
I don't like her anyway.

296
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,800
Isn't she just counting on...

297
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:27,370
Uncle Chen.

298
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,670
How's His Majesty?

299
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,350
He is resting inside.

300
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,550
I've already used my power

301
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,850
to slow down the spread of poison.

302
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,770
And at the Taurus o'clock,

303
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,450
I should use the power to relieve it again.

304
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:41,650
Now in the imperial palace,

305
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,400
there are many imperial servants who have the same symptom.

306
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,420
There is chaos outside the city too.

307
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,070
Something must be terribly wrong.

308
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,620
It seems that we should solve the problem of the crazies as soon as possible.

309
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,420
The person who poisoned others is so low-key without any trace.

310
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,720
Right under our nose,

311
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,950
the virus is spreading to such large area.

312
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,200
It must be plotted for a long time.

313
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,600
If there is a riot at this moment,

314
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,200
we all will be in danger.

315
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Right.

316
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,150
Chongchong.

317
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,220
Sister.

318
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,850
Your Highness, Lord Luo,

319
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,620
Xifeng Lie and those Ophiuchus people

320
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,800
are on their way here.

321
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,350
I take Chongchong back here first.

322
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,900
You did a good job.

323
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,400
I would like to go inside and check His Majesty first.

324
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,620
Uncle Chen, Bilian is inside.

325
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,120
Imperial decree from the Grandma-Empress said that

326
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,770
Bilian should cure the Emperor.

327
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,670
At this crucial moment,

328
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,670
how can Bilian still want to come here and make a mess?

329
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,820
What if something goes wrong?

330
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,470
She dares not to do anything harmful.

331
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,020
Miss Big eater,

332
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,000
what should we do now?

333
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,750
The priority now

334
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,300
is to find out the source of infection.

335
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,550
Shang Yu, issue my decree.

336
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,170
Command everyone to find the source of infection.

337
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,920
Must be careful.

338
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:03,800
Yes.

339
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,920
There are some clues that can not only be found by people.

340
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,920
I will also dispatch all the birds and insects

341
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,000
to help the investigation.

342
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,750
Hope we can find a new clue this time.

343
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,750
I can go too.

344
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,620
I know well about all the dogholes and shortcuts in the city.

345
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,750
Maybe I can help.

346
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,220
If you have any news,

347
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,350
let me know first.

348
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,000
We will go back to the palace and discuss it in the afternoon.

349
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,770
Be safe.
