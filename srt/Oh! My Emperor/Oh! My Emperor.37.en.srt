1
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,360
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

2
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,630
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,560
Episode 16

4
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,830
Lord Luo,

5
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,230
what a clever and ruthless trick.

6
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,160
Seems like Grandma-Empress doesn't dare to

7
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,160
bother you for a while.

8
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,500
I really don't know she can't eat fish.

9
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,430
What's our meeting about today?

10
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,360
Today...

11
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,700
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,300
Today is...

13
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,500
Did my words make you feel so disgusted?

14
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
Shengnan is pregnant.

15
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,360
Pregnant?

16
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,630
Whose child?

17
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,560
No!

18
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,500
Everyone keeps this matter under your hat,

19
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,030
otherwise people will laugh at me.

20
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,830
Dali,

21
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,230
you yell too loud.

22
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,960
Everyone knows now.

23
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,960
I don't care.

24
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,360
If you dare to spread it out...

25
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,230
In my opinion,

26
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,430
nowadays the best way

27
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,300
is respectfully asking Your Majesty to bestow marriage to you.

28
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,760
You two should get married as soon as possible.

29
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,700
Aye, brother.

30
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,430
There has been no happy events in the Palace for a long time.

31
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,830
Xia Bing and I are also getting there.

32
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,430
Why don't we

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,500
hold a wedding together, for six?

34
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,430
I have been restless recently,

35
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,430
and I am afraid of something big is gonna happen.

36
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,430
What do you mean?

37
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,360
That is...

38
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Wangyan has followed Grandma-Empress for many years.

39
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,360
Grandma-Empress is merciful to pay a special visit to him.

40
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
Don't talk about it to others,

41
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,230
in case of causing rumours

42
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,300
and result in some unnecessary trouble. Do you understand?

43
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,630
Aye.

44
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,830
You all may retreat.

45
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,630
You are finally here.

46
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,630
Not watching me die,

47
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,700
undoubtedly, you can't rest your heart.

48
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,300
Without watching you die,

49
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,960
my whole heart always keeps hanging.

50
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,630
You have stayed in the Palace for ages.

51
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,160
It's quite rare for you to be so honest.

52
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,160
This slap,

53
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,160
I did it for my dead son.

54
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,760
I laboriously did a distant marriage for the Orion State,

55
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,560
and climbed the position of Grandma-Empress step by step.

56
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,960
I gave priority to all honors and disgraces of the Orion State.

57
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,360
And you promised me you would never hurt my family,

58
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,960
but in order to eliminate Ophiuchus

59
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,700
which is the most serious threat to you,

60
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,160
you harmed my flesh and blood.

61
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,030
If Luo Feifei and others didn't discover clues,

62
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,900
I would not know till now.

63
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,560
Now, you wanna hurt my grandson again.

64
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,630
How could I stand to let you be alive?

65
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,630
I told you earlier,

66
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,630
they shouldn't even be born in this world.

67
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,560
If it's not me,

68
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,160
you didn't get a chance to be in position of Grandma-Empress

69
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,230
and enjoyed a rich and splendid life for most of your life.

70
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,760
Grandma-Empress,

71
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,830
being a Grandma-Empress is never what I want.

72
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,300
You planned all,

73
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,830
and I was merely a pawn in your plans.

74
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,630
A tool.

75
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,630
So-called a rich and splendid life you mentioned,

76
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,500
I don't give a damn.

77
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,500
Until one day,

78
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,630
my kid was born.

79
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,900
That's when I felt happy about being a person.

80
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,900
But you ruined them mercilessly.

81
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,160
From now on,

82
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,830
I will decide the road by myself

83
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,700
about how to be a Grandma-Empress of the Zodiac State.

84
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,430
Decide by yourself?

85
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,230
Pipe dream.

86
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,360
It's just a part of the big plan.

87
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,960
Soon you will witness personally

88
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,100
the destruction of the Zodiac State.

89
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,230
By then, your descendants

90
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,430
must be beyond redemption.

91
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,960
What exactly are you trying to do?

92
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,830
I will bury these secrets into the dirt with me.

93
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,030
You are just waiting for your descendants

94
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,030
to be buried with me.

95
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,360
Say it clearly!

96
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,760
Guards.

97
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,500
Come on, guards.

98
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,560
Are you okay, Grandma-Empress?

99
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,760
I am fine.

100
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,700
This one just did a deathbed struggle.

101
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,230
I have already subdued him.

102
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,630
Pull him out quickly.

103
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,230
The date of wedding will be scheduled in 8th of the next month,

104
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,700
and I hope to get Grandma-Empress's permission.

105
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,100
Good, that's okay.

106
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,760
Thank you, Grandma-Empress.

107
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,760
Well, Feifei,

108
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,030
The more time I spend observing you, the more I like you.

109
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,630
Smart and clever.

110
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,030
And I heard that

111
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,960
people in Palace all said dumplings made by you are popular.

112
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,500
When you are free and come here to do some,

113
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,430
I would like to have a taste.

114
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Grandma-Empress, you ate that dumpling last time...

115
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,100
I am tired today,

116
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,760
so I am not gonna to ask you to stay here to have dinner.

117
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,630
Don't save money when it comes to things about wedding.

118
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,430
If you need something by then,

119
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
just send someone to get it.

120
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,630
I know, and I won't be so courteous with you.

121
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,160
Then take a rest, Grandma-Empress.

122
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,300
We may retreat.

123
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
With no doubt, I will prepare a great present

124
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,700
to make you unforgettable forever.

125
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,630
Dragon Egg,

126
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,830
How I wish the time just stopped in this moment.

127
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,030
Why?

128
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,160
Because I feel so happy.

129
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,230
Dragon Egg,

130
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,630
don't you think Grandma-Empress

131
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,160
has been a little weird recently?

132
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,760
Weird?

133
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,760
You think that she being nice to you is strange?

134
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,030
Of course not.

135
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,100
After I did lots of things for her,

136
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,300
if she behaves like usual...

137
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,960
Even stones could be touched by me.

138
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,430
I mean, she is allergic to flesh meat.

139
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,630
But she said she still wanna try my dumplings.

140
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,030
Probably,

141
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,300
Grandma-Empress is aged,

142
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,430
and remembers wrongly.

143
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,430
It could happen.

144
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,500
This little wooden horse is kind of cute,

145
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,360
but it's not as spirited as

146
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,630
horses in the desert.

147
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,100
You have a great mood today.

148
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,100
Just bored.

149
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,500
Miss home?

150
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,700
Nope.

151
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,360
Try to deny it.

152
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,630
I usually like to have fun outside.

153
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,900
But no matter how far I go, I always like to come home.

154
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,830
Because even though there is much fun outside,

155
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,230
it can't be as cozy as home.

156
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
You must think so, right?

157
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,900
Anyway, you are just a girl

158
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
who is in a place which you rarely know,

159
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,830
no wonder you will miss your hometown.

160
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,830
To be honest,

161
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,230
I am kind of missing the days when I am in the desert.

162
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,830
So you also think the Orion State is better than the Zodiac State?

163
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,430
I didn't say that.

164
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,430
Just missing those days.

165
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,100
You were there in that time,

166
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,360
that's why I feel happy.

167
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,900
Speaking of good,

168
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,300
The Zodiac State is definitely better.

169
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,960
Eat well, sleep well.

170
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,030
Nothing like your place.

171
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,900
So brutal and wild.

172
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,830
The people from my hometown,

173
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,700
the boys and girls in there,

174
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,960
they all are straightforward.

175
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,430
Not like your people here.

176
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,700
Being bashful and timid,

177
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,700
and always behaving cautiously.

178
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,230
Nothing is better than us.

179
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,300
Okay, okay okay.

180
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,230
Let's not talk about these.

181
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,960
The important thing is that we are going to get married.

182
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,630
In the future, we

183
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,630
just ignore things about the Zodiac State

184
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,900
or the Orion State.

185
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,900
We just need to live our life well.

186
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,430
That's real good.

187
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,360
Our life.

188
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,500
Then we are...

189
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,830
You are here.

190
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,430
All my things belong to you.

191
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,100
Your things are still yours.

192
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,360
My relatives are yours,

193
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,160
and my friends are yours, too.

194
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,030
They will treat you well as they treat me.

195
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,430
If you feel lonely,

196
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,360
I will stay with you every day.

197
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,030
Take you to play something interesting,

198
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,960
and eat delicious food.

199
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,760
After a couple of years,

200
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,960
we will have some kids.

201
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,760
If you still miss home by then,

202
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,630
we will take our children

203
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,760
to go back and take a look. Is it okay?

204
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,160
A couple of years.

205
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,430
Kids.

206
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,560
No idea our kids will look like whom.

207
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,030
No, what am I thinking? So crazy.

208
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,430
What's wrong?

209
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,560
You think it's too slow, don't you?

210
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,300
We can make it happen more quickly.

211
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,030
Have two kids in one year.

212
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,500
Bai Wuchen has already been a dad.

213
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,100
We can't lose.

214
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,830
What are you thinking about?

215
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,030
Bingbing.

216
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,230
Bingbing.

217
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,030
How about we...

218
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,100
What are you doing?

219
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,760
Okay, I won't mess around.

220
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,030
Let me take you to play the wooden horse.

221
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,500
What fun is that?

222
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,430
It can't run.

223
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,560
Said by whom?

224
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,560
Are you ready?

225
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,560
It's running.

226
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,030
Running.

227
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,230
Do you want to go faster?

228
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,300
Here we go.

229
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,360
Why do you come here?

230
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
I told them to come.

231
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,230
Take a seat please, everyone.

232
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,760
Sit down please.

233
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,760
Come on, Dali.

234
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,160
Grandma-Empress has allowed,

235
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,630
in 8th of the next month,

236
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,430
Prince Tang and I are gonna get married together.

237
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,230
What requirements do you have?

238
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,360
Just tell Master Mei.

239
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,560
Four...Four people together.

240
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Lord Luo,

241
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,160
The national treasury is kind of empty.

242
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,830
Ask less requirements, please.

243
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,160
I only have one wedding,

244
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,030
so I must give Feifei the best.

245
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
One wedding.

246
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,560
Your Majesty, you will have other consorts.

247
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,360
Feifei has a good appetite.

248
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,360
That's enough I have her.

249
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,560
What a couple for a life.

250
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,360
How could you put your feelings in two places.

251
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,960
For the sake of

252
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,630
Your Majesty will only marry Luo Feifei,

253
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,900
The half of wedding's expense

254
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,560
are given by me.

255
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,560
So generous, Master Su.

256
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,960
Why are you so quiet today, General Chu?

257
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,760
I made a promise to my man, Bai,

258
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,230
that is to be a gentle lady.

259
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,500
Dali,

260
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,100
I am saying to be a gentle lady.

261
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,830
Does Dali sound like a gentle lady? Don't call me that again.

262
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Then how should we call you?

263
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,300
You can call me Shengsheng or Nannan,

264
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,700
or Chuchu. All good.

265
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,630
You can't stand yourself any more, can you?

266
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,830
Xifeng Lie, you are risking your neck.

267
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,560
Nannan.

268
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,300
Even if you wanna die,

269
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,430
I can't give you what you want.

270
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,300
I am gonna a good wife and mom.

271
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,960
You can make a miracle, Dali.

272
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,430
Nannan.

273
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,630
Bai, they are making fun of me again.

274
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,960
Your Majesty,

275
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,960
Nannan and I have already discussed

276
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
that we aren't gonna hold a wedding.

277
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,100
Nannan is shy,

278
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,760
and afraid of people gossiping.

279
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,560
We plan to make a sightseeing tour.

280
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,630
After the kid is born,

281
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
then we will hold a wedding.

282
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,030
A wedding tour.

283
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,700
Sounds so amazing.

284
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,630
Dragon Egg, let's do that, too.

285
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,560
In that case,

286
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,630
just turn the money of Master Su

287
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,360
in the national treasury.

288
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Uh, it doesn't make sense.

289
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,560
After all,

290
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,630
I still want to give you the best wedding.

291
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,430
All right. Let's hold a wedding.

292
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,100
Do you know where Big white tooth has been recently?

293
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Prince Tang,

294
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,230
he is quite busy now.

295
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,300
The tender place is where one couldn't get out quickly.

296
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,230
Though the national treasury is kind of empty,

297
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,830
Your Majesty has a order that

298
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,700
betrothal gifts aren't allowed to economize.

299
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,160
So,

300
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,430
I took something precious out of the national treasury.

301
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,960
Lord Luo,

302
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,360
take a look, Lord Luo.

303
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,760
Come on.

304
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,030
It was produced from the Aolai State in East China Sea.

305
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,300
After wearing it,

306
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,100
you will be able to prolong life and have a forever-young look.

307
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,960
I know the Aolai State.

308
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,360
It's where Monkey Sun jumped.

309
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,160
Who is Monkey Sun?

310
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,560
Doesn't matter.

311
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:08,960
Just look at...

312
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,360
Next one, next.

313
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,900
It's invulnerable, and has uninterrupted success.

314
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,430
This writing,

315
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,900
is the work of Master Wang.

316
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,030
All delicious foods of the capital are here.

317
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,160
What do you think?

318
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,500
It's good. Really good.

319
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,630
Thank you, Master Su.

320
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,160
What do you want me for?

321
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,160
I came to you

322
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,230
for our wedding, with no doubt.

323
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,030
I told you,

324
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,630
we are gonna hold a wedding with brother's together.

325
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,700
My sister-in-law is preparing.

326
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,900
Why don't you feel anxious?

327
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,630
Our marriage is united by two states.

328
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Does it make a difference whether I care or not?

329
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,030
Bingbing, all I wanna do is giving you the best.

330
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,360
So sweet.

331
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,760
I take a compliment from you

332
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
for the first time.

333
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,760
Hold on, don't change the subject.

334
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,160
The marriage between us

335
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,960
is just a tool for diplomatic relations of two countries.

336
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,360
Is that your real thought?

337
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,500
On the contrary, I really appreciate this diplomatic relations of two countries.

338
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,630
That's how I can marry you.

339
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
And I know

340
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,830
I have a place in your heart.

341
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,430
So how could we

342
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,560
be only a tool for diplomatic relations of two countries?

343
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,760
Okay.

344
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,560
Did you say all you wanted to say?

345
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,760
Then I will go back first.

346
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,030
Bingbing.

347
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,230
That I can get married with you,

348
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,360
makes me indeed joyful.
