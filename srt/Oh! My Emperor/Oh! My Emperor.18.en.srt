1
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,360
Oh! My Emperor

2
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,500
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd.

3
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,560
Episode 18

4
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,160
Search carefully!

5
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,430
Hurry up.

6
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
Xifeng Lie.

7
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,630
Hurry up.

8
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,560
Never miss any details.

9
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,160
Why did we make them all the way here

10
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,230
and make

11
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,430
them take medicine

12
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,030
This is about our big plan.

13
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,160
We want to trigger the war between

14
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,830
ophiuchus and other constellation.

15
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,100
We can gain from the war.

16
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,430
If you don't understand, stop asking.

17
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,030
I need to go to the toilet.

18
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,960
Wait a moment.

19
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,100
I need to go with you.

20
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,500
Watch them.

21
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,630
Sure.

22
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,760
Xifeng Lie, Xifeng Lie, Xifeng Lie.

23
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,160
Xifeng Lie.

24
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,560
That's a relief.

25
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Report to Your Highness.

26
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,760
We couldn't find anything suspecious.

27
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,500
Couldn't find anything suspecious?

28
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,230
Right now,

29
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,830
no news is good news.

30
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,830
Why did you fall asleep?

31
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,760
Wake them up and set off.

32
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,030
Let's go find some food.

33
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,030
Hey you! Watch them!

34
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,630
I can take advantage of this opportunity

35
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,300
and take Xifeng Lie away.

36
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,900
How about that body?

37
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,430
Relax, it will be eaten by the wolves.

38
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,630
Free food for those beasts.

39
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,230
Let's go back to Orion State.

40
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,630
Come on.

41
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,700
Feifei.

42
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,230
Feifei.

43
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,230
You have to tell me why you are angry.

44
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,160
I just

45
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,960
I just think

46
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,360
some guy flirting with other women is annoying

47
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,230
Flirting with other women? What are you saying?

48
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,630
If you did that, you should admit it.

49
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,430
Although it's been a while,

50
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,700
I saw what you did with Bilian

51
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,560
in that room the other day.

52
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,430
Some physical contacts.

53
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,030
That's what you are angry about.

54
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,160
Please let me explain.

55
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,560
I don't need your explaination.

56
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,630
Fine.

57
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,430
Hurry up and talk!

58
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,160
There is nothing between us.

59
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,030
Bilian is the Major Pharmacist of Zodiac State

60
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,230
and Grandma-Empress' favorite.

61
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,830
Grandma-Empress did mention that

62
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,360
she want me to marry her.

63
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,100
But I turned her down.

64
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,160
She is coming on to you.

65
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,630
How can you turn her down?

66
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,230
I had seen enough women who is prettier

67
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,560
than you and her.

68
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,430
Like Xie Yanran.

69
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,160
She comes from a rich family,

70
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,430
and is prettier than you.

71
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,500
But I never

72
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,360
ever like her.

73
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,430
You are the only one.

74
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,760
Say it.

75
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,030
I only fall in love with you at first sight.

76
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,830
Are there any advantages

77
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,760
I have compared with them?

78
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,160
When it comes to knowledge,

79
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,430
You can't even write down your name.

80
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,630
When it comes to appearance,

81
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,030
you have nothing special.

82
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,830
When it comes to figure,

83
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,300
you are not

84
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,160
Just eat this!

85
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,030
Give me that.

86
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,900
Lonely night,

87
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,760
only this corn cob is with me.

88
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,500
Yanran, what are you doing?

89
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,760
You are trying to scare me?

90
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,500
Did you forget about me?

91
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,830
You never play with me.

92
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,630
It's just, I'm afraid you are still mad at me.

93
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,030
Last time when

94
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,100
We can't talk here.

95
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,360
Why don't we go to your room?

96
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
What happened with you?

97
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,560
At yesterday's Constellation Lord Conference,

98
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,760
Your Majesty want to have tournament with Lord Chen.

99
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,230
I'm the essential vote.

100
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,960
Then?

101
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,430
Then I vote for Your Majesty.

102
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,360
You did the right thing.

103
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,700
You will be the queen someday.

104
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,430
No, it's not.

105
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,960
If Prince win without a fight,

106
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,300
Your Majesty will lose the Military Power,

107
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,560
Then I will have to marry the emperor.

108
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
But I vote for Your Majesty,

109
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,030
I don't know how to deal with Prince after this.

110
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,230
I'm upset.

111
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,560
Feifei, you have to help me.

112
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,100
Or our friendship will be over.

113
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,430
Don't get upset.

114
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,100
It's the military power they are fighting for.

115
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,100
Thay don't really care about who you will marry.

116
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,500
I'm just a maid working in Service Department.

117
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,500
I can't help you.

118
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,630
But relax,

119
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,830
if you need me,

120
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,960
I'm here for you.

121
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,630
I will find a way myself.

122
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,430
I'm the most talented girl in Zodiac State.

123
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,760
You are right.

124
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,700
If the most talented girl in Zodiac State can't find a way,

125
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,030
how can I?

126
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,830
I'm the play who can't see the game.

127
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,830
You are an outsider, think for me.

128
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,360
No, I'm also a player.

129
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,540
You are right.

130
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,830
Both of them like you.

131
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,960
You know I don't like Prince.

132
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,430
Okay, you overthink my words.

133
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,430
I'm not mad at you.

134
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,230
I'm just upset.

135
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,760
You are kind enough.

136
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,360
If this happened in our department,

137
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,030
those girls will fight against me, literally.

138
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:21,900
I'm telling you the truth.

139
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,360
How to make Prince Chen fall in love with me?

140
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,360
Follow me.

141
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,900
Mr. Zhao, please come in.

142
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,030
Xiaohong, serve him.

143
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,830
Isn't this Miss Feifei?

144
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,160
What? Do you want to work for me?

145
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,160
Of course not.

146
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,700
We are here to play.

147
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,560
Let's go.

148
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,360
Miss Feifei,

149
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,830
We Hongluan Brothels are not for you females.

150
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,560
Feifei, this is Hongluan Brothels?

151
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,630
Book says it's

152
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,830
inappropriate for a daughter of an eminent family.

153
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,700
We are leaving.

154
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,100
Let's go.

155
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,100
Don't consider yourself as a daughter of an eminent family.

156
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,830
How about your Prince.

157
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,760
Show her the money.

158
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,560
Why are you here if you don't have the money.

159
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,360
Give it to me.

160
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,760
What if we have money?

161
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,160
Of course.

162
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,630
Miss, please come in.

163
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,230
Xiaohong and Xiaoju, show them what you can do.

164
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,430
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

165
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,630
Feifei.

166
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,700
They are the help you can get?

167
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,360
Are you sure?

168
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,230
Are you sure?

169
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,630
I'm sure.

170
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,300
Let me tell you what.

171
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,560
Every missy here

172
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,430
can teach you how to chase Prince.

173
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,960
Chase Prince. You want that, don't you?

174
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,360
Chase?

175
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,030
But it's not as easy as making tea.

176
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,360
I can understand.

177
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,160
You are saying

178
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,960
chasing men is just like making tea.

179
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,360
You have to make sure the temperature and timing.

180
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,430
Then you can capture their hearts.

181
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,030
And taste them

182
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,160
and smell them, isn't it?

183
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,160
You are awesome, Yanran.

184
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,230
Your interpretation is awesome.

185
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,030
You are awesome.

186
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,830
Missies, come on.

187
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,760
Come on.

188
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,630
Take her away.

189
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,430
Teach her well.

190
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
No, no. no.

191
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,760
Let's teach her.

192
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,760
We will make sure you learn well.

193
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Yuanniang, Yuanniang.

194
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,030
Yes?

195
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,230
Ask those two men to come here.

196
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,500
They are guests.

197
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,430
They can share the table with us.

198
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
My back hurts.

199
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,030
Misses,

200
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,230
goodbye and take care.

201
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,560
Yanran.

202
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,160
How poor I am.

203
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,030
Within one universe and eight signs,

204
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,630
I transfer to another era

205
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,760
and fall in love with a capricorn nerd.

206
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,960
What are you talking about?

207
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,230
Your Majesty never gets close to a women.

208
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,430
But he only likes you.

209
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,030
Why can't you be satisfied?

210
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,100
No, you are teaching me

211
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,700
how to make Prince fall in love with you.

212
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,560
Why are we talking about you again?

213
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,500
Yanran,

214
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,960
How poor you are.

215
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,830
Do you know,

216
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,230
aquarius people is much better to a friend than to their love.

217
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,700
Yanran, how poor you are.

218
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,830
But I, as a ordinary person,

219
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,230
can never ever understand aquarius.

220
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,160
Go for it!

221
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,560
Go for it!

222
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,960
Go for it!

223
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,500
Go home!

224
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,230
Soldiers,

225
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
we have less than three days

226
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,160
before the tournament.

227
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,900
Each of you

228
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,230
are essential

229
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,760
in this tournament.

230
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,760
Do you have faith?

231
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,830
Yes!

232
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,160
Do you have faith?

233
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,230
Yes!

234
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,160
Good, very good.

235
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,960
Wrap up the head of the spear with cloth.

236
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Don't hurt anyone in the tournament.

237
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,900
Good.

238
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,700
Don't use too much cloth, it's expensive.

239
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,760
When you finished,

240
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,360
go find the basin and apply the powder on your spear.

241
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,030
Don't apply too much powder.

242
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,960
I'm paying for that.

243
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,830
Apply the powder on your spear when you are finished.
