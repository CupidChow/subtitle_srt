Episode 13

4
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,030
Things are not well. Feifei, she...

5
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,160
The Missy.

6
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,960
Feifei, she...

7
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,430
No, no, no.

8
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,160
Get away.

9
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,030
No, no, no.

10
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,700
What are you doing?

11
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,900
Don't go there.

12
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,300
What are you going to do?

13
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,500
Feifei is well now,

14
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,230
she played a joke

15
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,100
to strengthen her relationship with the emperor.

16
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,830
I spilled the beans.

17
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,100
Feifei,

18
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,900
Feifei,

19
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,560
Feifei,

20
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,760
Feifei.

21
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,700
Your Majesty, you can't do this any more,

22
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,300
you're torturing her to death.

23
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,560
Right, there's no point in shaking her.

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,560
I've been told pain could refresh people,

25
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,230
or, you can hit her

26
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,900
with strength.

27
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,560
No, more.

28
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,960
Your Majesty,

29
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,630
there's no point in doing it.

30
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Your Majesty, I've heard...

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,360
It can...

32
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,030
Water...

33
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,900
Water...

34
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,030
When I extort a confession in the army,

35
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,700
even when they pass out,

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,560
a basin of water could

37
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,760
wake them for sure.

38
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,760
Dali,

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,830
we're extorting a confession.

40
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,560
Not enough.

41
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,960
Your Majesty,

42
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,830
this will kill her.

43
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,230
Right, brother,

44
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,160
be gentle to her.

45
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,100
Use this

46
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,830
fur.

47
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,160
The Missy said,

48
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,430
use furs to scratch the feet,

49
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,230
they can stimulate nerves,

50
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,430
then she will wake up.

51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,830
Quickly.

52
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,900
It absolutely works.

53
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,960
Enough,

54
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,830
these methods are not useful.

55
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,560
Feifei said,

56
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,900
I said,

57
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,230
who said,

58
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,230
it doesn't matter.

59
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,430
Your Majesty, have you heard about an ancient book,

60
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,360
written,

61
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,430
when you want to wake up someone, you need to wake up her soul,

62
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,230
or you could say some romantic words,

63
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,700
maybe when she heard them,

64
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,960
and then wakes up.

65
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,630
It might work.

66
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,630
I can't.

67
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,630
Your Majesty, it's in emergency now.

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,500
I trust you.

69
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,030
Brother, i trust you too.

70
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,160
Ok.

71
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,160
So, let's get out,

72
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,430
let the emperor take good care of her.

73
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,230
Ok.

74
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,630
Go, go.

75
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Go.

76
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,160
I...

77
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,230
in my heart, you...

78
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,430
Dragon, I feel bored,

79
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,830
tell me a story.

80
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,360
Ok,

81
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
let me tell you one.

82
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,030
When I was young, I fought hard against Orion state.

83
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,760
Hang on.

84
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,030
Who would like to listen to this,

85
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,300
fight and kill stuff?

86
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,430
Then you tell me one.

87
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,430
Ok.

88
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,230
Let me tell you

89
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,560
the story about the Snow White and Prince Charming.

90
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,630
In a remote nation long time ago,

91
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,830
he saw the Snow White in deep sleep

92
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,960
with affections,

93
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,500
so he kissed her on the lips,

94
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,960
the Snow White then awoke.

95
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,160
Your story

96
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,700
are full of flaws.

97
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,230
Feifei, you are awake.

98
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,030
Come in, Lord Luo is up.

99
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,030
She's awake.

100
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,760
Missy, you are awake now.

101
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,560
I will inform the chef

102
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,630
to make the most delicious food

103
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,030
for you.

104
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,700
Awake now.

105
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,760
I'm ok.

106
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,900
Great.

107
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,630
You have a problem.

108
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,630
You have a huge problem.

109
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,830
What problem?

110
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,430
I heard someone wanted to scratch my feet, right?

111
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,630
It occurs to me that

112
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,830
I have tremendous things to deal with,

113
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,630
I will get out of here now.

114
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,160
Big white teeth,

115
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,900
if you take one step further,

116
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,760
I will tell dragon egg

117
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,030
to get you a wife by order.

118
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,500
Ten fat girls,

119
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,160
twenty fat girls,

120
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,160
thirty fat girls, forty, fifty...

121
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,030
And who said she would pour water onto my face?

122
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,030
The army hasn't been trained for many days,

123
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,100
I'm out now.

124
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,560
Nannan,

125
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
don't go away.

126
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,030
Your Majesty,

127
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,560
your precious glaze cup

128
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,030
has been broken by someone,

129
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,360
that seems to be pretty costly.

130
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,760
Who did that?

131
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,560
Words are held back when they're coming out of the mouth,

132
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,630
the name is

133
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,500
Bai Wuchen.

134
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,560
I can't conceal it for you.

135
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Dali, conceal what?

136
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,360
You know what I mean.

137
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,160
I broke it.

138
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,760
I...

139
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,560
Happy now, Meimei?

140
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,030
Happy.

141
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,160
You let the emperor hit me.

142
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,430
Not painful at all, really.

143
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,360
Numb, no sense of pain.

144
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,360
Your Majesty,

145
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,900
I'd like to ask master Mei to do something.

146
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,960
How about this, Meimei,

147
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,100
I'm just healed from a severe disease

148
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,630
and need some nutrition.

149
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,230
Master Mei,

150
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,430
from tomorrow on,

151
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,560
three meals a day,

152
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,430
no, four meals a day,

153
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,100
I will need the most luxurious food and clothing,

154
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,360
and I need to be fed every day

155
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,030
with sea cucumber aged thousands of years,

156
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,030
glossy ganoderma and ginseng

157
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
are essential,

158
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,100
is that ok?

159
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,030
I dare not forget that you saved me.

160
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,560
I just saw the emperor was so anxious,

161
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,030
so I came up with a good idea.

162
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,230
A good idea?

163
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Come here,

164
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,700
let me show you a good idea, come here.

165
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,900
Master Mei, since you're so concerned about me,

166
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,430
you should meet all the requirements of Lord Luo.

167
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,300
That's very generous of you, Master Mei.

168
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,160
No,no,no.

169
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,300
Take a look at these wealthy people,

170
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,030
they're much different from us.

171
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,760
I, I'm not fully healed,

172
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,900
I'm getting dizzy now,

173
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,230
I didn't understand what has been discussed,

174
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,230
too dizzy...

175
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,230
Uh...

176
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,230
I'm here.

177
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Drink, little one,

178
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:41,960
decent wine,

179
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,430
decent wine.

180
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,700
Let me tell you,

181
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,300
none of you should be drunken today,

182
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,030
I will drink all of it first

183
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,030
without waiting for you.

184
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,560
Right.

185
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,560
The adversity has already passed,

186
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,100
things are going well,

187
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,760
why don't we drink some wine?

188
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,100
Right, drink.

189
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,760
Make the cap full,

190
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,560
drink as much as we can.

191
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,030
Only with the tweedle, the atmosphere is not satisfying.

192
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,360
Right.

193
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,160
It's been said it's hard  to find someone who understands you.

194
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,560
When Mo Ran is gone,

195
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,230
I can only drink the wine alone,

196
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,160
it's boring.

197
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,830
Here, drink this one, and we have more.

198
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,960
You little one,

199
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,160
good as the wine is,

200
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,430
don't drink too much,

201
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,760
if you mess up with things tomorrow due to this,

202
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,430
how can you deal with that?

203
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Let's drink.

204
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,900
Here.

205
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,300
After investigation,

206
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,760
I've confirmed that

207
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,030
all these troubles

208
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,160
are caused by the Orion State,

209
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,830
and now,

210
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,500
I decide to

211
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,360
attack it with all our force.

212
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,360
Your Majesty,

213
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,160
a spy from the Zodiac State delivered a message,

214
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,960
saying that they have cured the disease of madness.

215
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,430
Faster than we expected.

216
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,760
This is not the worst news yet.

217
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,960
The worst one is

218
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,760
they know it's done by us.

219
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,300
I have plotted with state preceptor for so many years,

220
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,360
and sent lots of spies there,

221
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,630
we still haven't shaken its foundation,

222
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,630
its national power can't be underestimated.

223
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,030
It's not the best timing to wage a war.

224
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,760
Fortunately, state preceptor has been spying on it for many years.

225
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,360
With her wits,

226
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,960
your and Xiao Quan's kungfu,

227
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,900
we can eliminate the risk.

228
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,900
I'm afraid that they might be well prepared.

229
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,030
Hard to deal with.

230
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,430
When the Orion was defeated,

231
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,360
we sent a princess there to marry for peace,

232
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,500
and the princess,

233
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,900
is the grandma-empress there now,

234
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,430
the emperor's grandmother.

235
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,300
You mean...

236
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,160
You go to the Zodiac State with Xia Bing,

237
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,360
you and Xia Bing provide assistance,

238
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,960
with the instructions from the state preceptor,

239
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,360
everything will be clear.

240
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,160
Stop.

241
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,100
Why are you still here?

242
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,160
They don't belong to the Zodiac State.

243
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,760
What?

244
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,830
Want a fight?

245
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,160
You...

246
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,030
dare to take such liberties even in the Zodiac State.

247
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,300
Why don't try?

248
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,230
Don't be impulsive,

249
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,830
there are too many people.

250
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,360
Xiao Quan,

251
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,830
don't forget we have some important things to do, let's go.

252
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,830
There is one thing today,

253
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,900
who are willing to marry the daughter of the Orion

254
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,560
Grandma,

255
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,100
the Orion has sent someone here,

256
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,300
is it only seeking marriage for peace.

257
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,360
The key point

258
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,100
is nothing but peace.

259
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,360
Since they're sincere,

260
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,230
we will just let it go,

261
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,960
after all, the war between nations

262
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,300
will only afflict civilians.

263
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,900
Since you have said that,

264
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,160
I will let it go.

265
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,430
But who are willing to go,

266
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,960
they offer their emperor's only daughter,

267
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,560
you all should take the initiative,

268
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,830
don't be silent,

269
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,430
if you keep doing it,

270
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:18,960
I will pick one myself.

271
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,230
Why do you stand out?

272
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,360
I don't want to.

273
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,230
Out.

274
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,430
This is the princess of the Orion, Xia Bing.

275
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,160
Grandma,

276
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,560
let my brother focus on national affairs.

277
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,430
Now the marriage for peace

278
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,500
can ease the tension between two nations,

279
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,160
and promote communication,

280
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,100
Now, it's tie for me to show up.

281
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,500
I will accept the marriage.

282
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,760
Good, my grandson.

283
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,160
Giving priority to national affairs,

284
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,830
you have grown up.

285
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,100
Is Yan Ran feel well recently?

286
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,360
No big deal.

287
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,760
Thanks for your concern, yur highness.

288
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,560
I ask you out today

289
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,160
to just chat.

290
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Your Highness,

291
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,900
do you remember when you were younger,

292
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,230
we used to play around here,

293
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,760
my thoughts were quite simple at that time,

294
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,430
to be your wife when I grow up,

295
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
and take good care of you wit all my life.

296
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,630
Yanran, you know...

297
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,700
I can understand, Your Highness.

298
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,160
When you love someone, you can understand how deep affections can be,

299
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,160
when you get drunken, you can understand how strong wines can be.

300
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,360
I can understand.

301
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,630
Your Highness,

302
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,830
take a look at the sky,

303
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,160
full of clouds just now,

304
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,830
but with a full moon now.

305
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,030
Just like many things,

306
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,030
they happened,

307
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,900
but we didn't really notice.

308
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,230
But we can't deny that

309
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,900
they did come here.

310
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,960
Your Highness,

311
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
take care.

312
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,630
Yanran, where are you going?

313
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,030
It is better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books.

314
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,430
Because of you,

315
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,900
I chose to stay.

316
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,230
But now I want to choose for myself,

317
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,560
traveling nations,

318
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,830
boating in rivers,

319
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,030
I think one or two things among them

320
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,700
will help me find who I was.

321
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,630
And then,

322
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,230
there will be answers to many things.

323
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,160
I'd like to go to Wuxian state for traveling lately,

324
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,830
Xuxian said there are decent wines

325
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,500
that can free people of worries,

326
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,560
and will bring some of them back to you.

327
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,760
When you come back,

328
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,160
let's drink until we are thoroughly drunken,

329
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,960
and you will tell me.

330
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,160
Wines can get people drunk,

331
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,700
but people can't fool themselves,

332
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,430
best wishes for you.

333
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,700
Yanran has not gone yet.

334
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,700
I'm starting to miss her.

335
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,960
She has her own plans.

336
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,160
By the way, uncle also plans to travel as well.

337
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,500
But Yan Ran said,

338
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,630
she intends to learn things,

339
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,630
and she's determined to be a good star lord.

340
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,630
The relationship between her and prince,

341
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,960
she's thought it through and let it go.

342
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,100
That's good.

343
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,230
You can't just be perfunctory.

344
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,430
I'm feeling sad now.

345
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,430
After all,

346
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,560
she's one of the thirteen star lords,

347
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,960
she will devote herself to the nation when she returns.

348
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,030
I'm so sad,

349
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,700
and you don't comfort me.

350
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,900
We have no idea when they will be back.

351
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,830
Keep doing your business , I will get back now.

352
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,360
I said keep doing it, I'm getting back.

353
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,160
Get back then.

354
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,160
I'm really getting back now.

355
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,230
Get back.

356
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,500
Beitang Yi,

357
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,100
when a girl says do your business,

358
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,960
and she wants to leave,

359
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,830
you are not supposed to say that.

360
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,560
You should say,

361
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,160
I'm not doing it , you should stay,

362
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,830
let me be with you. you're the important to me.

363
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,030
I'm not gonna work.

364
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,700
Stay with me.

365
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,630
let me be with you.

366
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,030
Okay! Okay! Okay!

367
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,160
I'm gonna sleep.

368
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Sleep here again?

369
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,960
Of course.

370
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,100
There're so many things I wanna talk to you.

371
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,500
Listen,

372
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,030
Today, I came to Meimei

373
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,430
for that glossy ganoderma.

374
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,830
he had that thing in his arms,

375
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,830
I came to rob it and he hid from me,

376
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,500
again and again.

377
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,630
I kept chasing him,

378
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,230
and then he kept running,

379
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,830
and then we kept doing it,

380
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,030
and then...

381
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,560
Dali,

382
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,430
Dali helped me get it from him,

383
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
so he was pissed off.
