Episode 15

4
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,760
I'm so tired.

5
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,100
Pay respect to me and go.

6
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,830
Grandma-Empress,

7
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,030
You can't let His Majesty marry with that bitch.

8
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,700
I can't?

9
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,100
Why?

10
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,100
I know you.

11
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,500
I gave you a chance,

12
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,360
but,

13
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,700
you disappointed me.

14
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,960
Grandma-Empress,

15
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,430
I'm not begging for myself.

16
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,700
Luo Feifei is too restless.

17
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,630
There will be so many troubles if you keep her.

18
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
You may go.

19
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,960
What do you want to say?

20
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,360
Grandma-Empress, you might be stay here too long

21
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,500
to forgot our country's mission.

22
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,500
You mean I'm old and confused?

23
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,900
I need you to remind me?

24
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,360
Grandma-Empress, I dare not.

25
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Grandma-Empress, you have your own way to do things,

26
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,630
I'm nothing compared to you.

27
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,760
How dare I guess your godly thoughts.

28
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,500
I just can remind something small around you.

29
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,030
I hope you can forgive me cause I want to protect you.

30
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,230
Nowadays, His Majesty and the Lords get together.

31
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,960
If the trends continues,

32
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,700
It's impossible that shake the foundation of the Zodiac

33
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,160
and replace them.

34
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,960
Grandma-Empress, I hope you decide it as early as possible.

35
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,630
Bilian,

36
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,230
You're more and more capable.

37
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,160
Now you can teach me how to handle things.

38
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,300
I dare not.

39
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,830
Of course Grandma-Empress decide all of the things.

40
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,300
If you have no other things,

41
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,830
Grandma-Empress, I shall leave.

42
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Dehai,

43
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,160
How are my cottonrose hibiscus?

44
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,560
Your Majesty, it's not full of bloom.

45
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,760
Take good care.

46
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,830
It's hard to get them.

47
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,030
It's for Feifei.

48
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,630
Your Majesty, you're so thoughtful to Miss Luo.

49
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,030
Well, I'm concerned.

50
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,760
I need to take a look.

51
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,830
Miss Luo is so lucky.

52
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,830
Missy.

53
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,960
Big white tooth.

54
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,900
What're you doing here?

55
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,830
I came for you.

56
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,960
Let's play outside.

57
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,360
Nope.

58
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,830
I can't. Go yourself.

59
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,830
I'm about to get married with dragon egg.

60
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,630
Grandma-Empress doesn't like me all the time.

61
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,560
At this important moment,

62
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,030
I'm won't touch the tiger's ass.

63
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,360
Alright.

64
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,430
I'll spend more time with you.

65
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:17,900
Walk around with me.

66
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,500
When does the flower bloom here?

67
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,900
Is it a ordinary flower?

68
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,030
Nothing special.

69
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,830
But it's alone here.

70
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,630
And it looks have good smell.

71
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,030
Let me smell it.

72
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,160
Yeah, not bad.

73
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,030
No, it have no aroma

74
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,360
Your Majesty, look at that!

75
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,760
Who broke my cottonrose hibiscus?

76
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,230
Big white tooth!

77
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,360
He just said it smells good.

78
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,760
and he broke it. Then I said,

79
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,760
Big white tooth, stop! Stop!

80
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,230
He doesn't listen to me! And ignored me!

81
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,960
He broke it here.

82
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,630
Missy.

83
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,030
Brother.

84
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,160
It's my fault.

85
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,960
Missy.

86
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,430
He will not blame you! It's okay.

87
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,300
Every time

88
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,430
I am forced to be the scapegoat for you.

89
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,430
Egg!

90
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,030
Gragon egg!

91
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,030
Gragon egg!

92
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,430
Gragon egg!

93
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,160
Gragon egg!

94
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,030
Beitang Yi.

95
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,760
You may leave.

96
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,960
You know, Beitang Tang did it is not on purpose.

97
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,360
It's unintentional.

98
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,160
You thought I'm silly.

99
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,160
Beitang Tang is not interested in flowers and plants.

100
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,560
I know you did it.

101
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,430
Well,

102
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,430
I was afraid you would mad at me.

103
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,430
I care about you.

104
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,500
You know I spend a lot of time

105
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,830
on it.

106
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,030
Just because I want to give it to you when we marry.

107
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,160
For me?

108
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,100
You need to told me.

109
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,960
Actually, no matter later or early, it's the same!

110
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,100
How it can be the same!

111
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,500
I got it!

112
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,760
I got it!

113
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,560
Heart!

114
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,960
Beitang Yi.

115
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,960
You're upset?

116
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,030
The last time thing I haven't talk to you!

117
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,630
Now how dare you be mad at me!

118
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,760
I'm just a girl!

119
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,230
In order to marry with you,

120
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,360
I went to the Grandma-Empress by myself.

121
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,830
You?

122
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,360
You just like a nerd and you know nothing!

123
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,960
Now you blame me.

124
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,500
Feifei.

125
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,500
I don't  blame you.

126
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,760
That's right.

127
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,360
I've already sent you a betrothal present,

128
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,960
so where's your dowry?

129
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,630
Dowry?

130
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,760
What?

131
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,830
How can I give you dowry?

132
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,230
I'm HERE!

133
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,760
Well. You wanna get something from nothing?

134
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,560
I'll

135
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,360
give you! Give you! Give you!

136
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,360
Is it what I've sent you before?

137
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,360
Your Xiaomihu is my Xiaomihu.

138
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,630
It belongs to us!

139
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,230
You keep it!

140
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,630
Dowry! Take it!

141
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,230
Okay! After we marry,

142
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,760
II'll give it back to you.

143
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,630
Luo Feifei,

144
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,030
I'm gonna kill you today.

145
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,960
There's poison in the dart.

146
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,230
Your Majesty.

147
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,360
What?

148
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,830
There's a pattern.

149
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,360
Turn-back.

150
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,360
There isn't! For real.

151
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,960
I remember there was a pattern.

152
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,360
I saw it wrong?

153
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,360
What wrong?

154
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,500
Obviously, you wanna take advantage of her.

155
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,630
Okay. Stop it.

156
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,830
I'll handle this.

157
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,560
Also,

158
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,030
Recently you should visit Grandma-Empress less frequently.

159
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,360
Why?

160
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,630
Although Bilian belong to her,

161
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,430
she doesn't suppose to know this thing.

162
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,360
Listen to me.

163
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,630
You mad at me again?

164
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,300
By the way,

165
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,630
you ask Su Xunxian and Shang Yu

166
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,830
come to me tomorrow, I got something.

167
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,430
Missy, you alright?

168
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,760
I heard you were assassinated again?

169
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,960
I'm okay.

170
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,630
Not a big deal.

171
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,030
And besides, Every day, I'm so uncomfortable

172
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,560
if it doesn't happen.

173
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,030
Missy, you have such a special hobby.

174
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,960
Take it easy, Bilian was dead.

175
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,160
My brother is handling her funeral.

176
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,360
Why don't you help your brother?

177
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,030
I'm concerned about you.

178
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,760
They're there.

179
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,700
Why are they here?

180
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,630
Of course somebody invite us.

181
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,030
Prince Tang,

182
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,630
You have such a beauty at home,

183
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,900
why are you not going back?

184
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,230
I'm curious, you're a businessman,

185
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,760
Are you tired with speaking poems all day.

186
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,300
Give me.

187
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,500
Well, good liquor.

188
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,760
You also know liquor?

189
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,560
Nope.

190
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,030
It's impossible that Su Xunxian owns low quality liquor.

191
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,960
Besides,

192
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,960
I smell money in so far away.

193
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:45,960
Where's Shengnan?

194
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,900
Dali doesn't feel well recently.

195
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,100
She usually wanna throw up

196
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,630
and she likes eating something sour.

197
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,760
Is it heatstroke?

198
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,760
What are you laughing about?

199
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,230
You're still a kid.

200
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,430
You don't understand.

201
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,360
I feel like it's that.

202
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
You mean?

203
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,560
I'll go first.

204
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,630
How do you know I can't understand

205
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,030
if you don't tell me.

206
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,900
It's hard to say; it's about growing up.

207
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,760
Alright, stop it.

208
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,360
His wife is pregnant.

209
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,030
She's gonna have a baby.

210
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,900
Hurry up.

211
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,960
Go! Go!

212
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,230
The flour is made by mixing fish and powder.

213
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,360
You make dumplings first, this is stuffing.

214
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,030
Sedan?

215
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,830
Jiao

216
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,030
The three levels. Jiao.

217
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,960
Jiaozi.

218
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,230
Dumpling!

219
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,630
Dumpling. Pawnshop.

220
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,300
What's that?

221
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,360
It's a delicious food.

222
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,630
Delicious!

223
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,300
Hurry up! Do it!

224
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,760
I want a thousand first, okay?

225
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,560
Okay?

226
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,700
This might be more than I need.

227
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,360
I believe I can finish them quickly

228
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,960
with my speed.

229
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,700
If you finishes then you can begin another round.

230
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,830
Round and round.

231
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,700
I got it.

232
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,760
Iet's make it clear,

233
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,500
I

234
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,030
will not do these physical work.

235
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,830
Neither Bai Wuchen

236
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,760
nor Shengnan come.

237
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,960
You don't wanna do that! Well,

238
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,230
Big white tooth.

239
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,760
No!

240
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,230
I just play here.

241
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,030
I'll do all of it! Okay?

242
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,830
Master Su, would you mind chopping the stuffing?

243
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,760
Not bad. Not bad.

244
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,360
I've learned some new skills of

245
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,560
swordsmanship these days.

246
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,160
It's so fluent when I use it.

247
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,630
When I move with the skill,

248
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,030
it's like a dragon flying in the sky.

249
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,630
Shut up!

250
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,360
Can you stop talking?

251
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,830
And do something?

252
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,160
You're such a chatterbox.

253
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,560
Look? Still just looking at me?

254
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,160
There's nothing special!

255
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,830
Brother.

256
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,630
Your Majesty.

257
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,030
Your Majesty.

258
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,100
Where's Feifei?

259
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,500
After she finished making dumplings

260
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,500
she went to visit Grandma-Empress.

261
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,430
So why are you still here?

262
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
I wanna take some dumplings to Xaibing.

263
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,430
You just said

264
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,760
where did Feifei gp?

265
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,830
Grandma-Empress's chamber.

266
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,830
She didn't listen to me.

267
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,760
Go on.

268
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,960
Lord Luo, Grandma-Empress may see you.

269
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,960
Let me see, it hurts deeply.

270
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,160
Luckily, not a lot of blood.

271
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,430
You're worrying me?

272
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,030
You flatter yourself.

273
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,630
I was worrying His Majesty will blame me

274
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,760
if I hurt you.

275
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
You okay?

276
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,230
Maybe because there's a lot of blood.

277
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
I feel a bit giddy.

278
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,230
You okay?

279
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,830
You're insatiable.

280
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,030
Bingbing, you know,

281
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,300
the first time I saw you in the desert,

282
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,300
I was think it's unreal there will be such a pretty girl in the world.

283
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,830
And I also thought

284
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,960
who will be the lucky guy to marry you.

285
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,300
It will be the luckiest thing in his life.

286
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,230
You did such things to me and Shangyu

287
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,030
as I know you are the people of the Orion.

288
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,630
You don't know how angry I was.

289
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,360
At that time, I just wanted to catch you

290
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,500
and teach you a lesson.

291
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,760
It's all because of you

292
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,230
acted like an idiot when you saw the pretty girls.

293
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,030
Okay! Okay! Done!

294
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,760
Please stop being angry.

295
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,760
I still have a lots words to talk to you in the my rest of life.

296
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,230
By the way, I took some dumplings made by Missy.

297
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,230
It's really delicious!

298
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,960
Sit here.

299
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,700
Dumplings?

300
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,430
Take it here.

301
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,430
This is unique vinegar.

302
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,630
I made it by the Chinese wine

303
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,960
from Su Xunxian.

304
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,830
And added some garlic.

305
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,700
It's so good. Try it.

306
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
You don't scared me?

307
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,830
I need to afraid you'll trouble me?

308
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Or afraid you're an Orion's people?

309
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,500
You know I come from the Orion?

310
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,160
I've saw Bilian's pattern.

311
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,030
There're plenty of signs pointing at you

312
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,630
demonstrating you came from Orion.

313
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,160
Everyone knows.

314
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,630
So why you still here?

315
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,830
You wanna kill me here?

316
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
Don't you think that's too obvious?

317
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,030
You think you can go safely?

318
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,630
Threaten me?

319
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,500
No, I'm not bold enough.

320
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,160
And you're Grandma of the emperor.

321
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,960
I also wanna be good to you.

322
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,560
And you can give us the best wish.

323
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,160
One more thing,

324
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,960
Grandma-Empress,

325
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,830
Don't you think

326
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,160
it's so strange

327
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,700
that the Ophiuchus assassinated predecessor that year?

328
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,230
I hate the Ophiuchus all the time.

329
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,160
But I also doubted.

330
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
My original country.

331
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,030
Okay! Okay! Okay!

332
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,960
Try it.

333
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,830
It's been too long. You'd never tried it.

334
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,830
Have a try.

335
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,830
I haven't ate

336
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,300
such comfortable food for so long.

337
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,960
What's the stuffing?

338
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,360
Pork and cabbage.

339
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,900
But I can taste fish?

340
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,160
The skin of the dumpling is made by fish and powder.

341
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,560
It's expensive!

342
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,830
There's a bit one! Did you see?

343
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,160
You can eat more the big dumplings.

344
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,430
I put much meat in them.

345
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,360
I don't feel I waste them.

346
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,830
Look at the big

347
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,960
Grandma-Empress?

348
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,830
Grandma-Empress?

349
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,500
Grandma-Empress?

350
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,630
Somebody help? Help!

351
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,230
Lord Luo, what a clever and ruthless trick.

352
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,160
Seems like Grandma-Empress doesn't dare to

353
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,230
bother you for a while.

354
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,560
I really don't know she can't eat fish.

355
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,430
What's our meeting about today?

356
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,360
Today.

357
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,560
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,360
Today is

359
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,630
Did my words make you feel so disgusted?

360
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,560
Shengnan is pregnant.

361
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,430
Pregnant?

362
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,830
Whose child?

363
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,560
No!

364
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Everyone keeps this matter under your hat,

365
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,030
otherwise people will laugh at me.

366
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,500
Dali,

367
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,100
you yell too loud.

368
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,030
Everyone knows now.
