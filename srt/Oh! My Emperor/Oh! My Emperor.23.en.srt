1
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,630
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

2
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,700
Production Company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 02

4
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,030
That big brother is so weird.

5
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,230
I don't understand you adults.

6
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,030
So weird.

7
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,500
Sister, I've come to save you.

8
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,560
Please get well soon.

9
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,830
Grandma-Empress, the emperor has retired to his bedchamber.

10
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,830
Bilian.

11
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Yi'er, my son.

12
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,160
Where's the emperor?

13
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,430
My brother stabbed Missy,

14
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,900
and then went to Palace of the Prince Chen.

15
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,500
His Majesty went to Palace of the Prince Chen?

16
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Isn't Luo Feifei a consort of Prince Chen's?

17
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,830
Why would his Majesty go there?

18
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,030
I said nothing.

19
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,430
This Luo Feifei is indeed a wicked girl,

20
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,030
to bewitch you three like that.

21
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,360
I'll have to get rid of her

22
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,160
before more damage is done to our country and its people.

23
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,030
Grandma-Empress,

24
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,430
Missy isn't some kind of wicked girl.

25
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,830
Shut up.  She's just...

26
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,230
You. All of you.

27
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,030
Do you wish to provoke me to death?

28
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,030
Grandma-Empress,

29
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,630
I know it's my fault now.

30
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,230
There won't be a next time, Grandma.

31
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,960
Guards!

32
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,700
Aye.

33
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,960
Prince Tang is being disobedient.

34
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,160
Escort him to the palace to reflect on his wrongdoings.

35
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
And ground him unless I order you not to.

36
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,030
Grandma-Empress.

37
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,030
You know I'm the most...

38
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,830
Please, Prince Tang.

39
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,630
You're finally awake, sister.

40
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,830
Chongchong.

41
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,360
Chongchong, your hand.

42
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,830
You can't use the extraordinary abilities anymore, do you know that?

43
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,560
My energy is too weak.

44
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,830
If only Grandpa was here...

45
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,830
They could definitely heal you.

46
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,030
I'm already much better.

47
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,360
By the way, sister.

48
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,830
I just saw a

49
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,030
fierce-looking guy here

50
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,030
before he slipped away through the back door.

51
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,100
A fierce-looking guy?

52
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,100
His face was sullen

53
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,560
and he looked fierce.

54
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,760
Your Highness, the medicine is ready.

55
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,160
Are we really going to serve it to Miss Luo?

56
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,230
Good medicine often tastes bitter.

57
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,160
How am I supposed to face his Highness

58
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,430
after suddenly becoming his consort?

59
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,230
Your Highness, the medicine.

60
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,030
Serve it.

61
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,960
Aye.

62
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,900
Your Highness, she couldn't drink it.

63
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,960
I'll serve it myself then.

64
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,760
Aye.

65
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,630
Your Highness.

66
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,360
Allow me.

67
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,230
Alright.

68
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,760
Feifei.

69
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,100
You're awake.

70
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,030
I'm weak.

71
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,030
Weak.

72
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,160
Feifei, now that you're already awake,

73
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,960
I'll...

74
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,030
You Highness, you can leave now.

75
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,430
I'll take care of Feifei. Have an early night.

76
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,030
Take all the rest you need.

77
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,560
I'll visit you some other time.

78
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,430
Your Highness.

79
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,500
Thanks to your prescription,

80
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,100
Feifei is awake now.

81
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,230
Please, everyone,

82
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,030
send a copy of the prescription to my study.

83
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,360
Aye, Your Highness.

84
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,760
Who captured Xifeng Lie?

85
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,030
Do you have a lead?

86
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,560
While searching for Lord Xie with Xifeng Lie,

87
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,030
we encountered a group of mysterious men.

88
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,300
Mystery men?

89
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,560
I wanted to uncover their identities

90
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,230
and see if there was a lead.

91
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,500
But to my surprise, they took Xifeng Lie.

92
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,700
These recent, strange occurrences

93
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,900
remind me of the treason case ten years ago.

94
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,100
The last Constellation Lord

95
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,560
also became unconscious

96
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,160
after going missing for a few days.

97
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,760
After Luo Feifei went missing,

98
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,030
she became unconscious as well.

99
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,500
Is the capture of Xifeng Lie also because of...?

100
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,360
Then, then, then.

101
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,160
Then that's one more reason for us to rescue Xifeng Lie as fast as possible.

102
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,960
Boy, there's no need to hurry.

103
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,230
You will feel the same way

104
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,230
if your Constellation Coins are stolen.

105
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,560
His Highness spent a huge amount of money on treating Miss Luo.

106
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,830
It's twenty thousand C-coins!

107
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,430
But it's alright.

108
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,630
I'm rich

109
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,830
and can do whatever I want.

110
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,960
So, I'm actually glad

111
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,630
to be of help to his Highness.

112
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,900
The way I see it,

113
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,430
there's no need for more futile struggles.

114
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,830
You despicable rat. Who the hell are you?

115
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,030
What are you gonna do?

116
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,830
Despicable?

117
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
I'm despicable?

118
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,900
There are things that are far more despicable for you in the future.

119
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,100
The Zodiac State is gonna suffer

120
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,030
a hundred times more than you do. A thousand times, even.

121
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,560
Rescuing Xifeng Lie is not easy.

122
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,960
Where's the base of the mysterious men?

123
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
How's Xifeng Lie?

124
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,230
What if after rescuing him,

125
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,030
he becomes unconscious?

126
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,760
Feifei's regained consciousness,

127
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,030
which means this type of disease can be cured.

128
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,160
Feifei is awake?

129
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,760
You found the prescription?

130
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
Some strange folk from Xunxian Faction

131
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,430
wrote a secret prescription.

132
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,160
If proven effective,

133
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,230
since the prisoners suffer from the same disease,

134
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,760
we might as well try it on them,

135
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,500
and examine its effects.

136
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,360
Sounds good.

137
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,430
Shang Yu.

138
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,160
Yes.

139
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,500
Send men to investigate in secret.

140
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,030
Xifeng Lie has to be found.

141
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,160
Bai Wuchen.

142
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,760
I order you to brew the medicine overnight and send it to the cell.

143
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,830
Serve it to the infected prisoners.

144
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,430
As you order.

145
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
How about Bei Tangtang?

146
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,630
Your Majesty. Yesterday, Prince Tang disguised himself as you

147
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,160
and was caught by Grandma-Empress.

148
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,360
She grounded him.

149
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,900
No wonder it feels a lot quieter today.

150
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,360
Grandma-Empress ordered

151
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,560
that Prince Tang should not go outside the palace.

152
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,560
Let me out!

153
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
I want to go out!

154
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,030
What are you doing?

155
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,430
You smell good.

156
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,030
What are you looking at?

157
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,030
What are you looking at?

158
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,160
Go pour the medicine.

159
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,700
Go, go, go!

160
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,830
Your Majesty, the medicine has been poured.

161
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,560
We're now waiting for the reaction.

162
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,760
Your Majesty, the medicine appears to be really effective.

163
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,160
See? All of them are quiet.

164
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,630
Why not use my doubles?

165
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,760
Prince Tang. Prince Tang!

166
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,230
Stupid.

167
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,700
Just stupid.

168
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,760
As stupid as one can ever be.

169
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,760
Your Majesty, without dealing with the crazies,

170
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,560
the public's safety cannot be protected.

171
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,560
After a long time, chaos will ensue.

172
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
And the foundation of this country will probably be shaken.

173
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,630
He's right. Your Majesty,

174
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,830
the dungeon cell

175
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,630
has now been infested with the crazies.

176
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,030
But by encaging them without dealing with them,

177
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,030
after a long time,

178
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,500
it could lead to the exacerbation of the situation.

179
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,900
We're address this after finding Xifeng Lie.

180
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,430
Your Majesty.

181
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,630
Shang Yu.

182
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,830
How are the arrangements for rescuing Xifeng Lie going?

183
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,760
I can set off with two elite subordinates

184
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,830
right after Your Majesty gives the order.

185
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,230
How can you forget to

186
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,630
bring me along for something so exciting?

187
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,160
Then, Prince Tang,

188
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,900
you will go with him.

189
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,560
Prince Tang, there are probably a lot of difficulties ahead.

190
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,830
Have you thought it through?

191
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,630
Rest assured. I'll have you covered.

192
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,160
Aye.

193
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,230
Chongchong.

194
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,700
Why am I hungry again?

195
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,030
Me, too.

196
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,230
But, I remember us being practically stuffed tonight.

197
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,300
Feifei.

198
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,900
Are you asleep?

199
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,030
Yeah, I am.

200
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,560
What's the matter, Your Highness?

201
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,760
Nothing.

202
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,430
Please, get some rest.

203
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,360
I'll visit you another day.

204
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,830
Sister, you're lying! You're not asleep at all.

205
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,560
You are too young to understand.

206
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,160
Sneaking into the palace

207
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,830
at the middle of the night.

208
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,900
Your Majesty is surely at leisure.

209
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,700
Knocking on some girl's bedroom door at night.

210
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,630
Uncle.

211
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,030
You are surely a gentleman.

212
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,500
She's my consort.

213
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,230
As I recall, Your Majesty

214
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,760
was the one who arranged our marriage.

215
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,360
But before the wedding ceremony,

216
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,500
who would recognize a consort as such?

217
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,960
Your Majesty, I would like to

218
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,630
ask you to choose a wedding day for us.

219
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,560
I wouldn't bother.

220
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,830
Yah.

221
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,430
Yah.

222
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,760
Shang Yu, are you sure this is the way?

223
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,160
I am.

224
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,030
Aren't these the hoof prints from where we came?

225
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,630
Do you remember where Xifeng Lie

226
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,900
was taken away or not?

227
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,760
There's someone over there.

228
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,630
We can ask them about it.

229
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,630
Whoa.

230
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,900
Sister, thank you.

231
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,230
If not for you,

232
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,630
we would've camped outside.

233
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,160
Who's your sister?

234
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,960
Sister, you're really pretty.

235
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,160
You are a bold one.

236
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,300
Sadly, I don't buy it.

237
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,700
Miss, please don't mind him.

238
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,430
He talks in this way whenever he's around a pretty girl.

239
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,560
What a smooth talker.

240
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,160
Sister.

241
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,500
Where are you from? How do we address you?

242
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,230
Lord, we came here to rescue someone.

243
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,500
Here.

244
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
We don't have any delicacies

245
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,030
to treat you out in the wilderness.

246
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,100
Just make do.

247
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,160
Miss, you're alone

248
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,500
in this desert?

249
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,030
Sister, you're not afraid that we might be the bad guys?

250
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,630
Bad guys?

251
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,830
You?

252
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,160
Miss.

253
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,560
Have you seen this man before?

254
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,560
No.

255
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,230
There's hardly a soul around here all year long.

256
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,230
Not to mention the wind and the sand are our loyal company.

257
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,960
If your friend is truly lost.

258
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,630
you should probably prepare for the worst.

259
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,560
Alright. It's late. Let's get some rest.

260
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,360
Here.

261
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,900
Here.

262
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,960
This bed is great.

263
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,830
Sister, I'm going to sleep here.

264
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,900
Why don't you sleep outside?

265
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,160
I think that's also pretty neat.

266
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,700
I might as well sleep there.

267
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,030
It's too late. Going out on your own is not safe.

268
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,360
I'll go with you, okay?

269
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,430
Why are you here?

270
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,560
Just passing by.

271
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,830
Why are you out here with a kid

272
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,230
instead of staying in the Palace of Prince Chen?

273
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,630
I'm not a kid. I'm Chongchong.

274
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,160
Let's go, Chongchong. Ignore him.

275
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,300
Luo Feifei.

276
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,360
Call me Aunt.

277
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,700
I love that name.

278
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,900
You...

279
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,630
What are you doing out here?

280
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,760
Dragon Egg.

281
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,630
I know how to treat them.

282
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,760
Dragon Egg?

283
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,230
Niece.

284
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,560
I've already found

285
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,960
the antidote for their disease.

286
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,100
Uncle gave it to me.

287
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,960
So, this is the kid

288
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,160
who cured you?

289
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,430
I'm not a kid.

290
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,160
I'm Chongchong. Chongchong. Chongchong.

291
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,760
It's Chongchong.

292
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,230
So,

293
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,760
you getting cured

294
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
has nothing to do with

295
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,230
the motley bunch Uncle found?

296
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,430
That's right.

297
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,030
The superpower corresponding to each constellation

298
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,760
has its own restrictions.

299
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,700
I told you,

300
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,630
Ophiuchus' power of retrograde is different

301
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,960
from the twelve constellations' power of attack

302
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,230
in that it can also heal people.

303
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,830
You like my sister?
