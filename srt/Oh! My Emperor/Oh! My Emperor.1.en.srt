1
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,630
Oh! My Emperor

2
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,630
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd.

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 1

4
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:31,430
Luo Feifei, at the age of 20,

5
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:31,430
is a brilliant trainee surgeon in Sainte-Marie's Hospital.

6
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,030
Feifei,

7
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,030
there's an important patient in Room 10,

8
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,300
you need to sew up his wound.

9
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,430
My God,

10
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,300
you'd better get cleaned up a bit before you go.

11
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,230
I've been working for 20 hours.

12
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,960
could you ask another one to do it?

13
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm really done in.

14
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,700
Do you want Professor Zhang to come over?

15
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,830
Considering his eyesight,

16
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,030
the stitch will definitely be a mess.

17
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,430
Don't forget,

18
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,030
clean up and go there,

19
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,960
or you will surely regret.

20
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,030
Fortune Trend Today. Love Fortune. Be alert when in outdoors activities.

21
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,560
Why is it so quiet?

22
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,300
Kind of creepy around here.

23
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,700
Where are the people?

24
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,830
I'm just a little girl who shot her mouth off.

25
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,500
Forgive me if I did anything wrong. Forgive me.

26
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,100
Don't miss it when passing by.

27
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,430
Don't play trick on me. Don't play trick on me.

28
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,300
Don't. Don't. Don't.

29
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,230
Don't play trick on me.

30
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,630
It's my fault. All my fault.

31
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,830
Don't play trick on me.

32
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,030
I've told you.Why are you still doing this?

33
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,030
Jiacheng.

34
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,360
I'm so glad to be awarded the Best Artist of the Year Award

35
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,630
in the Golden Sparrow Festival on my fifth year of debut.

36
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
During the past five years,

37
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,900
I've brought my fans a lot of

38
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,230
different music works.

39
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,760
And I'll keep striving

40
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,030
to make more finer works.

41
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,360
At last, I'd like to tell my fans.

42
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,100
This award belongs to all of us

43
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,960
rather than me.

44
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,900
I love you guys.

45
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,900
Jiacheng, wait a second.

46
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,830
Wait a second.

47
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,830
Wait a second.

48
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,560
I'd like to live in your heart.

49
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,430
You have a greater attraction than the gravity.

50
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,230
I would like to go space traveling with you,

51
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,760
driving a time machine and visiting the Milky Way.

52
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,030
Just you and me.

53
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,830
I accept all your cold pride,

54
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,500
and you should humour my fickle temper.

55
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,160
You give me a little smile,

56
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,230
and air seems to sweeten up.

57
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,560
I seem to have fallen into the sea of love.

58
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,230
Will you have have some expectations?

59
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,960
It's like feeling your respiratory rate so closely,

60
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,160
and feeling all your emotions.

61
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Let me lean in your arms.

62
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,430
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,960
It wasn't a big deal in the first place.

64
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,700
A surgeon would do.

65
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,830
But now

66
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,700
I may need use internal medicine .

67
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,700
Should I contact an orthopaedic surgeon for you?

68
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,160
There is a an orthopaedic surgeon with whom I'm on familiar terms.

69
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,630
I just need a phone call to get him here.

70
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,030
I need to go to the airport

71
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,230
to attend a show later.

72
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,960
How can you attend a show like this?

73
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,830
It's a bliss to be your fan.

74
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
You're a fan of mine?

75
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,900
Of course.

76
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,230
I'm the president of the fan club in the three northeastern provinces of China.

77
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,230
Do you want to go to the show tonight?

78
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,160
I do.

79
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,430
In fact I will go. Yeah, I will.

80
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,230
See you tonight.

81
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,630
Thank you, doctor.

82
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,630
Goodbye.

83
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,430
I'm sorry.

84
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,560
In order to meet Jiacheng,

85
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,430
only Xiaomihu facial mask can

86
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,760
prepare my face skin in 15 minutes.

87
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,360
Simple Xiaomihu facial mask,

88
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,160
with natural water that can permeate facial skin,

89
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,700
is the best among this type of facial masks.

90
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,560
Yeah.

91
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,760
Five stars for love luck trend.

92
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,160
Five stars for love luck trend.

93
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,430
Five stars for love luck trend.

94
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,830
Where is your destination?

95
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,560
The Workers' Stadium,please.

96
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,160
At 8 o'clock tonight,

97
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,830
there will be a rare Ophiuchus meteor shower.

98
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,760
I'm doomed.

99
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,430
Are you OK?

100
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,300
Let's go to the hospital.

101
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,300
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

102
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,160
You take care of yourself now.

103
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,230
Zodiac State

104
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,360
Your Majesty, come on!

105
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,230
Bei tangyi, the Emperor of Capricornus with petrifaction skill.

106
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,960
Thirty-two.

107
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,030
His Majesty is amazing.

108
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,560
Although Lord Mei is a weakness,

109
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,960
they are tied.

110
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,430
His Majesty scored.

111
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,630
Fifty-five.

112
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
You know what?

113
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,760
His Majesty doesn't like smiling.

114
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,230
You wear a smiling face

115
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,030
all the time,

116
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,630
and it will make His Majesty uncomfortable.

117
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,630
Your Majesty, go for it. His Majesty is so handsome.

118
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,300
I just don't think so.

119
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,430
=Shang Yu, the attendant of Prince Chen of Aries with extra speed.=
.

120
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,560
=Shang Yu, the attendant of Prince Chen of Aries with extra speed.=
I agree.

121
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,430
=Shang Yu, the attendant of Prince Chen of Aries with extra speed.=
Maybe it's true because of the contrast.

122
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,900
His Majesty does look very handsome

123
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,300
this way,

124
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,760
but he is still far less handsome compared to

125
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,230
our Prince.

126
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,700
Su Xunxian, royal businessman of Gemini, and proficient in hundreds of languages.

127
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:35,360
Beitang Moran, the Prince Chen of Aquarius and uncle of the Emperor, with precognition skill.

128
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,300
Prince.Prince.Prince.

129
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,960
It seems that His Majesty

130
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,160
Is about to break your record.

131
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,630
How do you know?

132
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
Did your bird tell you that?

133
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,500
The bird is nice,

134
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,960
but the owner is not.

135
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,430
I wonder who asked me

136
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,160
to watch a group of men

137
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,960
playing water polo on such a hot day.

138
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,360
Such a waste of time.

139
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,630
I asked you to admire flowers.

140
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,700
I like the new daisies in the palace very much.

141
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,100
Considering your same hobby,

142
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,360
I invited you to enjoy them.

143
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,100
The daisies in the palace

144
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,900
don't look very nice.

145
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,760
Prince.

146
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,500
Jiacheng,

147
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,500
why are you here?

148
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,430
Tell you what,

149
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,360
I was really pathetic.

150
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,760
I just had a car accident.

151
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,760
I don't know how I got here.

152
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,160
Where is this place?

153
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Another one in jail.

154
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,960
This maid dressed too little.

155
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,430
You shouldn't look at her at will.

156
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,230
She dressed too weirdly

157
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,760
to be one of us.

158
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,830
I have seen many people from neighboring states,

159
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,900
Bai Wuchen, the Minister of Rituals of Virgo with telekinetic powers.

160
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,560
but I've never seen a person like this.

161
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,430
So simply dressed,

162
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,160
she is really suspicious.

163
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,830
Probably an assassin.

164
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,360
Xi Fenglie, the servant of Prince Chen from Sagittarius with fire-control skill.

165
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,030
Who...

166
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,960
Who would choose a girl to be an assassin?

167
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,430
Zhang Tianzheng, the Imperial Astronomer from Libra with compulsion skill.

168
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,960
She doesn't have sharp weapons on her

169
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,500
and is not a martial arts practicer,

170
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,430
so she is not likely to be an assassin.

171
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,030
But she dressed like this

172
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
and sneaked into the water.

173
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,830
She must have had some plan.

174
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,630
Mei Daren, Minister of revenue of Taurus, expert at actuarial science

175
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,300
I see.

176
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,560
Look at her boots.

177
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,430
Laces can increase service life

178
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,960
and save fabric.

179
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,960
It will save a large amount of money

180
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,630
for the palace if we popularize them.

181
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,830
Would you mind not interrupting?

182
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,630
You are the one who is the most talkative every time.

183
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,960
It's Shang Yu asked me

184
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,160
why she dressed so weirdly in the first place.

185
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,830
Your Majesty, how do we dispose her?

186
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,100
Behead

187
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,760
her.

188
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,560
You can't do that.

189
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,500
What?

190
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,160
Take her away.

191
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,900
Did you get my permission?

192
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,830
Uncle,

193
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,960
you overeached a lot.

194
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,900
I didn't have that kind of nerve.

195
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,960
She is a dancing girl in my Mansion,

196
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,030
not an assassin.

197
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,830
She followed me into the palace

198
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,960
and accidentally fell into the water to cause such a fuss.

199
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,500
Please forgive her.

200
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,030
What if I don't?

201
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,360
What If I insist on beheading her?

202
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,300
I've made a rather clear explanation.

203
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,960
if she makes some trouble again,

204
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,830
I'll take the responsibility.

205
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,630
Such an attitude problem, Uncle!

206
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,760
Your Majesty, if one of my family or subordinates

207
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,360
makes any mistake,

208
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,500
I have the right to punish them on my own.

209
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,830
Even she should be arrested,

210
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,360
you don't need to bother it.

211
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,230
Moreover,

212
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,030
I have the military power.

213
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,830
She is suspected of rebellion.

214
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,960
Are you sure you want to protect her?

215
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,630
Your Majesty, do you think

216
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,030
I'm going to rebel against you?

217
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,030
You!

218
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,430
Suspicious of even me?

219
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,360
If there are no other issues,

220
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,160
I may take my leave.

221
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,830
Take her away.

222
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,160
Uncle, you have to protect her life well.

223
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,760
Next time,

224
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,230
She may not be so lucky.

225
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,830
Your Majesty, your nose is bleeding.

226
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,360
Send for the imperial doctor.

227
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,300
No need.

228
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,500
I feel a bit dry.

229
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,360
Then I'll make you some tea to quench the heat.

230
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,360
No need.

231
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,360
A dancing girl?

232
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,560
I'm not a three-year-old child.

233
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,630
It is weird.

234
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,630
The rumor goes that the Prince Chen is handsome, romantic

235
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,700
and a well-known gentleman,

236
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,230
but I never heard he had a special preference for

237
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,160
a woman.

238
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,360
With my spies,

239
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,900
if he had a new lover

240
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,430
I would have known that.

241
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,030
Your Majesty, it's really strange.

242
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
I'll definitely find out.

243
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,160
Dehai,

244
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,030
has Fang Jian been leading a rather leisurely life recently?

245
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Yes.

246
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,700
I got you.

247
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,360
Fang Jian, the Guard Commander for the emperor, of Scorpio with rebouncing skill.

248
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,700
Ready.

249
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,230
Pull.

250
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,760
Loose.

251
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,160
Good, very good.

252
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,500
Lord Fang is really good.

253
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,630
Very Good.

254
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,960
Lord Mei,

255
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,300
what's your business?

256
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,630
Lord Fang,

257
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,030
His Majesty is really concerned about the Prince Chen.

258
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,430
I have my own plans.

259
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
No virtues at all.

260
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
Don't hear me wrong. I was praising you.

261
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,360
Wait. Lord Fang. Wait for me.
