1
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,630
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

2
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,630
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 04

4
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,960
Take him away.

5
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,230
Your Highness, why are you here?

6
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,830
Can't you see?

7
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,030
I am here to save you guys.

8
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,560
I honestly can't.

9
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,630
Just relax.

10
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,630
It's all under my control.

11
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,100
Your Highness, what's your next step?

12
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,360
I don't know yet.

13
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,500
Force him to drink it all.

14
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,430
The action is beyond imagination.

15
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,960
Put me down.

16
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,560
Put me down!

17
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,360
I said, put me down!

18
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,630
Put me down.

19
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,160
You put me down!

20
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,360
Your Highness,

21
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,560
why do you carry this vicious woman?

22
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,500
It's a pity to kill

23
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,830
such a beautiful Missy.

24
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,500
Well, how about Xifeng Lie?

25
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,760
He is still unconscious.

26
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,360
Why is the medicine not working?

27
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,960
The poison of Black Pearl is cureless.

28
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,500
Save it.

29
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,960
Where is your Xun?

30
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,430
You knocked Xun out of my hands.

31
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,030
I forgot it.

32
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,430
Does whistle work?

33
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,430
I don't know how to do that.

34
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
I can't.

35
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,030
Miss Xia, you need make them stop now.

36
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,300
I can't control them without Xun.

37
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
They don't even let me go.

38
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,100
Shang Yu, you go first with Xifeng Lie. Hurry up!

39
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,960
But how do you cope with them?

40
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,360
There is no but. Otherwise no one can get away with.

41
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Go! Now!

42
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
Come on!

43
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,360
There is a withered leaf on your head.

44
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

45
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,030
Aren't you cold?

46
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,830
Your Highness, Pharmacist Bilian has asked to see you.

47
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,160
Accoring to Grandma-Empress‘s order,

48
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,250
Your Highness and concubine are required to

49
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,150
enter into the palace to discuss wedding.

50
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,960
what is she up to?

51
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Feifei,

52
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,630
I had many misunderstandings to you.

53
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,160
You and Chen are a perfect match.

54
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,830
I won't hinder you any more.

55
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,830
And I am looking forward to getting a grandchild as soon as possible.

56
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,700
I...I won't accept these gifts.

57
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,830
What I want most is that

58
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,360
the innocence of Ophiuchus can be proven by you.

59
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,430
Look at yourself,

60
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,230
an unmarried maiden,

61
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,300
lives outright in Palace of the Prince Chen.

62
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
It may cause people to gossip.

63
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,100
While you are married with Prince Chen in a decent way,

64
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,700
I will investigate this case as you want.

65
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,360
Stop playing.

66
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,830
Come on, hurry up! I am so annoyed by you.

67
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,960
With your slow pace,

68
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,100
When we will get back to Zodiac State.

69
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,430
Both of us will die here if we can't find the source of water.

70
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,360
Are you afraid?

71
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,430
If you obediently took that medicine,

72
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,960
we would not be here.

73
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,230
So you manipulated the crazies all the time.

74
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,830
Looks like your brain is still working.

75
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,700
Okay. Well, you are thirsty, right? Just keep moving.

76
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,030
Put more firewood, please.

77
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,630
Do it quickly, Missy.

78
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,830
Someone is in the house.

79
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,760
How do you figure out, boss?

80
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,430
Are you blind?

81
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,960
It's obvious that someone ate the stuff of boiler.

82
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,160
Who has the balls and dares to enter into thief's nest.

83
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,960
What thief's nest? We are bandits.

84
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,230
There is no reason to close the deal

85
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,560
when they walked right into the house.

86
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,030
Give to me.

87
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,760
What the hell am I doing with this?

88
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,160
The smoke of weakness.

89
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,630
Oh, right.

90
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,230
Let's go!

91
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,560
Are you okay?

92
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,560
No need to worry.

93
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,830
I am tough.

94
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,760
Why do you rescue me?

95
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,760
Anyway, I just can't leave you to die and do nothing.

96
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,360
I never owe anyone,

97
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,900
so I am doing this

98
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,830
is to repay you.

99
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,360
If you dare to make a move, I...

100
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,960
I would kill you.

101
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,360
From now on, I am yours.

102
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,430
You have to be responsible to me.

103
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,360
Okay, sure.

104
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,160
I will do that.

105
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,630
I bow in respect before Grandma-Empress.

106
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,430
Your Majesty, step forward.

107
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,760
I have something to discuss with you.

108
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,160
The marriage of Prince Chen is coming,

109
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,560
and I want you to serve as a witness at the wedding.

110
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
A chief witness.

111
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,030
Prince Chen has assisted Your Majesty so well.

112
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,760
Your Majesty should be a chief witness at Prince Chen's wedding

113
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,560
in case of people rumoring.

114
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,960
Luo Feifei has the chance to marry to Prince Chen

115
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,700
with a terrific luck from her previous life.

116
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,830
Do you have any orders, Grandma-Empress?

117
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,160
No, you may leave.

118
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,760
Then I excuse myself.

119
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,900
Farewell with respect to Your Majesty.

120
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,300
Wish Your Majesty understand my thoughts with efforts.

121
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,630
Your Highness has set the place of wedding in Qiye Building.

122
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,630
Yanran,

123
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,360
why are you here?

124
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,430
I thought you were still angry at me.

125
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,300
I didn't.

126
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,630
Your Highness chose you.

127
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,230
Not you chose Your Highness.

128
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,760
I have no reason to be angry.

129
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,560
His Highness didn't choose me.

130
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,500
It's just our little plot.

131
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,160
A plot?

132
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,360
How dare you!

133
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,760
What else can we do?

134
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,560
While Grandma-Empress is forcing us,

135
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,900
we can't take our marriage as a joke.

136
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,630
Besides,

137
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,500
it's hilarious to put two persons together

138
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,160
who don't love each other.

139
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,760
Your Majesty, please have something to eat.

140
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,360
I am not hungry, and you may retreat.

141
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,360
Your Majesty.

142
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,900
Are you trying to disobey my orders?

143
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,360
I have to say something

144
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,030
even if you kill me.

145
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,100
I have served Your Majesty for many years.

146
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,500
I know exactly

147
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,430
what you are thinking.

148
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,100
What you behaved before Luo Feifei came here,

149
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,100
then how you conduct yourself after she comes here.

150
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,830
You two went through a lot all together.

151
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,760
Now.

152
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,960
Leave.

153
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,300
What you are looking at.

154
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,560
My dear guests, which one do you prefer? Noodles or rices?

155
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,430
We get everything to meet your needs.

156
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,760
Prepare some solid food and water for me, shopkeeper.

157
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,030
And I want to buy that camel.

158
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,030
Did we...

159
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,830
Do not mention about that again,

160
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,700
When will you stop being so savage?

161
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,760
Being soft like a female.

162
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,160
Otherwise no man want you near them.

163
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,900
Well. What did we do last night?

164
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,230
Just agreed on dropping it. Stop talking.

165
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,960
Okay, okay.

166
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,830
Nothing happened between us last night.

167
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,100
That's great. Good to know.

168
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,630
What do you mean?

169
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,630
You disgust me?

170
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,430
In that way, do you want something to happen between us?

171
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,230
I...

172
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,630
I have been hurt.

173
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,900
And you still make me walk.

174
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,500
what a vicious woman.

175
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,030
So brutal and cruel.

176
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,100
Your Majesty, they come back.

177
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,160
Lord Xi and Lord Shang are already back.

178
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,700
Lord Xi?

179
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,900
Your Majesty, I have brought Xifeng Lie back,

180
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,100
and put him in Palace of the Prince Chen.

181
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,560
How is he doing right now?

182
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,300
Xifeng lie goes mad because of poisoning,

183
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,160
and symptoms are the same as Lord Luo.

184
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,300
Any idea about what kind of poison and who did that?

185
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,760
I am about to report to you.

186
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,630
This insect is named Black Pearl

187
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,030
which is stinky to death.

188
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,230
But the smell disappears

189
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,900
when it is with this flower.

190
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
However, it makes people go mad.

191
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,630
Orion State is behind all of these.

192
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,630
Orion State was defeated back then.

193
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,830
And it's also Grandma-Empress's motherland.

194
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,360
I believe Orion State pretended they were Ophiuchus,

195
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,430
then created disputes and caused civil war.

196
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,430
I see.

197
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,360
Aye.

198
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,360
Yi'er,

199
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,360
You are saying Orion State

200
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,030
is behind all of these.

201
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,830
I suspect

202
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,500
the death of former emperor and the murder of former Constellation Lord

203
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,960
are definitely connected to them.

204
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,160
Do you have any proof?

205
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,830
You!

206
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,500
Your Majesty doesn't have to dispute with a kid.

207
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,560
You may go back first.

208
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,160
The thing comes all of a sudden,

209
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,160
and involves too many people.

210
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,430
Then I may excuse myself.

211
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,900
Just behave yourself.

212
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,830
You are welcome.

213
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,300
Doctor, how is Xifeng Lie doing?

214
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,830
Answer to Your Highness,

215
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,560
The wound of Lord Shang doesn't matter.

216
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,830
I will write a prescription later.

217
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,830
Following this and recuperating for a little while, Lord Shang will get well soon.

218
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,230
But the poison inside of Lord Xifeng

219
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,160
is the same as  Ophiuchus's.

220
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,230
The only thing I can do is to control disease rate,

221
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,630
but it can't be cured.

222
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,500
Thank you, Doctor Liu.

223
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,630
Then I am on my way to fill a prescription, Your Highness.

224
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,100
I... I come with you.

225
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,360
Little attendant,

226
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,030
Don't be so hurry.

227
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,630
We still get another highly skilled doctor here.

228
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Is he serious?

229
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,560
Yes.

230
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,630
Pretty bad.

231
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,030
I thought sunburn of desert was severe.

232
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,500
I didn't expect that it not only lacked of water,

233
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,430
but also had strong ultraviolet light.

234
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,900
So harmful to skin.

235
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,700
But you don't need to worry about it.

236
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,830
I get Simple Xiaomihu.

237
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,360
Simple Xiaomihu facial mask. Natural water permeable facial skin.

238
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,700
Let's save Xifeng Lie's skin together.

239
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Xifeng Lie, though you are a male, you still need to be delicate.

240
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,160
Feifei

241
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,030
Miss Luo, look at this situation, you...

242
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,500
I am just joking.

243
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,760
I am reluctant to use it on him even if you ask me.

244
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,830
What an easy thing.

245
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,360
I use extraordinary ability to save him.

246
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,030
Feifei.

247
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,430
Feifei, are you okay?
