1
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,600
Oh! My Emperor

2
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,500
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co.,Ltd.

3
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,500
Episode 15

4
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,270
Fine. You can leave.

5
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,920
Accept my greetings, Miss Luo.

6
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,770
Beitang Dragon Egg!

7
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,370
Feifei.

8
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,420
How dare you still come here?

9
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,800
I dare to do anything.

10
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,970
You know what? My father won't let me go outside.

11
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,350
I used my power of invisibility and rode over here.

12
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,820
I'm exhausted.

13
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,220
Quick! Give me one of your facial masks.

14
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,670
You set me up like that and still want my mask?

15
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,350
No way.

16
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,350
I just wanted to bring you and His Majesty together.

17
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,570
Feifei.

18
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,050
Feifei, Feifei.

19
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,050
Hands off.

20
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,920
Look at you!

21
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,770
Go away! Back off!

22
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,570
I know she has bad temper.

23
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,900
But I don't expect that her temper is so bad today.

24
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,150
The girl who is jilted is the most terrifying.

25
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,800
What are you doing in broad daylight?

26
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,350
What are you looking at?

27
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,570
Arrest them.

28
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,920
Being jilted?

29
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,150
I've heard that she broke up with Bai Wuchen.

30
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,750
How can you call that a "break up"?

31
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,270
They've never been in a relationship.

32
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,670
You're a layman.

33
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,670
The relationship status of them

34
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,000
can't be hidden from me.

35
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,770
Well, let's perform a good deed every day.

36
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,170
Go and help them.

37
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,170
Go!

38
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,750
What are you doing?

39
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,070
Are you going to torture me?

40
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,150
Torture my ass.

41
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Put on this facial mask.

42
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,400
There are holes for your eyes, nose and mouth.

43
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,700
All are uncovered. You can't be suffocated.

44
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,920
Come on. Don't be afraid.

45
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Come on, come on.

46
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,700
Is that nice?

47
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,920
I don't need this.

48
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,520
Well, I know you look like

49
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,800
a tomboy all the time.

50
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,000
But

51
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,100
your figure just betrays you.

52
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,820
How many girls out there would envy your body curve?

53
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,900
You...

54
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,550
All right. Shengnan,

55
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,720
this is the special local product

56
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,100
brought by Feifei. It's called Xiaomihu facial mask.

57
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,570
I don't like it.

58
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
You can't tell until you use one.

59
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,850
How can you know without trying?

60
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,620
As a girl,

61
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,550
you must show your real thought.

62
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,370
Do you know?

63
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,270
My mask!

64
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,670
Your biggest problem is that

65
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,400
you never say what you want.

66
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,000
What are you talking about?

67
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,450
I'm saying that you're untruthful.

68
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,400
and always push others away.

69
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,920
I think Bai Wuchen is good enough.

70
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,170
If a man

71
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,500
only likes joking around all day long

72
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,950
without improving his own kung fu skills,

73
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,950
you want to accept him?

74
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,950
You're looking for a man

75
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,170
who can fight for you?

76
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,850
It's more important that he likes you!

77
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,950
Yes. Do you know that there is a saying goes,

78
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,100
"The precious things are easy to get but perfect lover is hard to find"?

79
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,870
If my lover can treat me like that,

80
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,370
I would do anything.

81
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,370
Miss Xie,

82
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,120
I don't expect that you have such great passion toward His Majesty.

83
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,470
That wood doesn't deserve you.

84
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,700
I'm not talking about...

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,220
Never mind!

86
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,550
Shengnan, if you always behave like this,

87
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,220
without any make-up,

88
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,900
all day long,

89
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,220
hanging out like a man,

90
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,670
I'm telling you

91
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,670
that you cannot find a husband.

92
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,420
Who is a man?

93
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,400
You're not like a man?

94
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,720
How are you, Grandma-Empress?

95
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,300
Moran, there is no outsiders here.

96
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,800
You don't need to be overcautious.

97
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,250
Yes.

98
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,920
Moran was entrusted by the deceased Emperor to

99
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,670
assist His Majesty with states affairs.

100
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,670
You're really do it with great effort.

101
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,000
His Majesty was born with great intelligence and can take the responsibility.

102
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,770
I can't take credit for that.

103
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,950
Recently, I've heard that

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,800
you can't get along with His Majesty.

105
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,450
Do you need me to talk to His Majesty about it?

106
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,470
I appreciate your gracious care and concern, Grandma-Empress.

107
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,150
Your Majesty and I can always live together at peace.

108
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,770
Then I feel relieved.

109
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,520
His Majesty is just a few years younger than you

110
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,820
but he's not determined enough like you.

111
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,750
Please help me to assist him.

112
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,670
I won't make you disappointed, Grandma-Empress.

113
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,100
You don't know without trying.

114
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,220
Stop there!

115
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,570
Well,

116
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,170
do you want to have a cup of tea with me?

117
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,520
It doesn't matter if you refuse. Never mind, I...

118
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,520
Yes, yes, yes!

119
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,220
Yes.

120
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,570
Then...

121
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,750
This hairpin is invaluable.

122
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,100
If you two do want to buy it,

123
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,620
I sell it to you five C-coins cheaper.

124
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,850
What do you think?

125
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,850
Why hesitate? Just buy it.

126
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,700
What's your decision?

127
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,250
I really can't do it.

128
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,800
I would lose money if it's cheaper.

129
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,800
I can't. We'll buy it if it's cheaper.

130
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,870
You're so...

131
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,620
Vendor.

132
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,250
I'm telling you,

133
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,870
if you hold back when there is something good,

134
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,070
you lose it sooner or later.

135
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,200
Dali,

136
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,200
whatever you like,

137
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,670
I will get it to you as soon as possible.

138
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,120
How can you know

139
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,400
what I like?

140
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,000
Say it out.

141
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,400
Say it out.

142
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,320
If you can't say it out,

143
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,800
I will kill you.

144
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,400
Hey, what am I expecting?

145
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,700
What am I expecting?

146
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,150
Minister, there are large number of lunatics in the East Street.

147
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,520
Follow me.

148
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,750
Dali!

149
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,270
Can't you hear me?

150
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,250
Come to help.

151
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,870
Don't be afraid if you would fall in love with me.

152
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,220
Miss him again?

153
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,470
It's been a long time.

154
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,470
I know. I know.

155
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,920
But you just have crush on someone like this...

156
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,020
You told me you had a plan last time.

157
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,870
Tell me now, what's your plan?

158
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,550
You go first.

159
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,150
I meet him and catch you later.

160
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,400
The Back Mountain. I will wait you there.

161
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,400
Stop.

162
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,150
Let me help. Back off.

163
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,800
Arrest them.

164
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,320
Yes.

165
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,450
Xiang Wentian!

166
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,320
Xiang Wentian!

167
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,650
Uncle Xiang!

168
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,320
Xiang Wentian!

169
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,370
Uncle Xiang!

170
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,250
Dali,

171
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,800
Are you alright?

172
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,720
I'm fine. Not big deal.

173
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,600
How about you?

174
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,120
You care about me.

175
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,320
How can you still joke around at this moment? You

176
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,000
wasn't hurt badly, right?

177
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,520
So badly.

178
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,150
I know what's spreading in the wind.

179
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,270
It's dandelion.

180
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,400
There you are.

181
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,550
My lord,

182
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,950
I was wondering.

183
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,450
The reason why the Ophiuchus people are manic

184
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,700
is that the Constellation Lord

185
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,520
did not return to the position this time.

186
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,100
Since you've shown up as the new Constellation Lord,

187
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,950
maybe you can change this.

188
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,100
Constellation Lord?

189
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,220
What's a Constellation Lord? Is it cool?

190
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,600
Of course.

191
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,820
Our Ophiuchus can absorb others' power.

192
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,320
And especially you, as the Lord, have

193
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,000
the power of Mercury retrograde.

194
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,350
It's, so to speak, the strongest

195
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,950
among all the thirteen constellations of Zodiac State.

196
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,700
I only know that a young idler

197
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,070
would be afraid of Mercury retrograde in old age.

198
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,120
Now everything just makes sense.

199
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,670
What good is that?

200
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,220
That's because your power

201
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,600
is uncontrolled in childhood

202
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,220
without long-time strict training

203
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,170
like those former Constellation Lords.

204
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,720
Therefore, you can't control your power yet.

205
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,200
You're saying

206
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,150
I'm an amateur.

207
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,300
using the power randomly.

208
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,300
Of course.

209
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,100
My Lord, you can't not only control

210
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,370
when to use the power,

211
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,550
but also use it on whom.

212
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,250
Besides, it's definitely not a bad thing

213
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,870
that you have the power of Mercury retrograde.

214
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,370
For example, if one has a wound,

215
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,520
we can use the power

216
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,250
to heal it.

217
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,520
To heal a wound?

218
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,100
That's a bug!

219
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,870
How amazing!

220
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,050
His Highness only takes a shower in the daytime

221
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,500
when he's upset.

222
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,620
What's wrong with him?

223
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,800
Can it heal my mosquito bites?

224
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,100
This is a piece of cake.

225
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:38,800
Look,

226
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,020
it's done.

227
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,120
That's good.

228
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,900
Here, here is another.

229
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,100
Teach me, teach me.

230
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,570
Come on.

231
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,520
Like this.

232
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,970
Just like this. Come on.

233
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,320
What's going on?

234
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,920
It's impossible.

235
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,050
Is it because my power is weak?

236
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,720
You power is great enough.

237
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,020
I felt it just now.

238
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,950
But this bite was

239
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,020
not smaller but bigger.

240
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,470
It's powerful enough.

241
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,670
Maybe there was something wrong when

242
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,700
you were applying it.

243
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,520
And the effect went other places.

244
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,000
Other places?

245
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,500
What,

246
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,100
what's wrong with my invisibility?

247
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:56,650
Who is it?

248
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,670
My Lord, someone is coming.

249
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,150
We're leaving now.

250
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,370
Go.

251
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,920
Something's wrong!

252
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,570
Feifei.

253
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,120
It's you.

254
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,450
Your Highness,

255
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,400
what a coincidence!

256
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,400
We can even meet here.

257
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
By accident.

258
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,720
No more explanation.

259
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,150
I know what's in your mind.

260
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,570
What do you know?

261
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,850
I, I really don't know.

262
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,300
Feifei, I'm kind of regret to send you into the palace.

263
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,150
Because I suddenly find out that

264
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,470
the figure of you

265
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,670
has already engraved in my mind.

266
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,820
And it can never be erased.

267
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,300
Can you understand now?

268
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,270
Children shouldn't watch this.

269
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,420
I am sorry, Your Highness.

270
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,970
I really don't like you. Get to go.

271
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,850
Yanran!

272
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,600
Yanran!

273
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,620
Your Majesty.

274
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,400
Is this the complete list of casualty?

275
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,070
Yes, I've checked it myself, Your Majesty.

276
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,270
The casualties must be comforted and compensated well.

277
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,570
Don't miss anyone.

278
00:20:59,420 --> 00:20:59,800
Yes.

279
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:04,870
Prince Tang.

280
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:05,850
Minister Mei.

281
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:08,920
Brother,

282
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,320
Yanran and Missy went shopping

283
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,450
and haven't come back.

284
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,450
Here is the list of casualty.

285
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,070
Their name are not on it.

286
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,870
You may go to tell Dehai

287
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,470
to discipline the palace people.

288
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,870
Tell them not to go out without purpose.

289
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,720
I know, brother.

290
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,720
The Constellation Lord Conference will begin soon.

291
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,700
And you don't need to get prepared?

292
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,350
I'm leaving.

293
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
The Constellation Lord Conference will begin soon, Your Highness.

294
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,400
Alright. Prepare the carriage.

295
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,700
Yes.
