Episode 09

4
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,520
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

5
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,800
There are many little eyes,

6
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,520
hanging in the sky and glittering.

7
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,720
Look like plenty little eyes.

8
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,050
Take a look. There are so many stars.

9
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,750
I always think

10
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,250
you get many secrets that I don't know.

11
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,700
About Jiacheng, you mentioned before.

12
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,550
Who on earth is he?

13
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:52,970
Jiacheng,

14
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,970
is a really, really handsome boy.

15
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,620
So gentle and considerate.

16
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,650
More importantly, he is talented.

17
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,050
When I used to go to his concert,

18
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,970
I was... Concert?

19
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,970
What is the concert?

20
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:04,970
Well,

21
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,720
it is someone singing on the stage.

22
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,250
Lots of people are sitting off the stage.

23
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,000
Everyone takes a fluorescent stick

24
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,670
which can glitter.

25
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,600
And wave like this.

26
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,920
Then looking at it from a distance,

27
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,300
it's like the galaxy.

28
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,300
So beautiful.

29
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,770
Do I really look like him?

30
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,450
Definitely.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,750
Otherwise how could I think that

32
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,050
Jiacheng comes here with me together.

33
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,170
So you must miss him very much.

34
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,370
Besides, I also miss my dad,

35
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,950
my phone and computer.

36
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,920
I miss everything.

37
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,900
And miss the crowd of my female friends

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,170
who chase Jiacheng with me.

39
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,620
If they know

40
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,970
I am with a guy who looks like

41
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,850
Jiacheng,

42
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,150
they certainly will extremely be jealous of me.

43
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,520
Who exactly is Jiacheng?

44
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,550
Is he an emperor as well?

45
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,470
Who wants to be an emperor.

46
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,320
Jiacheng get many talents.

47
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,200
He can sing, dance and act.

48
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,200
Everything is great on him.

49
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,950

How could be.

126
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,550
Not ugly, right?

127
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes.

128
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,220
Then why we have nothing but lying down all the night.

129
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,770
Lying down all the night.

130
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,770
Share some details with me.

131
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,670
Just lying.

132
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,900
Nothing happened.

133
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,470
Do you think there is something wrong with his brain?

134
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,100
Nope.

135
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,120
Or some physical problems with him?

136
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,820
Physical problems.

137
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,000
It still doesn't make sense.

138
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,000
If he has physical problems,

139
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,070
we can cure him.

140
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,050
What am I?

141
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,000
A medical worker.

142
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,400
If there is something wrong, just cure it. No need to be afraid.

143
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,920
Feifei, why do you pull a long face?

144
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,400
Ophiuchus's grievance was just redressed.

145
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,400
And you honorably got the throne of lord.

146
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,400
Be happier.

147
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,400
I would like to,

148
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,370
but one trouble never comes alone.

149
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,350
Grandma-Empress made a misarrangement of match last time.

150
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,350
You knew it.

151
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,650
Uncle Chen had a conversation with her.

152
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,920
She did agree to postpone the wedding day.

153
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,550
Keep postponing

154
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,900
till today,

155
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
it still has no results.

156
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,470
I almost forget if you don't talk about it.

157
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:16,770
Grandma-Empress

158
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,870
doesn't solve the matter, though it's been delayed for a long time.

159
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,750
If she regrets,

160
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,100
then what should we do?.

161
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,570
Actually, I have a solution.

162
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,970
Say it.

163
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,770
I am not sure whether it's good to do in this way.

164
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,370
I am listening.

165
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,050
Think about it. what does the elders like?

166
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,620
Kids.

167
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,420
Kids?

168
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,820
If I carry Dragon Egg's baby firstly,

169
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,020
she will get the great grandson.

170
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,200
There is no way that

171
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,920
she kills both her own great grandson and me together.

172
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,900
Feifei, it's wrong.

173
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,170
You make a mistake.

174
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,750
You can't play the game of great grandson.

175
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,800
If she gets great grandson...

176
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,800
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

177
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,670
In that way,

178
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,670
the whole case can't be solved.

179
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,020
I have a favor to ask for your help, Master Su. Please.

180
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,770
I want...

181
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,770
I want to...

182
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,170
No matter what you are thinking,

183
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,170
you are immature.

184
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,720
Something you shouldn't think about it.

185
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,870
Just don't.

186
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,670
But,

187
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,670
I didn't say what I want to do.

188
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,700
You have no lack of money.

189
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,220
So the thing asked for my help...

190
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,470
Master Su, there is something you don't know.

191
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,050
I have spent all day

192
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,120
with Xifeng Lie who acted so slowly.

193
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:02,870
It kills me.

194
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,600
Moreover,

195
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,300
the way I see it, you and His Highness,

196
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,350
Your Majesty and Miss Luo,

197
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,750
I am so curious about what it's like falling into love.

198
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,470
Master Su, I am mature enough.

199
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,020
Please take me to enrich my experience.

200
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,070
Gain experience.

201
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,750
Good.

202
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,770
You little attendant.

203
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,950
Deal. I am joyful today.

204
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,550
And you need to read my book carefully,

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,050
from chapter one to five of "sex encyclopedia".

206
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,070
Take a close look at it.

207
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,820
I will take you to broaden your horizons tonight.

208
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,200
Feifei,

209
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,150
I told you everything about Your Majesty,

210
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,250
man and boy.

211
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,270
Should you, like, repay me?

212
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,920
Meimei, we are best friends.

213
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,870
Best friends can't ask for money.

214
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,450
It would hurt our feelings.

215
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,120
By contrast, talking about money wouldn't hurt feelings.

216
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,350
No money, no feelings.

217
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,850
Do you lack of money so badly?

218
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,850
I am just wondering,

219
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,850
well, in case someday I am gone,

220
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,070
I have the ability to hoard something for Your Majesty.

221
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,350
Then he will miss me once again when he spends money.

222
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,850
Listening to your words makes me feel weird.

223
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,320
Nothing weird.

224
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,500
You tell me, is there anything more real

225
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,830
than Constellation coin on the earth?

226
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,170
Yes.

227
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,150
Our friendship.

228
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,350
It's so reliable and real.

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,970
Stop jabbering.

230
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,450
Come on.

231
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Okay, okay.

232
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,300
I want constellation coin. Means money. What is it?

233
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,120
This is Xiaomihu facial mask.

234
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,700
Do you see the formula behind it?

235
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,250
Take it and have a research.

236
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,770
When you figure out how to make it, you will

237
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,770
make big money by selling it here.

238
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,120
That's great.

239
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,150
Feifei,

240
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,970
I knew it. You are my best friend.

241
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,200
Best friend.

242
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,070
So would you like to do something

243
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,720
for your best friend?

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,770
Well, it depends whether you get other formulas.

245
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,050
What kind of formula?

246
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,100
You will get your share when it's done.

247
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,420
Tell you what, Feifei.

248
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,920
I am

249
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,570
very, very warmhearted.

250
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,450
Yes, you are.

251
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,450
Just say it. How could I help you?

252
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,550
You will hide under the desk later,

253
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,650
and pretend to be a hooligan.

254
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,900
Dragon Egg will rescue me like a hero,

255
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,620
then...

256
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,300
Feifei, you are looking for me?

257
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,370
Well, the weather today is good.

258
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,470
I think we haven't seen each other for a while.

259
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,350
So how are you these days?

260
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,570
We were together yesterday, weren't we?

261
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,200
Master Mei.

262
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,200
Why do you call Master Mei?

263
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,620
Just considering the name of Master Mei

264
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,500
is so cute.

265
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,150
Master Mei is a coward.

266
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,070
He can't be regarded as a person.

267
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,220
Stop beating me.

268
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,070
Your Majesty, it's me. Stop.

269
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,020
It's me, Your Majesty. Stop hitting on me.

270
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,120
Stop.

271
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:32,700
Master Mei.

272
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,000
Meimei.

273
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,300
Come on and take a look.

274
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
Pass not to miss.

275
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
Porcelain, good porcelain.

276
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,250
I am from Zodiac State.

277
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,570
I am from Perseids State.

278
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,870
I am from Hercules State.

279
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,400
I come from Ursa Major State.

280
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,850
I come from Aquarius State.

281
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,320
I come from Orion State.

282
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,650
Master Su, how do you take

283
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,570
such a delicate and pretty attendant to come here today?

284
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,800
He is gonna fascinate lots of girls.

285
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,570
Yuanniang always has a good sight.

286
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,850
This is my little brother.

287
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,320
Take him to gain experience today.

288
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,970
You'd better take the best show out

289
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,520
to impress us.

290
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,700
Sure, certainly.

291
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,120
Master Su, do you think

292
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,200
I can find a girl I like here?

293
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,000
I read it in the "sex encyclopedia".

294
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,850
This place has courtesans.

295
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,620
However,

296
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,920
I don't even see a courtesan.

297
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,470
The requirement of meeting the best courtesan

298
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,850
is to know to recite poems and make couplets.

299
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,920
Can you do that?

300
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,350
I can, and I want to meet the courtesan.

301
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,150
The childe is seeking for courtesans.

302
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,420
As known to all, Hongluan Brothels

303
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,300
is top-notch in the world.

304
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,450
But few people all over the world know that

305
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,170
the best courtesan is here.

306
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,800
Your opinion?

307
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,570
It takes much money to meet the courtesan.

308
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,750
You are just a little attendant,

309
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,720
You don't have resources to raise enough money.

310
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,400
Master Su, well.

311
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,400
You are the owner of Hongluan Brothels.

312
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,170
How about

313
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,650
charging for free?

314
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,950
You little attendant, a smart boy.

315
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:52,950
You don't learn something useful,

316
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,750
just as Your Highness,

317
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,750
the one thing you learnt is to stop being polite with me.

318
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,100
Fine, you sure you want to meet the best courtesan?

319
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,350
Yes.

320
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,970
Then follow me, Childe.

321
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,000
Morning.

322
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,600
I'm yours in the future.

323
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,000
Your should be responsible for me.

324
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,900
I'll be responsible for you.
