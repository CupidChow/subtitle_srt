1
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,600
Oh! My Emperor

2
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,500
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd.

3
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,550
Episode 16

4
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,270
Do you want to stand there during the meeting, lord?

5
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,520
I have one thing to report, Your Majesty.

6
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:44,650
What's that?

7
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,870
Do you remember

8
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,400
who's the former owner of this chair, Your Majesty?

9
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,850
Of course. It belongs to the Constellation Lord of Ophiuchus.

10
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,700
Yes, it's the Ophiuchus's chair.

11
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,620
The Ophiuchus has provoked lots of riots recently,

12
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,150
hurting many innocent people.

13
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,650
The duty of the thirteen Constellation Lords

14
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,870
is to protect our people.

15
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,650
However, the Ophiuchus people keep

16
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,200
doing harm to those ordinary people.

17
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,800
So in my opinion,

18
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,150
the chair is no longer needed.

19
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,120
Then according to Uncle Chen,

20
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,070
this chair should be removed.

21
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,270
Don't you think it should, Your Majesty?

22
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,970
Right. It's a big decision.

23
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,400
It shouldn't be done in a hasty way.

24
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Let's vote for it.

25
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,500
And majority rules.

26
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,870
How about that?

27
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,650
Alright.

28
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,550
Let's vote, everyone.

29
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,320
The result is clear.

30
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,570
Six to five.

31
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,300
Then we can remove this chair, can't we?

32
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,850
Yanran!

33
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:42,850
Yanran!

34
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,100
What are you doing here?

35
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,400
Did the guards outside do their job?

36
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,620
How can they just let someone uninvited in?

37
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,700
No, Xiaohe, I'm looking for Yanran.

38
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,820
My lady is the daughter of Prime Minister.

39
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,920
You can't address her without a title.

40
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,820
Xiaohe,

41
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,050
are you on your period?

42
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,970
Xiaohe, this is serious.

43
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,350
Is Yanran back?

44
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,350
No, and I'm busy here.

45
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,600
Be my guest.

46
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,420
Xiaohe, I will go other places and check.

47
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,420
Let me know if she's back.

48
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,950
It looks more balanced now.

49
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,800
We can discuss the tournament.

50
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,000
According to the rules of the ancestors,

51
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,170
the final should at least be five against five.

52
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,850
Since the two signs of the final don't have enough players,

53
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,420
the four signs are divided into

54
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,070
two teams again.

55
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,820
Let's do it.

56
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,550
It's weird.

57
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,450
Why has Xie Yanran not come yet?

58
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,570
Since Xie Yanran is absent,

59
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,600
without her vote,

60
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,220
we can only continue the meeting tonight.

61
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,020
Feifei,

62
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,920
you've become more and more impudent.

63
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,820
You dare to come here

64
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,200
without my permission.

65
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,170
Your Majesty.

66
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,470
Why are you here?

67
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,250
Your Majesty,

68
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,120
Grandma-Empress sent me to serve you.

69
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,450
Your Majesty!

70
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,590
Your Majesty...

71
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,220
do you dislike me so much?

72
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,000
which part of Luo Feifei is better than me?

73
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,850
Why can't you just look at me for a second?

74
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,200
Get out.

75
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,500
Your Majesty!

76
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,100
Your Majesty, please don't!

77
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,000
Impudent!

78
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,920
Beitang Yi, you asshole!

79
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,500
Impudent!

80
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:19,950
Mark my words,

81
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,870
I only granted a pardon for Grandma-Empress's sake.

82
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:24,870
If you do this again,

83
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,300
nobody can save you.

84
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,620
I'm at fault, Your Majesty.

85
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,650
I won't do it again.

86
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,050
I'm leaving now.

87
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,370
Beitang Yi, asshole!

88
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,750
How can he screw around with Bilian?

89
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,250
What a shameless rapist!

90
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,920
Which part of Bilian is better than me?

91
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,670
A lecherous asshole with bad taste.

92
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,900
What are you doing here?

93
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,270
Beitang men are all assholes.

94
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,220
What have we done?

95
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,350
We three are in demand

96
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,120
in the Zodiac State.

97
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,320
What's wrong with you?

98
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,120
Where were you?

99
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,400
I've heard that there was a riot caused by the Ophiuchus.

100
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,070
My brother was very worry about you.

101
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,150
Your brother?

102
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,650
If he was, he shouldn't have flirted with the maid.

103
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,350
What do you mean by "flirted with the maid"?

104
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,400
Yanran is missing.

105
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,970
I was looking for her everywhere.

106
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,500
But I can't find her.

107
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,920
What? Xie Yanran is missing?

108
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,870
I was wondering why she can't make it in the Constellation Lord Conference.

109
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,520
That's because she's missing.

110
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,870
Alright. No worries.

111
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,420
I am going to tell my brother about it.

112
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,070
He will send the guards to search for her.

113
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,600
Don't worry about it.

114
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,700
Why don't you say anything?

115
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,250
Why don't you like me?

116
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,600
Your Highness, Miss Xie is missing.

117
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,500
His Majesty has already headed to our forest and searches with guards.

118
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,500
You and General Chu also go there and search with Xifeng Lie

119
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,070
Yes.

120
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,120
What are you looking at? Cad!

121
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,320
Give it back!

122
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:57,920
Give back to me.

123
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,470
You, you give it back!

124
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,870
What a madwoman!

125
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,300
You're a madwoman!

126
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,720
You rob my thing and curse me as madwoman.

127
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,900
I will show you today

128
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,420
what a truly madwoman is.

129
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:11,600
Feifei!

130
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,900
Yanran has been here for couples of hours.

131
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,400
It's getting dark if we can't find her soon.

132
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,120
Let go and find her as soon as possible.

133
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,950
Two people for a group. Find the partner yourself.

134
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,050
Shang Yu and Xifeng Lie,

135
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,470
you two go check the place behind.

136
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:31,720
I will go there.

137
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,120
Dali and I are in one group.

138
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,000
I am with...

139
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,720
Big white tooth, I'm going with you.

140
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,950
No way. Okay!

141
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,300
Then three of us are left.

142
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,450
We three can form a group.

143
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's go.

144
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,220
This way.

145
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,250
This way...

146
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,800
Don't cry, my lady.

147
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,500
Don't choke yourself.

148
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,520
Xiaohe, I feel really bad.

149
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,750
Why doesn't he like me?

150
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,920
My lady, it's natural that you feel hurt when carry a torch.

151
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,700
But no worries,

152
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,170
His Majesty won't give you a cold shoulder.

153
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,150
I want to give him a cold shoulder. I dislike him.

154
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,520
Xie Yanran!

155
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,170
Xie Yanran!

156
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,620
Xie Yanran!

157
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,800
Anything?

158
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,850
Nothing.

159
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,150
Keep searching. Okay.

160
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,500
Xie Yanran!

161
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,120
Where is she?

162
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,400
Yanran!

163
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,250
Yanran!

164
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,250
Xie Yanran!

165
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,950
Yanran, Xie Yanran!

166
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,600
Xie Yanran!

167
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,600
Xie Yanran!

168
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,270
Yanran!

169
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,950
Miss Xie! Miss Xie!

170
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:48,700
Xie Yanran!

171
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,450
Why are you running so fast?

172
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,520
How can I follow you?

173
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,120
If you don't run fast,

174
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,120
how can you find Miss Xie?

175
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,120
Miss Xie!

176
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,270
Miss Xie! Come out!

177
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,870
Keep your voice down.

178
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,420
Xie Yanran is an unmarried lady

179
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,800
and the future empress.

180
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,370
It's not appropriate

181
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,370
if you shout out like it.

182
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,520
We've been engaged for a while.

183
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,300
When can we...

184
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,220
Is this the right time to discuss such thing?

185
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,150
Had it coming.

186
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,900
Xie Yanran!

187
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,900
Where is that guy?

188
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,900
It's getting dark

189
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,550
and we find no one.

190
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,570
Xie Yanran!

191
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,570
Miss Xie! Miss Xie!

192
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,350
Miss Xie!

193
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,470
Shang Yu!

194
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
Shang Yu!

195
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,420
Xie Yanran was with you first,

196
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,420
and then was missing in the Back Mountain here.

197
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,070
You must have been to the Palace of the Prince Chen.

198
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,120
Your Majesty, impressive!

199
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,700
After a few days,

200
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,250
you're are a little bit more clever.

201
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,650
Your Majesty

202
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,250
has grown up.

203
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,770
Uncle Chen has grown old.

204
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,370
Your Majesty, we have to find Yanran as soon as possible.

205
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,920
Then you two get married.

206
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,720
So the royal family can be fruitful.

207
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,020
Seniority first.

208
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,620
Uncle Chen, you're still unmarried.

209
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,120
I can wait.

210
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,220
Shang Yu!

211
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,650
Shang Yu, is that you?

212
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,450
Shang Yu!

213
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,970
Shang Yu, stop hiding.

214
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,950
I'm sorry. Get the wrong guy.

215
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,120
Xifeng Lie!

216
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,470
Xifeng Lie!

217
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,300
Miss Xie!

218
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,300
What are you doing?

219
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,120
Dali,

220
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,420
this is the first time you accept my gift.

221
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:30,820
You can dress up like this more often.

222
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,000
Then no one would call you a tomboy.

223
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:34,700
What did you say?

224
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,450
I say...

225
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,300
you definitely look beautiful with this hairpin.

226
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,520
I don't need

227
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,620
such cissy thing.

228
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:53,800
Take away.

229
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,920
You know nothing and you're telling me what to do.

230
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,350
Dali!

231
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,250
What?

232
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,470
I've told what to do by others

233
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,250
all these years in the military camp.

234
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,600
Now even you are telling me what to do.

235
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,600
I didn't mean it.

236
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,150
In my heart,

237
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,020
you're the most beautiful girl.

238
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:23,720
Get out!

239
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,350

Is this related to the manic guys?

00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,520
Buddies,

279
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,270
I was lost before.

280
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,350
I'm leaving now.

Xifeng Lie!

282
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:39,950
Get him.

283
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,500
Get back here.

284
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,420
Shang Yu!

285
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,650
Line up.

286
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,670
Go, go, go!

287
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,420
I can't save him with my clumsy Kungfu.

288
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,420
I should first...
