1
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,960
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

2
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,500
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd

3
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,300
Episode 08

4
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,970
Now the relationship between Beitang Yi and Luo Feifei

5
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,030
become more close.

6
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,160
It's hard to run the plan which tries to

7
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,700
incite the relationship of Ophiuchus and Zodiac State.

8
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,030
Why don't we kill Luo Feifei first.

9
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,330
It will make Beitang Yi sorrowful.

10
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,830
Then we poison him,

11
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,700
and tell the world he died because of depression.

12
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,690
After all, he's my own grandson.

13
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,700
He should have never been

14
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,030
born in this world.

15
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,210
You, Grandma-Empress

16
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,660
Your Majesty and Miss Luo are asking to see you.

17
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,770
Reject.

18
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,910
Hold on,

19
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,240
let Lord Luo come in.

20
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,030
I don't want her to live till tomorrow.

21
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,900
Dragon Egg, I am a little nervous.

22
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,840
You have been to Qingxin Palace so many times.

23
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,100
Nothing is worthy to be nervous.

24
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,430
This time is different.

25
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,360
I come there for my people.

26
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
To earn rights which they are supposed to get.

27
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,110
I wanna them live in Zodiac State

28
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,160
in a decent, unspotted way.

29
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,430
That's good you know what you are doing.

30
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,770
In this box,

31
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,330
it's evidence for Ophiuchus to clear injustice.

32
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,430
You found that pest.

33
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,300
Boiling Black Pearl and white flower together turns into poison.

34
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,160
That's why Ophiuchus went crazy.

35
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,230
I pay respect to Grandma-Empress.

36
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,450
Wish you good health, Grandma-Empress.

37
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,900
Luo Feifei,

38
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,760
You have usually avoided me in normal times.

39
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,140
But you actively come here today.

40
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,160
It's not so simple.

41
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,330
What are you trying to do?

42
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,960
Grandma-Empress,

43
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,620
I have

44
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,630
the poison brought from Orion State by Prince Tang.

45
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,440
This thing is the key to make

46
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,900
Ophiuchus become crazies.

47
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,200
I beg for Grandma-Empress with respect

48
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,770
to tell the truth to world,

49
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,430
and redress Ophiuchus's innocence.

50
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,750
Wangyan, you just walked into a trap.

51
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,980
Still talking so much when you are gonna die shortly.

52
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,630
Feifei, you okay?

53
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,360
Both of you okay?

54
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,490
Guards.

55
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:28,860
Aye.

56
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,300
Throw him into prison.

57
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,550
Feifei, congratulation to you in advance.

58
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,300
The plague of pests have been solved.

59
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,760
Prince Tang and Master Xi safely came back.

60
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,990
Ophiuchus

61
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,990
finally wipes out injustice and the world knows the truth.

62
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,830
As a Constellation Lord of Ophiuchus,

63
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,630
you got the right position.

64
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,030
What do you wanna do next?

65
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,900
Of course I want to do something.

66
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,230
But Dragon Egg didn't indicate anything.

67
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,560
Well, think it over now,

68
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,230
actually, I did few things.

69
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,060
Just redress like that.

70
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,700
I am really happy.

71
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,770
Yanran, let me ask you one thing.

72
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,800
The palace of queen, is it huge?

73
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,960
Looks like someone casts

74
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
her greedy eyes on status of Zodiac State's queen

75
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,330
for a long time.

76
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,850
Feifei, then I may leave first.

77
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,610
Full scores for your appearance.

78
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,260
Totally full scores.

79
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,470
Such a handsome emperor,

80
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,500
why don't I take him?

81
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,830
How about

82
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,300
doing some sports after we go back.

83
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,430
Good.

84
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,540
Let's go running.

85
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,260
Summoning twelve Constellation Lords here today,

86
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,130
I have two things to announce.

87
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,180
The first one,

88
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,800
the case of Ophiuchus's crazies has been cleared.

89
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,870
You aren't listening.

90
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,540
I want to let the world know,

91
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,270
so that I can give their innocence back.

92
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,710
The second,

93
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,100
though Ophiuchus is innocent,

94
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,020
it's reasonable to let the Lord of Ophiuchus be on its right position.

95
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,040
Do you have any objections?

96
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,830
No, we don't object.

97
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,630
Beitang Yi and Shang Yu.

98
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
Aye, I am here.

99
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,190
You two play a crucial role in finding out

100
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,170
the truth of Ophiuchus's crazies.

101
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,760
Both of you will be awarded ten thousand taels of Constellation coins.

102
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,740
It's not a big deal.

103
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,250
Just accidentally found out.

104
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,940
Good part is the god bless our country.

105
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,770
Let me discover Orion State is behind all these

106
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,830
and set Ophiuchus up.

107
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,720
Orion State,

108
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,970
that is...

109
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,640
Grandma-Empress's motherland.

110
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,460
That's right.

111
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,760
Grandma-Empress's motherland is indeed Orion State.

112
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,480
But as a Grandma-Empress of Zodiac State,

113
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,550
she naturally put everything of Zodiac State in priority.

114
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,960
Orion State always takes mean ways

115
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,160
to make people scared.

116
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,230
I intended to send out troops immediately,

117
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,730
however, crazies and plague of insects came one after another in our state.

118
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,910
If I did back then,

119
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,310
the state must raise upheavals.

120
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,960
So I decided to

121
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
mainly alleviate these things of state.

122
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,440
Exactly Your Majesty!

123
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,910
Well.

124
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,070
Could these work?

125
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,620
Nothing is better than these.

126
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,760
What you like

127
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,100
doesn't mean Feifei likes them.

128
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,030
There is something you don't know.

129
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,610
An inch of time is worth an inch of gold.

130
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,830
Time could be measured by money,

131
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,640
then everything can be bought by money.

132
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,070
Besides,

133
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,880
All females love money.

134
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,320
That is golden rule.

135
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,840
Is that so?

136
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,430
General Chu, do you like money?

137
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,900
General Chu is quite different.

138
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,160
She is more masculine than men.

139
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,700
Her words don't have any reference values.

140
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,960
Su Xunxian, you are digging your grave.

141
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,960
Dali.

142
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,980
Oh, right. Be mild.

143
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,160
Su Xunxian, for my brother Bai's sake,

144
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,010
I let you go this time.

145
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,010
Woman is troublesome.

146
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,340
Well, I think

147
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,220
everything can be dealt with one meal.

148
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,220
If one meal can't handle it, then two meals will be okay.

149
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,220
Why does it sound like you are feeding a pig.

150
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,090
That's all I got.

151
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,700
Just go home to carry yours.

152
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
I suppose that's enough.

153
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,230
My all property is here.

154
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,670
I don't have one.

155
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,030
What?

156
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,430
We made a deal.

157
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,430
The rich will be asked to contribute money,

158
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,760
and the strong to contribute labor.

159
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,220
Yes, you are rich, and you contribute money.

160
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,400
We are strong, so we contribute labor.

161
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,400
Yes, yes.

162
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,440
Sister, I am back.

163
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,830
Chongchong, you are here.

164
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,880
Let me tell you a good news.

165
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,510
Do you wanna know?

166
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,760
That big brother who looks like ferocious

167
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,230
has redressed our injustice,

168
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,900
and announced it to the world.

169
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,010
You can live with me again.

170
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,340
Even if Your Majesty has cleared our injustice,

171
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,720
others aren't used to it.

172
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,480
They prefer living in Ophiuchus's village. It's more comfortable.

173
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,430
After succession ceremony of tonight,

174
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,990
Constellation Lord is back where she is belong.

175
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,640
Ophiuchus's people is equal to

176
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,030
other constellation's.

177
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,640
There is no more discriminations.

178
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,900
All of us can restart our life,

179
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,270
and live it well.

180
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,830
Your worries and considerations

181
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,830
will become the past.

182
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,100
Sister, is there any fun at the ceremony?

183
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,760
Will all of us go there?

184
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,300
The ceremony,

185
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,380
is fun.

186
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,380
Today,

187
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,030
is also the most important day of Ophiuchus.

188
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,960
We are going there

189
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,700
in a splendid way.

190
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,830
To show everyone what we got.

191
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,210
Exactly, Constellation Lord.

192
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,230
The same problem there

193
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,900
is left-right asymmetry. Handle it later.

194
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,900
Ascend the flag.

195
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,560
Wuchen, show you something.

196
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,130
What is it?

197
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,960
My brother used it to make Feifei be with him.

198
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,210
Take a deep research.

199
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,830
Hope you can be with Dali quickly.

200
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,050
Is that so mysterious?

201
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,560
Give me back if you don't want it.

202
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,920
I want it.

203
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,020
Of course I want it.

204
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,750
I am the kind of person who has a villa.

205
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,770
Well, it's good.

206
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,300
Missy will definitely like it tomorrow.

207
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,100
Oh my god, Prince Tang.

208
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,960
It's far beyond the budget.

209
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,800
Did we agree that

210
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,410
Su Xunxian would pay for the extra money?

211
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,390
This woman costs us so much

212
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,030
though she doesn't even marry to Your Majesty.

213
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,340
What a spendthrift woman.

214
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,340
Master Mei,

215
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,340
my brother and I are paying for this now,

216
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,130
and cost Su Xunxian's money.

217
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,290
You really...

218
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,750
To be clear, I don't have money.

219
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,480
I gain weight, that's why I contribute labor.

220
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,170
Okay, okay, good.

221
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,160
Devote your strength.

222
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,120
Perfect.

223
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,030
Your Majesty is coming.

224
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,330
Welcome to your arrival respectfully, Your Majesty.

225
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:02,760
Welcome... to... your arrival... respectfully.

226
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,870
It's a sequelae.

227
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,430
Don't mind it.

228
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,030
Sequela.

229
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:24,200
Don't... mind... it.

230
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,700
Yea, right. Just don't care about it.

231
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,500
Constellation Lord of Ophiuchus is back on it's position today.

232
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,430
It's also a big day for Ophiuchus

233
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,990
is back to Zodiac State.

234
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,610
I declare,

235
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,940
from now on,

236
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,830
I hope any one of thirteen constellations

237
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,830
not to be kicked out.

238
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,300
Thirteen constellations only unite together,

239
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,830
then the peace of Zodiac State lasts

240
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,960
And people will be happy forever.

241
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,300
We must follow your guidance, Your Majesty.

242
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,900
Ask the Constellation Lord of Ophiuchus, Luo Feifei,

243
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,700
and her people to see Your Majesty.

244
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,630
The Constellation Lord of Ophiuchus, Luo Feifei,

245
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,560
makes a vow with my people here.

246
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,360
From now on,

247
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,930
we are loyal to Your Majesty

248
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,630
and the masses.

249
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,680
With twelve constellations together,

250
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,360
we will protect state to last forever and maintain peace to prosper state.

251
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,830
You may rise.

252
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,830
Thank you, Your Majesty.

253
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,480
Being the Constellation Lord of Ophiuchus today.

254
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,160
Do you wanna say something?

255
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,380
Say something?

256
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,580
Oh, yes.

257
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,850
Hello, everyone.

258
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,850
I am Feifei, Luo.

259
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,300
Today, I, Luo Feifei

260
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,760
will be the new Constellation Lord of Ophiuchus.

261
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,760
I will lead my people

262
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,300
to be in harmony with twelve constellations,

263
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,700
and create a better and more friendly future together.

264
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,100
We will plant trees, pave roads all together,

265
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,760
and develop a higher development goal

266
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,160
of GDP.

267
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,500
To build a higher living standard for people.

268
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,330
Applause.

269
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,560
Good.

270
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,770
Great, so good.

271
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,970
Nice speech.

272
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,700
Wow, good.

273
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,160
Feifei,

274
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
what on earth is she talking about?

275
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,160
Some spells?

276
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,560
Master Mei, don't talk wild.

277
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,360
I would know if it's a spell.

278
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,900
And in this wonderful day,

279
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,490
you should expect something good.

280
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,810
I am just nipping in the bud.

281
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,430
Don't you get?

282
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,500
Nothing important about business. Just talk some nonsenses.

283
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,100
Just being garrulous.

284
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,080
Be quiet.

285
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,350
Well, everybody is cheerful today.

286
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,960
I am gonna liven the atmosphere a little up.

287
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,600
I, Luo Feifei

288
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,290
doesn't have any talents,

289
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,740
or specialities.

290
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,270
But for one thing, I can sing well.

291
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,430
I am particularly fond of singing something highly difficult songs.

292
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,100
Here it comes.

293
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,830
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

294

hanging in the sky and glittering.

296
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,100
Look like plenty little eyes.

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,500
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

298
