00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:01,700
Oh! My Emperor

Episode 12

4
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,510
How dare you make me pour away the water?

5
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,110
I will pour away the water for you.

6
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,050
Watch this.

7
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,300
Luo Feifei!

8
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,030
I didn't mean to do that.

9
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,200
You want to run away?

10
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,220
Come here.

11
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,740
I said I didn't mean to do that.

12
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,510
If I meant to do it,

13
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,670
I wouldn't do it with water,

14
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,140
I would use shit.

15
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,930
You!

16
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,220
I won't run away, just let go of me.

17
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,670
You did that on purpose.

18
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,920
I said I'm not for a thousand times.

19
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,600
Luo Feifei.

20
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,730
Beitang Yi.

21
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,760
Luo Feifei.

22
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,710
Beitang Dragon Egg.

23
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Luo Feifei.

24
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:18,860
Dragon Egg.

25
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,620
Luo Feifei!

26
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,390
Egg!

27
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,160
I said I didn't mean to do that.

28
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,590
It was an accident.

29
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,000
Bastard Emperor, today is your judgement day.

30
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,530
Let's go!

31
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,890
Help!

32
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,360
There is an assassin.

33
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,810
Your Majesty.

34
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,210
What are you looking at? Let's go!

35
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,220
Go go go.

36
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,210
Help! Help!

37
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,730
Take her down.

38
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,710
How dare you assassinate Your Majesty.

39
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,210
Take her down.

40
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,090
Yes.

41
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,370
Guard Your Majesty.

42
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,930
Guard Your Majesty.

43
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,440
Your Majesty, are you ok?

44
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,100
Your Majesty, let me heal you.

45
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,320
Leave us. Feifei can do it.

46
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,810
Let's go.

47
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,980
Come on.

48
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,170
I was terrified.

49
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,800
Come and dress my wound.

50
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,010
Me?

51
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,990
Last time, you said the way I dress my wound was wrong.

52
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,630
You have a deep wound.

53
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,610
You need to take off your clothes.

54
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,780
Take off my clothes?

55
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,540
Otherwise, it will be infected.

56
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,620
I didn't notice that

57
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,150
he has a nice body.

58
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,970
I want to ask you something.

59
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,460
But I don't know how to say it.

60
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,590
Then don't say it.

61
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,490
Your Majesty.

62
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,380
I thought you call me Beitang Dragon Egg.

63
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,010
Let’s stop raking up the past.

64
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,630
Speak out.

65
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,510
Can you release that maid?

66
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,100
She tried to kill me and should be sentenced to death.

67
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,080
Unless you give me a good reason.

68
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,940
I saved your life right?

69
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,620
Your life for hers.

70
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,100
It's really a bargain for you.

71
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,330
You stay in Palace of the Prince Chen for a long time

72
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,780
and learn too much

73
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,610
business with Su Xunxian.

74
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,160
Do you agree or not?

75
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,700
I can leave her alive, but she has to be punished.

76
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,570
Then, spank her for twenty times.

77
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,220
Then send her out of the palace.

78
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,580
Deal.

79
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,630
I just want to check your wound.

80
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,030
Beitang Yi,

81
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,460
you can't touch me up like this all the time.

82
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,320
Beitang Yi!

83
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,940
How about playing chess?

84
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,300
No.

85
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,010
Why?

86
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,960
No reason.

87
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,080
Do you know

88
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,540
I have a bottle of good wine from Five Immortals State.

89
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,920
It's said that you can forget worries after drinking it.

90
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,530
Let's have some?

91
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,760
No.

92
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,270
You don't play chess or drink wine.

93
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,740
How about playing the Guqin.

94
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,300
No.

95
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,960
Moran,

96
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,690
since we grow up together,

97
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,800
I've never seen you so worried like this.

98
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,460
Are you still worried about

99
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,670
Miss Luo's entering

100
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,520
the imperial palace?

101
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,240
You know you can't lie about it.

102
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,370
So you give up hiding the truth?

103
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,850
In my opinion, all ladies are the same.

104
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,460
Miss Luo is just like others

105
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,310
besides she is bright

106
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,010
and neurotic.

107
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,860
If you like a lady like her,

108
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,700
I can get some from the street and choose anyone you like.

109
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,450
Oh yes, the belle of Honglou Brothels

110
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,270
is quite nice.

111
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,690
Do you need my help?

112
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,920
Su Xunxian,

113
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,480
are you free lately?

114
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,170
There are many problems in the world

115
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,550
that can be solved with money.

116
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,640
But your problems

117
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,970
normally can't be solved with money.

118
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,060
So,

119
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,170
I think you are more important

120
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,520
No,

121
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,310
your problems are more interesting.

122
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,120
If you are free,

123
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,850
go play with your birds.

124
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,270
But I just like to chase problem when I'm free.

125
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,060
So I can kill

126
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,230
all the happy hours I have.

127
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,010
You!

128
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,390
Are you tired of yourself?

129
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,100
No, not at all.

130
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,300
They said ladies are changeable.

131
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,570
But I think the men without ladies are more changeable.

132
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,270
Miss, miss.

133
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,910
Miss.

134
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,960
Your Majesty got hurt, you should check him out.

135
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,230
There are royal physicians in the palace.

136
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,890
I'm not a physicians. What can I do?

137
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,360
But you are the future queen.

138
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,880
You should express your concerns.

139
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,110
You said I'm the future queen.

140
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,320
But I'm not queen now.

141
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,640
What are you worried about?

142
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,880
But the new dancing girls

143
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,300
all want to be a queen.

144
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,900
Our emperor was as cold as ice and frost before.

145
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,610
But now he begins to get close to women.

146
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,490
Please go check him.

147
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,720
Xiaohe, I've seen

148
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,130
one hundred and right ways of

149
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,480
punishing servants who gossip.

150
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,230
Name one. Which one do you like?

151
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,050
I'm telling the truth.

152
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,430
You can't do this to me.

153
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,440
You are born in an eminent family.

154
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,870
You can't read that kind of book.

155
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,560
It is destructive to the morals

156
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,420
and problematical.

157
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,010
I can't decide

158
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,160
my family background and my marriage.

159
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,380
Sometimes, I actually

160
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,090
envy you so much.

161
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,590
But everyone knows I am

162
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,850
the most pathetic servant in Dongan City.

163
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,600
How can that be?

164
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,830
You are my servant.

165
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,420
How can you be the most pathetic servant?

166
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,030
You are the reason

167
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,720
why I am the most pathetic.

168
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,430
So you blame me?

169
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,400
I want to change clothes.

170
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,730
Sure.

171
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,230
My lady.

172
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,830
How dare you! How can you talk to My lady like that!

173
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,960
Hey you!

174
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,750
Don't walk away. Do you know who My Lady is?

175
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,090
Why are you running? She is the future queen.

176
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,090
Don't run! Come back!

177
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,160
Ok ok.

178
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,960
You dancing girl

179
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,010
don't have good manners.

180
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,820
I will ask Discipline Nanny

181
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,850
to teach you well.

182
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,300
Teach me?

183
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,800
You should ask Discipline Nanny to teach you.

184
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,940
Teach you not to peep at others in bath.

185
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,060
I've already heard

186
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,720
the future queen is from an eminent family.

187
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,900
Where are you from again?

188
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,540
Bath house?

189
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,760
I come from Family Xie.

190
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,460
Family Xie.

191
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,300
I heard he is the Constellation Lord of Cancer?

192
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,430
If someone else knows about it

193
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,270
I'm not sure you can marry to anyone.

194
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,720
Name your price.

195
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,200
How much can make you keep that secret?

196
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,420
Gold and jewelry or houses and fields,

197
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,350
I can give you what I have,

198
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,670
just name the price.

199
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,440
So you know what

200
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,870
happens between Prince Chen and me.

201
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,410
So I won't poach Your Majesty with you.

202
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,530
I can't do anything.

203
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,270
Grandma-Empress make me married to him.

204
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,810
I don't know what to do.

205
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,430
But I can understand your situation.

206
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,670
That's how ancient people did.

207
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,920
When it comes to marriage,

208
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,580
You have to depend on your parents and matchmaker

209
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,230
instead of your own opinions.

210
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,960
You don't have a choice.

211
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,270
I'm surprised that you can understand me.

212
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,010
I don't know what I can do.

213
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,190
That's why I take a peep at him once in a while.

214
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,900
You didn't peep at him.

215
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,460
You peeped at him showering.

216
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,730
What can I do?

217
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,130
I have to see Prince Chen, otherwise

218
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,940
I will have a nasty taste and can't sleep at night.

219
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,440
You are so lame.

220
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,350
You should do something!

221
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,840
If you don't have a chance, make one.

222
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,510
Hold on to it if you have the chance.

223
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,300
Just do it.

224
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,470
Really?

225
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,100
Can I do that?

226
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,100
But I'm already engaged.

227
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,510
That's not right.

228
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,630
You should break the feudal idea.

229
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,490
That means nothing.

230
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,160
You should hold on to your happiness.

231
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,760
You are the one who are getting married.

232
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,740
I will help you.

233
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,810
You know what?

234
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,020
You are the first one to tell me those.

235
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,590
You are a good person.

236
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,810
Surely I am.

237
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,360
Relax. If you help me,

238
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,630
I will help you chase the emperor as well.

239
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,510
You don't want to be a queen?

240
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,460
Who told you I like that nerd?

241
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,660
I don't like him.

242
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,320
Only the fool can't see that.

243
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,100
If you don't like the emperor,

244
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,770
why did you try so hard to get in the palace.

245
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,350
I know the three brothers so well.

246
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,090
Your Majesty never let any women go near him.

247
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,480
He even kicked the Reminder Maid out.

248
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,050
Grandma-Empress is warried about it.

249
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,150
That nerd is kind of simple and naive.

250
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,660
I always want to ask you something,

251
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,180
That day,

252
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,850
when you appeared before me.

253
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,610
Do you have super power?

254
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,010
That's Flying star, my extraordinary abilities.

255
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,060
Is it like the Big Tooth?

256
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,590
And suddenly, it appears a lot of Big Tooth.

257
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,560
That's Double Shadow only from Prince Tang.

258
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:49,820
Double Shadow.

259
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,420
Do you all have extraordinary abilities?

260
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,240
No, not everyone.

261
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,900
And each of our extraordinary abilities

262
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,020
are not the same.

263
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,290
Why do you say that?

264
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,830
Like Your Majesty, he can fossilize people.

265
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,480
Prince Chen can forsee the future.

266
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,770
Lord Fang can rebound the force.

267
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,960
General Chu

268
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,640
can beat opponent by the voice.

269
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,240
Is it cool?

270
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
It is cool.

271
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,360
Awesome like you guys,

272
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,430
no other country

273
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,440
wants to fight with you right?

274
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,160
That's not possible. Besides our Zodiac State,

275
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,900
there are Five Immortals State, Perseid State and so on.

276
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,960
They all have extraordinary abilities.

277
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,430
Really?

278
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,680
When you guys fight, is it like this

279
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,090
Just like this.

280
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,360
No, we can't overuse our abilities.

281
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,900
It will pose a danger to our lives.

282
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,050
Can you teach me invisible ability?

283
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,450
It depends on your gift.

284
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,210
You think I don't have gift?

285
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,720
Let me tell you what,

286
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,430
I wouldn't lie to you.

287
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,740
Last year,

288
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,360
that Sailor Moon group

289
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,040
forced me to join them.

290
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,910
But I refused to.

291
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,830
Sailor Moon?

292
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,360
Is that an extraordinary ability.

293
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,550
No, Sailor Moon is a

294
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,030
fashion girls group.

295
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,240
I didn't join them.

296
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,830
But I joined

297
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,630
PILIPALA Fairies.

298
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,600
PILIPALA Fairies?

299
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,390
I'm kidding.

300
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,680
Ok, we have talked too much.

301
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,340
I will see you around, ok?
