1
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,230
Oh! My Emperor

Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd.

00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 20

4
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,430
We fight with each other!

5
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,100
What if somebody hurts or something else?

6
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,030
They'll live a whole life with permanent injury

7
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,430
if I can't heal timely.

8
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,500
Have your eyes on blocking!

9
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,430
Be cool!

10
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,560
Get down and wait in the grass!

11
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,630
Master Su, what a leisure time!

12
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,500
Master Fang listened to me such a long time,

13
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,030
Definitely what a leisure time you have!

14
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,630
You've played and said.

15
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,560
Do it.

16
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,360
Uh-huh.

17
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,360
Be careful.

18
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,630
This is battleground!

19
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,560
You sure flirt with her now?

20
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm sorry, Prince Tang.

21
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,760
I think they fed.

22
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,030
Fed! Fed!

23
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,900
Dragon Egg, you just let me go.

24
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,560
No.

25
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,360
You'll be in danger.

26
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,360
You filled in for Xie Yamran.

27
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,630
If this gets out

28
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
they'll be punished.

29
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,560
I'll keep you safe,

30
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,700
and get the military right back.

31
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,500
Master Zhang.

32
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,830
Master Mei, what was your plan?

33
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,630
I tell you that I predict

34
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,430
the winner is His Majesty.

35
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,630
You're not Prince Chen,

36
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,960
How do you know the winner is His Majesty?

37
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,900
You don't believe?

38
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,360
Whether we make a bet?

39
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
Fine, what'll you bet?

40
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,760
Well,

41
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,430
You give me spring eggs for one month if you lose.

42
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,030
Deal?

43
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,030
Deal! You'll lose!

44
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,960
Master Zhang, Be aware!

45
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,900
Beat me and eliminate me out if you can.

46
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,960
Master Mei, take it!

47
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,960
Su Xunxian is a wily old fox.

48
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,900
I felt false.

49
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,230
Fangjian have the suspicion too great to clam down.

50
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,630
It means that I put my head in the noose if I take precipitate action.

51
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,900
Master Su, where's your soldiers?

52
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,830
They're here,

53
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,760
here and here.

54
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,700
Master Fang, you can't see them?

55
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,630
Although you're a skilled fighter,

56
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,760
I won't let you go.

57
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,230
I can't make a rash act, I'll wait and see.

58
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,230
No matter how do you deal with it,

59
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,160
I'm sure you can't go back.

60
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,560
Master Fang,

61
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,100
How about I play a tune for you again?

62
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,100
Zhengzheng, look at that.

63
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,430
When will it finish?

64
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,830
Master Mei,

65
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,830
please be more serious.

66
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
What?

67
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
I was so serious just now!

68
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,430
Be lasting!

69
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,160
I hate you!

70
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,030
If you do that again, I'll send you off the battleground.

71
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,030
Threaten me?

72
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,160
Come on! Dali!

73
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,630
Cool! Dali!

74
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,630
Get up!

75
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,430
Get up! Get up!

76
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,100
Get up! you!

77
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,960
Get up!

78
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,560
And you! Get up!

79
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,030
Are you tired? Dali.

80
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,760
Wow.

81
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,360
ACE.

82
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,030
General Chu, cool!

83
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,760
Where did you hurt?

84
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,500
Get back, I have a stomachache, it's hurt.

85
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,760
Hurt?

86
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,160
What's the matter with you? ok, I'll help you.

87
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,630
You wasn't badly hurt.

88
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,760
I was dead.

89
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,360
Why are you escaping?

90
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,830
Get up? why are you scared her? Beat her!

91
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,100
Beat her!

92
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,830
What are you talking about? Luo Feifei.

93
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,960
Why were you poking at me?

94
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,630
Feifei.

95
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,830
You've been dead.

96
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,630
What? Where?

97
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,830
Where? Where? Tell me!

98
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,100
You've been dead as you're marked.

99
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,830
I told you I can't see it!

100
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,500
The tournament have begun.

101
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,830
Now,

102
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,960
Go.

103
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,830
Zhang Tianzheng, How dare you!

104
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,300
What happened?

105
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,630
That's not our people!

106
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,160
Not yours? So, who?

107
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,360
Your Majesty,

108
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,960
Prince Chen's soldiers use the real weapons.

109
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
Some of our soldier have been hurt.

110
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,560
Your Highness, there's a bad news.

111
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,760
Some unknown people blended in us

112
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,360
and uses real weapons.

113
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,100
There' re many casualties on his Majesty.

114
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Spy blended in us?

115
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,630
Yes, Your Highness, but I don't know why?

116
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,430
The site of His Majesty

117
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,630
was nettled.

118
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,030
Beitang Moran!

119
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,630
Master! Master!

120
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Master!

121
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,960
We're surrounded!

122
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,500
And we're caused heavy casualties!

123
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,030
What?

124
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,100
Su Xunxian.

125
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,830
You're for real!

126
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,030
I'm not such a murderous person.

127
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,430
We said there's a certain degree

128
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,760
to avoid to kill people.

129
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,160
Master, that guys seems are delirious!

130
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,230
Not our people.

131
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,760
They look like some madmen escaped from prison.

132
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,560
Crazies?

133
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,160
Wait! I'll go with you.

134
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,700
No! You need to go back to protect His Majesty quickly!

135
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,360
The rest of you follow me!

136
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,760
Go back and protect His Majesty!

137
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,760
Your Majesty!

138
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,630
Your Majesty! Your Highness! Something bad happened!

139
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,230
The disappeared crazies

140
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,900
appeared again!

141
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,230
They also rushed into the battleground!

142
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,360
I'm willing admit defeat,

143
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,300
and against the armies with uncle.

144
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,760
Your Majesty, the token belongs to you!

145
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,030
Uncle, this is

146
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,360
this is seal.

147
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,230
Your Majesty, you've pass my test.

148
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,100
This time,

149
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,760
I put your judgment of facing the powerful enemies to the test.

150
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,030
The deceased Majesty was assassinated, then you were forced in hurry accession.

151
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,430
I have to take the most greatest mission which's control the military right,

152
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,830
and took over the royal duties.

153
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,100
But now, I think

154
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,360
you completely passed my test.

155
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,160
I can get the world off my back.

156
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,830
Your Majesty, from now on,

157
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,760
I'll hand over the military right.

158
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,230
Give it back to you.

159
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Your Highness the Prince Tang,

160
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,360
This is women's fight!

161
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,160
Let them go.

162
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,030
Lord Bai, how dare you!

163
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,230
Changed the sides casually.

164
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,160
But I understand.

165
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,960
By the way, your Dali is a woman?

166
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,230
You're right!

167
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,300
She's a woman?

168
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,300
Beat me.

169
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,500
Luo Feifei!

170
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,560
Chu Shengnan!

171
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,030
Luo Feifei!

172
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,760
Missy!

173
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,830
All of you! Attention!

174
