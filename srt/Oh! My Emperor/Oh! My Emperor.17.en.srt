1
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,360
Oh! My Emperor

2
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,500
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd.

3
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,560
Episode 17

4
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,760
I can't save them with my clumsy Kongfu.

5
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,160
I should first...

6
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,300
Did we get here early?

7
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,630
Not at all.

8
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,900
I got here just in time.

9
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,230
Constellation Lords,

10
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
please sit here and wait for a moment.

11
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,760
I get fooled.

12
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,960
We have found her for a whole night.

13
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,760
Hope Yanran is safe.

14
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,560
Relax, she is the Constellation Lord of the Cancer.

15
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,230
She can protect herself.

16
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
My nephew is still cold and unfeeling.

17
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,300
Even with your fiancee.

18
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,360
Uncle Chen really enjoy

19
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,160
talking about that?

20
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,760
That's my father's decision, not mine.

21
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,830
I know that

22
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,560
Yanran doesn't love me at all.

23
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,760
When I take my power back,

24
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,300
I will break off the engagement and set her free.

25
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,360
You will break off the engagement?

26
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,030
Does Yanran know about that?

27
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,760
If she knows that,

28
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,960
she will be happy to crazy.

29
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,830
You can say that when you get your power back.

30
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,630
If you lose the last Tournament,

31
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,360
you have to wait until 30.

32
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,030
Grandma-Empress will force you

33
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,630
to get married before that.

34
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,100
Uncle, that's going too far.

35
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,630
Going too far?

36
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,830
Ok.

37
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,900
Let me show you what is going too far.

38
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,630
The last Tournament will be moved up to three days after.

39
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,830
Three days after will be fine.

40
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,900
I will definitely make my victory loud and clear for you.

41
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,300
Can you guys stop fighting?

42
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,960
You've fought for a whole night.

43
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,030
Act like a pussy.

44
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,630
Do you really care about Yanran?

45
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,500
Feifei.

46
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,960
Listen.

47
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,960
It's you.

48
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,160
It's all your fault.

49
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,430
Yeah.

50
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,760
It's all your fault.

51
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,560
Tell you what,

52
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,160
if something happened to Yanran,

53
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,160
I

54
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,830
I will kill you.

55
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,900
Feifei.

56
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,830
What has it to do with me?

57
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,160
My lady, are you feeling better?

58
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,300
Yeah, I'm fine after a good sleep.

59
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,230
Right,

60
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,300
Feifei come to see me yesterday, isn't it?

61
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,630
Yes, I sent her away.

62
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,430
How dare her ask where you are.

63
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,960
I didn't tell her.

64
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,960
How can you did that to Feifei, Xiaohe?

65
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,030
How can you did that to yourself, my lady?

66
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,300
You will be bullied if you are too kind.

67
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,300
Kind people sometimes

68
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,560
come to no good end.

69
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,630
She didn't fight for Prince with me.

70
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,960
She is not that kind of person.

71
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,830
That makes her a horrible person, my lady.

72
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,360
She said no but her heart said the other way.

73
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,430
All men love this kind of girls.

74
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,700
Especially for men like Prince.

75
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,560
They are chased by all the girls.

76
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
If I were the Prince,

77
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,630
I would be curious by that girl.

78
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,960
Why she never chase me?

79
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,960
It's a bad thing once he has the idea.

80
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,100
My lady, you have read all those books.

81
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,430
Don't you know anything

82
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,760
about protending to refuse?

83
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,360
Xiaohe, what a master.

84
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,030
Yes, that wicked girl is a master.

85
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,160
No, I'm talking about you.

86
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,030
You are a master.

87
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,500
You have all those ideas.

88
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,830
Why don't you teach me?

89
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,230
I was helping you chasing the emperor.

90
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,430
Prince is the one I love.

91
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,700
Your help is useless.

92
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,830
But the one Prince love is that wicked girl.

93
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,560
not you.

94
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,500
I can't help you with that.

95
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,560
My thought was the same as yours before that.

96
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,900
But I understood it yesterday.

97
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,760
She is no harm to me. We are friends.

98
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,830
And about firendship,

99
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,160
trust is the most important.

100
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,160
It is pathetic if you

101
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,830
have been living in suspicion.

102
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,160
My lady, you have a big heart.

103
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,030
No, I have a small heart

104
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,230
and it only enough

105
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,760
for holding Prince.

106
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
And yesterday I didn't make it to

107
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Constellation Lords conference.

108
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,900
Help me get ready.

109
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,830
I want to go to the Palace.

110
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,360
Yes, my lady.

111
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,360
It seems like

112
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,630
I need to try harder to be a better person.

113
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,500
So that Prince will notice me.

114
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,430
Why are they so late?

115
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,760
My godness.

116
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,830
Brother.

117
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,230
Missy and uncle.

118
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,830
How was it?

119
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,830
We didn't find her. How about you?

120
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,500
I found for a whole night but nothing.

121
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,900
Shengnan.

122
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,430
How about you? Did you find her?

123
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,230
No, we didn't.

124
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,760
Bai Wuchen

125
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,230
You went to the forest with General Chu?

126
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,760
Although that's what happened,

127
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,830
the way you say it is werid.

128
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,430
Let me tell you.

129
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,230
Shut up.

130
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,830
How about Shang Yu and Xifeng Lie?

131
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,160
We didn't see them.

132
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,160
We failed to find one and lose two.

133
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,160
Let's go back.

134
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,430
Those two men will

135
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,030
be fine on themselves.

136
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,160
You are right. Let's go back.

137
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,430
I have important news to pronounce.

138
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,230
Good morning, Eunuch Hai.

139
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,960
Good morning, my lady.

140
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,560
How is the Constellation Lords conference held yesterday?

141
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,360
Constellation Lords conference?

142
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,830
I was just back from the conference.

143
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,160
I don't think everyone's arrived yet.

144
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,830
Then I'm not late.

145
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,300
Everyone, wake up.

146
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,160
Let's get start.

147
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,230
Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

148
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Sorry to keep you waiting.

149
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,630
Last night, I was looking for

150
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,630
Xie Yanran with them.

151
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,360
Good morning everyone.

152
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

153
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,230
What happened to you guys?

154
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,830
Where was Yanran?

155
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,430
Miss Luo.

156
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,760
I finally find you.

157
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,300
What are you doing here, Eunuch Hai?

158
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,160
Miss Luo, tell you what

159
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,500
Is it about Yanran?

160
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
What happened to Yanran?

161
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Was something wrong with Yanran?

162
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,830
Be careful, Miss Luo.

163
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,830
That's hurt.

164
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,560
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

165
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

166
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,430
Miss Xie is fine.

167
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,630
She's in Constellation Lord Hall.

168
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,960
She is fine. Don't worry about her.

169
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,430
Thank god she is fine.

170
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,560
But what she's doing in the Back Mountain?

171
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,360
She went to the Back Mountain?

172
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,560
Maybe

173
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,630
she has some issue.

174
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,760
Then I go and report back to Your Majesty.

175
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,900
Sure.

176
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,700
Your Majesty knows Miss Luo is worried about Miss Xie.

177
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,500
He particularly gave me the order to come here

178
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,560
and tell Miss Luo.

179
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,230
He gave you the order?

180
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,430
Yes. It seems like Your Majesty is cared about Miss Luo.

181
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,630
Bad Dragon Egg.

182
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,700
Right.

183
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,830
Hold on a second.

184
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,030
Your Majesty asked me to give you this.

185
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,630
I will go.

186
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,160
Be careful, Eunuch Hai.

187
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,500
Bad Dragon Egg.

188
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,760
I won't be compensated by your gift.

189
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,160
Yanran, where were you last night?

190
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,360
We have searched for you on the mountain for a whole night.

191
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,560
I wasn't on the mountain, Prince.

192
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,830
I was at home.

193
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,230
Ok then, since you are fine,

194
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,560
let's continue our conference.

195
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,760
OK.

196
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,960
Miss Xie, you are sitting on my chair.

197
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,230
Is it really matter?

198
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,960
You can sit on my chair.

199
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,700
Why are you sitting here, Prince?

200
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,430
Prince will sit here from now on.

201
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,030
Your chair is over there.

202
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,360
Please.

203
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,830
According to the ancestral system,

204
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,560
there will be no less than 5 people

205
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,160
on both side in the last tournament.

206
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,560
We have already voted,

207
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,630
and it's your turn to vote.

208
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,430
Your Majesty, you know that

209
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,160
if the difference between both side is big,

210
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,430
the tournament will be automatically cancelled.

211
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
I know.

212
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,160
I

213
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,030
I vote for Earth Signs.

214
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,630
I vote for Your Majesty.

215
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,630
Prince must have been angry with me.

216
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,300
Fine.

217
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,760
Let's just group like that.

218
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,900
So much for today.

219
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,230
Take it easy.

220
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,160
We haven't finished yet.

221
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,700
Uncle,

222
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,760
what else do you want to say?

223
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,230
Today the ophiuchus lunatics riot again.

224
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,630
So I think

225
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,560
they all should be killed.

226
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,230
They just lost their mind for once.

227
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,430
Is it cold if we kill them now?

228
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,700
Cold?

229
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,760
Your Majesty, don't think like a woman.

230
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,760
Think about those lunatics.

231
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,900
All the harm they did,

232
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,830
all the people they killed,

233
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,230
and all the lost they made.

234
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,560
You know better than me.

235
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,960
I think the most important is

236
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,830
to find out why they did that.

237
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,900
Don't you think so?

238
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,300
Of course we need to know why,

239
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,230
but they also need to be killed.

240
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,630
What if I say no?

241
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,700
Your Majesty,

242
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,560
you will say yes.

243
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,300
You.

244
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,630
Uncle, don't forget.

245
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,830
My brother is the King of Zodiac State, not you.

246
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,430
Of course.

247
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,030
But Prince Tang,

248
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,960
you can save those words

249
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,360
when you win the Tournament.

250
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,360
It will be tougher.

251
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,430
But now, with the absence of Shang Yu and Xifeng Lie,

252
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,430
our side is short of people.

253
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,960
How can we start our tournament?

254
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,630
Your Majesty,

255
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,630
I'm willing to join Prince Chen.

256
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,630
When Dali was chasing the ophiuchus people,

257
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,100
she sustained serious injuries

258
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,360
and hasn't recover yet.

259
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,100
Her Kongfu is worse than before.

260
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,030
I am worried about her.

261
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,630
Your Majesty

262
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,960
I'm willing to join Prince Chen.

263
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,830
Please help me fulfill my wish.

264
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Ok, that's it.

265
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,430
The tournament will be held in three days.

266
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,560
According to our rules,

267
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,230
both sides will have three team.

268
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,760
Confront each other one by one.

269
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,830
If you can't catch the commander

270
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,960
of your enemy or get the flag

271
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,560
of the commander by the sunset.

272
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,160
The team which defeat

273
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,630
more soldiers will be the winner.

274
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,630
This medicine is strong.

275
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,430
It will work effectively the moment you take it.

276
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,430
The reason why they

277
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,160
get mad is this medicine.

278
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,230
It's late, let's set off.

279
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,230
Those lunatics are controlled by those people.

280
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
I have to follow them.

281
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,430
Find out who are they.

282
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,630
Come on, follow up.

283
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,830
Bai Wuchen, thank you.

284
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,760
Dali,

285
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,630
are you touched by me?

286
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,630
Why did you do that?

287
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,830
You are Gardian sent by Your Majesty.

288
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,830
Because I think you need me more.

289
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,830
It's been half a day.

290
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,030
Why don't Shangyu and Xifeng Lie come back?

291
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,030
The ophiuchus people take more operations these days.

292
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,900
Is it because they have problem

293
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,960
and couldn't get back on time?

294
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,030
Xifeng Lie is smart.

295
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,630
Once there is a problem, he will send a signal.

296
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,630
Did you receive any signal?

297
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,360
Shengnan.

298
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,030
Send people to the Back Mountain to search for them.

299
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,360
Yes.
