4
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,700
Do you want to put me in prison?

5
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,830
I know the road well.

6
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,230
How dare you! How come you get this attitude?

7
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,790
Well, I just don't let you go in there.

8
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,760
Bilian,

9
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
The wicked girl

10
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
and Xie Yanran are yours.

11
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,170
Take them to the Constellation Health Institute.

12
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,100
Yes, Grandma-Empress.

13
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,290
You, wash them.

14
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,490
You,

15
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,920
wash this.

16
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,370
you two must

17
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,310
weed before it gets dark.

18
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,310
I don't want to see any grass.

19
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,620
No food.

20
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,740
No water.

21
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,470
Even a scullion

22
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,610
who also work after being full up.

23
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,010
Yanran,

24
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,550
I'm too tired to work.

25
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,370
Don't you help me?

26
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,660
You know,

27
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,760
If we can't finish,

28
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,310
then we can't sleep.

29
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,090
Refused!

30
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,230
You don't know what you have done!

31
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,830
I'll help you when you remember it.

32
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,460
It's too bad.

33
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,130
I don't know what happened completely.

34
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,030
I really can't remember it.

35
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,850
What did I do?

36
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,090
My perfect sister, please tell me.

37
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,700
What a terrible thing you did

38
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,160
is you drank and out of your mind.

39
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,270
You told Prince Chen

40
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,720
I peeped him when he take a bath.

41
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,990
Yanran,

42
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,920
love need to say out! Right?

43
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,560
What did he do?

44
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,920
I don't know.

45
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,970
I fell asleep.

46
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,240
Fell asleep?

47
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,130
How?

48
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,350
What a pity!

49
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,250
What a pity!

50
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,740
Xifeng Lie, try it.

51
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,710
It's really delicious!

52
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,030
You don't eat anything!

53
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,730
You upset me!

54
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,890
My god!

55
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,490
S-E-

56
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,460
Q-U-

57
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,030
E-L-A.

58
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,830
I'm

59
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,730
very slow.

60
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,400
Too hard.

61
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,880
It's too hard!

62
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,570
No,

63
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,370
This is destiny.

64
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,560
Feifei,

65
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,740
When we can finish that?

66
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,160
I don't know.

67
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,030
Bilian finally got us,

68
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,840
she'll completely torment us.

69
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,570
How!

70
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,430
She know who I am.

71
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,260
I'm the girl of Prime Minister.

72
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,500
You know who's her boss?

73
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,980
It's Grandma-Empress.

74
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,130
That wicked woman.

75
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,830
Generally speaking, you dad need to retired

76
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,560
at that age.

77
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,370
Retired?

78
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,240
I'm too tired to explain it.

79
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,600
Your, I can't talk about people in daytime.

80
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,790
Yanran,

81
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,160
or you want to find a

82
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,350
cooler place,

83
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,560
play on your own?

84
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,270
I don't want to go anywhere.

85
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,040
I think it's good enough.

86
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
I'm so tried.

87
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,510
You don't know the situation?

88
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,830
No? No?

89
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,120
I'm leaving.

90
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,030
Gragon Egg, why you're so late?

91
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,490
You don't know how tired I am.

92
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,030
The old wicked woman.

93
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,960
I was tortured to death by Grandma-Empress.

94
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,850
Please intercede for me.

95
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,520
Forgive me.

96
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,890
You know it's hard?

97
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,200
Again?

98
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,230
Grandma-Empress is angry now.

99
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,800
You know, it counterproductive to do so.

100
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,020
But don't worry,

101
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,450
I'll take you out soon.

102
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,810
You must

103
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,560
do a lot of works here everyday, right?

104
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,060
I'm so poor.

105
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,800
Look at my hand,

106
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,570
It's shaking.

107
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,240
You told me that my hands cannot lift heavily,

108
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,870
and my shoulders can't do, either.

109
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,830
But now, I was ordered to do so many menial works.

110
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,830
Actually! I bring something great for you.

111
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,300
You'll like them.

112
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,300
Really?

113
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,100
Dehai has taken them.

114
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,290
I took the hammer stone, bronze bell and.

115
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,430
What are you doing with these?

116
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,900
I know you have weakness of strength.

117
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,520
Then?

118
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,430
You can exercise in your free time.

119
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,930
It will renew you strength.

120
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,970
Do it yourself!

121
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,740
Good.

122
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,050
Tangtang said

123
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,350
girls like gifts.

124
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,410
Your Majesty.

125
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,410
Prince Tang have been going out for half a month.

126
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,760
Why doesn't he come back?

127
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,370
What have happened?

128
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,140
I don't know, either.

129
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,110
At that time, I used my power

130
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,960
to portal them to the safe place

131
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,200
then I've never seem him.

132
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,660
The desert was windy,

133
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,310
there was no steps there.

134
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,610
The troops came back,

135
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,030
and they also said they haven't seem Prince Tang.

136
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,100
If anything happens to Prince Tang.

137
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,830
Your Majesty, I have something for you.

138
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,740
The thing we speak for Ophiuchus.

139
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,460
Because we didn't tell the people,

140
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,100
they still

141
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,230
stay away from the people of Ophiuchus.

142
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,360
I know.

143
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,430
I'm just

144
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,160
waiting a best time

145
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,830
and an important person.

146
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,160
Inform my order,

147
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,620
No matter what the ways you have,

148
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,340
just find back Prince Tang.

149
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

150
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,980
Your Majesty! Something bad happened! Your Majesty!

151
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,980
Your Majesty!

152
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,830
Something bad happened!

153
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,420
There's appeared mysterious monster in the city!

154
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,860
The situation is up to our eyebrows.

155
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,280
Monster?

156
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,360
Yes! It's so scared!

157
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,360
Scared me!

158
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,290
Your Majesty,

159
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,630
Sequela, sequela.

160
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,230
What're you doing?

161
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,610
Get up!

162
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,250
Work or not?

163
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,720
What work?

164
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,830
You want to fight?

165
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,730
We.

166
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,900
What?

167
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,910
You're good?

168
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,910
You had the thing?

169
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,540
I had the thing!

170
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,400
Xie Yanran,

171
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,360
How dare you talk to Pharmacist Bilian like taht?

172
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,310
I?

173
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,840
You're too excessive!

174
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,430
I can't stand it!

175
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,230
I, I.

176
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,620
What you did

177
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,950
lets me down

178
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,280
and angry.

179
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,280
Right? Pharmacist Bilian.

180
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,370
Are you in the wrong place?

181
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,960
I tell you, Luo Feifei.

182
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,770
Today, I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

183
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,430
Close the door!

184
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,740
Do it!

185
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,100
Hit them!

186
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,170
Hit them mercilessly!

187
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,610
Cool?

188
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,500
Yes! Really cool!

189
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,160
I think it's cooler than become a Emperor.

190
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,880
Yeah?

191
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,340
Me too.

192
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,640
Did you bully me?

193
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,900
Wash the bucket?

194
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,450
Do it again!

195
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,900
We clear the goblin now.

196
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,180
The side of the old wicked woman

197
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,400
should be rest in peace.

198
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,610
Look, I can't mention her!

199
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,970
She upset me!

200
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,970
You know,

201
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,430
She is in fumbling age,

202
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,030
but what the hell things in her hair?

203
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,500
All of the hair!

204
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,230
Full of things.

205
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,490
I don't know.

206
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,830
That goblin

207
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,100
follow the old wicked woman every day.

208
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,070
You walk around me on and on

209
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,380
and on and on!

210
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,880
You tired me out! I can't stand!

211
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,660
Yanran, not I'm bragging.

212
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,230
Bilian,

213
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,500
I tell you,

214
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,300
I can fix

215
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,410
another ten sisters like you.

216
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,340
You wanna try?

217
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,590
I told you don't bother me!

218
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,670
Luo Feifei.

219
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,340
It's up to fate.

220
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,650
Destiny, destiny.

221
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,900
Did Miss Luo come back again?

222
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,900
Miss Luo,

223
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,230
this time, how long do you gonna stay here?

224
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,430
After I play enough.

225
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,020
Where's the poker?

226
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,560
poker?

227
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,260
Poker? I've gave you.

228
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,870
I have nothing, you put it to some place last time.

229
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,030
I haven't!

230
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,160
Dose it with you?

231
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,330
No! Not me.

232
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,630
Find it soon! Move your ass!

233
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,630
Okay! I'll go.

234
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,500
I'm here

235
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,360
to heard of your illness.

236
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,830
Illness?

237
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,790
I was

238
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,730
attacked by your baby Princess!

239
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,590
You interceded with me for her?

240
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,030
Mother,

241
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,630
please don't say "baby Princess".

242
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm so regret!

243
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,550
Regret?

244
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,290
I thought you really like Luo Feifei?

245
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,310
Mother,

246
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,830
I just was on an impulse.

247
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,920
I thought her personality

248
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,570
is very different from the others.

249
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,830
She's special.

250
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,360
But I just mistook curiosity for flip.

251
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,680
Now I think about it,

252
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,270
there's nothing curious.

253
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,700
While we haven't got marry,

254
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,980
I implore Mother cancel our marriage.

255
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,360
I've already announced everyone.

256
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,560
And witnessed by His Majesty.

257
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,650
Now you wanna cancel the marriage,

258
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,450
which makes royal's behave seems like a joke.

259
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,820
Mother, you're right.

260
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,270
Or we can do it like that.

261
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,500
Mother,

262
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,690
We can postpone the marriage.

263
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,270
When people are all forget it,

264
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,780
then we cancel the marriage.

265
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,010
All of you are worried me.

266
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,650
Let it go.

267
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,110
Okay, okay. Just do it.

268
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,450
Thank you, Mother.

269
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,350
Where' re you going?

270
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,960
You just said you'll hold me accountable.
