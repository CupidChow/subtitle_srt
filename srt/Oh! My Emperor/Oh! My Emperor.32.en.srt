1
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,600
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

2
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,500
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co.,Ltd

3
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,640
Episode 11

4
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,190
The priority now

5
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,550
is to find out the source of infection.

6
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,800
Shang Yu, issue my decree.

7
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,370
Command everyone to find the source of infection.

8
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,150
Must be careful.

9
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,050
Yes.

10
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,100
Be safe.

11
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,720
The disease of crazies is pandemic all around the Zodiac State,

12
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,970
causing chaos to all the citizens.

13
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,000
Thanks to the powerful General Chu

14
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,470
and the powerful Master Bai, who became powerful unexpectedly,

15
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,450
they led the State Army to fight the battle with the crazies.

16
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,000
Meanwhile, others did their job separately.

17
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,870
Chongchong used all the legendary secret tunnels

18
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,470
to collect important information.

19
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,050
Su Xunxian launched all the birds, insects and ancients mythical creatures

20
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,350
to find out the cause of the disaster.

21
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,970
Shang Yu who was invisible

22
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,150
has gone around the city in haste.

23
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,900
Beitang Moran, the Great Prince,

24
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,470
with his power of Constellation Initiation and his own beauty,

25
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,470
predicted the next epidemic area

26
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,700
and sent troops to put it down in time.

27
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,720
In this way, the state is stable for now.

28
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,570
Your Highness,

29
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,570
General Chu and Master Bai

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,920
have investigated in the infected area

31
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,270
and found two clues.

32
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,450
First, the food in the infected area

33
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,250
was safe.

34
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,120
Second,

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,220
the livestock didn't go crazy in the infected area.

36
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,100
It didn't work on the livestock,

37
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,750
which means that it only works on the human.

38
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,450
As long as we control the infected areas,

39
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,050
the disease will be under control.

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,520
I also found some clues.

41
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,070
Zhang Tianzheng and Mei Daren were attacked by the disease one after another.

42
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,020
But it's fine they are both in the isolation area.

43
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,170
It makes me wonder that

44
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,170
how Dragon Egg and Master Zhang

45
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,820
got infected by sitting at home.

46
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,820
Do you think those crazies

47
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,920
have anything in common?

48
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,450
Chongchong also got something.

49
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,320
Uncle Jian took me to inquire many people

50
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,570
and we finally found the guy who is infected with the virus first.

51
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,300
What did you find?

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,170
But that guy has already gone mad.

53
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,800
The first crazy never went out before.

54
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,770
You know, we also had the same food like them.

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,270
So what can make a man who never

56
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,020
goes out infected?

57
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,450
Chongchong,

58
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,900
is there anything special about that man?

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,900
I think of one thing.

60
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,900
Do you think the hobby of bathing counts?

61
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,200
Bathing?

62
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,120
Can it be the water's problem?

63
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,450
The crazies virus dissolved in the water.

64
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,400
Then the virus came into the body through pores.

65
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,870
So he was infected by the venom.

66
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,770
I remember one thing.

67
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,820
Master Zhang likes to boil eggs

68
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,370
with the water from the well guarded by Tianxingbao Pavilion.

69
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,950
Master Mei just made a bet with Master Zhang

70
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,350
and won one-month eggs of well water.

71
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,120
Just a few days after it, Master Mei was infected as well.

72
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,550
There is definitely something wrong with the water.

73
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,550
What should we do now?

74
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,700
Now we have a clue.

75
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,220
So we must follow up this clue.

76
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,920
I will go and test it.

77
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,420
Even if I am infected with the crazies virus,

78
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,400
it doesn't matter.

79
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,400
I have the power to protect myself.

80
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,270
And even if you can't find the antidote in a short time,

81
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,650
I can expel the poison myself slowly.

82
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:32,970
It's not big deal.

83
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,450
Don't worry about it.

84
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,320
No way.

85
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,450
His Majesty is more powerful than you.

86
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,450
But he can't resist the crazies virus.

87
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,200
What's more,

88
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,050
you power

89
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,470
can't make sure that you will be safe.

90
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,850
Besides,

91
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,500
if your power has rejection reaction,

92
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,150
then we can't figure out if the water is the problem.

93
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,700
This clue will be wasted.

94
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:56,950
Right.

95
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,350
We can find other clues.

96
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,420
There must be other ways.

97
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,250
I will go.

98
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,300
Don't worry.

99
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,520
I've made a plan.

100
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,520
The Ophiuchus people are coming soon.

101
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,600
Shang Yu, Xunxian,

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,600
you two go check the infected areas.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,250
We can't just sit around and wait.

104
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,670
Yes. Take care, Your Highness

105
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:22,920
Take care.

106
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,020
Your Highness!

107
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,750
Your Highness,

108
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,670
You want to take the bath yourself

109
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,300
because you're afraid that Feifei might be infected.

110
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,420
Am I right?

111
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,450
Yes.

112
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,750
You are still fond of Feifei

113
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,370
even though she has someone in her heart.

114
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,620
Yes.

115
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:11,820
Fine.

116
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,150
I understand.

117
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,300
Feifei is my best friend.

118
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,320
I like her very much as well.

119
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,350
Your decision is right.

120
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,550
If I were you, I would do the same.

121
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,300
♪Follow you for a long way.♪

122
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,820
Well, Feifei said she has found a new method.

123
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,250
Well, Feifei said she has found a new method.

Chongchong, we look at the water for a whole night

137
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,650
and find nothing wrong.

138
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,300
But I...

139
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,750
I can't see anything.

140
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,870
Your Highness.

141
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,920
Feifei, what's new?

142
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,500
Nothing new.

143
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,150
That's weird.

144
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,970
Yanran said...

145
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,250
Oh, no!

146
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,520
Wait for me!

147
00:08:59,340 --> 00:08:59,980
Yanran!

148
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:07,700
Yanran!

149
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,270
Yanran,

150
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,590
Yanran, what are you doing?

151
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,130
Come on, come out.

152
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,350
Feifei, you're my best friend.

153
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,070
You taught me how to fight for love actively.

154
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,870
You taught me how to break the common customs and practice.

155
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,970
I always support you and listen to you.

156
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,220
So today you need to listen to me.

157
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,600
Okay?

158
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:33,650
Okay.

159
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,950
I wait for you at the gate.

160
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,220
Call me if you need anything.

161
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,150
Let's go, Chongchong.

162
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,170
Feifei used to say

163
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,200
that what goes around comes around.

164
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,420
I used to peek at you when you were taking a bath.

165
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,350
Now I do the poison test for you.

166
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,900
We are even now.

167
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,700
Moran!

168
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,100
Yanran...

169
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,470
You meet me once.

170
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,020
I fall for you once.

171
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,600
You...

172
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,800
You look back at me with a smile,

173
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,850
I am ecstatic.

174
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,900
I can't remember how many times like that.

175
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,120
Let's put an end to it today.

176
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,850
I'm really...

177
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,720
I'm really tired.

178
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Why are you so silly?

179
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,840
Yes, I'm really silly.

180
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,250
I have fallen in love with you for ten years.

181
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,300
So if today

182
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,600
I miss the chance to tell you all about that,

183
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,330
I'm afraid...

184
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,530
I'm afraid...

185
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,530
Yanran...

186
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,150
Yanran.

187
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,670
Yanran!

188
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,220
Yanran!

189
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,470
Miss Big eater,

190
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
don't be upset.

191
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,920
Our clansmen are coming soon.

192
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,800
Besides, if Sister Yanran is infected,

193
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,550
I can cure her.

194
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,550
I'm very good.

195
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,650
Chongchong, what time is it now?

196
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,220
Almost the Taurus o'clock.

197
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,020
Taurus o'clock.

198
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,220
Right! The grumpy brother!

199
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,220
Yes!

200
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,670
No, no.

201
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,420
Chongchong,

202
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,150
if Yanran is attacked by the poison,

203
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,650
you need to cure her first.

204
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,470
I am going to grumpy brother's place now.

205
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,750
After I check on his condition,

206
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,930
I will go back and check on Yanran's.

207
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,470
You must stay clam and don't panic.

208
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,320
I'm leaving.

209
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:29,750
Remember!

210
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,450
Missy,

211
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,370
you come at last.

212
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,370
I think it's almost at Taurus o'clock.

213
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,560
If you don't show up,

214
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,560
I will send Dehai to Qixing Palace and get you.

215
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,050
I know it's almost the time so I came here.

216
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,270
I rushed here.

217
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,400
Is everything alright?

218
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,100
Nothing happens.

219
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,100
But now no news is good news.

220
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,550
Bilian is still there?

221
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,270
Yes.

222
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,270
It's fortunate that she likes my brother

223
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,800
so that she won't hurt him.

224
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,000
Why are you here?

225
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:32,550
Where's Feifei?

226
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,620
Feifei was afraid of being infected.

227
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,870
So she left first.

228
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,450
Grandma-Empress went to pray for you.

229
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,450
And she sent me to take care of you.

230
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,650
Your Majesty,

231
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,850
I've already controlled your disease.

232
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,850
It won't harm you anymore.

233
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,850
You can rest easy, Your Majesty.

234
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,650
It's late at night.

235
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,320
Let me serve you to have a sleep.

236
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:57,970
Impudent!

237
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,360
Your Majesty, I...

238
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,000
Your Majesty, you're sick.

239
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,220
Please don't use your power anymore.

240
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,220
Otherwise the poison will spread more quickly.

241
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,450
Help!

242
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,000
You untied the rope and buttons?

243
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,420
Yes.

244
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,250
Luo Feifei, how dare you slap me? You evil girl!

245
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,420
I told you not to move anything.

246
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,150
I told you before!

247
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,750
Do you know that if he goes crazy again,

248
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,920
it will speed up the spread of the poison?

249
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,250
Do you know that?

250
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,570
I know.

251
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,700
Guards!

252
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,400
Drag this woman out.

253
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,070
Execute her directly.

254
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,600
I was decreed by Grandma-Empress to

255
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,720
take care of His Majesty.

256
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,350
If you hurt me a little bit,

257
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,970
I'd like to know how you explain to the Grandma-Empress.

258
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,450
If I die,

259
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,420
I will drag you down to accompany me.

260
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,220
Bilian,

261
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:50,900
I'm telling you,

262
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,600
if there's something wrong with Beitang Yi,

263
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,970
You will die for sure.

264
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,370
Drag her out.

265
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,770
I'm serving Grandma-Empress.

266
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,100
Who dare to touch me?

267
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,770
Luo Feifei, you took revenge in the name of His Majesty.

268
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,120
I must report to Grandma-Empress

269
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,300
that you intend to murder His Majesty.

270
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:36,870
Your Majesty!

271
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,950
Lord Luo!

272
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,250
In his whole life, His Majesty

273
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:41,530
Dehai!

274
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,130
has never had such serious disease.

275
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,330
You must save him, Lord Luo!

276
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Eunuch Hai!

277
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,330
Eunuch Hai, rise please.

278
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,130
Eunuch Hai, I will try my best.

279
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,860
Miss Big eater, I have a big discovery.

280
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,460
Chongchong. I'm so tired.

281
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,530
Quick, have a seat.

282
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,660
Sister Yanran has been attacked by the virus.

283
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,330
I controlled the disease for now.

284
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,330
Then I found out that

285
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
there is something wrong with the bath water.

286
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
The water is colorless and tasteless

287
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,820
because the poison was diluted.

288
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,820
When the poison enters the body

289
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,820
and reacts with the venom,

290
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,820
the mutation occurs after

291
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,420
accumulating for a while.

292
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,750
That's the reason why they were affected.

293
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,350
My grandpa taught me before

294
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,870
that if the poison enters from the skin without hurting the heart,

295
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,470
then we only need 150 grams of Sweet Dream fruit,

296
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,820
25 grams of Lucky grass,

297
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,370
and 5 grams of citrus powder

298
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,670
to make a pill and let the patient take it.

299
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,020
Then the patient can expel the the toxin bit by bit and recover in the end.

300
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,850
Chongchong, are you sure?

301
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,320
In our village, my grandpa just used this remedy

302
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,520
to cure several crazies who were infected for a short time.

303
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,420
After taking these three kinds of drugs,

304
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,820
some people might sweat a lot,

305
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,820
some might poo a lot,

306
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,750
and some might vomit three days.

307
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,750
Anyway, we can get rid of the poison then.

308
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,320
Good.

309
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,300
That's great.

310
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,470
With this medicine,

311
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,150
my brother and others can be saved.

312
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,370
The poison in Sister Yanran is easy to remove.

313
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,770
But the poison in grumpy brother's body...

314
00:17:59,470 --> 00:17:59,870
What's wrong?

315
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
He can't be cured by taking medicine.

316
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,500
So we can only wait for our clansmen

317
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:04,920
to save him.

318
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,420
Chongchong, you did a good job.

319
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,420
But I need you to

320
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,500
take care of Sister Yanran later.

321
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,750
Help her to drink the antidote you mentioned at once.

322
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,950
Eunuch Hai, please take Chongchong to Qixing Palace.

323
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,720
Chongchong, when all is over,

324
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,350
I will buy you many delicious food.

325
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:28,700
Okay?

326
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,970
Miss Big eater, you must keep your promise.

327
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,720
And don't break it just because I have decayed tooth.

328
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,350
I won't. Just go now.

329
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,300
Big white tooth,

330
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,270
you go find the doctor

331
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,920
and cook the medicine that Chongchong mentioned.

332
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,450
Even if it doesn't work,

333
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,020
it can control the poison a little bit.

334
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,800
Alright.

335
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,450
Yanran, Chongchong found the antidote.

336
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,220
You will be safe.

337
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,800
Pretty brother,

338
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,150
let Sister Xie take this pill

339
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,170
and she will be alright.

340
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,550
Yanran...

341
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,020
Yanran...

342
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,720
Sister Xie is fine now.

343
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,950
My lady.

344
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,970
Yanran, you're awake.

345
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:45,870
Thank you, Chongchong.

346
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,300
Your Highness, something happened in the Constellation Palace.

347
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,150
Yanran, you have a rest first.

348
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,670
Xiaohe, take care of Yanran.

349
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:13,920
Yes.

350
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,050
My lady, my lady.

351
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,450
Dragon Egg...

352
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,550
Dragon Egg!

353
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,570
Dragon Egg!

354
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,550
Dragon Egg, good boy. I'm here.

355
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,100
There, there.

356
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,100
Feifei!

357
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,020
Missy, you were bitten.

358
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,170
What should we do?

359
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,200
Sister Xie!

360
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,370
My lady,

361
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,270
slow down, my lady.

362
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:42,920
Sister.

363
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,370
Yanran.

364
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:45,950
Why do you come here

365
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,170
instead of having a rest?

366
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,620
We can take care of my brother.

367
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,900
You should go back and take a rest.

368
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,300
Feifei, your wound...

369
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,200
Feifei, you're infected with the crazies virus.

370
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,200
You should take the medicine.

371
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,200
I don't need it.

372
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,850
Don't worry about me.

373
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,850
Now the important thing is

374
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,470
to keep Dragon Egg under control.

375
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,270
Once the virus get into the brain,

376
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,950
there's no way to control it.

377
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,100
See,

378
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,970
the poison has been gradually receding.

379
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,970
Sister,

380
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,970
what medicine did you have him take?

381
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,970
I didn't give him any medicine.

382
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,270
It was said medicine didn't work at all.

383
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,820
What's happening?

384
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,270
It's Feifei's...

385
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,920
It's Feifei's blood.
