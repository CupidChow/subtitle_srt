00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,110
Where' re you going?

5
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,440
You just said you'll hold me accountable.

6
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Go away.

7
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,900
Your Majesty,

8
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,000
recently what we thought the monster is pest plague.

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,580
The black and red pests of hard shells are everywhere.

10
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,160
They destroyed the fields.

11
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,030
People are suffering.

12
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,360
Your Majesty,

13
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,630
the pests spread to the city

14
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,910
from the fields for a few days.

15
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,060
Rumors of

16
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,740
something strange be predicted and the monsters rampant bound.

17
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,240
More.

18
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,130
When they feel dangerous,

19
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,230
they will get together to become a huge monster.

20
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,630
Jixiong.

21
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,290
Several stores in dong street slept in the morning

22
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,030
the pests filled in their houses,

23
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,560
even the roof.

24
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,900
Well,

25
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,960
Where do the pests come from?

26
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,620
Your Majesty,

27
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,640
The pests go everywhere and they'll destroy everything,

28
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,340
and leave a puddle of thick mucus

29
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,120
with the stench hangs in the air.

30
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,550
The pests eat human.

31
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,360
Fall into the pests,

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,620
the body will be broke in the moment.

33
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,030
If you can't flee in time,

34
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,900
there's rarely anything left of them.

35
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,900
We need to kill them all as quickly as we can,

36
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,340
or they kill us.

37
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,120
Please, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,810
We need to know

39
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,800
where the pests came from and to solve the problem.

40
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,360
Master Mei, Zhang Tianzheng.

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,600
Your Majesty.

42
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,100
I appoint you to find out the source of the pests.

43
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

44
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,360
General Chu.

45
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

46
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,080
I appoint you to protect the people with crack troops.

47
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,200
Kill them all when you see the pests.

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

49
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Feifei,

50
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,940
Feifei, wake up,

51
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,130
I'm Yanran.

52
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,820
Feifei, Feifei.

53
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,480
Why are you so late?

54
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,050
I thought you wouldn't come.

55
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,120
How can I leave you here!

56
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,900
I'm a loyal gal.

57
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,030
We should share happiness and hardship.

58
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Grandma-Empress.

59
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,390
I helped you.

60
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,250
Sit down!

61
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,000
She's more rebellious than before.

62
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,230
Such a good kid

63
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,030
who'd been led astray by Luo Feifei.

64
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,240
I am back.

65
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,050
What are you doing?

66
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,120
Open the door! I have something inform to His Majesty.

67
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,870
Who are you?

68
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,710
Is you the Prince Tang?

69
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,920
How can't you recognize Prince Tang!

70
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,350
Enough!

71
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,940
He don't know who I am before.

72
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,220
Take me to His Majesty.

73
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,780
Please come in.

74
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,430
Okay.

75
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,410
Your Majesty!

76
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,640
Your Majesty!

77
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,140
Your Majesty, the Prince Tang is back!

78
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,410
The Prince Tang is back!

79
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,520
Where's he?

80
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,880
Prince Tang is fatigue.

81
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,390
I asked them to take him to qinning Chamber to clean up,

82
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,310
and meet Your Majesty after having a short rest.

83
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,490
That's good.

84
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,440
Did he hurt?

85
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,010
A little.

86
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,360
He've bound up.

87
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,430
It's okay.

88
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,950
Then I will ask the doctor to diagnose.

89
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,540
Good.

90
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,960
Finally came back.

91
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,660
Black Joker!

92
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,100
Red Joker!

93
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,970
It's good to have you here.

94
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,200
Look.

95
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,760
Is somebody

96
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,260
in the prison like me?

97
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,960
Cool? Cool!

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,460
Now the country have panicking,

99
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,780
it's a good place here.

100
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,330
Panic?

101
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,280
Why?

102
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,160
Pest plague.

103
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,370
The people are scared to go out.

104
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,180
What's that?

105
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,320
How to say.

106
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,500
Wait, I draw it.

107
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
This size?

108
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,350
Like that.

109
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,780
Have you seem?

110
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,750
No.

111
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,770
What's it?

112
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,990
What did you draw?

113
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,580
The painting doesn't look like it?

114
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,520
No.

115
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,650
I think It's good.

116
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,340
Big big big pest!

117
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,410
Where?

118
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,990
Quickly! Pest! It's at your feet!

119
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,040
What the hell pest!

120
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,250
That's it! That's it!

121
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,630
Long time no see! Crayfish!

122
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,210
Come here!

123
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,400
Brother! I found an important clue!

124
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,950
When we saved Xifeng Lie,

125
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,500
I and Shangyu found that

126
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,230
it's all the Orion State did.

127
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,680
I knew it!

128
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,610
However,

129
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,680
why they can always take control of Ophiuchus?

130
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,160
They made a poison

131
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,940
to control people's mind.

132
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,120
The people forced to drink it,

133
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,520
and they can control them.

134
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,880
It not only can diverted our attention,

135
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,600
but also can reduce their risk

136
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,310
and their objective and checklists.

137
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,040
They can attack our interior.

138
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,080
I see.

139
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,700
Tangtang, thank you.

140
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,640
Brother.

141
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,590
You don't know who I am!

142
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,200
I'm the Lord of Pisces in Zodiac State,

143
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,560
and the little Prince of Beitang family.

144
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,030
Bei Tangtang, Your Highness the Prince Tang.

145
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,950
Take some rest.

146
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,230
In a few days,

147
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,700
what you want the iron back elephant will be come.

148
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,170
Brother, you know me.

149
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,400
Tomorrow.

150
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,300
Do lords here have any idea to solve the problem?

151
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,220
Your Majesty,

152
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,740
it's hard to solve than before.

153
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,960
There are many people being starved.

154
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,230
If this goes on,

155
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,100
it will caused more disasters.

156
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,840
Yeah. Yeah.

157
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,150
If we can't stop it,

158
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,400
there will be a riot.

159
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,990
If we safeguard it after that happened,

160
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,570
it's an enormous cost.

161
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,130
What should we do?

162
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,830
Why do the pests stand in my way?

163
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,840
The people is my people!

164
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,950
I can't leave them.

165
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,400
Moreover,

166
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,820
people's mind is the foundation of our country.

167
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,800
Declare my order,

168
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,670
Open the granaries and distribute the foods.

169
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,820
Calm the people down,

170
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,160
then we can better to solve the problem.

171
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

172
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,510
Grandma-Empress,

173
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,100
I really miss Missy,

174
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,570
and I haven't seem her for a long time.

175
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,930
Okay, okay.

176
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,060
Be careful of your injury.

177
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,080
Let me think about it.

178
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,230
Yi'er, how do you deal with the pest plague?

179
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,830
Grandma-Empress, please forgive my disability.

180
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,900
I heard that pest plague

181
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,030
have already spread to the Qingxin Palace.

182
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,120
I'm not afraid it,

183
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,160
but

184
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,930
the eunuchs and maids.

185
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,730
They can't sleep at night.

186
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,700
Mother,

187
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,500
I heard the Palace's jailers said

188
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,440
there's a person who can do it.

189
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,390
Can't believe there's such a capable person.

190
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,300
You knew her, Mother.

191
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,060
Who?

192
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,420
Luo Feifei.

193
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,740
Still that wicked girl?

194
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,580
Mother,

195
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,360
she no offense on that day.

196
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,570
It's just misunderstanding.

197
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,900
Right, misunderstanding.

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,300
What a misunderstanding in the world!

199
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,760
It was rebel!

200
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,870
It's awkward for me!

201
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,250
Grandma-Empress, something bad!

202
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,700
There' re so many pests in Qingxin Palace.

203
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,900
Grandma-Empress, you'd better go to the safe place.

204
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,760
Be quick! Let the wicked girl out.

205
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,830
Quickly!

206
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,960
Gragon Egg,

207
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,620
I knew you will save me.

208
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,520
It's the Grandma-Empress.

209
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,260
Grandma-Empress?

210
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,780
She agreed to let me go?

211
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,000
Tangtang is back.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,870
He pestered Grandma-Empress for you.

213
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,140
Is he back?

214
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,080
Go, go, go.

215
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,700
Your Majesty, Prince Tang is Okay.

216
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,160
But he needs to rest for a while.

217
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,560
You can leave.

218
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,680
Your Majesty.

219
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,680
I said It's okay.

220
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,540
You must call a doctor.

221
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,860
It's too troubling!

222
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,130
Look at you, ungrateful guy!

223
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,790
He do it all for you.

224
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,280
We can relax when the doctor said you're okay.

225
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,840
Missy,

226
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,620
so why you not come to see me?

227
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,820
I knew you're okay.

228
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,880
What?

229
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,900
I saved people in the Orion State

230
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,300
who bully me excessively.

231
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,980
Poor boy.

232
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,020
Come here.

233
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,960
It's okay. It's okay.

234
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,610
Crayfish.

235
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,640
Eat it.

236
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,080
This is yours, this is yours,

237
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,780
this is mine.

238
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,760
What are you waiting for? Try it!

239
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,960
It's really delicious!

240
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
This is garlic,

241
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
spiced.

242
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,560
I tell you

243
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,010
your hearth is not good.

244
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,200
Or I'll do the same thing like before.

245
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,560
It's your hearth's problem.

246
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,430
If I can

247
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,050
have one knife on it,

248
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,750
that will be more tasty!

249
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,800
That

250
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,560
big pest

251
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,520
is so ugly and...

252
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,260
How it will be delicious?

253
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,660
Big pest! Big pest!

254
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,130
Don't use such dreadful words!

255
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,090
They had a kawaii name,

256
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,120
which called crayfish.

257
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,750
Got it?

258
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,140
I honestly say

259
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,810
there's no one can be more

260
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,430
delicious than crayfish.

261
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,300
Wait a sec, kawaii?

262
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,070
"Kawaii" means "cute".

263
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,470
That's cute?

264
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,830
Shengnan, trust me,

265
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,770
try it.

266
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,960
You will not be regret.

267
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Try what I did it.

268
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,750
No.

269
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,190
Afraid?

270
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,670
What?

271
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,850
Who I am?

272
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,300
I'm afraid it?

273
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,800
Yep!

274
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,760
There's nothing our General Chu will be afraid in the word.

275
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,670
Shengnan, but I heard that

276
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,700
somebody said

277
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,910
the first one who eat the crab is brave.

278
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,760
The first one who eat the crayfish

279
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,960
is fierce.

280
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,490
Someone always said she had valor,

281
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,490
but I do not see any "valor" in the key time.

282
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,240
No, no, no.

283
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,850
My valor

284
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:23,080
doesn't need the crayfish to prove it.

285
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,200
Afraid?

286
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,610
Right! You're afraid!

287
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,120
I can't believe there's something General Chu will be afraid.

288
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,600
Yep.

289
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,700
She also have something afraid.

290
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,800
I, I.

291
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,480
That, that.

292
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,840
Today, I invite you to try a new food.

293
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,700
Please try it.

294
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,130
People have their own life but they can't control the end.

295
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,460
Everything will be gone.

296
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,590
That's all.

297
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,520
Even I read tremendously,

298
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,960
but I can't understand the causation.

299
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,440
Destiny, destiny.

300
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,480
I had countless troubles in my life

301
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,160
and never flinched.

302
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,130
But now.

303
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,870
Well,

304
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,960
It's the real thing we can eat?

305
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,630
You sure Miss Luo is not kidding?

306
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,430
Yeah! Yeah! It's delicious!

307
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,230
Try it! Try it! It can eat!

308
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,600
Your Majesty, it seems need to peel.

309
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,220
Dali, delicious?

310
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,890
I will not eat it until dead.

311
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,830
Come over here and take a look!

312
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,700
Look at that and try it!

313
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,180
Thirteen spices, spicy and spiced crayfish.

314
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,580
There's everything you want.

315
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,090
Watch your step!

316
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,090
Jumping the queue, you cut in line!

317
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,640
Luo Feifei is a fool.

318
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,100
I want to buy a brand of spicy crayfish

319
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,800
with 400 C-coins.

320
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,450
She's unwilling!

321
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,300
If she sells it

322
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,150
with 400 C-coins,

323
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,670
she would be the real fool.

324
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,700
So how many you pay for it? Tell me.

325
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,980
40,000 C-coins.

326
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,470
What?

327
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,140
Look at the bright words.

328
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,430
Quickly!

329
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,040
Everyone have it!

330
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,500
Well, slow down! Slow down! Don't run together!

331
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,590
Don't crowd!

332
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,670
Okay! One by one!

333
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,540
Grandma-Empress, please let me peel it for you.

334
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,450
No!

335
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,970
You can leave.

336
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,690
Leave.

337
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,560
Eating such some monsters

338
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
needs to peel it by myself,

339
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,790
otherwise, there's boring.

340
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,630
Grandma-Empress,

341
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,030
Have you too enjoyed the happiness of family,

342
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,300
then forgot our country's plan?

343
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,350
You also wanna teach me?

344
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,010
I...

345
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,380
You looks like

346
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,650
overzealous this title.

347
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,070
I deem it an honor to accept the His Majesty's entrustment.

348
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,640
He asked me to help you complete the plan of building a State.

349
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,200
Now the relationship between Beitang Yi and Luo Feifei

350
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,500
become more close.

351
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,830
It's hard to run the plan which tries to

352
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,700
incite the relationship of Ophiuchus and Zodiac State.

353
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,540
Why don't we kill Luo Feifei first.

354
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,810
It will make Beitang Yi sorrowful.

355
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,150
Then we poison him,

356
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,230
and tell the world he died because of depression.

357
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,230
After all, he's my own grandson.

358
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,040
He should have never been

359
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,460
born in the world!

360
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,960
You.  Grandma-Empress. Your Majesty and Miss Luo are asking to see you.

361
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,340
Reject.

362
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,250
Hold on,

363
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,620
let Lord Luo come in.
