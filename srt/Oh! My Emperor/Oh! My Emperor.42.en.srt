77
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,160
The girl was bumped to fly.

78
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Help her first! Hurry up!

79
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,630
Too fast! Oh my God!

80
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,120
She hurts seriously.

81
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,010
Come on, help her! Help her!

82
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't know it is a dream or not.

83
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,160
But I remember all of them.

84
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,220
And it's so real.

85
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,870
Feifei,

86
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,480
recently you read more constellation books

87
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,080
than professional books.

88
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,650
You wanna find a new job?

89
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,100
A new job?

90
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
Who gonna accept me?

91
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,010
Do you believe time travel?

92
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,010
Yes.

93
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,010
I also believe the returns of White Snake.

94
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,060
I knew it.

95
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,060
Right.

96
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,060
Nobody believes time travel.

97
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,060
It's incredible.

98
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,470
All accidentally is inevitable.

99
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,250
The rest of them

100
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,000
have something undiscovered causality.

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,770
Like fate.

102
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,840
They will meet each other by mutual attraction.

103
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,610
For example, the stars.

104
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,620
They have their own orbits,

105
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,000
but they will meet the other stars one day.

106
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,650
I believe,

107
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,180
one day, I will meet my Mr·Right

108
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,180
accidentally.

109
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,770
All accidentally is inevitable.

110
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,770
Good gal.

111
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,360
Not a stuff.

112
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,100
I have a friend who writes novels.

113
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,050
He said the structure of theater

114
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,050
can explain lots of things in life.

115
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,170
Something looks complex, but actually it's easy.

116
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,590
No matter how do you think about it, it's just a circle.

117
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,570
I can't understand.

118
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,990
I'll sing a

119
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,980
Little Star to all of you!

120
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,760
Boss, you've got a few customers here.

121
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,240
A little bad business these days.

122
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
But I think,

123
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,160
lady, your friend got a bad day, right?

124
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,420
Bad?

125
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,970
I'll give you some money.

126
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,710
You may take your friend

127
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,250
to try that one opposite.

128
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,360
Let your friend teach them a lesson.

129
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,060
What?

130
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,190
Please! Please help me!

131
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,820
Please take her away.

132
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,890
The other customers left because she's singing.

133
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,900
Twinkle twinkle little star.

134
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,290
How I wonder what you are.

135
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,340
Up above the world so high.

136
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,250
Dragon egg,

137
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,560
I miss you.

138
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,000
Dragon egg!

139
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,050
According to the observation of astronomers.

140
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,580
Tonight, it's the nearest distance between Ophiuchus

141
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,360
and the earth in recent years.

142
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,200
Because it's so close to earth orbit,

143
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
that's why it's so obvious this time.

144
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,740
It's rare

145
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,110
to see that.

146
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,110
Because Ophiuchus just need a little time to cross the Milky Way.

147
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,110
So that the center direction of the west of the Milky Way

148
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,750
which nears the stars beside Ophiuchus.

149
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,760
Tonight! 8:00 pm.

150
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,020
You can expect to see Ophiuchus

151
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,750
in our Jianlong mountain.

152
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,300
Now,

153
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,600
there are many astronomers

154
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,000
arrived there.

155
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,780
I hope all of you pay attention to your safety.

156
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,780
Be sure not to stampede.

157
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,780
Feifei.

158
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,580
In China, the official name of Ophiuchus

159
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,510
mainly belongs to Heavenly Market Enclosure, Housing accommodation and Tail accommodation.

160
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,580
Xiaoyu.

161
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,580
I heard that Ophiuchus is the only one constellation

162
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,850
which can connect with Cancer.

163
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,410
Master! Master! Please stop!

164
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,410
Stop!

165
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,530
Wait, I've remembered it.

166
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,530
Okay, thank you, doctor.

167
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,140
Where?

168
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,970
Workers stadium, please.

169
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,970
Got it.

170
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,550
Don't move! Don't move!

171
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,580
Cold?

172
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,000
You're here.

173
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,450
I thought you'll come here.

174
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,190
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

175
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,040
Bad dragon egg!

176
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,770
I'm not dragon egg.

177
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,770
You are talking about other person.

178
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,770
Talking about other person.

179
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,770
You can just tell me you want my signature.

180
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,700
Is it funny?

181
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,600
Is it funny to masquerade someone's boyfriend?

182
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
What are you still looking at?

183
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,820
Jiacheng! Jiacheng!

184
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,040
Jiacheng, I'm a big fan of you!

185
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Quickly! Jiacheng! Take some pictures quickly!

186
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040

191
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,000

192
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
then I will punish you.
