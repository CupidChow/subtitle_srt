1
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:01,160
Oh! My Emperor

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,560
Episode 7

4
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,430
Do you have any sympathy?

5
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,700
An old woman is sitting here. Can't you see?

6
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,700
Why don't you give her a hand?

7
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,230
Why are there so many people gathering around?

8
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,360
And the traffic is blocked.

9
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,360
Let's go and check.

10
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,500
That's too much!

11
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,830
Do you have any sympathy?

12
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,100
The Ophiuchus people are born to be vicious.

13
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,430
It can't go wrong to keep away from them.

14
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,230
Am I right?

15
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,430
Yes! Just kill her!

16
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,760
She also stole our things!

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,430
Nonsense, you are lying.

18
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,320
She's the thief!

19
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,960
Let's go.

20
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,900
I didn't steal his things.

21
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,630
Just ignore him.

22
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,360
Let's go.

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,360
Give me the beans.

24
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
You...

25
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,560
You!

26
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,160
Beitang Yi!

27
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,030
You were just watching your savior falling down

28
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,360
and didn't catch her!

29
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
Do you have any tenderness toward a girl?

30
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,230
Can't you feel the sting of conscience? The sting?

31
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,830
Luo Feifei.

32
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,830
How dare you insult and attack me?

33
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,100
Insult and attack you?

34
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,630
You're a lecherous liar!

35
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,700
Instead of being grateful, you blamed it on me!

36
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,360
Is there a law or something?

37
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Woman,

38
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,030
you played all these tricks

39
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,700
just to catch my attention.

40
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,100
Guards.

41
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,100
Arrest the girl who attacked and insulted

42
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,500
the emperor.

43
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,760
Move! Move!

44
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,960
Brother, I will win the game for you.

45
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
What is he doing?

46
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,430
How can I know?

47
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,560
So confusing.

48
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,560
Why haven't the guys of Fire Sign come yet?

49
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,560
How can I know?

50
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,760
Still confusing.

51
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,700
If they still don't show up,

52
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,430
after the Sagittarius hour,

53
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,900
we will win the bye.

54
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,560
Can we win so easily?

55
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,030
How can I know?

56
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,760
Confusing.

57
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,630
Why do you always repeat the same sentence?

58
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,430
Confusing.

59
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,230
I should stick to it.

60
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,300
When the guys of Fire Sign come,

61
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,230
they will all be intimidated by my awesome looking.

62
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,700
The win rate with Water Sign tomorrow is...

63
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,230
The game is set.

64
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,500
That's right.

65
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,300
To Prince Chen, to tomorrow's victory.

66
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,360
Cheers!

67
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,830
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

68
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,230
Stop!

69
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,760
Stop!

70
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,360
Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness!

71
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,030
Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness!

72
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,830
Stop!

73
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Your Highness.

74
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Your Majesty.

75
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,760
It seems that Your Majesty cares nothing about the game,

76
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,230
and have time to play around on the street.

77
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,030
Your Highness should know that

78
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,030
this is the way to the competition terrain.

79
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,700
What happened?

80
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,560
He

81
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,900
took advantages of me

82
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,760
and wanted to throw me in jail.

83
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,160
Nonsense.

84
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,160
Why are you standing there?

85
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,830
Go and arrest her.

86
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,160
I'd like to know

87
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,300
who dares to touch my girl.

88
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Your Highness, what are you talking about?

89
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,830
I'm saying that I will protect you.

90
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,830
Isn't that a classic line of

91
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,900
the hero in a novel?

92
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,430
That's like the Mary Sue plot.

93
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,700
Finally I can be a little like the heroine in a Korean drama.

94
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,300
Your Highness, it's almost the time.

95
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,560
The first game of the Military Power Race

96
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,500
has begun.

97
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,030
We can't make it if we set off now.

98
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,500
Why don't we just compete here?

99
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,160
What do you think, Your Majesty?

100
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,560
Arrest her first.

101
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Then we can compete.

102
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,630
According to the rule of the first game,

103
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,900
four signs compete and three can enter the second round.

104
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,360
Now that we don't have other two signs,

105
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,430
it's alright that we two teams

106
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,500
compete first.

107
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,760
Let's compete one-on-one.

108
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,430
The winner can advance to the second round

109
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,760
and go away with Luo Feifei.

110
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,160
What do you think, Your Majesty?

111
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,560
All right.

112
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,360
Then please go easy on us, Your Majesty.

113
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,760
Do they compete for real?

114
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,900
We are all scholars but now we involve in fighting.

115
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,430
I don't think it abides by the sage's moral codes.

116
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Alright. Then let's have a brain competition.

117
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,300
Master Mei, in your opinion,

118
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,630
what's the win rate of Bai Wuchen?

119
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,030
What's wrong with my power?

120
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,100
Your Majesty, according to my calculation,

121
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,230
Master Bai can win definitely.

122
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,360
Within ten moves,

123
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,230
Master Bai is sure to...

124
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,430
He failed.

125
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,700
Pure luck.

126
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,630
Pure luck.

127
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,430
The competition has just begun.

128
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,830
The competition has just begun indeed.

129
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,760
But I believe that

130
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,760
it will end soon.

131
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,230
It's getting late and we have to leave.

132
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,230
Nephew, you need to work harder.

133
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,960
Why does nobody come?

134
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,700
How can I know?

135
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,500
I'm so tired. No,

136
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,430
I can't embarrass my brother.

137
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,960
I should hang on.

138
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,230
Tomorrow we will compete with Water Sign.

139
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,430
We must win.

140
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,960
So His Highness will have more chance to win.

141
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,330
You must be wrong.

142
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,360
The game is

143
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,160
the day after tomorrow.

144
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,230
It's tomorrow.

145
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,760
Tuesday.

146
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,030
Water regurgitation.

147
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,760
Battle is dominated.

148
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,360
Tuesday?

149
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,760
Isn't, isn't tomorrow Saturday?

150
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,160
It's Tuesday.

151
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,700
But today is Tuesday.

152
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,160
Result of Final Three: Fire Sign is automatically forfeited.

153
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,560
Water Sign is advanced.

154
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,700
Those three guys of Fire Sign

155
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,900
were too scared to

156
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,030
show up.

157
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,230
I told you that they three were intimidated by me.

158
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,830
Lord of Fire Sign always support Prince Chen.

159
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,900
Did they forfeit the game for something fishy?

160
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,760
Something fishy?

161
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,700
Brother, just don't bother anymore.

162
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,560
Now you,

163
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,900
me and Uncle Chen,

164
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,630
we three elites of Beitang can be in the final.

165
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
That's nice.

166
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,700
It my fault to get the wrong time.

167
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,960
It's also my fault. I should be punished.

168
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,500
I...

169
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,560
What's done is done. No more explanation.

170
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,360
Each of you takes twenty spankings later.

171
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,560
Yes.

172
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,630
I was too weak to win the game.

173
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,100
I should be punished, Your Majesty.

174
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,160
No need to blame yourself.

175
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,360
You've done your best.

176
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,030
I was too weak to have the right result.

177
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,360
Your Majesty, please...

178
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,500
Rise.

179
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,160
It's not a good thing.

180
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,230
Why do you fight for it?

181
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,960
Right.

182
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,230
I have been fighting against him for ten years.

183
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,900
No need to care about one game.

184
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,030
News!

185
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,560
Your Majesty, it's said that...

186
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,230
Your Majesty,

187
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,430
Lord Fang said that those Ophiuchus lunatics

188
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,560
were all released and rescued.

189
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,160
Yes, those Ophiuchus...

190
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,360
I've seen those Ophiuchus lunatics.

191
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,360
They can go mad with great harm.

192
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,230
Yes, if...

193
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,160
If they go out,

194
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,830
the damage can be inconceivable, Your Majesty.

195
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,030
Then why don't you send the guards to chase them?

196
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,960
Whatever happens,

197
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,230
catch all those people for me.

198
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,360
Yes.

199
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,230
Master Fang, do you have anything to say?

200
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,360
Nothing.

201
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,230
Your Majesty,

202
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,960
Prince Chen has the military power.

203
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,830
Send someone to inform Prince Chen.

204
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,630
Are these jewelries all given to me?

205
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,700
His Highness is so generous.

206
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,030
I feel a little bit embarrassed.

207
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:07,700
This is the first time

208
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,430
that His Highness gives so many jewelry to a girl.

209
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,100
You have such a good luck.

210
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,500
Dinner is ready.

211
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,700
I will deliver it to you later.

212
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,900
Thank you. Thanks.

213
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,830
Never smile. That's weird.

214
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,360
Water signs advances automatically.

215
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,160
It seems that your nephew is lucky enough.

216
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,560
Just by accident.

217
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,500
Miss Luo must mean a lot to you.

218
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,430
Otherwise, you won't care about her.

219
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,230
Care about her?

220
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,160
I only care about the valuable person.

221
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,630
Thank you.

222
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,630
Miss Luo, water for washing feet.

223
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,760
You don't need to do this for me anymore.

224
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,960
You are our honored guest.

225
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,230
I should do such things for you.

226
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,160
No, no, no. Let me ask you something, okay?

227
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,760
Did His Highness say

228
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,160
that what should I do

229
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
now that he brought me here?

230
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,030
You don't need to do anything.

231
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,700
Just settle down and feel at ease.

232
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,900
Without a phone and Wifi,

233
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,360
how can I feel at ease?

234
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,030
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

235
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,430
Never mind. Please fetch my bag to me.

236
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,830
Bag.

237
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,960
Yes.

238
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,830
Thanks.

239
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,760
I miss you so much!

240
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,230
What's this?

241
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,900
Facial mask.

242
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,560
What is it used for?

243
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,100
For skin care.

244
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,560
We need to know some skin care skills at our age.

245
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,030
Otherwise, you will get old easily.

246
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,100
That's alright.

247
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,760
We also have cosmetics here.

248
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,160
How can they be the same?

249
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,300
They are totally different.

250
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,630
The cosmetics here contains high amount of lead

251
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,960
and it's harmful to the skin without hyaluronic acid.

252
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,360
Look at your foggy face.

253
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,760
Maybe I can just call you Foggy.

254
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,630
How about that?

255
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,560
When I don't have facial masks,

256
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,830
I can just watch you for fun.

257
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,430
All, all right. You can go and have a rest.

258
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,830
Yes.
