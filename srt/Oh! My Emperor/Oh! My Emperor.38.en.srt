00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,360
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,630
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,560
Episode 17

4
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,360
Why do you want to get into the Palace with me?

5
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,360
Anyway, it's my wedding.

6
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,430
All of a sudden, you care about the wedding?

7
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,700
You aren't trying to scrutinize the topography here, are you?

8
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,630
So it's convenient for you to do something bad?

9
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,960
You suspect me?

10
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,830
I am just kidding.

11
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,560
Don't be mad.

12
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,760
Besides,

13
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,160
in your present body,

14
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,160
it's a little hard to do bad things.

15
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,760
No, hold on.

16
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,560
What's wrong with my present body?

17
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,700
It's because of you.

18
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,900
You make me eat so much every day.

19
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,030
Of course I gain weight.

20
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,360
Okay, I dare not to say are fat.

21
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,960
What's more,

22
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,360
no matter what you become,

23
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,030
I will always like you.

24
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,630
Sweet words.

25
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,560
I mean it.

26
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,760
Not just sweet words.

27
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,430
Moreover,

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,430
I am holding your hands right now,

29
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,030
which means you are my wife.

30
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,560
Okay, I believe you. Just let my hands go.

31
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,430
No.

32
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,230
You don't want your hands, do you?

33
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,230
Do you know that spicy gluten sticks?

34
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,230
Your place doesn't have that, you know.

35
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,830
Here they come.

36
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,760
Spicy slices, you know?

37
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,560
That is...

38
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,030
Prince Tang,

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,630
today is for discussing about the wedding things of Your Majesty.

40
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,900
Why do you bring this vicious woman here?

41
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
What vicious woman?

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,430
She has a name, which is Xia Bing.

43
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,700
And she is a peace-making marriage princess from the Orion State.

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,760
My fiancee.

45
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,160
Prince Tang,

46
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560
though in that situation,

47
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,900
a private meeting like this,

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,760
you bring such a beautiful foreign female here.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,960
Is it a little improper?

50
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,630
She is going to be my wife.

51
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,100
I bring her here

52
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,160
is to eliminate misunderstandings you have to her.

53
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,100
Well, an outsider or an insider, both are okay.

54
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,830
But I have to make it clear first.

55
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,830
Messing around is fine. Do not steal money.

56
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,630
The national treasury is really empty.

57
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,700
Shut up.

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,300
All right, okay, okay.

59
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Turn around, come on. All turn around.

60
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,500
An outsider or insider, it doesn't matter.

61
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,830
You are one of us when you get married.

62
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,830
Missy knows best.

63
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,630
You are worthy of being a friend, Missy.

64
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,430
Lord Luo,

65
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,030
I know you have a good relationship with Prince Tang in private,

66
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,030
but it concerns important issues of our state.

67
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,160
It must be taken serious.

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
It must be taken serious.

69
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,500
I know,

70
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,300
Miss Xia Bing has done evil things

71
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,630
to us before.

72
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,830
But it was because

73
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,430
we didn't stand on same side.

74
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,830
But now...

75
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,430
Now...

76
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,760
As the saying goes,

77
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,700
one false step brings ever-lasting grief.

78
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,630
Then a girl who takes a false step...

79
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,560
Wrong, a girl who made a mistake.

80
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,760
Why can't she be forgiven by you?

81
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,900
If we don't forgive her,

82
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,230
what to do if she continues making mistakes?

83
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,230
You notice that Dragon Egg is not talking.

84
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,100
You guys are talking so much here.

85
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,830
A girl from far away come here to marry.

86
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,300
What harm can she do to the Zodiac State?

87
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,560
Feifei is right.

88
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,830
Missy, you are so great.

89
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,360
Before,

90
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,360
you isolated me just because

91
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,230
I belong to Ophiuchus.

92
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,630
Try to kill me.

93
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,160
But I am still standing here

94
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,760
to discuss major issues with you.

95
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,230
So just give her a chance.

96
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,760
Misunderstandings will be solved in the end.

97
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,560
That's it.

98
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,360
I invite Miss Xia Bing

99
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,230
to prepare my wedding together.

100
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,830
Do you agree?

101
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,560
Hold your disagreements.

102
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,900
Applaud if you agree.

103
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,630
Applaud.

104
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,760
Your Majesty,

105
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,430
this is the ultimate madness medicine

106
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,760
that Orion State developed using Black Pearl.

107
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,300
I hand it over to show our sincerity.

108
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,760
I hope you can live with each other peacefully

109
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,430
and give times of peace and prosperity to the masses.

110
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,360
Exactly, Your Majesty.

111
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Come on.

112
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,300
Beautiful, right?

113
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,760
Why do you bring me here?

114
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,300
What do you wanna know?

115
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
What does that mean?

116
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,360
I bring you here

117
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,760
to make you relax.

118
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,830
I know you don't want to be with them.

119
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,830
See?

120
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,760
Is it amazing?

121
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,700
What?

122
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,830
This clothing is

123
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,630
beautiful, right?

124
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,100
Weird.

125
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
Just like you.

126
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,230
I harmed you and Ophiuchus's people.

127
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,900
I am the enemy of the Zodiac State.

128
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,030
To my surprise, you helped me to persuade others.

129
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,230
In this world,

130
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,100
it's normal that so many things are weird.

131
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,430
I came here in a weird way,

132
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,360
with no ideas.

133
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,230
And I became the Constellation Lord of Ophiuchus,

134
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,500
and fell in love with

135
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,430
that nerd.

136
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,430
Though there are many strange things,

137
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,700
enemy can't be the enemy forever.

138
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,960
Right?

139
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Not the enemy forever.

140
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
I tell you what,

141
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,230
Beitang Tang really likes you with his whole heart.

142
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Just think about it.

143
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,960
Don't always think about the past.

144
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,560
Lots of people are together.

145
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,030
One more person just adds a pair of chopsticks.

146
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,560
Two more persons, we...

147
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,500
add four pairs of chopsticks.

148
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,160
Only need to add two pairs of chopsticks.

149
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
You are good at counting.

150
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,360
Anyway,

151
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,830
Your wedding clothing, consider it done.

152
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,900
I definitely will

153
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,960
make friends with you.

154
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,960
Stay here. Don't go out.

155
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,960
Xia Bing.

156
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,300
Bingbing.

157
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,960
Who is being weird for a day?

158
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,960
Stop.

159
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,030
Who are you? How dare you assassinate?

160
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,830
Grandma-Empress?

161
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,030
Xia Bing, you get the balls to prevent my plan from carrying out.

162
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,900
How dare you.

163
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,030
Imperial Archbishop.

164
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,160
I dare not.

165
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,960
I don't mean to stop your plan.

166
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,160
If Luo Feifei

167
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,030
is killed by others,

168
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,300
it will obstruct your big plan.

169
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,900
That's why I took moves rashly.

170
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,230
Please forgive me, Imperial Archbishop.

171
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,430
Xia Bing,

172
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,360
you grew up beside me.

173
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,030
Your temper is really like mine.

174
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,900
The future destiny of the Orion State

175
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,030
is on your hand.

176
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,030
I must follow your orders.

177
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Then I will act according to your plan.

178
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,900
Just...

179
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,560
Hope Imperial Archbishop could spare Prince Tang's life.

180
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,160
As long as he behaves as he told,

181
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,160
his life

182
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,760
is yours.

183
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,030
Thank you, Imperial Archbishop.

184
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,900
Feifei,

185
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,830
you were assassinated again.

186
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,760
Are you okay?

187
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,830
I am good. It happens a lot.

188
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,830
You know it.

189
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,560
Don't worry.

190
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,030
There is a saying goes

191
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,830
the good live a thousand years,

192
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,900
the bad live not too long.

193
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,100
I feel I probably have done

194
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,160
few good things in recent days.

195
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,900
I should pay attention to it.

196
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,960
Can't do that few.

197
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,300
It looks like the Orion State doesn't give up.

198
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,500
Dragon Egg,

199
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,360
do you figure it out?

200
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,760
They already use a peace-making marriage

201
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,960
to resolve conflicts between.

202
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,360
I don't think there will be more conflicts.

203
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,430
Perhaps they does one thing under the cover of another.

204
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,960
But Bingbing saved me.

205
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,960
If not her, I already became a hedgehog with a arrow on me.

206
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,760
And you know it, Dragon Egg.

207
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,030
I truly don't want the tragedy of Ophiuchus happen again.

208
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,030
Is Bingbing okay?

209
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,160
Just relax, she is fine.

210
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,960
She probably come back home with Beitang Tang.

211
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
I think Bingbing likes Big white tooth.

212
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
You think?

213
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,760
My excellent Intelligence Quotient.

214
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,960
Being fond of a person,

215
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,560
the expression in one's eyes is different.

216
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,230
You do pay a lot of attention to her.

217
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,030
Of course.

218
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,760
Their marriage is also a major event.

219
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,160
Oh, I got another thing to tell you.

220
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
You..

221
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,830
No.

222
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,030
It's us.

223
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,030
Our wedding customs of the Zodiac State

224
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,360
is really out of date.

225
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,960
I don't want it arrange like that at all.

226
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,030
How about you handing all over to me?

227
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,700
You arrange?

228
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,100
What did you say?

229
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,160
I didn't say anything.

230
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,300
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

231
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,960
No, I am not.

232
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,830
I feel you have something on your mind

233
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,700
after you get out of the Palace.

234
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,430
Did they scare you?

235
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,300
They are good people.

236
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,360
Just have a weird temper.

237
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,230
Come on.

238
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,430
It's nothing.

239
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,030
I don't mind.

240
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,630
That's right.

241
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,700
Missy stood up for you.

242
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,030
I believe they will accept you soon.

243
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,300
So it's not because of them.

244
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,230
Yea.

245
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,160
Did Missy ask you something?

246
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,630
Nope, Feifei is nice.

247
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,430
I think so.

248
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,230
Her words are always surprising,

249
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,760
but some of those are true

250
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,830
and break common customs.

251
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,560
Maybe it's the reason why

252
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,830
my brother and Uncle Chen

253
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,030
were so into her before.

254
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,360
You?

255
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,160
I only like you.

256
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,030
Sweet words again.

257
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,700
But

258
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,630
Feifei told me earlier today.

259
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,560
She said there are no permanent enemies.

260
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,100
Even though two persons are on the different stands,

261
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,430
they may be together in the end.

262
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,830
Yea.

263
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,630
The Ophiuchus

264
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,900
was deadly enemy to the Zodiac State,

265
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,830
and was the enemy who killed my father.

266
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,430
But they eventually are together.

267
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,430
Sometimes, I kind of envy her.

268
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,300
Ignoring the masses' thoughts,

269
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,500
no matter how others slander,

270
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,760
she doesn't care at all.

271
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,700
Beitang Tang,

272
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,760
let's leave here, okay?

273
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,760
What's wrong? Bingbing.

274
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Is it not good here?

275
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,560
No.

276
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,830
What are you worried about?

277
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,230
You don't understand.

278
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,100
Bingbing, I don't know what you are thinking,

279
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,630
but

280
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,500
trust me.

281
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,700
Whatever happens to you,

282
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
I will protect you.

283
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,430
I am afraid I can't protect your safety.

284
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,030
I am afraid you will hate me then.

285
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,230
Yours.

286
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,100
It's a spring and autumn haute courture.

287
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,230
Beautiful, right?

288
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
For me?

289
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,430
For me?

290
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,830
I was wondering whether it suits me.

291
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,300
Doesn't suit?

292
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,160
How could be?

293
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,100
I am gonna prepare

294
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,960
the most perfect wedding for the four of us.

295
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,700
Feifei,

296
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,830
could you tell me

297
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,360
our wedding procedure?

298
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,830
It's my first time to get married

299
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,030
and I don't have much experience.

300
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,300
Sister,

301
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,230
do I look like I get married for the second time?

302
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,230
Nope.

303
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,160
Nope, right?

304
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,560
We all get married for the first time.

305
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,230
Tell you what,

306
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,030
on wedding day,

307
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,560
in the early morning,

308
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,030
Dragon Egg and Big white tooth will ride on their imperial horses

309
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,160
to gallop.

310
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,700
Start from their imperial room

311
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,230
to our boudoir.

312
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,230
At this very moment,

313
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,230
Shengnan and Yanran

314
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,160
will stuck in the doorway.

315
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,630
For what?

316
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,030
No red packets, no way to enter.

317
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
After that,

318
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,430
they will come inside to look for our shoes.

319
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,830
Will it be too complicated?

320
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,700
Complicated.

321
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,230
It's quite simple.

322
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,160
Men

323
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,700
won't cherish if they can get you easily.

324
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
It's true.

325
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:24,630
Then the four of us will be under people's attention,

326
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,300
with lots of cheers and applauses,

327
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,960
then we will step into wedding hall together.

328
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,300
After that, we will buy everyone in the city a drink. The whole world joins in the jubilation.

329
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,700
boom-bang-boom-bang.

330
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,230
Applauses are everywhere.

331
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,430
People are touched.

332
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,760
So blessed.

333
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,960
People are touched.

334
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,900
So blessed.

335
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,500
What do you think?

336
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,830
Xia Bing.

337
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,430
Huh?

338
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,230
What's going on?

339
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,230
Nothing.

340
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,100
Finish?

341
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,700
Yea.

342
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,630
Why are you absent-minded the whole day?

343
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,700
This is so important.

344
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,700
Nothing, I am good.

345
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,700
I know.

346
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,500
Does Big white tooth...

347
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,360
He must bully you, doesn't he?

348
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,100
-I will beat him for you the other day. -He doesn't.

349
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,830
This kid is...

350
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,430
No, Prince Tang is good to me.

351
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,160
Chongchong, wait for me, Chongchong.

352
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,300
Hurry up.

353
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,760
Here you come, Chongchong.

354
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,030
Lord, what you don't know

355
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,560
is that Master Mei is so stingy.

356
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,030
This one can't give, that one can't give.

357
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,960
Even these bamboo barrels of gunpowders

358
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,960
are solved by us.

359
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Master Mei,

360
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,360
you don't even spend this little money!

361
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,230
you don't even spend this little money.

362
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,030
I turn you in.

363
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Do you believe I search your house and confiscate your property?

364
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,160
Make you become a poor wretch.

365
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,230
It's not me being stingy.

366
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,830
The national treasury is empty.

367
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,560
It really has no money.

368
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,960
No money, right?

369
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,630
I suppose your money is in your belly.

370
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,960
Do you have other instructions, Lord?

371
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Not a big deal. We could raise money by ourselves.

372
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,160
And we will never let you wronged, Lord.

373
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,160
You are so great, Chongchong.

374
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,360
Well, however,

375
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,760
I just want everything be simple.

376
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,230
Anyway, food and clothing in the Palace cost money.

377
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,300
Only the housekeeper knows how high the cost of living can be.

378
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,230
You see,

379
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,960
Your Majesty could have an empress like you,

380
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,430
which is really a fortune to state.

381
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,160
Shut your mouth.

382
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,300
What are you doing here?

383
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,700
According to the national law,

384
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,230
Both of you will be drawn when you get married.

385
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,500
Be drawn.

386
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,630
Meaning wedding pictures.

387
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,300
What pictures?

388
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,700
Nothing.

389
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,960
With your brain and your Intelligence Quotient,

390
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,230
can you understand?

391
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,630
Just know to ask questions.

392
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,160
You guys could stay here. I will go find him.

393
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,630
Okay, you go ahead.

394
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,430
Chongchong and I put gunpowders away for you.

395
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,030
Your pose is kind of weird.

396
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Not at all.

397
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,560
The weird part is you unexpectedly find Su Xunxian to draw it.

398
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,160
What's weird is that you choose Su Xunxian to draw this picture.

399
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,830
So I thought,

400
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,300
you may think drawings of Master

401
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,560
follow too many rules.

402
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,300
Then I specially found Su Xunxian for you.

403
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,960
If you say Su Xunxian is good at drinking and making money,

404
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,630
I totally trust you.

405
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,030
But you say he can draw.

406
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,830
I truely don't believe it.

407
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,760
As the saying goes, methods may vary while the principle remains the same.

408
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,760
I can comprehend by analogy.

409
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,560
Don't question my painting skills.

410
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,160
My mother taught me that personally.

411
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,030
Do you know who my mother is?

412
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,630
Who is his mother?

413
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,300
His mother is the top timber dealer in Zodiac State.

414
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,230
A timber dealer?

415
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,230
And you are drawing us there.

416
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,630
What's wrong with the timber dealer?

417
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,830
Arts are interconnected.

418
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,960
Like making a profit, it is a kind of art

419
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,430
isn't it, Master Mei?

420
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,030
I can't agree more.

421
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,760
What a big profit you are making.

422
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,830
Just this picture

423
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,030
can help you earn thousands of constellation coins.

424
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,030
Okay.

425
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,630
Alright.

426
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,430
You are all artists, aren't you?

427
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,230
Then let me check how

428
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,030
you work.

429
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,830
I just draw it roughly.

430
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,500
Still need more details.

431
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,560
Then it is finished.
