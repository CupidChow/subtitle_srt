00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,630
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

2
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,630
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 12

4
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,760
See,

5
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,230
the poison has been gradually receding.

6
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,160
Sister,

7
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,430
what medicine did you have him take?

8
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,700
I didn't give him any medicine.

9
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,760
It was said medicine didn't work at all.

10
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,360
What's happening?

11
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,700
It's Feifei's...

12
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,500
It's Feifei's blood.

13
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,160
Is it?

14
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,360
Because human blood is resistant to virus.

15
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,830
Why the effect of poison is showing again?

16
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,630
Chongchong, Chongchong,

17
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,430
the king is in a severe condition,

18
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,300
small amount of blood like this can't cure him,

19
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,830
so the poison is coming into effect again,

20
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,830
and the king suffers.

21
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Chongchong,

22
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,030
when I was infected by viruses,

23
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,900
it was you who helped me overcome them,

24
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,300
now tell me,

25
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,700
what are we supposed to do.

26
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,430
I don't really have any clue,

27
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,360
unless we exchange your blood with him,

28
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,230
but it's a long-lost trick.

29
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,700
I don't know how to do it.

30
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,030
Big white teeth,

31
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,360
send someone to summon master Bai,

32
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,500
tell him,

33
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,830
tell him I have a way to save Dragon Egg,

34
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,830
now.

35
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,630
Aye.

36
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,430
Go now.

37
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,030
Feifei,

38
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,500
is your wound ok?

39
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,560
It's fine.

40
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,900
Why don't we take care of your wound first.

41
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,100
Just leave it.

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,630
What if you're infected?

43
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,560
I said leave it.

44
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,360
Prince Chen and Prince Tang,

45
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,760
Master Bai,

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,230
your power is transferring energy, right?

47
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,430
Right.

48
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,830
What's wrong?

49
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,430
Let's go.

50
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
Feifei,

51
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,630
first you need to tell me what's your plan.

52
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,830
She wants exchange her blood

53
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,230
with that rude guy,

54
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,160
right?

55
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,230
No.

56
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,230
The trick has been long-lost,

57
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,300
still needs to be considered,

58
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,230
it's too risky.

59
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,760
Missy, you can't take the risk.

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,630
So...

61
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,030
So...

62
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,430
Master Bai, I trust you, you can do this,

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,100
right?

64
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Let's go.

65
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,430
Feifei, let me do this,

66
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,500
I'm his uncle

67
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,360
and his subject,

68
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,560
it should be me to take the risk.

69
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
I can do this too.

70
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,760
Let me do it.

71
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,700
I have a special body constitution,

72
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,760
the poison can't get me in short time,

73
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,630
even if I'm affected,

74
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,230
my clanmen will come and save me,

75
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,760
please give us the room.

76
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,030
Master Bai will stay with me.

77
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,560
Feifei, have you thought it through?

78
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,160
Sister.

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,960
Grandpa is gone.

80
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,830
I have no one to rely on

81
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,900
if something happens to you.

82
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Listen to me,

83
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,230
you will never be alone,

84
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,960
I will be fine.

85
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,360
What are you waiting for,

86
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,830
do you want to save Bei Tangtang or not?

87
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,560
Out.

88
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,960
Out.

89
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,360
Your Highness.

90
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,960
Master Su has bought all the medicine in Zodiac State

91
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,100
and employed hundreds of doctors to make the antidotes.

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,430
Master Shang and Master Xi

93
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,500
have carried the cure to the infected zone.

94
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,230
Master Fang has also led the army

95
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,700
to keep everything in order.

96
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,430
You stay here and wait.

97
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,960
I will go to the infected zone.

98
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,030
Uncle, be careful.

99
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,960
Your Highness, we wait for your good news.

100
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,960
Lead the way.

101
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,100
Feifei, are you able to hold on.

102
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,430
Yes.

103
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,300
Let's continue.

104
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,830
Sister.

105
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,830
Master Bai, how is my brother?

106
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
The poison in our king's body is neutralized,

107
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,960
he needs to be taken good care of.

108
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,700
Great.

109
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,900
What about Miss Big eater?

110
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,160
Feifei, what about Feifei?

111
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,830
Be assured,

112
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,430
she's just too exhausted,

113
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,560
although she has carried all the poison,

114
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,160
she's just fine,

115
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,500
just need rest.

116
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,030
You must be tried, master Bai,

117
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,430
go get some rest.

118
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,830
Great, great.

119
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,630
I'm relieved now.

120
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,500
Lady, lady Xie, Missy,

121
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,630
are you ok?

122
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,830
I'm fine, just need some rest,

123
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,160
everything here will rely on you and Prince Chen.

124
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,560
Take your lady home for some rest.

125
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,430
Right.

126
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,560
Be careful.

127
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,630
Oh,

128
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,830
please tell Prince Chen,

129
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,100
the king and Feifei are fine now,

130
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,560
he pretends to be clam,

131
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,430
but he's extremely anxious.

132
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,560
Be assured, I got this,

133
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,360
get back for some rest.

134
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Uncle,

135
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,500
what about the emperor and Feifei?

136
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,900
Let's talk about it outside.

137
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,030
My brother and the Missy are both fine.

138
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,830
Good.

139
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,430
By the way, uncle,

140
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,760
what about the infected zone?

141
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,230
The people of Serpent star will arrive here in two hours.

142
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,360
Shang Yu and Xifeng Lie

143
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,030
have distributed the cure,

144
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,560
everything is going to be fine.

145
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,100
By the way,

146
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,760
Xie Yanran

147
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,430
might not in good condition.

148
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,560
What about her, is she suffering from poison again?

149
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,160
No,

150
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,360
she wasn't completely cured

151
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,700
and stayed here for another day,

152
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,430
until my brother and the Missy are healed,

153
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,630
and then she left.

154
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,300
Uncle, I think she looks at you in a...

155
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,160
Prince Tang, the people of the Serpent star have arrived.

156
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
I've arranged them

157
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,830
to cure the disease of madness.

158
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,960
Finally you're here.

159
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,560
They come to cure the Lord Luo.

160
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,160
Finally you're here,

161
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,360
please check on my brother,

162
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,630
and the Missy.

163
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,100
Feifei,

164
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Feifei

165
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,300
Feifei, wake up, Feifei.

166
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,960
Doctor,

167
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,160
doctor, go get the doctor.

168
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,230
Your Majesty.

169
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,300
Why is she still not awake?

170
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,360
Let me find it out.

171
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,100
What about it?

172
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,430
Your Majesty,

173
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,230
she's too exhausted,

174
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,760
and in a coma

175
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,360
due to the remains of poison in her body.

176
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,830
Maybe...

177
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,830
Say it.

178
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,960
According to her pulse,

179
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,630
she's just tired,

180
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
not a big deal.

181
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,430
Then why is she not awake?

182
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,230
Do forgive me, Your Highness.

183
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,430
Your Majesty.

184
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,760
Your Majesty, star lords are waiting outside to see you

185
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,560
for a long time.

186
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,360
Take care of Lord Luo.

187
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,100
Yes.

188
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,900
Brother,

189
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,360
you're fine now.

190
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,960
Your Majesty, in the areas where plagues broke out,

191
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,700
disease has been prevented from spreading,

192
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,430
the cure

193
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,560
has been distributed to the public by Su Xunxian,

194
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,760
the drugged people

195
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,700
all came to awake,

196
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,230
the disease of madness has also been in control.

197
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,630
Master Fang are investing with soldiers

198
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,160
about the source of the disease.

199
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,430
Brother, you and the citizens

200
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,830
both are caught by the disease,

201
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,100
we were so worried.

202
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,160
Such a coincidence,

203
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,830
there might not be a natural cause,

204
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,300
it has been created on purpose,

205
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,760
so abominable.

206
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,960
When I was trying to stop the disease,

207
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,830
I heard a rumor in the public,

208
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,360
that could be unfavourable to Lord Luo,

209
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,430
and some gangsters utilizes the turmoil to rise in revolt.

210
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,100
Although the public are not in risk now,

211
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,160
they have no place to settle in.

212
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,430
The plague has been severe,

213
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,030
I beg you

214
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,230
to summon all the star lords

215
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,700
to have an emergent meeting.

216
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,030
I will stay to take care of Feifei.

217
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,160
Be assured.

218
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,100
Prince, Master Su, time to go.

219
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,230
Affection has always been spoiled,

220
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,300
why don't we just drink wine and make some money.

221
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,030
Feifei, I'm Yanran,

222
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,030
wake up.

223
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,700
Feifei,

224
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,760
you out now.

225
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,960
I'd like to stay with Lord Luo, just the two of us.

226
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,230
Lord Xie, the emperor said...

227
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,300
You're welcome.

228
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,630
Out.

229
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,830
No, Lord Xie.

230
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,230
Will you listen to me.

231
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,830
I read from a book

232
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,300
about over an hundred ways of torturing servants.

233
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,630
Eunuch Hai, pick one.

234
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,760
Go.

235
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,630
They've already left.

236
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,830
You don't know how uncomfortable

237
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,030
it is for me to sleep on this bed,

238
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,360
I dare not to move.

239
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,760
When I need to eat, I get fed with only little,

240
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,830
so unbearable.

241
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,030
Taking care of me?

242
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,030
It's literally torturing me.

243
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,230
Do you know

244
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,360
the emperor is so worried about you,

245
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,760
he can't pull himself together.

246
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,030
I know.

247
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,030
Yanran,

248
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,360
listen, I had a dream,

249
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,960
a long dream, and important.

250
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,300
You can predict things like the prince?

251
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,160
No,

252
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,830
I went to buy facial masks in my dream.

253
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,430
Why are you still thinking about facial masks when you are ill.

254
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,160
Girls, you know,

255
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
I, I'm running out of it, so I'm in a hurry to buy them,

256
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,630
every one tends to pursue beauty.

257
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,960
Get back,

258
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
just pretend that you know nothing.

259
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,760
I will sleep now.

260
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,160
What are you doing,

261
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,830
everyone is getting mad, you still want to sleep.

262
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,630
No.

263
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,500
It is rare

264
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,430
that dragon egg could say some romantic things to me.

265
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,230
But everyone is worrying about you.

266
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,430
I know when to cease it.

267
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,430
Let me tell you,

268
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,430
you trick dragon egg to come here,

269
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,500
no matter what,

270
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,560
take him here,

271
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,160
let him speak more,

272
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,430
but not the words from poems,

273
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,700
let him say,

274
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,230
something straightforward.

275
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,630
I like you.

276
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,830
I love you.

277
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,230
Simple word like those.

278
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,960
What romantic words?

279
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,760
Just...

280
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,160
just imagine,

281
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
he grasps my hands and says,

282
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,430
Feifei...

283
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,160
with deep affection

284
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,630
my eyes opened with tears in them,

285
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,430
I look at him,

286
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,700
and said,

287
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,500
egg,

288
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,030
dragon egg,

289
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,830
what have been thinking all day,

290
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,830
you are not sympathetic for me and judge me.

291
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,630
You've done so much for the prince,

292
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,360
is you two?

293
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,160
I thought it through.

294
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,960
Nothing at all.

295
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,430
all these years,

296
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,960
it's just my own intention,

297
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,360
Prince Chen has always treated me as his sister,

298
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,760
I'm really exhausted.

299
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,230
So I'm planning

300
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,560
to leave for somewhere far away in about two days,

301
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,830
to see the bigger world outside,

302
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,630
and nobody will know who I am,

303
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,360
I don't have to behave like a lady,

304
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,830
and then

305
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,500
I can find the true self,

306
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,360
be a true Xie Yanran.

307
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Feifei,

308
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,560
isn't it a great decision

309
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
to see the outside world,

310
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,960
to walk around,

311
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,360
and learn more new things,

312
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,560
and make more friends,

313
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,230
be assured,

314
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,760
I can help you with everything before I leave.

315
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,160
Who are you to me?

316
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,230
You're my best sister.

317
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,230
I, Xieyanran,

318
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,500
I have a hundred ways of

319
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,430
letting man say romantic words,

320
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,230
I've found a solution.

321
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,230
Here, let me tell you.

322
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,230
Be happy.

323
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,560
I will miss you.

324
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,430
I will be back.

325
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,430
In the 34th year of Xingyao Dynasty,

326
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,900
the severest plague of madness broke out,

327
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,830
in the Zodiac State,

328
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,630
when the emperor BeiTang Yi was affected,

329
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,030
there was a considerable improvement in his martial.

330
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,760
The lord of Serpent star Luo Feifei

331
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,030
risked her life to save the emperor,

332
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,960
in this emergency, Chongchong

333
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,360
figured out a cure.

334
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,430
With therapy of Serpent star's

335
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,700
effects are satisfying when men and women were both joined.

336
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,100
In conclusion, with efforts from multiple sides,

337
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,760
the truth were finally revealed.

338
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,230
Orion state wanted to murder me.

339
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,360
the people of the Serpent star finally proved to be innocent.

340
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,160
The thirteen stars of Zodiac State have all been back in their place.

341
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,360
The disease of madness

342
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,760
were cured thanks to Lord Luo.

343
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,030
As she deterred the dangerous trend.

344
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,160
Otherwise,

345
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,160
the disease of madness will continue to spread,

346
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,300
the consequences would be beyond imagination.

347
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,360
Yes.

348
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,230
Moreover,

349
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,160
the emperor's disease was cured

350
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,030
because the Lord Luo,

351
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,630
exchanged her blood.

352
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,760
Lord Luo is our savior.

353
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Right.

354
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,630
Although she's always childish

355
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,230
with illogical words and gets into trouble often,

356
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,630
looks ordinary,

357
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,960
but thanks to her this time,

358
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,560
our state was saved.

359
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,430
Yes.

360
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,500
I was cured by her as well.

361
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,430
How can I respond so quickly?

362
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,360
Xi Fenglie, is your sequela cured?

363
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,830
I don't need to worry any more.

364
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,960
Thanks to Missy this time.

365
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,230
Everyone sees it.

366
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,760
Oh, brother,

367
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,030
is she still not awake?

368
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,030
She's just too exhausted.

369
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,030
Master Mei,

370
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,560
are there any ginseng or glossy ganoderma in the national treasury?

371
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,630
Take them out.

372
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,030
Your Majesty,

373
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,100
there is no money in the national treasury now.

374
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,430
But Lord Luo saved the emperor,

375
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,030
we need to save her even at cost of everything,

376
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,760
save her.

377
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,830
Since you said it,

378
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,960
you provide the ginseng and ganodermers.

379
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,230
Money comes and goes,

380
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,960
and can always be earned.

381
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,760
Master Mei,

382
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,500
I've heard that you rank the third wealthiest man in the state,

383
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,630
can't you afford even a glossy ganoderma?

384
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,360
You don't have to do this, easier said than done.

385
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,560
Things are not well,

386
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,960
Feifei, she...
