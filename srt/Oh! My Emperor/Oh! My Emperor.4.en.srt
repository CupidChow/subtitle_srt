1
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,630
Oh! My Emperor

Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd.

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 4

4
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,830
Your Majesty, Prince Chen has come to visit again.

5
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,900
He's outside the door.

6
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:18,960
Let him in.

7
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,030
Aye.

8
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,830
Uncle.

9
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,630
What's the matter?

10
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,430
I heard that Your Majesty

11
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,630
had imprisoned my dancer.

12
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,900
She intended to infiltrate into my place

13
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,300
and tried to assassinate me.

14
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,830
Do you think I shouldn't have imprisoned her??

15
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,760
Your Highness, there must have been a mistake.

16
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,100
Her character has always been a quite naughty one.

17
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,500
I will take her back and get her disciplined.

18
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,700
Naughty character and the intention of treason

19
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,630
are two different concepts.

20
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,030
The whole world is yours,

21
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,560
monstrous deeds like treason,

22
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,830
no one would dare to do it.

23
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,030
I want the military leadership.

24
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,230
It's been a tradition in Zodiac State for a thousand years

25
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,360
that the Emperor can both rule the imperial court and lead the army once he reaches thirty.

26
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,760
And I got entrusted from our deceased Emperor

27
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,030
to lead the army temporarily.

28
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,360
Your Majesty still has to worry about it?

29
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,360
What if I want it now?

30
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,230
Of course you can have it.

31
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,900
Only when you accomplish two tasks

32
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,760
will I give back the leadership.

33
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,630
Ok.

34
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,630
This is task one.

35
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,360
In three days,

36
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,630
collect signatures of ten thousand people to support you.

37
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,360
Uncle,

38
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,030
three days to accomplish that

39
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,030
would be most difficult.

40
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,630
An Emperor is the God's son,

41
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,430
he should be able to accomplish the impossible.

42
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,900
Ok.

43
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,100
Only after getting the signatures

44
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,960
can you launch the competion with the four masters of constellation.

45
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,160
then the winner can get the leadership.

46
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,160
I just hope

47
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,360
before tomorrow night,

48
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,500
my dancer can get back to me.

49
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,500
Brother,

50
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,560
are you really letting her go.

51
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,760
What else can I do?

52
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,160
When you imprisoned her,

53
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,230
you looked so irritated,

54
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,560
but now you just let her go.

55
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,560
Is this a bit...

56
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Brother,

57
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,430
I will get her out.

58
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,960
There's some problem with the shoulder.

59
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,700
Tell you what,

60
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,830
you must take good care of your skin.

61
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,630
If it goes wrong,

62
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,500
your pores will be clogged.

63
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,830
Keep using body lotion.

64
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,100
I'll prescribe you some medicine.

65
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,160
Everybody, listen to me.

66
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,630
Tonight, Prince Tang is going to get Miss Luo out.

67
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,630
Let's turn a blind eye to it,

68
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,160
remember?

69
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,030
Ok.

70
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,630
Ok, keep on.

71
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,500
Let's go to drink.

72
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,360
I really want to get home.

73
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,830
Now, I think

74
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,430
night drift is pretty good.

75
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,830
I can order a spicy hot pot with vermicelli.

76
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,560
Some fried drumsticks will also be fine.

77
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,830
Come with me.

78
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,230
Who are you?

79
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,760
Wait a minute

80
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,760
I don't have money,

81
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,830
And I will not marry you to express my gratitude.

82
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,700
It's me.

83
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,830
Big White Teeth.

84
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,360
Let's go,

85
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,430
go,

86
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,560
go.

87
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,360
Sorry.

88
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,960
Polaris looks dim tonight,

89
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,630
and the Emperor's wish to get back the army leadership

90
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,630
could be extremely hard.

91
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,760
I will bet

92
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,500
the Emperor can get the leadership back for sure.

93
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,030
And although

94
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,030
Prince Chen constrains the Emperor in all respects,

95
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,560
in my eyes, the Emperor is just bidding his time.

96
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,900
So, you want to bet this time.

97
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,700
As the most generous money giver in Zodiac State,

98
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,700
you lose every time.

99
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,500
Money giver, who named me that?

100
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,830
Of course I did.

101
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,630
You...

102
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,630
Ok, I will bet with you.

103
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,230
I bet the Emperor can't collect all the signatures in three days.

104
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,100
Take it easy.

105
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,760
I remember

106
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,430
you owed me four bucks last month,

107
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,300
and eight bucks the month before last,

108
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,900
and nine bucks the month before that,

109
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,560
so twenty one bucks in total.

110
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,960
Pay off, Zhang Tianzheng.

111
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,830
You are crueler than these people in the casino.

112
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,830
The treasury is almost empty.

113
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,960
Save as much as we can and make as much as we can.

114
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,630
Think about it yourself.

115
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,830
What are you doing, Zhang Tianzheng?

116
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,560
Are you going to kill me to get rid of your debt?

117
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,960
Listen, Mei Daren,

118
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,830
even if I have to use the my constellation power,

119
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,960
I will not let the Emperor finish collecting all the signatures.

120
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,160
Hilarious！Tell you what.

121
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,030
Who doesn't know it? Our power...

122
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,360
Our power has a time limit.

123
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,960
If you use the power to control too many things,

124
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,900
you will be exhausted.

125
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,030
If you don't believe it, just try,

126
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,160
I will.

127
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,430
I'm not afraid.

128
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,760
Zhang Tianzheng,

129
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,830
come back！

130
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,700
Come back！

131
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,560
Let me go,

132
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,560
let me go.

133
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,160
Lift it, Zhang Tianzheng.

134
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,430
You son of a bitch.

135
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Lift it.

136
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Big White Teeth,

137
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,960
since you saved me today,

138
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,960
you are my friend from now on.

139
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,630
Such a beautiful girl,

140
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
how could my brother be so cruel

141
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,160
to let you suffer in the prison?

142
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,960
But my suggestion prevailed today.

143
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,560
Keep this in mind,

144
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,500
you owe me a favor.

145
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,560
Your brother.

146
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,360
The Emperor...

147
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,960
I knew Jia Cheng couldn't forget me.

148
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,560
Missy, let's go.

149
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,030
I have a more important mission tomorrow.

150
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,830
What mission?

151
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,360
Collect signatures.

152
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,630
What signatures?

153
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,030
As long as we can collect signatures of ten thousand people,

154
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,760
my brother will be capable of doing what he likes.

155
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,300
This is important to him.

156
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,500
Important to Jia Cheng?

157
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,430
Maybe the key to our return?

158
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,900
Jia Cheng said he would kill me,

159
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,700
but then he sent this man to save me,

160
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,030
so there must have been some difficulties for him.

161
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
I must help him.

162
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,760
Missy, let's go.

163
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,030
Wait.

164
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,630
What's wrong?

165
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,500
How about I collect these...

166
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,100
these signatures with you.

167
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,030
You want to help?

168
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,960
What?

169
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,030
Slight my ability?

170
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,830
Three days！

171
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,030
Ten thousand signatures in three days！

172
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,230
This is impossible.

173
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,430
Yeah.

174
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,500
Why don't we write them by ourselves?

175
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,100
Of course not.

176
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
It matters a lot.

177
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,630
Not a game.

178
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,700
Missy,

179
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,960
have you got any plan?

180
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,960
I got it. I got it.

181
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,160
Let's go.

182
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,430
Missy,

183
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,430
want to be brainwashed?

184
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,100
want to know about the book of ten thousand signatures?

185
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,630
Uncle, do you know about the book of ten thousand signatures?

186
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,960
You don't know about that, right?

187
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,230
Look at this.

188
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,160
Do you want to know about the book of ten thousand signatures?

189
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,160
Take this to your parents and let them sign it.

190
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,160
Have you ever felt that

191
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,700
life is substantial sometimes

192
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,430
and empty at other times?

193
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,230
Old one, I have a book of ten thousand signatures here.

194
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,230
If anyone comes here,

195
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,300
you just let him sign on it.

196
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,430
What book?

197
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,830
A book of ten thousand signatures.

198
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:48,960
Not interested.

199
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Give me one more.

200
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,960
Move, move.

201
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,900
As a resident on the street,

202
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,360
shouldn't we pool our efforts together?

203
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,100
As a common saying goes ,

204
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,630
a single spark can start a prairie fire.

205
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,830
As long as we all donate a gift of love,

206
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,100
we can create a bright future.

207
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,300
It doesn't work this way.

208
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,700
Tell me,

209
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,430
why did those girls chase you that day?

210
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,230
They wanted to marry me.

211
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,100
What are you doing?

212
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,360
I will give you a nice present tomorrow.

213
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,560
Come and sign,

214
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,430
wait in line.Show some order!

215
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,360
Come and see, everybody.

216
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,030
Come here. Come here.

217
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,430
Tell you what,

218
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,300
there is a handsome guy,

219
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,960
you shouldn't miss your chance when walking by.

220
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,630
It's a free hug.

221
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,360
Sign on this,

222
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,430
then you can hug him.

223
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,700
Come on, Big White Teeth！

224
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,560
Five thousand to go.

225
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,960
Come on, White Teeth!

226
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,900
I will cheer you on like crazy.

227
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,430
Come on!

228
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,960
Is Prince Tang a fool?

229
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,900
You don't understand it, dumb soldier.

230
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,030
They two are not comparable to our prince.

231
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,760
As an honorable prince.

232
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,630
Move fast. Wait in line!

233
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,430
You go so far as to use my pretty face this way.

234
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,700
Girls, what are you waiting for?

235
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,560
Quick.

236
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,030
So,

237
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,100
you stay here,

238
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,630
and I will report to the prince.

239
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,630
Think up a strategy first.

240
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,430
Strategy...

241
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,960
You have a Strategy?

242
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,560
Not yet. Let me think about it.

243
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,030
Why did you lose your composure?

244
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,230
I... I didn't.

245
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,960
Do you think I did?

246
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,830
No, no.

247
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,160
With this being the case, how can you keep your composure?

248
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,360
I...I need to go first.

249
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
You go to the Prince's mansion.

250
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,560
Let me confront them.

251
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,500
Don't go, come back.

252
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,030
You attacked the prince.

253
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,100
Where are you going?

254
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,760
Do you want to go to prison?

255
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,830
You all have hugged him,

256
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,160
but you haven't signed yet.

257
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,900
Yeah.

258
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,760
This is not right.

259
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,030
Not honest.

260
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,900
Almost.

261
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,430
Come here.

262
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,360
Why you followed me everywhere?

263
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,900
Do you have a problem with me?

264
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,230
She is having a problem with my brother and me

265
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,430
rather than with you.

266
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,630
Why would you say this?

267
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,160
I just saw you were attacked by these people,

268
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,560
so I came to help you.

269
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,430
it's very nice of you, General Chu.

270
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,100
Let's go, Missy.

271
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,100
Wait.

272
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Recently, some thieves and gamblers infiltrated into town.

273
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,230
I suspect that there were some in the group here

274
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,830
meant to do no good to our state.

275
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,160
It's all based on your own assumptions.

276
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,100
Show us some evidence.

277
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,360
Thanks for your reminding.

278
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,160
I searched and found a letter from a spy,

279
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,830
so I need to get your signatures for cross-check.

280
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,960
You know these signatures are significant for us

281
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,630
yet you asked us to give it up.

282
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,300
Are you trying to messing up with us on purpose?

283
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,560
I have my duty

284
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,160
and I have to do it based on laws,

285
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
please understand me.

286
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,500
I...

287
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,630
I will never let you have it.

288
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,160
I won't keep it.

289
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,830
What trick are you playing?

290
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,160
Be assured, Prince Tang.

291
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,430
I will return it after the cross-checking.

292
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,500
I know the amount of names

293
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,900
and I think if we work hard and force the pace,

294
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,100
I will be able to give it back the day after tomorrow.

295
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,500
You are kidding.

296
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,160
Tomorrow is the last day.

297
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,960
Tomorrow,

298
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,230
I can't give it back tomorrow.

299
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,300
You are being totally unreasonable.

300
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,430
Do you know who he is?

301
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,160
He is a prince.

302
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,430
Do you know who you're messing with?

303
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,960
When he gets angry,

304
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,500
he will even scare himself.

305
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,960
I can get super angry.

306
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,100
Really super angry.

307
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,500
I can even scare myself.

308
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,560
Really intimidating!

309
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,700
Watch out for it.

310
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,630
You.

311
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,430
Don't you think I'm afraid of you.

312
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,630
Don't you think I'm afraid of you.

313
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,900
I will tell my brother when I get back.

314
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,160
This. You...

315
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,230
I will just take it away.

316
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,030
You...

317
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,900
She...

318
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,430
Forget about it.

319
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,830
Who is she?

320
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,230
She's not even afraid of you.

321
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,560
She's the master of Leo

322
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,830
with a rank not lower than mine.

323
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,760
What should we do, Missy?

324
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,160
I would like to ask you this question too!

325
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,960
No work can be done without money.

326
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,630
Prince,

327
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,230
the collection of signatures is about to be finished.

328
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,300
Should we start to...

329
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,830
No.

330
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,230
But, but...

331
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,160
Don't you understand

332
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,300
my words?

333
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,560
I am taking my leave.

334
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,430
Missy,

335
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,560
Missy, it's time to eat.

336
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,430
How can still have the appetite?

337
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,630
The food outside the palace

338
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,760
are much more delicious.

339
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,160
I don't want to eat.

340
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,430
Not in the mood.

341
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,030
I will use my ultimate strategy.

342
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,360
Ultimate strategy?

343
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,630
What is that?

344
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Run, Zodiac State!

345
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,430
We just need to teach the public

346
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,760
the game of tearing name tag.

347
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,630
It can be a big hit.

348
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,760
The one who tears the most numerous name tags is the winner.

349
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,160
In this way,

350
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,030
we can accomplish much

351
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,030
with only a little money.

352
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,500
I'm so smart.

353
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,160
that I must be a fairy from the the heaven to help people.

354
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,300
I'm about to see my Jia Cheng.

355
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,630
Jia Cheng,

356
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,630
Who is it?

357
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,560
Your brother.

358
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,630
My brother?

359
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,630
Give this to me.

360
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,160
Since when my brother has become yours?

361
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,960
Here you go.

362
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Count it right.

363
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,830
Missy,

364
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,830
so you're into my brother.

365
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,830
I got it.

366
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,300
White Teeth, you...

367
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,430
Why are you so tiresomely talkative?

368
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,230
I told you

369
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,900
to count up all these things,

370
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,230
and sort out these inferior ones.

371
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,030
Remember?

372
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,430
I do.

373
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,630
Just do it.

374
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,160
A group of ducks are swimming under the bridge before my door.

375
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,960
Come and count them.

376
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,560
Two, four, six, seven, eight.

377
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,630
There are so many of them.

378
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,030
Prince,

379
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,430
please stop Missy Luo.

380
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,030
if she continues,

381
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,500
we can't count it right no matter how many times we try.

382
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,700
It's rare to see her so happy,

383
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,830
so let her sing.

384
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,560
Come and count.

385
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,300
One, two...

386
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,300
Missy,

387
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,030
why don't you give this bag

388
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,700
to the servant and let him send it?

389
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,760
I don't understand. Silly boy!

390
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,160
These are the last several hundred pieces.

391
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,430
Of course I need to hand them to Jia Cheng in person.

392
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,830
You're so....

393
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,160
Something doesn't feel right.
