Episode 20

4
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,230
Empress is kind and extraordinary.

5
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,830
Empress is kind and extraordinary.

6
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,560
As the mother of the whole world.

7
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,230
As the mother of the whole world.

8
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,300
It's the fortune of us.

9
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,100
It's the fortune of us.

10
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,830
First bow to Constellation Emperor.

11
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,430
Second bow to the late emperors.

12
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Emperor and Empress bow to each other.

13
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,030
It was just my one-sided love all the time.

14
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,630
You never treat us sincerely,

15
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,430
do you?

16
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,160
Tang Tang.

17
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,560
Yes, I do.

18
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,830
No.

19
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,630
If we didn't leave that desert,

20
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,030
the two of us,

21
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,300
could just live happily forever.

22
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,760
Right?

23
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,230
Just go.

24
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,360
I don't want to kill you.

25
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,630
Let me go

26
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,760
Xia Bing,

27
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,760
you really disappointed me.

28
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,560
Don't do this!

29
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,830
No!

30
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,630
Tang Tang.

31
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,830
They won't let you go.

32
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,830
Go now.

33
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,230
Tang Tang, Tang Tang, Tang Tang.

34
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,230
Tang Tang, don't you scare me.

35
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,830
Let's go back to the desert, shall we?

36
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,700
And handcuff us together, okay?

37
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,160
Tang Tang, do you agree?

38
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,560
Handcuff us for the whole lifetime, promise?

39
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,500
Do you think it's all right?

40
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,560
Tang Tang.

41
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,360
You must move on and live your full life.

42
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,760
Let's go, just go.

43
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,030
Just go back to the desert, okay?

44
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,630
Tang Tang, don't scare me.

45
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,300
Tang Tang.

46
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,560
Tang Tang.

47
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,630
I will kill you all.

48
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Come on.

49
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,360
Help yourself.

50
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,230
Everybody, everybody.

51
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Today is Lord Luo's wedding day.

52
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,900
Help yourself please. Enjoy yourself, everyone.

53
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,360
Sure.

54
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,230
Come on, have a toast.

55
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,630
Yea.

56
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,160
Drink it all.

57
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,230
Take more bites.

58
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,700
Come on. Have a drink.

59
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,560
Drink more wine.

60
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,100
Let's drink. Come on.

61
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,360
Have some more.

62
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,360
Feifei,

63
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,830
It's wrong. You are the Empress.

64
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,500
Yanran makes a toast to you.

65
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,560
Happy marriage.

66
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,630
Your Majesty, I propose a toast to you.

67
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,030
Hold on, wait a second.

68
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,030
Mei Daren.

69
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,560
Your Majesty.

70
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,360
This toast

71
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,360
should be proposed to you by me.

72
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,900
His Majesty has something important to do today.

73
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,500
The wine is expensive. Drink it slowly.

74
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,760
Thank you, Ma’am.

75
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,760
I also want to make a toast to you, Ma’am.

76
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,630
Okay, just drink.

77
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,100
It's poisonous.

78
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,800
Yanran.

79
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,630
Feifei, Feifei.

80
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,630
Feifei.

81
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,360
I am okay.

82
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,160
Master Mei, Master Mei, are you okay?

83
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,630
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

84
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,700
Your Majesty, the people of Orion State have already come.

85
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,960
Yanran,

86
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,160
Yanran, I am sorry. I am too late.

87
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,360
Moran,

88
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,300
stop saying you are sorry.

89
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,700
No need to apologize again.

90
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,030
When we meet in the next life,

91
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,360
you can't keep me waiting for too long.

92
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,030
Moran.

93
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,700
Your Majesty.

94
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,760
Uncle Chen.

95
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,030
Tang Tang.

96
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,230
Tang Tang.

97
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,300
What happened to you, Tang Tang?

98
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,900
The moon.

99
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,800
Brother.

100
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,200
Uncle Chen.

101
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,630
Just kill me quickly.

102
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,230
Tang Tang.

103
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,560
Do it now.

104
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,700
Come on, do it.

105
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,900
Besiege this place.

106
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,700
I will come back again.

107
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,900
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

108
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Dragon Egg.

109
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,360
Dragon Egg.

110
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,230
Dragon Egg, we haven't finished our wedding yet. Dragon Egg.

111
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,430
Get up.

112
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,160
Sister.

113
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,760
Lord, Lord, Lord.

114
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,700
Save them.
