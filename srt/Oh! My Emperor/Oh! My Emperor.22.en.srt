1
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,630
Oh! My Emperor Season 2

2
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,630
Production company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,630
Episode 01

4
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
Her dress is odd.

5
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,960
She doesn't belong to Zodiac State,

6
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,160
probably an assassin.

7
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,100
Your Majesty, what do we do with her?

8
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,830
Kill her.

9
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,430
You can't.

10
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,830
She's the girl in my prospects.

11
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,630
I can predict she's closely connected

12
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,430
with the future of Zodiac State.

13
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,160
We will trigger a conflict between  the Serpent star

14
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,030
and the other twelve stars,

15
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,500
so we will profit from it.

16
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,830
I'm willing to give up.

17
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,960
You've passed my tests.

18
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,230
From now on,

19
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,500
I give away the military power

20
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,560
to you.

21
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,160
You're the master of Serpent star.

22
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,630
Move away.

23
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,100
When the war ends,

24
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,760
do you think grandma will let her go?

25
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,360
The almighty energy,

26
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,360
is she a spy on the king?

27
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,100
Beitang Yi,

28
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,100
I didn't, I didn't lie to you.

29
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,500
With the luck from the stars to enlighten the sky,

30
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,230
with the light from Purple unit,

31
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,160
as the almighty ruler of Zodiac,

32
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,230
I hereby follow the will of all stars,

33
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,960
wishes from ancestors,

34
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,560
to tell the world,

35
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,830
I take back the king's military power for military and political unity.

36
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,700
I will be diligent and humble,

37
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,430
and work together with the masters of twelve stars.

38
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,630
Congratulations on the unity!

39
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,560
Up, you all.

40
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,700
Thanks, Your Majesty.

41
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,830
From now on,

42
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,760
I'm the king of Zodiac State.

43
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,760
I will certainly spare no efforts to build a prosperous country.

44
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,300
We'll follow Your Majesty.

45
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,560
I will

46
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
I will announce amnesty.

47
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,230
Fantastic as amnesty is,

48
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,030
only that the whole world belongs to Zodiac State,

49
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,630
all the benefits should go to our people.

50
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,760
So foreign people can't be included in the amnesty.

51
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,430
Don't forget how your father died.

52
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,430
If you want to pardon people,

53
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,300
who do you want to pardon exactly?

54
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,960
I want to pardon all the prisoners.

55
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,630
people of Serpent star created mad people,

56
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,630
trying to overthrow our regime,

57
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,360
can these people be pardoned?

58
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,030
Especially their master Luo Feifei.

59
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,830
Don't let the people of Serpent star go!

60
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,960
Aye.

61
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,560
Brother,

62
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,160
she likes you so much,

63
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,430
and just put her into prison, letting her die.

64
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,100
It was wrong of her to assassinate you.

65
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,760
But,

66
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,630
I believe she has a reason,

67
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,430
and you hurt her with a sword,

68
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,030
now you're even.

69
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,560
Please let her go.

70
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,430
Get out!

71
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,760
I won't leave if you don't let her go.

72
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,630
Dehai,

73
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,830
get him out!

74
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,030
Pardon me, Your Highness.

75
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,830
Look at you, Dehai.

76
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,630
Take him out, you fat boy.

77
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,960
Bear this in mind,

78
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,360
Dehai!

79
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Let me go!

80
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,160
Dehai!

81
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,430
Let me go!

82
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,300
You two!

83
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,430
Dehai!

84
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,700
Your Highness,

85
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
see, Your Majesty is irritated,

86
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,160
just don't bother him.

87
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,960
Don't bother him?

88
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,430
Please forgive me,

89
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,630
I was wrong.

90
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,030
You are so unreliable,

91
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,830
useless.

92
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,560
Has he gone?

93
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,430
Yes.

94
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,560
Childish.

95
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,430
The prince is righteous, a trait hard to be found now.

96
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,430
You can talk well.

97
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,030
I've heard yesterday

98
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
if you hadn't thrust the sword,

99
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm afraid Miss Luo would have gone mad now.

100
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
I think Miss Luo sees things well.

101
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,300
She's supposed to know your good intention.

102
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,700
Prince Tang,

103
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,360
Prince Tang, help us.

104
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,830
Prince Tang, help us.

105
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,760
Prince Tang, let us go.

106
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,360
Let them go, let them all go.

107
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Prince Tang, help us.

108
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,760
They are the people form the Serpent star.

109
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,300
The emperor has announced amnesty,

110
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,100
will you betray his order? Let them go.

111
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,760
Aye.

112
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,560
Thanks, Prince Tang, thanks!

113
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,100
Where is my Missy?

114
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,830
She is on the way to the place of execution.

115
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,700
She's not in the prison now.

116
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,630
The last master of Serpent star killed the emperor, committing treason.

117
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,760
Now the current master

118
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,830
demonstrated her power when the war broke out,

119
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,760
and then all the asters lost their power.

120
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,560
We were so close to a catastrophe.

121
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,700
I follow the will of the God,

122
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,560
to kill the master of Serpent star.

123
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,160
Brother!

124
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,230
The Missy has been hijacked to the execution ground.

125
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,030
What?

126
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,360
Archers, get ready.

127
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,760
Faster!

128
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,700
Kill her.

129
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,560
Faster!

130
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:31,900
Faster!

131
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,230
Up the arrow.

132
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,230
Faster!

133
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,030
Let loose...

134
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,030
Cease it!

135
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,030
Prince Chen, what do you want to do?

136
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,830
Mother, you can't kill her.

137
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,960
I've heard you like this witch.

138
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,560
Really she is.

139
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,300
No wonder even Prince Chen has been obsessed with her.

140
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,960
If the witch stays here,

141
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,700
the Zodiac State will be destroyed sooner or later.

142
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,900
We can't keep her alive.

143
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,230
Kill the witch! Kill the witch!

144
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,830
Kill the witch!

145
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,630
Prince Chen,

146
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,960
do you still insist on standing by her?

147
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,100
I have my reason to save her.

148
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,160
I'm all ears to hear

149
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,430
what is it

150
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,830
that could let you forget the death of your brother a decade ago.

151
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,830
Luo Feifei and I have been engaged with a witness.

152
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,430
She's my wife,

153
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,230
not the foreign people.

154
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,160
She belongs to the Zodiac State.

155
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,630
The emperor has announced amnesty.

156
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,160
Prince Chen has been addicted to the witch,

157
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
we can't not trust his words.

158
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,160
Kill her!

159
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,700
Mother!

160
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,960
You need to kill me first if you want to kill her.

161
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,160
Prince Chen, are you committing treason?

162
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,630
I dare not.

163
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,160
But couples should enjoy prosperity and endure adversity together.

164
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,360
Even she's the master of Serpent star,

165
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,830
I will stay with her, unbound by death.

166
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,360
All these words with no evidence.

167
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,960
You dare to fool me with your engagement.

168
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,630
Prince Chen,how dare you!

169
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,160
The emperor is coming!

170
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,230
Grandma.

171
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,360
Right about time.

172
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,430
Prince Chen came to defend the witch,

173
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,960
and tried to fool me with his engagement.

174
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,830
How to deal with it in your opinion?

175
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,560
I'm aware of it.

176
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,630
I was there when they engaged.

177
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,030
Great.

178
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,760
I bow out, grandma.

179
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,900
Watch her closely.

180
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Feifei is my wife now.

181
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,430
I will protect her with all means.

182
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,630
Brother,

183
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,230
will you let Prince Chen take her away just like that?

184
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,160
Your Highness, Master Su is here.

185
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,960
When you fall in love with someone,

186
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,500
you'll never know when it will end.

187
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,560
You are getting so emotional today.

188
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,360
I'm emotional.

189
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,560
I'm congratulating you.

190
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,030
there's a saying?

191
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,030
A beauty's smile could fascinate all people in a nation,

192
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,100
but could also be a danger.

193
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,100
I've heard

194
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,760
you've shown your guts in the execution ground.

195
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,700
You've got all the time today,

196
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,030
should I assign you something?

197
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,960
No need.

198
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,300
I will be fine.

199
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,360
Your Majesty.

200
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,500
Your Majesty.

201
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,630
Your Majesty.

202
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,100
Your Majesty.

203
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,760
Miss Luo will be the wife of Prince Chen,

204
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,360
how can you be so calm?

205
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,030
Luo Feifei.

206
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,830
Well, you can't forget Miss Luo,

207
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,900
why did you let her go?

208
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,360
Your Majesty.

209
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,430
Go get her.

210
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,300
Your Highness.

211
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,500
Yanran.

212
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,700
What's the matter? It's been so late.

213
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,160
I've heard Feifei had been hurt badly,

214
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,430
and I want to pay a visit.

215
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,160
Your Highness, she's having a fever again.

216
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Who is there?

217
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,760
Yanran,

218
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,760
it's been too late,

219
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,960
you should get back.

220
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,300
Thanks, Your Highness.

221
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,560
But I can't fall asleep

222
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,230
if she doesn't wake up.

223
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,900
Please allow me to stay,

224
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,560
so I can ease myself.

225
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,030
There's nothing that you can do,

226
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,030
don't push too hard on yourself.

227
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,560
We're the same.

228
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,830
It is true of you as well.

229
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,960
Please.

230
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,760
Feifei, don't blame me.

231
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,230
Why bother to come

232
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,160
to my place?

233
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,630
As you said,

234
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,360
it seems you seldom have my company.

235
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,030
You've grown up,

236
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,160
being more considerate.

237
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,700
Where is your brother, Tang?

238
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,700
My brother,

239
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,030
at this time

240
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,630
he's probably asleep.

241
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
I don't know if

242
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
he's still angry at me.

243
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,630
Let's go and visit him.

244
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,100
Why don't we visit him tomorrow?

245
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,300
Your brother should be viewing memorials now.

246
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,300
Let's go there.

247
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,830
Grandma.

248
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,630
Let's go.

249
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,230
That big brother is so weird.

250
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,030
I don't understand you adults.

251
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,900
So weird.

252
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,430
Sister, I've come to save you.

253
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,430
Please get well soon.
