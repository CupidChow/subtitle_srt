1
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:01,430
Oh! My Emperor

2
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,630
Production Company: Horgos Wajijiwa Entertainment Co., Ltd

3
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,700
Episode 10

4
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,100
That man ran from the back of the Dragon Chasm.

5
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,630
Let's go back first.

6
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,230
And then chase after him on horseback by a shortcut.

7
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,700
Feifei.

8
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,300
Surround them.

9
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,300
I never thought you would be such a good fighter.

10
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,430
General Chu, you're late.

11
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,560
You're welcome. Where's His Highness?

12
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,830
Uncle

13
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,560
and my brother went to rescue Missy.

14
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,230
Arrest them all.

15
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,360
Brother, you...

16
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,030
Your Highness.

17
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,300
Are you hurt?

18
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,030
Take care of yourself.

19
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,030
I'll follow the path to chase down the remaining force.

20
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,960
And leave

21
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,100
the rest to His Majesty and General Chu.

22
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,160
Aye.

23
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,700
Take all the suspects away.

24
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,100
Go. Go.

25
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,960
Hey,

26
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,830
I haven't gone.

27
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,700
Do you hear me? She's still here.

28
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,500
Aye.

29
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,030
Wait.

30
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,360
Hey, that's...

31
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,830
Move it.

32
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,000
the Wind Sign and the Earth Sign advanced into the final.

33
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,830
Advance. Advance.

34
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,360
It's you again?

35
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,160
Yeah. It's me again.

36
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,760
What have you done this time?

37
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,700
No idea.

38
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,300
What are you having?

39
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,300
Pig's feet. Do you want some?

40
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,100
I'll have some.

41
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
That one's for you.

42
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,900
Pass peanuts to her.

43
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,500
Help yourself to the food and drink.

44
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,560
We're home.

45
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,430
Enjoy the meal. Make yourself at home.

46
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,360
What did you say?

47
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,900
Luo Feifei got locked up in the dungeon again?

48
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,160
Yes. This time, His Majesty ordered us to

49
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,030
put every suspect

50
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,900
in the dungeon cell.

51
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,700
Let's go.

52
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,700
Where to?

53
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,760
The palace!

54
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,960
Your Highness. Your Highness.

55
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,030
Is his Majesty in there?

56
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,560
Yes.

57
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,960
Your Highness.

58
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,500
Uncle.

59
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,560
Why would His Majesty put Luo Feifei

60
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,630
in the dungeon cell?

61
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,500
What are you talking about, Uncle?

62
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,360
When have I ever put her in the cell?

63
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,030
She's already been locked up,

64
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,430
and you're still pretending that you know nothing about it?

65
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,300
In the Dragon Chasm,

66
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,900
Luo Feifei saved you.

67
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,630
Doing this would be

68
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,430
repaying her kindness with ingratitude.

69
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,760
And how callous is that?

70
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,900
With all her efforts,

71
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
you still ignored her.

72
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,700
Even glanced her way while arresting the others.

73
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Doesn't it mean you're going to arrest her?

74
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,360
I don't care what exactly happened.

75
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,430
I will take Luo Feifei away now.

76
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,160
Who knows how much pain

77
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,160
Missy has suffered down there.

78
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,500
I'll go and take a look.

79
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,700
Uncle has already gone there.

80
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,100
I believe he can handle it.

81
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,560
Brother, are you worried?

82
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,560
I've never seen you so worried before.

83
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,160
She saved my life in Dragon's Chasm.

84
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,960
Brother, you figured it out!

85
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,500
Why not we summon her to enter the palace?

86
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,500
Enter the palace?

87
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,900
Yeah. I think you two are meant to be together.

88
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,760
Nonsense.

89
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,300
Brother, please believe me.

90
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,630
Alright.

91
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,230
Brother, come and have some fun.

92
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,060
Brother, since you were a child,

93
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,260
you've been taught by Grandma-Empress

94
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,560
to concentrate on dealing with political affairs everyday.

95
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,230
Immersing yourself in all kinds of

96
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
military tactics and ancient books.

97
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Everyday, you would hold a book

98
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,260
and stare in jealousy

99
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,560
as Uncle and I rode the wooden horse.

100
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,560
Just hop up and let loose.

101
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,360
With this amount of time,

102
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,760
why don't you think about how to summon Luo Feifei?

103
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,100
Brother, just for a little while.

104
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,500
You'll probably come up with ideas

105
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
once you hop on the horse.

106
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,500
With your age, how come you're still so naive?

107
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,630
Stop.

108
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,100
You shall leave.

109
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,100
Aye.

110
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Brother, there's no one here. Just come here to play.

111
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,830
Prince Tang, Master Mei has asked to see you.

112
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,760
I'll be right back.

113
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,630
I heard that in the Five Immortals State, you bought a-

114
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
His Majesty.

115
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,900
What a lovely day, right?

116
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
The weather is fine.

117
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Yeah.

118
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,700
Please rest assured.

119
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,500
She's suffered absolutely no pain in there.

120
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,660
We've offered her hospitality services.

121
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,500
Her scream seems painful.

122
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,360
But-but we really didn't interrogate her.

123
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,900
Three Taurus' and a Virgo.

124
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,900
Wait. Anyone? Anyone?

125
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,160
Anyone wants to call?

126
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,030
I check.

127
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,960
Here! I'll call.

128
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,700
I'll call.

129
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,630
Four Capricorns.

130
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
Let's see what you've got.

131
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,700
That's strange. Why did you get all the Capricorns?

132
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,030
It's called luck.

133
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,900
Let me show you how it's done.

134
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,500
She seems fine.

135
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,430
Hurry up.

136
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,300
Will you call or not?

137
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,560
Please hurry.

138
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,760
I'll call. Anyone else?

139
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,830
Here! I'll call.

140
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,100
Four Scorpios.

141
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,500
I just dealt one.

142
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,760
Why do you still have four Scorpios?

143
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,230
When did you deal it again? I never saw that.

144
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,630
Yeah. He did deal a Scorpio.

145
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,300
You didn't. Don't flip the cards.

146
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,760
Don't flip the cards. That's not fair.

147
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,960
You're cheating!

148
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,630
Is it because you all are sore losers?

149
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,230
Is it?

150
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,160
Prince Chen.

151
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,500
Prince Chen. Prince Chen.

152
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,160
Feifei, shouldn't you come here by now?

153
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,360
Will I be released?

154
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,700
Come on. Do you think

155
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
we're here to play cards with you?

156
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,760
Take care, Your Highness.

157
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Welcome to play next time.

158
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,100
Next time, we'll play in my home.

159
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,230
How about raising the stakes?

160
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,360
You little money-grubber.

161
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Time to go.

162
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,360
I have to go now.

163
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,630
Next time, let's play outside.

164
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,300
Play outside, okay?

165
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,360
Finally.

166
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,230
I'm seriously worn out these days.

167
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,430
It's great to be back.

168
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,900
Your Majesty's skill in chess has greatly improved.

169
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,230
Attacking at every turn. I'm put to shame.

170
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,700
You're too modest.

171
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,830
It seems that you're evading,

172
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,300
but in truth, you're just biding your time.

173
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,500
Taking detours, using defense as offense.

174
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
Sometimes, avoiding conflicts

175
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,500
is just a way of compromising.

176
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,500
But if the opponent keeps on pushing,

177
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,830
I'll have to counter-attack.

178
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,500
The most important thing

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,630
in playing chess

180
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,560
is knowing how to move.

181
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,560
The most important thing in life

182
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,830
is knowing what you want.

183
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,300
Then Uncle has to be careful.

184
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,700
A temporary victory

185
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,760
doesn't mean a guaranteed success.

186
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,760
I know how to move the chess pieces

187
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,900
and, more importantly, what I want in life.

188
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,760
The realm belongs to the Emperor.

189
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,430
As do all the people in it.

190
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,160
Now that the entire world is yours,

191
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,430
there's no need to hurry.

192
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,100
Once the time comes,

193
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,100
you can take it.

194
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,300
Very well said.

195
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,500
I'll mark your words

196
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,000
and ask someone of yours

197
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,560
to enter the palace and accept rewards.

198
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,700
Rewarding should be decided by Your Majesty alone.

199
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,500
Then, I'll summon Luo Feifei to enter the palace today,

200
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,230
and confer upon her the title Rank Six Astrologist.

201
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,960
Luo Feifei has hardly achieved anything.

202
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,900
I'm afraid she's undeserving of the title.

203
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,030
Luo Feifei saved me.

204
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,900
How is that "hardly achieving anything"?

205
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,760
Not to mention Rank Six Astrologist

206
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,300
is not a high rank at all.

207
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,700
If you're worried, Uncle,

208
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,100
I'll reward her with Rank Seven Astrologist.

209
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Uncle just said

210
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,100
"as do all the people in it".

211
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,300
Is rewarding a dancing girl going too far?

212
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,630
Of course not.

213
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,900
Your Majesty, I just think

214
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,560
Luo Feifei is clumsy and rash.

215
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,500
She probably can't shoulder the responsibility.

216
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,100
It's alright. I can find someone to teach her.

217
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,700
If you're still worried,

218
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,300
I'll reward her with Rank Eight Astrologist, then.

219
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,100
You wouldn't object to that, would you?

220
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,900
You Majesty, I wouldn't dare to object.

221
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,960
I think Luo Feifei

222
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,700
is my beloved dancing girl.

223
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,500
Sending her to the palace...

224
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,160
Dare not to, not will not.

225
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,430
It seems that Uncle is still displeased.

226
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,100
Alright then. I'll make her a Rank Nine Astrologist.

227
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,560
"As do all the people in it".

228
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,500
Your Majesty, can you stop talking like this?

229
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,700
That's what you said to me before.

230
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,430
But Luo Feifei-

231
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,960
Please stop talking.

232
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,760
At this rate,

233
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,960
with her rank dropping again and again,

234
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,780
I might as well banish her to the border

235
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,600
as a Constellation Slave.

236
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,360
You're exerting yourself, Uncle.

237
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,500
Alright. Then I'll have to ask you

238
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
to take care of Miss Luo for me.

239
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,160
Uncle, the game hasn't finished yet.

240
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,360
The winner hasn't been decided

241
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,760
and there's no need to dwell on one game.

242
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,560
There's plenty of time ahead.

243
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,760
Your Majesty, let's settle it another day.

244
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,630
Miss. Miss.

245
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,230
Wake up.

246
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,360
No.

247
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,300
I haven't slept well for two days. I can't get up.

248
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,700
What are you doing?

249
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,700
It's already late. You really should getup now.

250
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,900
His Majesty is waiting for you to enter the palace.

251
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,960
Enter the palace?

252
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,100
I'm not going.

253
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,300
Feifei, the palace is heavily guarded.

254
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,160
Scheming and plotting is inevitable.

255
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,760
I know you don't want to go,

256
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,160
but his Majesty insists.

257
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,560
So.

258
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,900
Your Highness, I know you can

259
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,300
predict the future.

260
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,230
I just want to ask

261
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,430
when will you be granted with visions again?

262
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,030
My precognition skill can indeed see into the future.

263
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,300
But every time I use it,

264
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
it's being triggered.

265
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,030
And I can't see many visions

266
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,360
at one time.

267
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,500
So.

268
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,100
Alright. Okay then.

269
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
What do you want to know.

270
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,300
How to put it?

271
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,100
It's pretty complicated.

272
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,760
I don't want to talk about it. That's all.

273
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,700
When will I enter the palace?

274
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Tomorrow.

275
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
I don't get it.

276
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Why is the Dragon Egg

277
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,830
so eager to let me enter the palace?

278
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,420
Outside the palace,

279
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,530
he wanted to see me locked up in a cell

280
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,360
and beheaded.

281
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,230
If I do enter the palace,

282
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,760
will I be killed instantly?

283
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,360
No.

284
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,160
I'll have to ask the old man.

285
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,430
Miss, why do you crawl out of there?

286
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,900
Slowly. Slowly.

287
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,830
Pardon me, Xiang Batian.

288
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,700
But I come for an answer.

289
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,430
That day, when I went to the Dragon Chasm,

290
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,760
I saw that those Ophiuchus' bearing

291
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,960
a different symbol from my own.

292
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,030
My Constellation Stamp

293
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,160
is also different from other Ophiuchus commoners.

294
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,900
Because I'm the elder of Ophiuchus.

295
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,160
I think you made a mistake.

296
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,160
If not,

297
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,300
I hope you did.

298
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,160
You Ophiuchus' are strong fighters.

299
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,160
I'm nobody. I can't be-

300
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,560
I can't be your Ophiuchus.

301
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,360
That's impossible.

302
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,360
Miss.

303
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,500
There isn't any kind of energy

304
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,300
that's born for destruction.

305
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,630
I don't understand. I don't understand.

306
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,360
See for yourself. See for yourself.

307
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,360
See for yourself. See it.

308
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,900
See it. Just see it.

309
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Miss.

310
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,700
You're the Constellation Lord for Ophiuchus.

311
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,560
Please accept my kowtow.

312
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,160
Your action will shorten my life.

313
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,900
You don't have to do this. Please stand up.

314
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,560
Constellation Lord, no.

315
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,230
I can't accept it.

316
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,500
Unhand me. You can't do this.

317
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,960
I'm going home. Don't pull at me.

318
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,160
Don't look for me later

319
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,700
or ever.
