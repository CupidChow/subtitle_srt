1
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,000
What if Fou4Mod happens to like you for real, what will you do?

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,060
Wait, when you said, "In case you'd like to have your nails done..."

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,900
you meant, you, yourself, are doing nails for them?

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,410
Well, no, there's still no definition to what we both are yet.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,710
Be careful you might get hurt.

6
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,350
Hello.

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,250
Why are you in such a hurry?

8
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,590
I'm gonna go see my friends.
I'll have some of this.

9
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,000
Hey, can I ask you something?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Our home is only 10 minutes away from the school.
Why do you have to go to school so early every morning?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,010
I have to help my friends do their homework.

12
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,080
I used to send a file for them to copy but the teacher caught us so no iPads are allowed.

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,150
- Oh oh
- See you.

14
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,330
- Have a good day at school.
- Bye-bye, dear.

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,069
Bye-bye.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,950
To BTS Mo Chit, please.

17
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,660
Please hurry, I don't want them to see me.

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Thank you.

19
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Fou4Mod.

20
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,870
Where exactly are you right now?

21
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,420
The first carriage, it's least-crowded.

22
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,840
Period.

23
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,030
Are you gonna copy my homework?

24
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,490
No, I did it myself.

25
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,000
Chian did the lotus for me, it's gorgeous!

26
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,040
You know what, you can have my phone, if you're gonna stare like that.

27
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,420
So nosey.

28
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,280
Fou4Mod.

29
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,280
He's graduating, when is he gonna ask you out?

30
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,650
Hey!

31
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,800
I cut him off.

32
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,940
Huh?

33
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,210
Why's that, Coach?

34
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,290
Although I like girls, I still think he's hot.

35
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,840
I got sick and tired of him. He's boring.

36
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,740
It was annoying. That's it.

37
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,280
Look at you!

38
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,880
You're so charming, so charming...

39
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,630
He's so so confident, your friend.

40
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,000
Fou4Mod.

41
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,940
He couldn't hear you.

42
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,460
So what are we doing?

43
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,470
I don't know. Just take some rest.

44
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,460
We're too stuffed.

45
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,710
Need to sit down to digest.

46
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:46,860
Hey, hey!

47
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,730
Move!

48
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,970
You actually didn't cut Wichianmas off. I can tell...

49
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,740
he cut you off, didn't he?

50
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,180
Excuse me.

51
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,830
How did you know?

52
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,020
Take a look at yourself.

53
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,700
Shit.

54
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
I think he just ghosted me.

55
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,670
How are you feeling?

56
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,670
You can tell me. I won't tell anyone.

57
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Shit, there must be something wrong.

58
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,310
You know, he hasn't replied to my DM on Instagram for a month now.

59
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Does that mean he doesn't like me?

60
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,740
But you know, he used to tell me...

61
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,740
that he was put on hold by Bua.

62
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,630
You know what he told me?

63
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,310
He said he was done, he had enough...

64
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,910
he didn't wanna get hurt anymore.

65
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,600
Shit!

66
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,520
It's like him giving me a sign that he's free.

67
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,970
Is that all?

68
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,780
Yes, that's all.

69
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,830
For real?

70
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,430
Yes, for real. Really.

71
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,430
Alright, go on.

72
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,320
Why did he do that to me?

73
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,370
And you know, the other day...

74
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,370
I saw his Story, he's back doing nails for Bua.

75
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,170
Here's the thing, do you have his Line ID yet?

76
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,590
You guys don't even talk on Line.

77
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,590
Would he be serious with you?

78
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,800
How are you feeling?

79
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,850
You can tell me. I won't tell anyone.

80
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,850
So...I think he's keeping on a hook.

81
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,900
Do you remember when you said you two didn't have a status?

82
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,920
Well, I'll give you the definition.

83
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,190
Something like, he's a breadcrumber.

84
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,560
I'm like...

85
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,320
I keep going on a loop thinking if Chian likes me or not.

86
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,210
You know, I wake up and see his Instagram everyday. Boohoo.

87
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,380
You seem to like him a lot. LoLLLLL!

88
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,880
Desprately.

89
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,410
Just get over him already, really.

90
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,360
My cards turned out really bad.

91
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,110
If yours are good, you must be the one purchasing the concert tickets.

92
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,900
Alright.

93
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,490
Enjoy! This is the first time you're gonna meet Lisa.

94
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,770
After you spend time at the concert, you'll get over the heartbreak.

95
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,160
Your cards are really good.

96
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,880
Let him purchase the tickets. 5,800 baht on the 27th. You'll get them.

97
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,860
Lisa won't be smiling at me, looking from the cards.

98
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,660
How about my friend?

99
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,150
Pick three cards.

100
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,950
Your love is really good on the concert day.

101
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,200
Prepare to celebrate. Lisa will be smiling at you.

102
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,990
You try on your phone and I'll try on mine, okay?

103
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,720
Okay, okay.

104
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,600
And the fortuneteller says that zone E2L is really good.

105
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,540
E2L, E2L!

106
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,490
Do you get it?

107
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,430
Alright, I got it, E2L.

108
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,240
Whomever gets it first, okay?

109
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,750
Alright, okay.

110
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,380
Shit, I'm so nervous.

111
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,740
- C'mon, it's about time.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

112
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,870
On a count of five.

113
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,800
Five, four, three, two, one...press it.

114
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,230
Shit, my screen froze.

115
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,320
Fuck, please help me, God.

116
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,350
Please, they need to be confirmed.

117
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,610
Namo tassa bhagavato arahato samma sambuddhassa.

118
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,910
Namo tassa bhagavato arahato samma sambuddhassa.

119
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,200
Namo tassa bhagavato arahato samma sambuddhassa.

120
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,490
Namo tassa bhagavato arahato samma sambuddhassa.

121
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,830
- Namo tassa bhagavato arahato samma sambuddhassa.
- Shit, it's going through. It's going through.

122
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,440
Namo tassa bhagavato arahato samma sambuddhassa.

123
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,860
- Fuck, it's here, confirm!
- Confirm it, comfirm it!

124
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,340
Okay, okay.

125
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,740
Fuck, I finally get to meet Lisa!

126
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,510
Man, which pink is Blackpink's?

127
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,280
I'm dizzy. There's a lot o f them.

128
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
This one.

129
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,430
Do you want a hoodie like mine?

130
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,330
No. Never the same design.

131
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,930
Wow, this is pretty.

132
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,950
Wait, I haven't finished wearing it.

133
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,860
Okay.

134
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,720
It's good.

135
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,710
Thank you.

136
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,770
This is nice, I bet Lisa will be able to see me for sure.

137
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,250
Ooh, there's a design at the back as well.

138
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,280
Are you alright?

139
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,680
I miss him again.

140
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,940
I wanna try on a shirt with him again.

141
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,080
Hey.

142
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,180
Why don't you do it with me instead, what you wanna do with Wichianmas?

143
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,900
It might help you forget him.

144
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,650
Are you crazy?

145
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,440
I'm for real.

146
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,710
No, I wanna hold his hand.

147
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,240
Fuck it!

148
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,230
Damn you.

149
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,990
Well, do you want it?

150
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,560
You know, that day, I was holding his arm like this.

151
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,550
But actually, I wanted to do this so much.

152
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,730
Can I lean on you a bit?

153
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,750
What the hell? What the fuck are you doing?

154
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,230
Well, I'm playing Wichianmas.

155
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,290
There's no Oscar for you. Just a little bit is good enough.

156
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,480
Well, you told me to be Chian.

157
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,550
Ah, try being Wichianmas.

158
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,650
Dear Fou4Mod, would you like to have your nails done?

159
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,150
- Haha, that's not like him at all.
- Would he say that?

160
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,570
Dearest Fou4Mod, how are you doing? Lol.

161
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,720
Just chillin' but I miss you a lot, Chian.

162
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,610
So does your face look like this when you put away the shades?

163
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,610
Fuck you!

164
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,130
You're funny.

165
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,540
I like that.

166
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,080
LoLLLllLllLLLLLLLLLL

167
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,560
What's so fucking funny?

168
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,940
I'm a funny person. LolLLLllLLLLLllllL

169
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,910
You know,

170
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,170
today is the first day I haven't looked at his Instagram.

171
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,300
I'm 10% on forgetting him.

172
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,240
Period.

173
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,510
Period.

174
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Let's go get some smoothies.

175
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,090
Why did you kick me?

176
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,990
C'mon, get up.

177
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,050
Right.

178
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,290
Hey!

179
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,110
What?

180
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,930
Let's take a selfie.

181
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,800
What about me?

182
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,080
How was that?

183
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,020
I'm more handsome than you.

184
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,210
That's not true.

185
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,860
What the heck?

186
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:14,930
Wanna get our nails done?

187
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,110
Let's go.

188
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,530
Wanna try this?

189
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,860
Don't look.

190
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,180
Chian is here.

191
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,350
Damn you, I told you not to look.

192
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,560
Let's go get our nails done.

193
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,560
Man, should I say hi to him?

194
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,380
Don't even think about it.

195
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,610
C'mon, let's go.

196
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,930
Hey!

197
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,080
Hey, what are you doing here?

198
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,380
I'm here to buy new uni uniform.

199
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,170
And thinking about going shopping.

200
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,520
Finding something to wear at the welcoming orientation.

201
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,930
Oh.

202
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,240
You've disappeared.

203
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,600
Are you here to get your nails done?

204
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,620
Where are you going next?

205
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,980
Actually, I walked Baa here to get his nails done.

206
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,500
After that, I'm going on a walk.

207
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,750
Right, has the person you're having a date got here yet?

208
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,000
Is he here yet?

209
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,310
He's getting off a Tuk-tuk in front of MBK.

210
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,230
Oh.

211
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,960
Why don't you go with Chian?

212
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,120
When my date is here, we're gonna go for a walk too.

213
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,540
So shall we?

214
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,530
Are you sure?

215
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,760
Yeah.

216
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,670
Alright, see you. I'm off.

217
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,880
Chian.

218
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,040
Chian.

219
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,520
If there's nothing that you like, why don't you find it on an app?

220
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,440
I'm not sure about the size, I'm afraid it won't fit me.

221
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,970
Hey.

222
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,610
I'll help you look.

223
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,980
C'mon.

224
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,340
Shit, my battery is running out. Only 10% left.

225
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,410
You can't buy it if you don't have enough battery.

226
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,410
C'mon, choose the design.

227
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,130
Could you do that for me?

228
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,700
How about grey?

229
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,670
Size...large.

230
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,640
When you said you wanted me to do your nails...

231
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,110
that time...

232
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,930
Do you still want me to do them?

233
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,850
Seven, eight...so eight yellow sticks.

234
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,320
Four red sticks.

235
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,640
What's up? I'm working. Speak quickly.

236
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,090
Alright, I'll be fast.

237
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,850
I'm not going to Blackpink's concert anymore.

238
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,050
Chian wants to do my nails.

239
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,500
Excuse me, one moment.

240
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,860
Do them another day.

241
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,140
You told me you wanted to go to Blackpink's concert with me.

242
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,920
Well, the fortune teller told me that my love's gonna be good.

243
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,590
If I confess how I feel and he says no, I'll be able to move on.

244
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,880
Okay?

245
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,240
Then do it another day. You're in a good luck already anyway.

246
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,680
Man, why wouldn't you want your friend to have a scene?

247
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,660
If I confess to him and he's okay, then period!

248
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,730
So I don't have to be annoying around you, isn't that a good thing?

249
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,810
If you see me happy, are you not gonna be okay with that?

250
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,450
You're always like this.

251
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,900
You can sell my ticket. I'll give you a share.

252
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,910
Okay, deal. Bye.

253
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,390
Chian.

254
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,390
Baa-bin?

255
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:15,930
Yeah?

256
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,410
I like Fou4Mod.

257
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,350
I like Fou4Mod. Will you stop messing with him?

258
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,790
@Buawaterlily : Blackpink's concert on the 27th's ticket needed, no markup.

259
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,550
Bua.

260
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:24,080
Hey, thanks for the discount.

261
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,510
Is your friend really not coming?

262
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,160
Thank you.

263
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,780
Can I ask you something?

264
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,610
Yeah.

265
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,690
When are you and Chian going to be a couple?

266
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,190
Why are you asking?

267
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,860
Then I'm gonna be straightforward.

268
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,840
Would you stop keeping Chian on a hook?

269
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,440
You're fucking nosey.

270
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,060
What the fuck are you doing? Take this goddamn ticket back.

271
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,630
No, you take it.

272
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,340
No! You take it back now.

273
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,650
Let's go.

274
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,929
Bua.

275
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,929
Bua. Bua.

276
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,330
Bua, take the ticket!

277
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,590
But please, end up with Chian.

278
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,130
So my friend can cut him off.

279
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,310
I like Fou4Mod.

280
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:43,030
"Looking to buy a concert ticket."

281
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,640
You like Lisa the most?

282
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,830
Just cover the ticket price.

283
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,220
Give me your hand.

284
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,650
Don't be stiff.

285
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,050
I'm not.

286
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,980
Yes, you are.

287
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,500
I'm not, do you know how to do it?

288
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,910
Of course.

289
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,690
Stay still!

290
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,620
After my nails are done, I'm gonna make a love confession.

291
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,110
After your nails are done, let me know.

292
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,330
I'll be rooting for you.

293
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,090
Hey, I really am not interested in Chian.

294
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,830
I think I'm being very clear about that.

295
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,370
We can only be friends.

296
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:11,280
Imagine being more than friends, it won't work out.

297
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,330
You're frowning.

298
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,890
So tell me, does Chian really like your friend?

299
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,400
They're doing nails right now.

300
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,090
After my friend's got his nails done, he'll confess to Chian.

301
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,280
They'll end up together for sure.

302
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,920
So you're gonna be heartbroken, huh?

303
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,960
Have you ever told your friend that you like him?

304
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,290
And you're gonna let him go, just like that?

305
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,150
I don't know.

306
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,930
I think this is your last shot.

307
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,770
If I were you, I would say something already.

308
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,540
Like, I like you. Like, right now.

309
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,690
At least, if you tell him and he doesn't like you...

310
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,480
or doesn't wanna be with you...

311
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,940
you won't have any doubt.

312
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,350
Really.

313
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,060
I don't know. Maybe there are too many people here causing internet problem.

314
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,920
I'll tell him after the concert.

315
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,670
Come on, man.

316
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,370
Listen, this has nothing to do with the goddamn internet.

317
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:15,830
You're doing it to yourself. No one is keeping you on hold.

318
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,180
You're keeping yourself on hold.

319
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,630
I bet...

320
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,290
with the next concert's ticket...

321
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,750
If you're still like this...

322
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,470
you two will never end up together.

323
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,870
Please, I mean well.

324
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,910
Let's listen to some music.

325
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,240
Hey, I got something to tell you.

326
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,680
Are you done with your nails?

327
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,180
Hello?

328
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,160
Excuse me, excuse me. I'm sorry.

329
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,190
So sorry. Excuse me.

330
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,920
Where have you been?

331
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,210
If Lisa turns around, please give her a smile. I'm off.

332
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,940
Excuse me, excuse me. I'm sorry.

333
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,450
Where are you going?

334
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:19,230
Don't tell Chian that you love him just yet.

335
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,160
I'm on my way to you.

336
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,000
Hurry up, please!

337
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:52,180
Thank you.

338
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,050
Thank you.

339
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,920
Can I take a pic?

340
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,210
Yeah.

341
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,790
So which one do you like, customer?

342
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,970
Okay.

343
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,550
That's cool.

344
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,010
Fou4Mod, I like you.

345
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,430
I've liked you since the day you texted me to copy my homework,

346
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:44,700
and you told me I had nice handwriting.

347
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,170
It made me feel really good. You know, I screenshotted that conversation.

348
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:54,690
Actually, I've screenshotted many of our conversations and made them in to an album.

349
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,120
I lied about living around Mo Chit,

350
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,070
because when you get on a BTS, you'll pass Mo Chit, right?

351
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,230
So I could have at least ten more minutes with you. That makes me happy.

352
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,580
Seriously, do you have any feelings for me?

353
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,950
You asked me to do nails with you...

354
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,400
you tied my shoes with beads...

355
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,060
and you created a playlist with me...

356
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,450
you don't seem to do these kinda things with other people...

357
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:44,880
You doing all that makes me like you more and more.

358
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:55,390
Or is it only in my imagination?
Sometimes, I feel like you don't like me at all.

359
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,960
Like, you're not that interested in me.

360
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:05,110
I don't wanna ask a fortune teller about you every day anymore.

361
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,570
Can you choose me? Don't choose him, please.

362
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,640
Is it cute?

363
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,760
Yes.

364
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,300
Here we are Fou4Mod. Ants printing.

365
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:24,340
So sweet. Do you like it?

366
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,620
Thank you.

367
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,320
This ant is a big one.

368
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,370
What about these ants?

369
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:31,430
There are so many ants already.

370
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,460
I'll take a pic of it, okay?

371
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,120
Alright.

372
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,010
What message have you unsent?

373
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,650
I sent the wrong one.

374
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,460
I just pocket-dialed.

375
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,290
I like it.

376
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,040
Chian.

377
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,830
I have something to tell you.

378
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,830
Yes?

379
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,840
- Are you still there?
- Huh?

380
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,630
What's wrong?

381
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,930
There's a new photo booth.

382
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,260
Let's check it out.

383
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,000
- Sure
- Ok.

384
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,800
- That's it?
- Um.

385
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:48,070
Well, I want to take a photo of my nails.

386
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,760
Sure thing.

387
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,600
I thought that what's any big deal.

388
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,870
I just messed you up. There's nothing.

389
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,910
- Ok.
- Will you get your nails done?

390
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,480
Can I have one sec.

391
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,730
Sure.

392
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,270
Let me choose the color first.

393
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,330
Ouch so tired.

394
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,120
What's the matter? Are you old?

395
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,580
You took it so long.

396
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,240
Oh I'm sorry.

397
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,300
I'm not going to confess him.

398
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:30,090
I think I already know the answer.

399
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,990
Please don't tell him.

400
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,090
Can you scan this one too?

401
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,350
My LINE ID.

402
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,310
For chitchat.

403
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:09,280
Siamese cat.

404
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,690
The ants.

405
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:17,940
Fou4Mods.

406
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,760
I probably won't be able to come and help film your Tik Tok often.

407
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,830
How's you and P'Fou4Mod?

408
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,300
Didn't you see it in his story? He posted things of Fou4Mod until it was spots.

409
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,930
One more shot.
