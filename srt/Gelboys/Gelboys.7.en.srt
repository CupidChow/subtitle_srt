1
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,160
Let's see if I'll get lucky.

2
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
Will we get a secret Aep Verr color?

3
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,180
If I get it this time, I'll give it to you.

4
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,380
Really, I ain't lying.

5
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,510
Promise?

6
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,080
Alright.

7
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,410
Here we go!

8
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,410
Okay!

9
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,930
I got blue again. When are we gonna get the secret Aep Verr color?

10
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,380
Oh, man...

11
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,380
Let's do it again.

12
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,670
Again?

13
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,520
I saw it from Baa's Story that you're here.

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
I wanted to come play too.

15
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,780
If you get a secret one, don't have them do your nails yet.

16
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,830
Can I be the first one to do your nails?

17
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,430
Go do them for other people.

18
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,060
Let's go, man. Take this, too.

19
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,840
Hey.

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,220
Come have your nails done with me often.

21
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,220
You'll get over him.

22
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,260
Hey, I...

23
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,940
I don't wanna rush into being in a relationship.

24
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,110
It's okay.

25
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,079
You don't have to worry.

26
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,080
Can we just keep talking?

27
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,760
But if there's someone interesting, I won't stand to lose that chance.

28
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,310
You get what I'm saying?

29
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,600
It's alright.

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I can wait, really.

31
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,160
Alright.

32
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,050
You got this!

33
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,050
I see you have thousands of views on each clip.

34
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,420
How about I help you grow more followers?

35
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,900
I'll help you with the comments and shares.

36
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,580
So you'll get a million likes fast.

37
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,850
Anything...all I ask is for you to come back to your old self.

38
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,850
I feel guilty.

39
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,750
I'm sorry.

40
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,510
Can you not be mad at me?

41
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Please.

42
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,830
Your shirt...that's my sweat. Back off.

43
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,159
Back off!

44
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,930
My sweat isn't that aromatic.

45
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,490
No.

46
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
Okay.

47
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,780
Here's the deal.

48
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,960
You hurt me.

49
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,110
I almost didn't make it.

50
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,990
I almost got a heart attack.

51
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,990
You'll have to pair up with me and dance on my Tiktok channel.

52
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Why are you smiling? Not just one video...

53
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,160
but every video...

54
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Of course.

55
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,260
Are we good now?

56
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
No.

57
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
Go.

58
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,350
Blow dry your shirt.

59
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
What are you looking at?

60
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,620
Can we do 0.75 first?

61
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,620
There's no 0.75 on Tiktok.

62
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,060
Just one wrong move. Let's start again.

63
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,590
Only one movement, it's not difficult. Take a look.

64
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Arms go like this.

65
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Go like this.

66
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,290
And spin it out like this.

67
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,890
Like this, and step in.

68
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,270
Can I go...can I go see the first draft?

69
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,230
No, listen, it's only one movement.

70
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,230
No, I'll follow you.

71
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,950
C'mon.

72
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,390
Which draft?

73
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,390
Here.

74
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,670
"Can I go home with you?" would like to share a photo.

75
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,900
I'll take this one.

76
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,660
Which one?

77
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,660
This one.

78
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,830
Fou4Mod.

79
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,270
Fou4Mod, can I borrow some money?

80
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,270
I don't have any cash on me.

81
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
They don't accept payment via QR.

82
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,550
How much?

83
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,480
How much is this one?

84
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
100 Baht each.

85
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
100 Baht.

86
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,050
Thank you.

87
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,940
What's your Promptpay number?
I'll have the money transferred.

88
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,820
It's okay. Take it.

89
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,510
No, tell me.

90
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,510
09 08 07 06 05?

91
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,800
06...

92
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,030
06...

93
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,380
1..

94
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,140
1...

95
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,070
0...

96
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,080
0...

97
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,230
9...

98
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,430
7...

99
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,110
7...

100
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,840
1...

101
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,130
4...

102
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,170
7...

103
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,170
9...

104
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,380
Done.

105
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,990
Hello?

106
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,990
Don't block me.

107
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,110
Save this number.

108
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
So when I call, you'll know it's not a scammer.

109
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,630
Okay?

110
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,910
Scamianmas.

111
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
See you, bye.

112
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Don't forget to answer my call.

113
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,440
Get up!

114
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,610
Where are we going?

115
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,440
C'mon, hurry up!

116
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,370
That's done?

117
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,370
I don't know.

118
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:51,730
Hey, for the Random Dance...

119
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,860
Fou4Mod has been rehearsing to be Onglee every day.

120
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,750
You're missing a member here.

121
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,750
Let him rehearse with you.

122
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,400
I don't mind.

123
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
At the Random Dance, we don't have to have all the members.

124
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,250
Listen, I apologize on his behalf that he didn't clear things up with you directly.

125
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,010
But have you seen it?

126
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,500
He's been posting a Story every day, apologizing to you.

127
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,370
He also has them on a Highlight, he's afraid that you won't see them.

128
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,250
Sorry, Faifa.

129
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,460
Faifa, I'm sorry.

130
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,180
Please don't be mad at me.

131
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,740
I'm really sorry, Faifa.

132
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,180
I'm sorry.

133
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,430
Pleaseee...

134
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,890
Faifa, I'm sorry again. Please don't be mad at me.

135
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,380
Sorry.

136
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,110
I'm sorry, I feel very guilty.

137
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,510
Please don't be mad at me.

138
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:41,880
I see other people playing music...I want to play in a band with you again, Faifa.

139
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,400
I'm sorry.

140
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
I'm still waiting for you to stop being mad at me.

141
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,140
If you're not okay, I'll post these on Tiktok too.

142
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,850
Shithead, I'm gonna continue on my rehearsal.

143
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,260
Right, right, let's dance.

144
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,660
If you don't dance, I'm gonna change the songs from PIXXIE to others'.

145
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,740
Alright, let's do this, Coach. I don't wanna be the only one who sucks at this. C'mon.

146
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
C'mon, get up.

147
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,140
Let's go, let's do this.

148
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,260
So, how are you feeling?

149
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,810
Ah, okay.

150
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,000
Close your eyes.

151
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Closing them now.

152
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:15,730
Here we go.

153
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,730
Okay.

154
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,880
What's this?

155
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,400
There's another box!

156
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Open it!

157
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,250
What is it?

158
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,250
I don't know. Guess.

159
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
What is it?

160
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Oh, okay.

161
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,770
I'll do it for you.

162
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,840
I saw you switch your items to charge so I got one for you.

163
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,090
You can use it all by yourself.

164
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,410
Wow, you notice lots of stuff.

165
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,490
Let's try.

166
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,220
Stay still. I'll be at your service today.

167
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:21,420
Scammer is calling...

168
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,390
Hey, that's cute. You got stickers.

169
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,390
Yeah, stick them.

170
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,590
Which ones are cute?

171
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,590
All of them are.

172
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Take this.

173
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,360
How about this one? This looks like you.

174
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
This looks like you too.

175
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,490
Very spicy Mala soup and Pork Bone soup are here.

176
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
Thank you.

177
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,850
Damn you, I really thought your home was in Mo Chit area.

178
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,780
Is there anything else you're still hiding from me?

179
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,370
C'mon.

180
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,050
I'm willing to do this.

181
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,030
Shit.

182
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
Wake up.

183
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,580
Why are you sleeping here? Don't you have a home?

184
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,730
I'm glad I get to send you off.

185
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,640
You should go back to your dorm, it's far.

186
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,640
Oh, I've moved to Pu Chao already...

187
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
so I can come send you off often.

188
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,120
So I'm gonna get going now.

189
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,210
Bye.

190
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,190
Next station, Pu Chao.

191
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,070
Pu Chao.

192
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,330
"There's really a fulfilled love."

193
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,250
Allow me to change the name of the playlist.

194
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,250
The old name wasn't very auspicious.

195
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,130
I've also added so many songs too.

196
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,210
I've been waiting to listen to them together with you.

197
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,130
How can I listen to them all?

198
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,040
How are things?

199
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,050
So is this like when you're in the nail salon?

200
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,770
So?

201
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,060
Yeah.

202
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:23,470
Oh and today's design...

203
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:27,470
this is my order, you can't change it, you can't fix it.

204
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
I've spent a long time designing that.

205
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,640
Here, this is what you like to eat in front of the school.

206
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
With lots of chili salt.

207
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,650
And...

208
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,650
What?

209
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,380
You're too lazy to walk after school, right?

210
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,220
Of course.

211
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
There's a Tuk-tuk for you.

212
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,420
And this is the cat from your shirt that we bought together at Siam.

213
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,470
And a cap, also from that day.

214
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,260
If you're bored, there's a rollerblade.

215
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,450
You suck at rollerblading.

216
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,450
I'll go practice.

217
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,480
And this is the highlight. Tom-Leng.

218
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,070
That's not a mess-up, is it?

219
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,260
That's a mess-up for sure.

220
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,260
Lots of chilis, you like to eat them, don't you?

221
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,870
What's this one?

222
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,960
This is Onglee.

223
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,120
This is like Onglee selling Tom Leng.

224
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,530
Damn it.

225
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,480
At least, we have Onglee.

226
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
That's terrible.

227
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,530
You know what other ones stand for.

228
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:27,830
So that's all I know about you.

229
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,940
But I want to get to know you more. Can I?

230
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,180
Yeah.

231
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,460
You still got toenails.

232
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,460
That's reserved for Wichianmas.

233
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,310
Go ahead, Wichianmas.

234
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,750
Take this!

235
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,750
Okay, okay, I'll design it first.

236
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,740
Toenails design?

237
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,740
Yeah.

238
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,470
You don't have one yet?

239
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,470
No.

240
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,640
Alright, alright.

241
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Period.

242
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,630
Your pants look cool.

243
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,630
Your hand is pretty naughty.

244
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Yours too.

245
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,290
Listen, being on my channel...

246
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,180
you can't rely on video filters.

247
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,180
You gotta be responsible for your own face.

248
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,540
And what's with the ASMR?

249
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,150
Hey!

250
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,670
How many times have I said that?

251
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,910
How many times have I said that?

252
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:53,100
There, you can't get this kind of treatment at any clinics.

253
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,100
Right.

254
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,780
Have you ever hooked up with Fou4Mod?

255
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,070
That's nuts. I still get nervous hitting on him.

256
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,570
Never.

257
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
Are you upset?

258
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,630
Nope.

259
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,830
That's a lie.

260
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,340
Well, me too.

261
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,990
Are you upset?

262
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,810
Nope.

263
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,340
Have you ever wanted to try it?

264
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,060
Yeah.

265
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,300
With whom?

266
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,310
No one.

267
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,030
Right.

268
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,630
I'm serious.

269
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,080
I want that too.

270
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,560
What are you looking at?

271
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,460
Can I try it with you?

272
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,220
Do you think that's a good idea?

273
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,660
Why?

274
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,670
I have never done it before.

275
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,550
Neither have I.

276
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
Oh.

277
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
So what's it supposed to be like?

278
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,010
Ah, come here.

279
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,370
Do you know how to do it?

280
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,090
Calm down.

281
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,450
It's all about body movements, right?

282
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,290
Like this?

283
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
What?

284
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:04,090
No, that's not it. Here.

285
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,409
Lie down.

286
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,139
And this is...

287
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,139
Is it?

288
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,670
That's not it.

289
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,670
This is hurting my knees.

290
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
Come here.

291
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,199
Get over there.

292
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:34,409
Oh, easy, easy.

293
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,010
Up.

294
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,020
More.

295
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,460
Move.

296
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,760
Do you know how to do it?

297
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
It's like a dog.

298
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
No.

299
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
Lie down.

300
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,360
Hey.

301
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,650
Hey, where are you going?

302
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,780
Baa, seriously...

303
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,220
Again.

304
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,490
What we're doing is like what a couple would do.

305
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,090
Don't you think?

306
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
Oh?

307
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,900
What are you doing?

308
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:34,470
Sorry, I thought we're just close friends.

309
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,350
Seriously...

310
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,950
why haven't you chosen me already?

311
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,850
I told you your face's funny.

312
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,850
Your hair is brown, your eyes are blue, I'm not into that.

313
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
I'm not into a foreigner.

314
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,360
Hello, everyone.

315
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,360
Today, I'm gonna change my look.

316
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,730
This is my new look. Isn't it gorgeous?

317
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,760
I'm ready for the Random Dance.

318
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,190
I'm gonna go take a shower now.

319
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,520
Hello?

320
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,640
Tofay, I'm gonna change my look.

321
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,270
Here is my hair.

322
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,120
It's all black now.

323
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,390
And my eyes are black now too.
How did I do it? I'm wearing contacts.

324
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,320
Well, there's the Random Dance tomorrow at Siam.

325
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,330
So I'll see you all there.

326
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,050
And here is tomorrow's look.

327
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:13,050
I'm more Thai now, I hope you all like it.

328
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,350
Hey, I'll be right back.

329
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,350
Alright.

330
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,480
Here. Please separate the soup and meat for me, Auntie.

331
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,480
Yes.

Oh, okay.

336
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
Yeah, I'm done for today.

337
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:29,770
I'm home.

338
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,580
I'm gonna go take a shower first.

Shit, I forgot one move.

343
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,290
You know, I onced liked you.

344
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,130
Take it.

That's fab.

349

Let's go.

350
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,420
Where?

351
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,980
Hey, I saw you again. You're so into dancing.

352
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,940
Of course, I've been practicing it for months.

353
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,040
Hey, where is Baa?

354
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,040
He was walking with you earlier, wasn't he?

355
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,560
So you're not gonna dance?

356
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,430
As if you care.

357
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,080
I texted you and you didn't reply...

358
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,080
You told me you'd go take a shower...
so you've been showering the whole week.

359
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,920
If you don't want to know me anymore, just leave.

360

Let's go.

361

Are you going? C'mon.

362

Hey, hey!

363
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,140
I'm sorry.

364
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,070
What the hell do you want from me?

365
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:53,030
Can I ask for someone who is willing to get serious with me?

366
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,480
You want out, I've handled that for you.

367
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,730
I didn't mean it.

368
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:02,340
Can we go back to the way it was?

369
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,340
What way?

370
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,580
Which way?

371
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,040
Like, you don't need me but having me around is good enough, right?

00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,130
No, that's not it.

373
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,380
So, what's it gonna be?

374
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,380
Friends, a couple, or two people in the talking stage?

375
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,050
Can you answer that?

376
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:35,660
You know...

377
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:39,660
A million likes don't matter to me anymore.

378
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,420
Just one like from you makes me happy.

379
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,960
But if you're not gonna give me a like anymore.

380
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,960
You can unfollow me.

381
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:13,170
So you're not gonna say anything?

382
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,560
Stop keeping me on the hook!

383
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,990
Stop it!

384
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:46,990
It's driving me crazy.

385
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,760
I'm glad I got to see you.

386
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,680
What's wrong?

387
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:28,810
That time when you said I was keeping you on the hook...

388
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:38,060
I really did keep you a hook, right?

389
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,980
I seriously don't know what I'd done to you.

390
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,750
If it's a yes, I'm really sorry.

391
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,990
Hey, we need to clear things up.

392
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,340
What?

393
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:52,070
You've chosen Fou4Mod, haven't you?

394
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:56,730
So?

395
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,740
Please welcome PROXIE!

396
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,970
Can you be clear about that?

397
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,970
So what's it gonna be?

398
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Hey, where have you been?

399
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,400
What's it gonna be with Bua?
Do you like him or not? You should tell him.

400
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,520
He's hurt, you know.

401
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,600
Huh?

402
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:30,610
Why didn't you tell me that you liked him?

403
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:41,730
I don't want to like him.

404
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:46,350
I care about you. You're my friend.

405
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,760
If you don't like him, how could I like him?

406
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:29,110
Hey, Baa, think straight...

407
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:37,790
You're my friend.

408
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,840
I've been sitting right next to you in school.

409
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:51,470
If you like someone, I'm gonna like him too.

410
00:59:56,270 --> 01:00:00,280
All you gotta do is just tell me...

411
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:04,650
I'm your friend.

412
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:09,820
I feel guilty for everyone.

413
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:17,290
It's okay, it's okay.

414
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,650
It's alright.

415
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,870
Can you come out and talk?

416
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:50,870
I'm in front of your house.

417
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,230
Please talk to me.

418
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:13,550
Hey.

419
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:43,220
BAABIN liked your video.

420
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:45,810
Hello, everyone.

421
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:48,090
Today, I'm gonna change my look.

422
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:51,540
Here is my hair. It's all black now.

423
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,710
And my eyes are black now too.
How did I do it? I'm wearing contacts.

424
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,710
Well, there's the Random Dance tomorrow at Siam.

425
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,640
Are you trying to get on my last nerve?

426
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,640
I'm sorry.

427
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,010
For what?

428
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,270
Calm down, listen to me.

429
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:23,950
From now on, no matter what you post on Tiktok...

430
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,100
I'll give you a like.

431
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,800
Please be my partner.

432
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:51,380
But if you don't want me anymore, you can just tell me.

433
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,100
You can scold me but not too harsh...

434
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:19,630
Say that again.

435
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:24,770
Again.

436
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,300
Why?

437
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:31,530
I'm gonna record it.

438
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,700
Again, what did you say?

439
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,980
Please be my partner.

440
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,900
Onglee, can I take a photo with you?

441
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:13,430
Who took a photo of you and Onglee?

442
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:18,180
Well, I don't like to take selfies.

443
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,180
Are you mad at me or something?

444
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,500
You do know that I like you, right?

445
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:51,630
I've always wanted to be your partner.

446
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,410
Since PROXIE's song, "Kon Mai Kui".

447
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:03,050
Hey, PROXIE is about to have a big concert.

448
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:12,780
It's been two years. You and me are still like this.

449
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:31,660
And you know, when I called you that day and you didn't answer...

450
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:37,430
I thought you're with someone else.

451
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:38,550
But actually, you're not.

452
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:42,550
There's nothing but I got paranoid.

453
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,750
I can't take this anymore.

454
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:52,670
I've been hurt so much that I get too paranoid.

455
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:02,630
Please be my partner.

456
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:22,650
Why are you doing this now?

457
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:26,620
If you don't trust me anymore, I get it.

458
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:31,390
We can still meet every month and I'll do your nails.

459
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:25,170
Fou4Mod.

460
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,520
Yeah?

461
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,420
I'll go get my nails done with Wichianmas.

462
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:34,899
Okay.

463
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:39,710
Bua wants to have his nails done, are you okay with that?

464
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:49,830
Go ahead, Bua.

465
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:52,470
You're a Gelboy too.

466
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,050
Then we're gonna get going.

467
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:01,050
Yeah.

468
01:09:01,609 --> 01:09:02,090
See you.

469
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:03,090
See ya.

470
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:04,170
Let's go.

471
01:09:05,569 --> 01:09:06,569
See ya.

472
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:39,270
Unblock.

473
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:41,270
Unblock chian.wichianmas?

474
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,400
Unblock.

475
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,350
Mission: Finding a secret color for Fou4Mod!

476
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,000
Still looking for it...

477
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
My sixth one already and still haven't got it.

478
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,010
All I got is RED.

479
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,160
Which RED...

480
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,440
BOOHOO.

481
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,800
What is it with yellow?

482
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:21,850
I'll find it next time.

483
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:24,040
I won't quit until I find it.

484
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,800
This is for you.

485
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,440
Only for you.

486
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:31,310
Is there still hope?

487
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:32,000
Where is the secret one?

488
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,760
Where?

489
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,410
Still haven't got it...

490
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:33,820
Alright...

491
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:34,210
It's a no again.

492
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:34,740
Can't find it.

493
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,300
Missed it again.

494
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:35,820
Three boxes and still haven't got it.

495
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,820
Has anyone got a secret one? Let me know.

496
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,050
This is fab!

497
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,250
It's not painful.

498
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,810
Oh, is this your last nail?

499
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:11,380
Yeah.

500
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:12,380
Right?

501
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:14,600
Done!

502
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,490
Oh, it's done?

503
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:18,440
Oh my gosh!

504
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,570
It's glittery.

505
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,170
Shiny.

506
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:22,940
Glamorous.

507
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:23,460
Glamorous.

508
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,460
Fab.

509
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:31,540
Wichian, may I have the same design as Bua's?

510
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,500
Huh?

511
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,370
So it will be a match.

512
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:39,050
This one?

513
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:42,490
No, the whole ten nails so it will be alike!

514
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:43,800
Alike?

515
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,640
Well, yours and mine.

516
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,210
What?

517
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:45,850
Yeah.

518
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:46,610
Ten nails.

519
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:47,090
Yes.

520
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:47,780
No way.

521
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,510
Seriously.

522
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:49,280
That's crazy!

523
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,470
I'm serious!

524
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:51,470
C'mon.

525
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:03,950
I got it on my first try.

526
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:06,150
Really?

527
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,150
I'd been trying so hard. I bet the nail salon is so rich now.

528
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,710
Yeah, I saw that.

529
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:14,190
Hey.

530
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:20,040
Do you think we'll still have our nails done when we become adults?

531
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,770
I think...from time to time.

532
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:34,930
There might be a day that I'm too lazy to do nails for you...

533
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:38,930
or I might be too busy that I don't text you back...

534
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:42,940
but I will let you know.

535
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,600
"There's really a fulfilled love."

536
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,580
Do you want to do the same design as mine?
