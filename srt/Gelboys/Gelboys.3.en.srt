1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Three. Two. One. Go!

2
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,160
Do your best.

3
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,319
That was awesome.

4
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,600
Go take a rest.

5
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
You did great. Let's take a look.

6
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,840
You got all the moves right.

7
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
You're gonna make me the only one who did the wrong moves, huh?

8
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
Thank you.

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
Take a seat.

10
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Can I see the draft first?

11
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,000
Was it nice?

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,759
It was very good. You're very good.

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,759
Don't exaggerate!

14
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,759
I didn't. Are you hot?

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Yes.

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,840
You're really good. It's been only three days.

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Yeah, the practice took only three days.

18
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Hello.

19
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Hi, Bua.

20
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,840
What are you doing?

21
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Lying around.

22
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,200
Do you remember that singer from Siam?

23
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,600
Yes, what's up?

24
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,120
Well, he and I created a playlist together, right?

25
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,440
And from that day that we had our nails done together until now,

26
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,640
he still hasn't stopped adding songs to the playlist.

27
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,720
I think he's being serious with me.

28
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,600
Well, I think he's just an ordinary type.

29
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,440
Speaking of the playlist, have you seen the one Moo and I created together?

30
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,200
Have you seen it? Every song he added was about kissing.

31
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,120
Man, I'm scared.

32
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,240
Do you think I'll be taken?

33
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,720
I'm scared he's gonna ask me out.

34
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,520
And if he does, what should I do?

35
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
Do you think I should say yes?

36
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,280
Or do you think I should say let's keep talking.

37
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,920
And you know what, the other day, he came to surprise me in front of the school...

38
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,040
with a bunch of roses.

39
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,840
I was shocked and my friends were looking, right?

40
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,000
And I just didn't know what to do.

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,840
And he invited me to...you know...to karaoke.

42
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,840
And you know, it's really dark, right? And every song he sang...

43
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,240
was something like, "I love you".

44
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,280
"Tonight, I'm going to be with you, how many times do you want?..."

45
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,520
Think about it, it's very creepy.

46
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,440
And you know, I didn't know what to do, right?

47
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,040
And so I thought...do you think I should...

48
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,320
So what's with you and Wichianmas?

49
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
I saw that you went to have your nails done together after the concert.

50
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Wow, you're smiling. Tell me!

51
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
No!

52
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
You're so annoying!

53
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,880
You wanna know?

54
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Yes, what's going on?

55
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Alright, alright, I'll tell you.

56
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Well, he and I made a deal that we're not gonna have a status right now.

57
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Well, does that mean he's keeping you on a hook?

58
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Assface.

59
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,120
Well, no, there's still no definition to what we both are yet.

60
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,080
It's like a very new kind of situationship.

61
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,840
So we stick to what we are for now.

62
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
I'm a trendsetter, you get it?

63
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Something like that...

64
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Be careful you might get hurt.

65
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Assface.

66
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
I'm too lazy now.

67
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
See ya, bye.

68
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Your quail egg dumplings aren't crispy anymore.

69
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,560
Why are you so late?

70
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,280
Well, my class created a content, santas giving away gifts.
That's why I'm so late.

71
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,320
I saw ten santas earlier.

72
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Alright, c'mon.

73
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Merry Christmas, one bag of dumplings for you.

74
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,640
Are you tying in the dumplings?

75
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,560
There's no "Thank you."

76
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,280
Well, thank you very much.

77
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,280
I'm kidding.
Give some to me, I'm hungry.

78
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,920
Something like this.

79
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, I always thought you looked like a deer.

80
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,600
But I thought..ehh, are you missing some antlers here?
Now, you're a deer.

81
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,360
Thank you.

82
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Don't break it, I pre-ordered it and waited for so long.

83
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,720
Here, change. The old one is crying.

84
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,080
What old one?

85
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
I don't use something old.

86
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Nicely done.

87
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Thank you.

88
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,080
Let me see, your nails are coming off really bad.

89
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Get them done, please.

90
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Well, I already booked two seats with Moo.
He's waiting over there.

91
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,600
Oh.

92
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Well, he's been waiting.
Thank you so much for the phone case.

93
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Bye-bye.

94
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,280
I'll take this one.

95
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,240
And this one, and that one.

96
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Please make it hot.

97
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Bua, something to drink?

98
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,520
Do you want anything else?

99
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,080
I'll have one chicken.

100
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,640
One chicken, please.

101
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,400
No, I'm eating watermelon!

102
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,920
You want some pineapple?

103
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,760
No, you know I don't eat pineapple.
I'm gonna eat watermelon!

104
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Then, nothing for you, period!

105
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Damn, I'm so sick of you guys.

106
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,520
Auntie Noy, one mango, please.

107
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,000
Lots of mango, LOTS and LOTS!

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What are you eating, Pailin?

109
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,720
Pailin likes to eat pineapple.

110
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh.

111
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,600
And Pailin likes to eat bananas too.

112
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,560
Because when I was abroad, there's only one kind of banana.

113
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
So?

114
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,240
I love rambutens!

115
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,920
What's the matter with you?

116
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,440
I'm just mimicking a beauty pageant contestant.

117
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,240
That was silly.

118
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,120
What?

119
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
You're so annoying.

120
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,560
I'm outta here!

121
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,400
I'm off too.

122
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,680
Me too.

123
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,680
I'm outta here, Pailin, Pailin!

124
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
Want some?

125
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Hey, how about this?
Who gets to Siam first wins!

126
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,400
Don't challenge me, I'm a runner.

127
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,600
On a count of three. One. Two. Three...

128
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Hey, you cheated!

129
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Hey, Mariah Carey is here to collect her money.

130
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Shoot a Story? Let's go.

131
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
On a chorus, okay?

132
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Go!

133
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,680
Let's see, how many clips are there?

134
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,680
Well, this one.

135
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,600
Here.

136
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Could you Airdrop the one with Mariah to me?

137
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Of course.

138
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Wow, that's cute.

139
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,880
So, are you free on Saturday?

140
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Let's go get a manicure.

141
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,120
I have plans with my parents.

142
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Oooooh.

143
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But seriously, I'm still free on Sunday.

144
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
I don't have to go be glamourous anywhere...

145
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,840
If you wanna go, DM me.

146
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Okay.

147
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Bye.

148
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Wipe my face for me, would you?

149
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Moo, can I have your hand?

150
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,920
I really like this one person.

151
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,960
And they added me to their Close Friends on Instagram.

152
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,400
But today, they posted a Story holding hands with someone else.

153
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:26,400
And they didn't remove me from their Close Friends.

154
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:34,560
What do they actually think of me?

155
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Them posting a photo holding hands with someone in their Close Friends...

156
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,320
might indicate a special relationship they have with that person.

157
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,280
However, the fact that they still keep you in their Close Friends...

158
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,600
might mean they see you as an important person in their life.

159
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,560
And want to share personal moments with you...

160
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:56,560
as a close friend or someone they trust.

161
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,440
Next station, Pu Chao.

162
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Pu Chao.

163
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,240
Attention please, this train terminates at this station.

164
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,240
All remaining passengers please exit the train. Thank you.

165
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Excuse me.

166
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Excuse me.

167
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Excuse me. This is the termainal station.

168
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Oh, thank you.

169
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,040
Thank you very much.

170
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Thank you.

171
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,760
Hi.

172
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,480
What's up, kiddo?

173
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,600
Wow, savvy trader, have you spent all of your pension traveling?

174
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,360
No, it won't be gone easily.

175
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,920
Why don't you come here when you're on a school break?

176
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,240
I'll buy you a first class ticket here, what'd you say?

177
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,040
No, Thailand is more pretty.

178
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,080
Mom wants to talk to you.

179
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,080
Chian, the weather in Toronto is really nice.

180
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,560
That's good.

181
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,640
See? Isn't it pretty?

182
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,880
Dad is thinking about requesting for a visa to extend our stay.

183
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,520
Oh?

184
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,920
I'm jealous, I'm gonna get off now to eat.

185
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,480
If you're tired of traveling, pay a visit, I'll do your nails.

186
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Of course, I'd love for you to do my nails.

187
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,480
I've been traveling a lot so I haven't had my nails done at all.

188
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,520
I miss you, son. Bye-bye.

189
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,160
Take care.

190
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
You too.

191
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,400
Chian.

192
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
You've already got a spot at Architecture.
Why are you here with us at this time?

193
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Guys.

194
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
I'm done with Bua.

195
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
I don't wanna talk about this.

196
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
I'm sick of being a concerned friend.

197
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,920
What if he gets back to you tomorrow, what would you do?

198
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,640
You would definitely go back to him.

199
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,640
I'll say it because you won't say it...

200
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,120
He's keeping you on the hook.
He doesn't love you.

201
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,920
He just likes it that you love him.

202
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,960
So, hello?

203
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
I know that.

204
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
That's why I said I was done.

205
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I'm not gonna stuck in a loop, assfaces.

206
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,920
Alright, I'm gonna find a partner, how about that?

207
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
If you can, then, it's good for you.

208
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
So you won't be an ass.

209
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,040
You keep Airdropping to other people and Bua isn't even jealous at all.

210
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
I'm not that much of an ass.

211
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,400
Okay, I talk to other people but it's only one person here.

212
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,400
And I told him that we're just gonna stay this way for now.

213
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
And he's okay with that.

214
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,400
What if Fou4Mod happens to like you for real, what will you do?

215
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,920
I don't know.

216
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
You're stupid.

217
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Are we still having our nails done this Sunday? Lol.

218
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,280
Already booked two seats.

219
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
We're sitting together. 1 p.m.

220
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,080
Dress fashionably! We're gonna be acting cool around Siam this Sunday.

221
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,360
What? Lol.

222
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Don't make too big of a scene.

223
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,120
Yes.

224
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
Here's a package for you.

225
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Thank you very much.

226
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
You're so freakin' late.

227
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,440
Wow, you're really serious about the acting cool part.

228
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,920
No, this is my regular outfit.
I dress this way at home too.

229
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
Okay.

230
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,720
What is it? What's wrong?

231
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,520
Don't.

232
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,160
Don't, what?

233
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,040
I'm not confident.

234
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,200
What's there to not be confident about? Let me see.

235
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,480
Let's go shopping!

236
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,120
What? Wait, let me see.

237
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,160
Nooooooooo!

238
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,480
Let's go shopping!

239
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,560
Ooh, there are some really cute beads.
Wanna put them on your head?

240
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,040
C'mon. Let's go shopping!
Let's try on some shirt.

241
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,600
No, let's take a look around here first.

242
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,760
I want some stickers.

243
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Let me take a look, try on a shirt.

244
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,200
No, don't force me!

245
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,560
I'd like to see what's underneath Chian's shirt!

246
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Take it easy.

247
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,000
Okay, there's nothing to try on.

248
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,840
Of course, there is.

249
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
That was fast.

250
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,280
Can I put it there?

251
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
Of course.

252
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Shall I try it on?

253
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
Yeah.

254
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Wow.

255
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
That's quite something.

256
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,240
Is it okay?

257
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,200
What? It's okay, it's more than okay.

258
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,560
Really?

259
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,760
Yes.

260
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,320
It's hot.

261
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,320
But my belly button is not. It's an outie one.

262
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Well, that's hot.

263
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
Really.

264
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Let me see yours.

265
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,360
Well, well, you got a really nice belly button.

266
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,760
Well, who am I? I'm the trendsetter.

267
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,680
THE TRENDSETTER...why would you care?

268
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,680
Well, if it's not hot enough and...

269
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,920
you don't wanna walk with me...then it's kinda sad.

270
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,560
C'mon, whatever you wear...I'd walk with you anyway.

271
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
You could even be in a pair of pyjamas.

272
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,520
I'd still walk with you even if you wore only an underwear.

273
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,200
You can't take back your words...

274
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,960
Well, are you going to do that?

275
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
No.

276
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,360
Okay.

277
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,760
Have you ever heard of a phrase...

278
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,760
"I don't care, Boston. I don't care, USA. I only just care about my life."?

279
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,880
What? Are you tired already?

280
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,840
"There's no fulfilled love. Fulfilled love is just a noun."

281
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,680
Grace, you're molding it very nicely...I can't do that myself.

282
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Wait, you know how to do nails?

283
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Wait, when you said, "In case you'd like to have your nails done..."

284
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,480
you meant, you, yourself, are doing nails for them?

285
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880
That's sneaky.

286
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,360
Would you do them for me?

287
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
Will you?

288
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
I can only do silly designs.

289
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,720
I'm alright with that...

290
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,560
but will you be alright with that?

291
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,040
Do you want to do this?

292
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
Would you wanna do this big mission?

293
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
Yeah.

294
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Handshake.

295
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Still got 24 seconds to go.

296
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,960
Then give me your arm, it's a deal, okay?

297
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,240
What's this design?

298
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,520
The fruit in front of the school.

299
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
Creative.

300
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,320
There's also a squid. Yummy?

301
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,240
Yummy.

302
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,040
Ooh, that's a real yum there.

303
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
Wait, take a pic first.

304
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Excuse me, could you please take a pic for us?
Thank you.

305
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,040
C'mon, a picture.

306
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
Okay.

307
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Alright, keep it going.

308
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,960
Come take pictures for me often, okay?

309
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
Huh?

310
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,560
I don't like taking selfies.

311
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Why not?

312
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,360
It's like...

313
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,360
The front camera cannot capture my handsomeness.

314
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,040
Let me know when you wanna have your pics taken.

315
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
I'll be on a standby for you.

316
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Okay?

317
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
You promise.

318
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Yes.

319
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Here.

320
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Oh, damn, that's freakin' sad!

321
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,360
What?

322
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,360
I forgot to bring a power bank.

323
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,360
I'm running out of battery, shit.

324
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,680
This will take a while.

325
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
Do you wanna go take a walk first?
Are you bored?

326
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,680
No, I'll keep you company.

327
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Are you sure?

328
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm sure.

329
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
Just let it charge.

330
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
That's cute.

331
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
What?

332
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,280
Are you gonna buy the same design?

333
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
Why?

334
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Your partner will get jealous.

335
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
You mean Bua?

336
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,200
Seriously...

337
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
I don't even know what we are right now.

338
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
But I backed off.

339
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
It's a waste of time.

340
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
I should spend this time to find a partner.

341
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,360
So can I buy this?

342
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,120
What?

343
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,840
This one.

344
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
I don't know.

345
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,360
No?

346
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,720
I don't know!

347
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,520
It's okay to have the same design.

348
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,120
It's Sunday. I don't wanna go home yet.
Where are you going next?

349
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Nowhere.

350
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,000
Where do you wanna go?

351
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Where do you live again?

352
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
Sena Nikhom.

353
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,480
Let's take a tour there.

354
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,280
Huh? Don't you have anything else to do?

355
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
I'm free.

356
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
It's far.

357
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
C'mon.

358
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Do you have a monthly ticket?

359
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
What monthly ticket?

360
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Well, a monthly ticket...
last time, I went to your house, it costed only 10 more Baht.

361
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,320
Hello, I'd like a monthly ticket, please.

362
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,920
I'll pay via QR.

363
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,200
Turn on your Airdrop.

364
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
Now?

365
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,920
Done?

366
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,920
Yeah, what is it?

367
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,720
I'll post this.

368
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,320
I'll make a cool outfit change transition video for you.

369
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,200
Ready?

370
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,200
Yeah.

371
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,760
Okay.

372
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,600
LeBron James.

373
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,280
Are we good?

374
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:29,920
Okay, that's a little far. Come back.

375
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,080
Step back a bit.

376
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,720
Step back.

377
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,720
Alright, one, two, three...

378
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,960
Do I need to jump?

379
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,480
Yeah.

380
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,480
One, two, three, jump!

381
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,440
A little right...

382
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,720
Okay, one more time, smile a bit.

383
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,280
One, two, three.

384
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,120
One more, just in case.

385
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,120
C'mon.

386
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,680
Ready?

387
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,680
Go ahead.

388
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,760
Okay.

389
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,240
I'll post this on a regular Story.

390
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,440
Can I tag you?

391
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,600
Yeah.

392
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,640
Okay.

393
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,640
Let me think of a caption first.

394
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,160
Bua : Where are you?

395
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,160
Bua : What are you doing? Aren't we supposed to be in a call?

396
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,200
I wanna have my nails done @chian.wichianmas

397
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,400
Hey.

398
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Hey!

399
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,640
Here we go with the caption.

400
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:02,960
A siamese cat (Chian), a pen, a fan, 4 ants (Fou4Mod), a mic?
(Will Chian be Fou4Mod's partner?)

401
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,960
Let make this big so our friends will ship us.

402
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,880
Maybe not.

403
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,480
People will misunderstand it and won't have the guts to get close to you.

404
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,560
That's harsh.

405
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,320
Alright, I'll post it later.
I can't think of a caption now.

406
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,880
Alright.

407
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,880
Well, I'm heading home. It's late.

408
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,000
See ya.

409
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
See you.

410
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Wait, I'll walk you out.

411
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,120
It's okay, I know the way out.

412
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,040
Right, at my school, a doggie came to shit at a flagpole in the morning.

413
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,400
What?

414
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,520
Listen, you looked more like a duck more earlier.

415
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,520
No! Don't!

416
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,960
Isn't that song too boring?

417
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,960
No.

418
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,280
Why don't you play this song?
I just added it yesterday.

419
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,920
TangBadVoice just released a new song.

420
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,120
I'm gonna listen to 4EVE.

421
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,400
Up to you.

422
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,040
Right, yesterday I found one clothing store.

423
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,200
It looks like a store that's made for WICHIANMAS.

424
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,200
I was stunned and I ordered 2 items for you.

425
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,960
Hey, what's my shirt size?

426
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,480
You wear a large.

427
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,480
If it's an oversized shirt, you wear a medium. Why?

428
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,520
Nothing.

429
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,600
You found another store? I can take a look for you.

430
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,640
It's alright.

431
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,640
Send me the store link!

432
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,120
I just forgot my size.

433
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,520
Hey, let me see your nails.

434
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,960
Do I look like shit?

435
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,200
Okay.

436
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,320
Let me see.

437
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,560
No.

438
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
It's for quality control.

439
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,520
No!

440
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,960
What? Chian!

441
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,960
Just wait and see.

442
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,480
Ass.

443
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,080
Moo.

444
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,480
Have you seen a video of a monkey
falling of a tree and picked up an apple from the car?

445
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,320
It's really funny. Take a look.
I've already sent it.

446
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,840
Pause your game and take a look.

447
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,600
See ya. Bye. See ya.
