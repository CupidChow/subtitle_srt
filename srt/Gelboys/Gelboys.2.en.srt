1
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,380
Oh wow, yours is THE MOST...

2
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,670
This with this is THE MOST...

3
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,539
Here, this matches with this, it's THE MOST...

4
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,750
THE MOST...what?

5
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,750
- THE MOST...my ass,
- Assface!

6
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,500
What? Asshole, you want a fight?

7
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,789
Wait, I'm your friend.

8
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:36,330
I am your friend.

9
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,710
Oh, okay, my dear friend.

10
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,630
But this one of mine looks like yours.

11
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,630
Which one? This looks like this.

12
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,630
Hold on.

13
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,830
Join me, let's throw in some songs.

14
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,830
So we can listen to them while getting nails done.

15
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:16,000
"There's no fulfilled love. Fulfilled love is just a noun."

16
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,540
Greetings, all, we're back and we're KC gift shop!

17
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,250
If you're Mr. Daddy then I am Mrs. Mommy.

18
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,920
Today, we have special stuff just for you.

19
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,040
If we're both here, you know there's a friendly promotion for sure.

20
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,830
Fayefangkaew.

21
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,750
Here's the thing, my friend asked me...

22
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:25,210
there's a guy inviting him to join a playlist on Spotify,
what could it possibly mean?

23
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,830
That means he's flirting. You know, those songs
that only both of them can listen to.

24
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,330
He's giving him a feeling of being someone special
but in the end, he will say no.

25
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,250
I just got played recently too, I'll show you.

26
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,670
This is Men.
He's created a playlist for me to join only with him.

27
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,420
And when you add more songs, the duration will be longer.

28
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,670
So you can extend your moment together.

29
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,670
But you know what, he created playlists with every cheerleader.

30
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,920
Damn, he loves keeping people on the hook.

31
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,380
But come to think of it, there're billions of people in the world...

32
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,380
and he chose to keep me on the hook.

33
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,290
How's that? He's a cutie.

34
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,790
What? What am I falling for?

35
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,330
Falling for the wrong one.

36
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,830
You're silly letting someone do that to you.

37
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,040
This is unisex.

38
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,210
Wow, Mr. Daddy.

39
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,460
How's that, Mrs. Mommy?

40
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,880
It's gorgeous.

41
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,540
There's no right, no wrong. Guys can wear it too.

42
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,540
"There's no fulfilled love. Fulfilled love is just a noun."
"Heart K-mistry but if you got none then it's OK."

43
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,920
"Heart K-mistry but if you got none then it's OK." (1 save)

44
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,540
If he's keeping him on the hook,
then let's keep him on the hook as well!

45
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,540
Right!

46
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,540
You're fabulous! You're...

47
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,290
glamourous.

48
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,040
Period.

49
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Yes, period.

50
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,210
C'mon!

51
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,210
Yeah!

52
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,210
Internet is ready!

53
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,790
Internet, ready!

54
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,540
This song will reach the top.

55
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,960
That's right!

56
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,130
C'mon, I'm ready to boost the views!

57
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,130
Right!

58
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,540
Hey, can you join my playlist?

59
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,630
C'mon, please, educate me with Blankpink songs!

60
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,290
What?

61
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,540
Yeah, what have you got? Throw them in! C'mon.

62
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,540
Alright, you, newbie, go for it!

63
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,540
Hurry!

64
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,330
"ROSÉ's hair becoming black but my heart ain't black."

65
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,960
Whoa, your playlist name...

66
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,080
Well, I'm a Blink.

67
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,790
Alright, you, newbie, go for it!

68
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,790
Okay, give me all you got!

69
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,790
Okie, on it.

70
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,290
ALL YOU GOT!

71
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,290
I got this!

72
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Guys, last 10 seconds.

73
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,250
Ten.

74
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,000
Nine.

75
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,880
Eight.

76
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,750
Seven.

77
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,500
Six.

78
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Five.

79
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,170
Four.

80
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,170
Three.

81
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:32,920
Two.

82
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
One.

83
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,630
Whoa, shit!

84
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,540
Fuck!

85
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,790
What the hell?

86
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,790
That was fucking brutal.

87
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,710
Baa! Baa!

88
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,460
Yeah?

89
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,960
I gotta pee, come with me.

90
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Okay.

91
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,710
Hurry!

92
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,460
Hey, hold on.

93
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,460
C'mon, I need to take a piss.

94
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,960
Here I come!

95
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,210
How'd you make a move?

96
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,960
The same style, my style.

97
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,460
Are you gona pee here or there?

98
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,460
Why don't you go to this restroom?

99
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,710
Holy shit!

100
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,920
My Airpods are all scratched.

101
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,040
Go ahead, toss in more songs to the playlist.

102
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,330
Blackpink's?

103
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,000
Add more...c'mon!

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, okay!

105
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,830
Hey, you're not gonna join my playlist? Lol.

106
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,630
Still thinking of the songs...

107
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,040
Maybe when...

108
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,040
What songs should I add?

109
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:27,750
Coach, would you reply to me? Lol.

110
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,250
Guys, should we go get our nails done?

111
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,500
So we will be dazzle-veiled.

112
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,250
So?

113
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,000
Dazzle-veiled, much?

114
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,540
Dazzling, dazzling, dazzling...

115
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,290
Oh, you guys did them already?

116
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,540
Take a look, isn't it neat?

117
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,540
Yeah, but...

118
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,830
Do you think this looks good?

119
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,500
Can this stick to it? Take a look.

120
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Of course.

121
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
What's up, Gelboy?

122
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
What are you doing here?

123
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
When are you guys playing?

124
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,830
Next Friday, Siam.

125
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,580
Oh.

126
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,580
Why, are you coming?

127
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,250
Are you inviting? If you are, then, I'm going.

128
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
You're being sneaky.

129
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Would you wanna come?

130
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,500
If you would, I'll invite you.

131
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Of course.

132
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,830
Then I'm inviting. 5 p.m., no rain check.

133
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,250
Of course.

134
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,580
Deal.

135
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Deal.

136
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,250
It says that you've read my messages but you didn't reply to me.

137
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,250
Oh, shit, I forgot, I was reading it while taking a shower. Sorry.

138
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Come on, join the playlist.

139
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,960
So you won't get bored while having your nails done.

140
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,960
Musicians, they know lots of songs, right?

141
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
Got it.

142
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,460
When my nails get messy, I'll join the playlist.

143
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,710
Alright.

144
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
Okay.

145
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Deal.

146
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,250
I'm off.

147
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,250
See ya, Gelboy.

148
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,540
G-E-L-B-O-Y...

149
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,290
Gelboy, Gelboy!

150
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,290
That was something, Coach.

151
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
See ya, Gelboy.

152
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,040
That's normal, shitheads.

153
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,790
That was something alright, Coach.

154
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,790
You're too handsome.

155
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,630
Hey, can you hold this for me?

156
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,130
Where are you going?

157
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,460
To take a piss.

158
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,630
I'll be right up. Need to pee first.

159
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,380
See you upstairs.

160
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,380
Alright.

161
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,670
"Heart K-mistry but if you got none then it's OK."

162
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,250
Hurry up.

163
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,250
They're not here yet. People aren't even standing up.

164
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
The hall is almost empty.

165
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Let me check about their whereabouts.

166
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,460
IG...IG...

167
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,130
Hey!

168
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,630
What?

169
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,630
Nothing, I thought they're here.

170
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,080
Let's go, I don't think they're here.

171
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,000
C'mon.

172
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,750
And you're not staying?

173
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,750
Let's get going.

174
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:29,500
Shit, shit, I need to shit. You go ahead.

175
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Need me to go with you?

176
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,250
It's alright. Go ahead.

177
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,170
See you upstairs then.

178
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,170
Alright.

179
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,330
4EVE! 4EVE!

180
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,330
Taaoem! Taaoem! A hand, please.

181
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Taaoem! A hand...

182
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:11,330
Taaoem! Taaoem! Taaoem! Taaoem!

183
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:19,330
Taaoemmm...

184
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,540
Why are you adding so many songs?
You got time to listen to all of them?

185
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,540
Just do it, in case we need to make a show.

186
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,540
What? You got a problem?

187
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,540
Oh, no.

188
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,040
Don't pull it too hard.

189
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,290
Just keep walking. It won't fall off.

190
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,290
Just don't pull it too hard!

191
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,790
50 people are in line.
Do you still want to wait?

192
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,790
I can wait. If you're hungry, smell the pork belly first.

193
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:48,250
I've chosen the songs.
If you're gonna get your nails done, let me know, I'll join.

194
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,330
Can I have the waiting ticket?

195
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,210
Hey, can you take a photo of me with this ticket?

196
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:41,210
I don't like to take selfies. My face doesn't look cool.

197
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,040
I'll take burst shots, okay?

198
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Alright.

199
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,250
Ready?

200
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,080
One. Two. Three. Go!

201
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,500
Excuse me.

202
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Oh, okay.

203
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,750
Send.

204
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Picture.

205
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,210
Unsend.

206
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,540
Hey, hurry up, we got it.

207
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,790
Get up! I'm starving.

208
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,790
RIght.

209
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,540
I'll get going first, okay?

210
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,380
Hey, shithead, Fou4Mod, are you becoming shorter or what?

211
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,880
You're tall, get behind the line.

212
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Okay, I know that.

213
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,880
Are you alright?

214
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,880
It's nothing.

215
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,500
Hello, guys, and we're back!

216
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,250
You're home, son?

217
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,250
We got some help today from Men.

218
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,000
Please stay tuned.

219
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,500
You can't miss today's promotion.

220
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,420
Mom, Mom!

221
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,830
Who is that?

222
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,080
He's the one on the playlist. We're a couple now.

223
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,540
How could you go out with him? That asshole.

224
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,710
He's not an asshole. He's kinda cute.

225
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,210
Cute?

226
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,210
Mom, don't let her date him. He's a player.

227
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,460
Why don't you give her some credit?

228
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:52,880
That's true.

229
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,130
In the past, she's been put on hold for so long.

230
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,130
That's not it.

231
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:02,130
She'd been crying everyday in front of the mirror.
If the mirror had a life, it would laugh at her.

232
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,290
But I guess you gotta fight it in order to get what you want.

233
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,040
You should have someone too, son. You got this!

234
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,670
Whoa! If I got someone like that, I wouldn't want him.

235
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,670
Damn it, he's a player.

236
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,420
Men, what's the promotion today?

237
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,420
And most importantly...

238
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,420
C'mon, do you not want it or what?

239
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
Thank you.

240
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,380
Guys, let's take a pic of our nails!

241
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,380
C'mon, hurry up. Let's do it!

242
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,380
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

243
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,880
Move!

244
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,380
Why let the short one hold the camera?

245
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:38,920
Hey!

246
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,880
Just kidding.

247
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,130
Here we go!

248
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:41,880
Make yourself look taller!

249
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Show our nails! One, two, three...

250
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,880
Hey, Coach, why are your nails like that?

251
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,540
What?

252
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,830
Whoa, look at that, look at that!

253
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,080
What?

254
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,880
Let them see now!

255
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,580
What is that? That's disgusting.

256
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,170
I wanna save it for later. Why?

257
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,170
Save it for later for what?

258
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Hello! We're "100% Full Battery"

259
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,420
Guys, have you ever been put on hold? Let me hear you!

260
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:28,170
"Lately, you haven't been replying to my messages."

261
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,420
"You used to tell me all day what you've been doing."

262
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,920
"I used to text you that I missed you."

263
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,420
"You would text me back I missed you too, we would talk all day, so sweet, yeah."

264
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,670
"We'd been talking and it was all good. But what's happening now?"

265
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:55,000
"It's been 17 minutes that you tell me to wait but it feels like a year."

266
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,330
"What are you doing now? (That was in the afternoon.)"

267
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,000
"And I wait, wait and wait and then...(It's a good night.)"

268
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,250
"I keep saying "Hi!", but...(you won't answer.)"

269
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,750
"I ask you what you're doing. (You won't tell.)
And you disappear, just like that, don't you love me anymore?"

270
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,500
"Lately, you haven't been replying to my messages."

271
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:16,250
"It's as if I was talking by myself. And I was the only one missing you."

272
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,750
"I need to stop my heart first, I need to be patient."

273
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,500
"I need to be able to control myself."

274
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:29,250
"But I can't resist your cuteness, I wanna love this person."

275
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,750
"Because others won't be able to beat you."

276
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,500
Shit, it's raining.

277
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,500
Take this, fucker.

278
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's raining, it's raining.

279
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,250
"Although I don't like talking but I like listening."

280
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:52,000
"When you text me, I read every single word."

281
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,500
"I might be a little too late but it's not like I don't have feelings."

282
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,750
"I'm afraid you might think I don't deserve you."

283
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,750
"What should we do? (What should we do?)"

284
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,250
"Should we become a couple?"

285
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,000
YES!

286
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,250
"I wanna be next to you, quietly, like this...(till the end)."

287
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,000
"I don't talk much, a guy like me doesn't talk much."

288
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,500
"Even if I don't talk much but all I got is you."

289
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
"If you don't have feelings for me, why are you here?"

290
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,750
"Don't play with my heart like that."

291
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,250
"If you don't have feelings for me, don't look me in the eye."

292
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,750
"You're making me fall for you."

293
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,500
"I don't want to be just a friend of yours."

294
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,250
"Who's your friend? Have you asked me about that yet?"

295
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,130
"I gave you my all but in the end, you saw me as a friend."

296
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,000
"Let me tell you, my heart thinks of you more than that."

297
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
"I don't want to be just a friend of yours."

298
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,750
"Who's your friend? Have you asked me about that yet?"

299
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,500
"I got lots of friends already, you know what, nevermind."

300
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,000
"I'm sorry for caring about you more than just friends do."

301
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,750
That's fab!

302
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,750
So this is gonna be our last song.
I'd like you all to do something.

303
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,000
Right now, we just posted a story on IG.

304
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,250
ONE SONG, please DM.

305
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,750
Whoever wants to sing the song, please send in the song name.

306
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:06,750
Our IG is "Full 100% Battery"

307
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,790
Whose song is THE MOST...we'll ask you to come out and sing with us.

308
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,540
Let me take a look.

309
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,790
Are there lots?

310
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,540
Yeah, quite a lot.

311
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,540
Hey, that didn't take long.

312
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,540
I pick this one.

313
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,290
Which?

314
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,500
You had it in mind already.
There're so many but you chose this one.

315
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
Well, is that a problem?

316
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,750
Well, I guess not, Wichianmas likes all your posts nowadays.

317
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,750
Really?

318
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,000
Guys, I just wanna mess with his head.

319
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,500
Oh?

320
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,250
But stop it right there, I'm okay with you guys flirting...

321
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,250
BUT take a look, can you play that song?
You'll embarrass yourself.

322
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,750
Shithead, he can look at the chords and play it.

323
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,000
I wanna see Wichianmas gets fucked up by my friend.

324
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,250
See?

325
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,250
Up to you.

326
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,000
I can play it. So this is it?

327
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
What are you waiting for?

328
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,000
Okay, we got the song.

329
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,000
The next song we're playing is "Test Me" by 4EVE.

330
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,750
And we'd like to invite the owner of the account named...

331
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:30,750
Chian, Wichianmas here to sing along with us.

332
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Alright, everyone, please welcome him.

333
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,790
Let's talk a bit.
Wichianmas, why did you choose this song?

334
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,250
I wanna know...

335
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,000
I love Taaoem so much.

336
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
My alarm clock is set to play a song by 4EVE as well.

337
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Ooh, I wanna be loved like this too.

338
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,580
Are you shipping us?

339
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:10,290
Let's not waste any more time.
Who's ready for some music?

340
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,790
Are you ready, Wichianmas?

341
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:12,750
Yes, I am.

342
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,750
Okay, let's start!

343
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,540
One. Two. Three.

344
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:27,290
Let me see some sea of lights.

345
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:42,040
"You don't have to be afraid that I'm gonna be like the others."

346
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,540
"Because I'm definitely not like those people."

347
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,790
"You heard that they're good."

348
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,790
"But take a look at me first."

349
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,790
"Reserve me as your favorite."

350
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,040
"Let me be your number one."

351
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,630
"I know that you don't know what you deserve."

352
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,790
"Because in your heart, there's only them inside."

353
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,290
"But if you come to think of it..."

354
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,040
"if you open your heart and get to know me, yeah."

355
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,540
"You'll see the one whom you've been always looking for."

356
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,790
"How much you love them, I love you more."

357
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,040
"I don't know how much but I love your more."

358
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,540
"How much are they willing to give you..."

359
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,040
"I'm going to give you more."

360
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,130
"I'd love to challenge, who's gonna give you more than me?"

361
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,630
"Measure it, I will not lose to anyone."

362
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:56,540
My nails are coming off.

363
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,790
Wanna get them done?

364
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:12,170
Maybe, next time?

365
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:16,170
Yeah, next time.

366
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:21,790
Okay.

367
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,290
Okay.

368
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,540
Hey, I'm off.

369
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,130
Are you gonna go now?

370
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:43,540
See ya!

371
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,790
Where are you going?

372
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,540
Kung will take me to have dessert.

373
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,540
See ya!

374
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,420
See you, see you.

375
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
Bye.

376
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,040
I'm gonna get going too, bye-bye.

377
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
And where are you going?

378
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
Home.

379
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,540
Oh, okay, see you.

380
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,290
Alright, see you, safe travels.

381
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,290
Bye-bye.

382
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,540
Baa, see you!

383
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Hey.

384
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,540
You dropped your Airpods a lot.

385
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,540
Let this keep them company.

386
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,040
Ooh, that's so cute. Thank you.

387
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,790
I'll use it now.

388
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,040
How's that?

389
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,540
It's cool.

390
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,540
Well, if it's with the right one, it's always cool.

391
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:16,790
Right.

392
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
And where are you going?

393
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:35,290
I'm free and thinking about getting my nails done.

394
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:45,290
Mine has came off totally.

395
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
And where are you going?

396
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
I'm free.

397
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,540
You don't have plans with your friends?

398
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,290
You can join the playlist now.

399
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,630
Hello, have a seat.

400
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:59,130
Join the playlist.

401
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,750
"There's no fulfilled love. Fulfilled love is just a noun."

402
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:14,540
"Let's create your playlist."

403
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,540
"Add songs to this playlist."

404
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,830
What's the design that you'd like today?

405
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,580
Anything that will take a bit longer, I'd like to enjoy the music.

406
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,080
Thank you.

407
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,080
Okay, done.

408
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,080
Thank you very much.

409
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,080
Let's head back after this song.

410
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,580
I'm off, Coach.

411
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,580
Alright.

412
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,580
My heart is breaking.

413
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:22,580
Bye-bye.

414
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,580
Bye.

415
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:33,540
Bye, see ya.

416
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,540
Bye.

417
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,290
Shit.

418
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,580
I'm off now, the train will...

419
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:25,330
It's...

420
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,880
"ROSÉ's hair becoming black but my heart ain't black."

421
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:49,130
"There's no fulfilled love. Fulfilled love is just a noun."

422
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:57,920
I don't want to be just friends, can we be something else?

423
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,920
I just wanna talk for fun.

424
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,250
What?

425
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,250
Why did you do that to me then?

426
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,250
I didn't mean to lead you on.

427
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,500
Actually, I like someone.

428
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,250
But he's been keeping me on a hook for a year now.

429
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,540
So I just wanted to find someone to talk to, just for fun.

430
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:14,290
So he might see it.

431
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:25,290
Is it Bua?

432
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,540
Yeah.

433
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:36,790
I'm sorry.

434
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,040
I won't be around you from now on, I'm sorry.

435
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:55,830
Hey, wait, wait, actually, I'm not that into this too.

436
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,080
Like, I'm not that into you.

437
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,830
Really.

438
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,830
We can stay this way, okay.

439
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,920
And if you end up...

440
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,920
with Bua, you can always just tell me.

441
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,880
Or if I find someone new, I'll let you know.

442
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,960
Are you sure about this?

443
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,960
Yes.

444
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:36,960
I'm sure. Okay.

445
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:45,960
Then, we'll be something like this.

446
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,380
Then, I'm off.

447
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:03,920
Wait, I just want to make it clear.

448
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:10,920
Like, something like this...what can we do?

449
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,920
Aside from getting our nails done together.

450
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:18,670
Like, what?

451
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,420
Like...

452
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:28,420
going out for a walk, having meals together...

453
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,170
Can we? After school...something like that.

454
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,670
Of course.

455
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:34,420
So if you're free, I can invite you, right?

456
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,920
Yes, yes.

457
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,960
Like on Saturdays, Sundays...or any days...

458
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:48,710
If we're free...

459
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:06,210
And...can we do something else too?

460
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:16,500
Something else, like what?

461
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:22,250
Like...

462
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Hmm...

463
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:40,000
Can we...?

464
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
If you're okay, then, I'm okay.

465
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:37,080
Wait, I'm not quite sure...

466
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,580
about...?

467
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:47,580
What are we?

468
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:56,580
I don't know...hmm...

469
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:10,330
Let's start without a status first.

470
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,130
Are you okay?

471
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:27,630
Okay, deal.
