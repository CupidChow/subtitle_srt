1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,320
So in the textbook, we saw the word...

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,240
...a little hard to spell..P-H-L-E-G-M, pronounced, phlegm.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,880
Phlegm is a throat gunk.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,480
Have you ever seen cough syrups or an expectorant with flem...something?

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,720
They change PH into F...so it will be easier to understand...
but it's actually the same thing.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,840
So it's phlegm. And aside from that...
there's also a word, mucas...that's the same thing.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,520
For example, I have mucus in my throat but no cough.

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,520
That means you have mucus but you don't cough.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,960
Guy : "I miss you."

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,960
Guy : "Come see me at my place today?"

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,280
Alright, let's continue.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,160
Next...

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,120
So what's between you and him?

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
Huh?

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
You and him?

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
Me?

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
Get up.

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,920
Let's not put a label on it yet, Fou4Mod.

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,920
No, choose one, a friend or a couple?

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,120
Choose!

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,720
"A fouble."

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,120
A fouble, my ass.

23
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,760
No, Mom, Kami's songs are so old!

24
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
C'mon, let's go!

25
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Mom, take your seat!

26
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Mom, change the music, please.
It's too indie and it's too old!

27
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

28
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,200
- Ooh, good job, FayeFangKaew.
- Guys, here we go again, BTS.

29
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,200
What? Mom! If you wanna choose the music
then you have to pay for my Spotify.

30
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,720
Right, right, right!

31
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,040
Mom, speaking of BTS, can I ride it to school by myself now?

32
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,960
My friends already go to school by themselves...

33
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Why don't you wait for a bit more?
How about getting into a uni first?

34
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,159
You see, your school and your sister's are in the same direction...

35
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,960
why would you wanna take a BTS?

36
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,720
Mom, this is too much!

37
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,120
When I was a 6th grader, they built a station in front of our alley.

38
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,480
You said after they'd finished building, you would let me go.

39
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,880
When I was a 7th grader, they let us take the train for free...

40
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,480
You said wait till I became a 10th grader, became a MR. first.

41
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,560
I'm a 10th grader now, are you still not letting me go?

42
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Please, can I go now, my beautiful Mom?

43
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
I'm worried, text me when you get there!

44
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Mom, bye-bye!

45
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Bye-bye, son!

46
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:13,760
Bye-bye!

47
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Bye!

48
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,240
Excuse me.

49
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,120
Hello.

50
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,120
I'd like a student monthly package.

51
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Alright, the package includes 35 rides per month, costing 26 Baht per ride.

52
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Oh, that's nice. I'll take that.

53
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,560
Scan to pay?

54
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,600
Yes, ma'am.

55
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Thank you.

56
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Sena Nikhom.

57
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Next station, Ratchayothin.

58
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Excuse me, could you please take a photo for me?

59
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Thank you.

60
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,560
BTS, here I come!

61
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Sena Nikhom, here!

62
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,480
Fab! On Nut, here!

63
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,080
Phra Khanong, here!

64
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,680
Wongwian Yai, here!

65
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
I'm taking Grab but I'm here!

66
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,960
Fou4Mod, I'm at Mo Chit, wanna go together?

67
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Next station, Mo Chit, the terminal station.

68
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Baa! Baa-bin! Over here!

69
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
What?

70
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,400
What did you do during your break?

71
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:12,840
What?

72
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,840
You're like Onglee PROXIE.

73
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,400
Really.

74
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,760
Really?

75
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,880
Yeah, your face is like Onglee.

76
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,920
That's crazy, are you for real?

77
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,800
Yeah, totally, exactly!

78
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,720
What?

79
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:36,400
Yeah, your brows brighten your chin,
your chin brightens your hair, your hair brightens your outfit...

80
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,440
Your outfit brightens your elbow and your elbow brightens your hand...

81
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,640
Your hand to your knee, and your knee, back to your face.

82
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,680
Damn, you're so handsome.

83
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,200
Or is it the way you styled your hair?
Can I take a photo? I'll try to do it too.

84
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,920
Hey, can I go with you to the next BLACKPINK's concert?

85
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,720
Well, I want to become a Blink like you.

86
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,280
C'mon, just you and me.

87
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,840
That's weird.

88
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,000
What is?

89
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,520
C'mon, take Onglee with you.

90
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Alright.

91
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Ha! In your face!

92
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Hey, I just happened to catch you in my shot...

93
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,760
it turned out pretty nice. Want me to Airdrop it to you?

94
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Oh, I don't have an iPhone.

95
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Siam Suksa School.

96
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,560
Next, we're gonna take a look at a conversation between Shanben and Zhangdong.

97
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,480
They're gonna discuss if there's a post office in the school.

98
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,520
Repeat after me. Xuexiao libian you youju ma?
(Is there a post office in the school?)

99
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,360
Xuexiao libian you youju ma?
(Is there a post office in the school?)

100
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
You. (Yes, there is.)

101
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,280
You. (Yes, there is.)

102
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,720
Youju zai nar?
(Where is the post office?)

103
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,600
Youju zai nar?
(Where is the post office?)

104
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,120
First, we're gonna have to study shengci (new word).

105
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,640
The first word of this lesson is bian (a side).

106
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,000
That means "a side, or, next to."

107
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,080
Youju zai nar?
He asked Zhangdong, "Where is the post office?"

108
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,760
So Zhangdong answered, "Zai tushu guan Xibian."

109
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Zai tushu guan Xibian.
(West of the library.)

110
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,280
Li zhe yuan ma?
(Is it far from here?)

111
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,640
Li zhe yuan ma?
(Is it far from here?)

112
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,920
Bu yuan. (not far)

113
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,840
Bu yuan. (not far)

114
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,000
Next word is "Tong bian" (East).

115
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,280
Hey!

116
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,560
See, they use the word "Tong"...

117
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,640
Someone just liked my first pic on IG. What do they want?

118
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,640
They're flirting so you'd be interested.

119
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,560
If they were to like your latest pic, would you be interested?

120
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Really?

121
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I think you're chosen.

122
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,400
Let's take a look at this.

123
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,359
"Bowuguan zai nar?"
(Where is the library?)

124
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,040
"Bowuguan zai nar?"
(Where is the library?)

125
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,280
"Bowuguan zai dongbian."
(The library is in the east.)

126
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,160
"Bowuguan zai dongbian."
(The library is in the east.)

127
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,480
"Zai heping gongyuan."
(in the peace park.)

128
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,000
"Zai heping gongyuan."
(in the peace park.)

129
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,080
"He renmin quangchang."
(and People's square.)

130
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,360
"He renmin quangchang."
(and People's square.)

131
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,520
Alright, class, that's it for today.

132
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,240
Hey, class, listen...

133
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,240
Class leader, don't forget to collect your friends'...

134
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,240
Walk faster, shithead!

135
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,720
What? Smartmouth!

136
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
You're walking like a turtle, shithead.

137
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,640
Ass!

138
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,360
Goodbye.

139
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Goodbye.

140
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,560
Auntie, I want...

141
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,160
No, I got here first.

142
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,240
No, me first, pineapple?

143
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,520
Pineapple, pineapple!

144
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Auntie, I want lots of chili salt!

145
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,040
How much is it? 50?

146
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,640
20 Baht, my dear.

147
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,320
20.

148
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,520
Let's scan.

149
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,840
Alright.

150
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,440
20 Baht.

151
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,480
Auntie, let me scan it first.

152
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,240
Papaya, transfered!

153
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,000
Guava, already paid!

154
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Watermelon, done!

155
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,280
Hey, I just happened to catch you in my shot...

156
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
want me to Airdrop it to you?

157
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,400
Why are you in a paparazzi mode?

158
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Gotta hurry before we lose the light.

159
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Three. Two. One.

160
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,640
Cut, cut, cut!

161
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,720
Hey, you got it. Take a peek.

162
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Take a peek or hit delete?

163
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
C'mon, it can be posted.

164
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,360
How's that?

165
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Well, we got it. Yeah.

166
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
I'm tired. Let's take a break.

167
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
Are you hungry?

168
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Yeah, I am.

169
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
How about Gluay Gluay?

170
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Gluay Gluay? Yeah, why not?

171
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Here. Take it.

172
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Chian.

173
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Huh?

174
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,400
We're gonna go hit Gluay Gluay for some Hurricane Bananas.

175
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Boosting some energy.

176
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,600
Same stuff?

177
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Gluay Tok Jai and Iced Chocolate.

178
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,120
That's it? No specials?
You could never finish them anyway.

179
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,560
Thank you.

180
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,880
Excuse me.

181
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Can I interview you for my Tiktok content?

182
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,080
It will take just a sec.

183
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,560
Of course.

184
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Okay.

185
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Alright.

186
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,200
Okay.

187
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,400
Alright, one, two, three...

188
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,960
Hello, could you please introduce yourself?

189
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,760
Hi, my name is Bua, Buachat. I'm 15.

190
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,760
Okay, Bua, do you have any single friends that you wanna set up?

191
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,840
Umm, are you in a hurry? It's kinda hard.

192
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
None?

193
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,960
No, none.

194
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,480
Oh?

195
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,480
What about the guy you danced with earlier? Is he single?

196
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,240
Oh, yes, he is. He's single.

197
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,240
If you'd like me to set anyone up with him, let me know.
I'm excited to see how it goes.

198
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,360
Okay, that's fab.

199
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,360
How many points would you rate him?

200
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,520
I'm gonna go with 2.5.

201
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,160
What? Why so low?

202
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,360
Just a 2.5?

203
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,360
If someone likes him that much, he might need to be prepared for that.

204
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,520
Oh? Why is that?

205
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Is this for the content? Or is this targeting my friend?

206
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Was that too harsh?

207
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,200
That's it, thank you.

208
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,480
Well, Bua, here's the thing. My friend likes him.

209
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Your friend's appearance is outstanding so my friend sent me to talk to you.

210
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,520
So what are you saying? Be prepared?

211
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Well, tell you friend to be careful, he might get put on hold.

212
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,080
Because lately, he's been quite a player. He Airdrops to lots of people.

213
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,640
Like, he's not really serious with anyone...so...

214
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,920
Oh, okay.

215
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,920
If your friend is not serious too, then I guess it's fine. I'll look forward to that.

216
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,440
I'll keep my friend posted.

217
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,880
Maybe, it will work, who knows?

218
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Well, we'll have to see about that. Thank you.

219
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,160
What was that?

220
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,080
I don't know.

221
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Let's go.

222
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,160
What?

223
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,840
I haappen to have a boyfriend, sorry.

224
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,520
Where should we go?

225
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Today? Where should we go?

226
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,720
Okay, I'll let them know.

227
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,120
I'm gonna go to Daddy's with Kung.

228
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,840
Now?

229
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,120
Yes, now. See ya later. Bye!

230
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,760
Shall we?

231
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,640
Yeah.

232
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,440
Guys, we'll get going too.

233
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Noon ane I, we'll go try pickled crab we saw on Tiktok for you all.

234
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
See ya. Bye.

235
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,560
Oh no, we couldn't get seats at NAPLAP.

236
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,840
How about other co-working spaces?

237
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,960
No, there aren't beds.

238
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,760
I wanna lie down and watch Demon Slayer.

239
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,120
Oh, I know what I wanna do!
I wanna go to Governer Chadchart's outdoor cinema!

240
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Are you free tomorrow?

241
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
No.

242
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,040
Then I guess we're not going.

243
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,240
Or would you like to go to JJ now?

244
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,320
Now? Let's go.

245
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,760
See ya. Bye-bye.

246
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,200
Hey, see ya!

247
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,960
Hey, I want a jacket like yours.

248
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,960
I want it to be an everyday jacket, can you pick it out for me?

249
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,960
My Mom just texted me to be at Teenoi, we're getting a table in 10 minutes.

250
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,760
Oh?

251
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,880
Then, I'm gonna get going.

252
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,080
Okay, see you.

253
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,960
Alright, see ya.

254
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,240
Do you wanna eat anything when you're back?

255
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,800
No, I'm eating with someone now.

256
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,560
Welcome.

257
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,000
Hello.

258
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
A walk-in guest? Please have a seat.

259
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,400
Please pick the design.

260
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Thank you.

261
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,600
No need to be nervous.

262
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Okay, I'll take it easy.

263
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
That's right.

264
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,560
Wash it nicely. Last time, the classroom was so stinky.

265
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,720
I was the one who washed it. Wasn't it supposed to be cleaner?

266
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,320
Why is it dirtier?

267
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,320
Wash it nicely, wash it.

268
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,440
Oh, what the hell are you doing?

269
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,520
Go!

270
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
Asshole!

271
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Stop it there!

272
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,720
I didn't do anything!

273
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,440
Okay.

274
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,080
That's dope.

275
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
That hurt!

276
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,240
Be prepared!

277
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,520
C'mon here, quickly.

278
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,800
C'mon, man.

279
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,880
You're in the way.

280
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,880
This one, I think.

281
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,680
C'mon, it's alright, that's more than 10 inches away.

282
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,600
Three.

283
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
See?

284
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
Five, then.

285
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
Alright, let's continue.

286
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,120
Auntie Noy, why are your fruits so yummy?

287
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Because of the chili salt!

288
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,440
20 Baht, right, Auntie?

289
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,720
Auntie, I want a lot of chili salt.

290
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
C'mon now.

291
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,240
I'd like one mango with sweet fish sauce.

292
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Are your nails coming off? You want another manicure?

293
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,840
You go ahead.

294
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,720
I'm so tired with the music rehearsal.

295
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,080
Okay.

296
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,600
I don't want any chili salt anymore.

297
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,160
I'm in a hurry. I won't be able to find a Tuk-tuk.

298
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,080
Auntie, I already transfered the money.

299
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Okay.

300
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
See ya.

301
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,760
Hey, you're off now?

302
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,280
Wait, guys. Can I ride this one?

303
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,480
I have to go to the Colorful Bangkok 2025.

304
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,600
No.

305
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,040
No, get off first, c'mon.

306
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,040
Can I go first? I already have a date at Colorful Bangkok.

307
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,680
I don't wanna walk. It's too tiring.

308
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,120
If it's that tiring, then don't do anything.

309
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,440
And you're gonna let him walk?

310
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,440
Please, please, please. Could you please let me have it?

311
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,320
Excuse me, will there be more Tuk-tuks?

312
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,280
Most of us already went and dropped of kids at Colorful Bangkok.

313
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,280
I'll be back in half an hour. Do you wanna wait?

314
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,640
We're gonna go eat at Tuay-Tung, Buntudtong. The line is long.

315
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,320
No, you're inseparable.

316
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,480
C'mon!

317
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
See ya.

318
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,120
This is kinda small.

319
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,680
Thank you, thank you.

320
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,960
It takes only a short time to finish the glass.

321
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,120
What? I'm gonna go to Daddy's with Kung, okay?

322
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,920
And you're inseparable too, asshole.

323
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,520
Why would I care?

324
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,200
Whatever.

325
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,200
- Here're ours.
- I'll hit you! See ya, bye!

326
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,640
We're gonna get going too. NAPLAP is waiting for us.

327
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,840
See ya.

328
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Wait, you're gonna watch an anime, right?

329
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,120
I wanna see Demon Slayer too.

330
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,440
Let me go with you.

331
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,600
I'm not gonna go see an anime, I'm gonna go see her boobs!

332
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,280
That's gross, damn you! Go away!

333
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,960
See you!

334
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Shit, Tanjiro's crying now.

335
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,080
Want it?

336
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Yeah.

337
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,560
Hey, have you picked out a jacket yet?

338
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,640
Huh?

339
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,840
You want me to go pick it out for you?

340
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,080
Now?

341
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
Yeah.

342
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Hey, do you think I should get a long-sleeve or a jacket?

343
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,920
That's up to you. Which one do you want?

344
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,760
Or should I get a hoodie?

345
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Go try them out first.

346
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
What?

347
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Nothing.

348
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Which one?

349
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,920
Which one do you prefer?

350
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,080
Pick one for me, which one suits me better?

351
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
The right one.

352
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,680
Hey, take a look!

353
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,680
Man, my nails are growing out, and it looks so messy.

354
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,080
I don't like how it looks at all. I'll go get my nails done, okay?

355
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,440
Okay.

356
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,440
Alright, I'm off now before the place's crowded. Get that one. Bye.

357
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,280
Welcome.

358
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Can I put it here?

359
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
Please, have a seat.

360
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,440
Okay, so what would you like to do today?

361
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,000
I'll do this one, auspicious color for love.

362
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,720
Okay.

363
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,600
I was born on Monday.

364
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Okay, got it.

365
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,120
Excuse me, could you do a really cute design for me?

366
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,600
Of course.

367
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Thank you.

368
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,640
How much is it?

369
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,640
It's 600 Baht, please scan it over here.

370
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,800
Done.

371
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,200
Thank you. We'd love to have you back.

372
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,320
I saw it earlier, your nails are stunning.

373
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,320
Can I take a photo with you?

374
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,720
It will take a minute.

375
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,320
Is your name really Fou4Mod? Your mom's a Kami's fan?

376
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:50,320
(Singing Fourmod's song) Right?

377
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,040
Can I call you Fou4Mod, Kami, next time I see you?

378
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,880
Call me whatever you want, but don't expect me to turn my head.

379
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,880
What will make you turn your head? Calling you 4EVE?

380
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,680
How about Gelboy? Will you turn around?

381
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,680
Okay, Gelboy, it is.

382
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,080
And where do you live?

383
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,720
Sena Nikhom.

384
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,680
I get off at Pu Chao.

385
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,680
Wanna walk to BTS together?

386
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
It's okay. Out.

387
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:56,040
What are you looking at, Gelboy?

388
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,160
"Devotees of auspicious colors for love #Mondays #Fridays"

389
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:51,320
Right, right, right, that's right. That's good.

390
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:51,880
Let me see.

391
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,080
I think we got it.

392
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,840
That's nice.

393
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,600
Airdrop to me.

394
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,040
Of course, Mom.

395
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,000
Hurry up! I need to post it to promote my items.
I'm about to go live streaming.

396
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Gotcha!

397
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,040
Airdrop!

398
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,520
My dear sis, Fayefangkaew.

399
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,240
Yes?

400
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,240
Do you want to stream Spotify for free?

401
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:15,640
Yes!

402
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,080
Want it?

403
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:16,320
Yes!

404
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:16,680
Want it?

405
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,480
Yes!

406
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,120
Let's exchage phones.

407
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:18,640
No way!

408
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,560
Why not?

409
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,280
No, I don't like android phones!

410
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,080
What? It's amazing.

411
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,400
Amazing? No way!

412
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,040
Really!

413
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,320
No, mine is more amazing.

414
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,080
How about 3 months of Spotify for free?

415
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,440
No, that's too little.

416
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,520
5! How about 5 months?

417
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,520
No, who would want that?

418
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,000
How about...my last deal...one full year?

419
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Dismissed.

420
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,320
Hey, I need chili salt now. I'm off first, okay?

421
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,520
Move, move, move, move!

422
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I'm gonna get going now. See ya.

423
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,440
Oh, where are you going?

424
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,000
I'm going for a walk.

425
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,800
Oh.

426
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,240
Can I have the pic that you took that day?

427
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,640
Of course.

428
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,640
Can you Airdrop it to me?

429
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,080
Have you turned on your Airdrop?

430
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,080
Yes.

431
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,120
"Gelboy"

432
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,880
Sent.

433
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,360
Ok, got it.

434
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,360
Thank you.

435
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,920
Okay, bye.

436
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,040
Hey, wait.

437
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,960
My nails are coming off, how about yours?

438
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,960
Come pick out the design with me, will you?

439
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,360
I just had them done last week.

440
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,280
Oh, I thought we're gonna go together.

441
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,320
How about...next time, when my nails are messed up, I'll let you know?

442
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,320
Going or not, it's your call.

443
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:09,160
Oh, why? In case you're going with someone else?

444
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,360
Hey, if you wanna go with someone else first, you can.

445
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,360
So you won't miss out an opportunity.

446
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:47,200
Oh, I get it now. It's clear that it's so unclear.

447
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,520
But if you're not okay with it, it's fine.

448
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,760
Okay, got it. If your nails are coming off next time, let me know.

449
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:17,240
Okay, I'll keep you posted. See ya, bye!

450
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,680
- Can you speak Thai?
- No.

451
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,120
You can't speak Thai?

452
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,960
Pineapple, please, Auntie!

453
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,560
Papaya, please.

454
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,000
Alright!

455
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,240
Can you pay for me?

456
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,200
Of course.

457
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,280
Me too!

458
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,440
Alright, I'll pay.

459
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,400
What?

460
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,880
I think this suits you.

461
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,080
Don't you think it's too fancy?

462
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,440
Let me see yours.

463
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,040
Can I do it like yours but in different colors?

464
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,920
No, I don't want yours to look like mine.

465
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,080
No, it's cute!

466
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,600
How about I choose the design for you? It'll look gorgeous.

467
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,960
Alright.

468
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,960
Let's go.

469
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,000
Join me, let's throw in some songs.

470
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,080
So we can listen to them while getting nails done.

471
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,000
"There's no fulfilled love.
Fulfilled love is just a noun."

472
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,800
So you won't get bored
while having your nails done.

473
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,800
If he's keeping him on the hook,
then let's keep him on the hook as well!

474
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,680
Hey, can you join my playlist?

475
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,360
- Add more...c'mon!
- Okay, okay!
