You want some?

Roger that.

12
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,020
Hey, Chian, you want some pot?

13
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,150
What?

14
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,880
No.

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,479
You didn't hold your joystick earlier.

16
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,650
What?

17
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,020
C'mon, boy. Good boy. C'mon, good boy.

18
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,020
Good boy, c'mon. Want some treat?

19
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,710
No. I'm not your dog, man!

20
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,720
What?

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,570
Just one puff, c'mon.

22
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,979
No. It makes my breath stink.

23
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,740
What?

24
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,310
Whatever, how about you?

25
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,750
Go ahead, I've had too many puffs already.

26
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,880
C'mon, one puff.

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
Too many puffs? I'm the only one smoking here.

Do it like this.

35
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,060
I'm barking, literally barking here.

36
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,900
I haven't taken a pic of it yet!

37
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,990
There, there, so mouth-watering. I'm barking.

38
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,750
This is number one. Let's eat.

39
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,720
How about a camera eats first?

40
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,920
No, I effin' eat first!

today is the first day I haven't looked at his Instagram.

45
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,770
I'm 10% on forgetting him.

46
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,290
I'm so freakin' lonely.

47
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:16,690
Hello?

Don't let me talk by myself.

Hello? Do you want a piece of me, huh?

52
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,329

Oh.

54
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,790
Are you alright?

55
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,360
I'm worried.

56
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,010

Muve, move. The center spot is mine.

69
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,050
Don't laugh, I said muve but I corrected it, you shithead.

70
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Guys!!! I happened to run into Lisa BLACKPINK at Siam soi 2.

71
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,640
Let's go see Lisa!!!

72
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Where are you?

73
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,850
Awwwwww.

74
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,850
I'm in the hallway next to your school.

75
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,460
Really? Hang on, I'll run to you.

76
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,460
Quickly!!!

77
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,330
That's it.

78
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,340
Whose speaker is this? lt's a piece of crap.

79
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,750
Alright, let me see.

80
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,750
We did the right moves earlier.

81
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,110
That's fab!

82
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,680
But we can know each other, right?

83
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Or do we have to be sneaky?

84
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,680
What are you afraid of?

85
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,809
We're close friends.

86
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:36,049
Wow, you're so confident about that.

87
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,700
That's fab.

88
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,340
Guys, I'm off.

89
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,780
What, shithead?

90
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,310
Where are you going?

91
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,670
I'm in a hurry.

92
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,670
Alright, safe travels.

93
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,280
Hey, it's Lisa!!!

94
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,800
Are you sure?

95
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,880
I think it's her! She has the same haircut!

96
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,000
Hey!

97
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,200
Oh, shit.

98
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,450
Let's go!

99
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,610
No, don't.

100
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,570
Why not?

101
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,570
We don't wanna invade her privacy. Calm down.

102
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,250
Ta-da!

103
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,090
So today, we're tracing Lisa's steps.

104
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,790
You, point! Three, two, one...

105
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,150
Me?

106
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,790
Yes, you! Three, two, one...

107
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,710
More energy!

108
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,210
Three, two, one...

109
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,330
This spot, right here...

110
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,620
is where Lisa was standing five minutes earlier.

111
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,030
Here, everyone, take a look.

112
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,990
Ta-da!

113
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,030
Like, standing here makes me feel like I am Lisa.

114
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,960
You get it?

115
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,040
So earlier we were standing there, right? And what happened?

116
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,530
It's like when we saw her...and we went, "Drop some money~".

117
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,670
Here, this spot, guys.

118
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,590
Stay tuned for the next EP, we'll show you where we meet Lisa again.

119
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,790
Whoever wants to see Lisa...

120
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,390
outside of the concert...

121
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,830
please stay tuned.

122
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,760
Follow me.

123
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,330
Bye-bye.

124
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,920
Bye-bye.

125
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,690
That's fab!

126
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,530
I should have brought you to shoot with me a long time ago.

127
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,530
True.

128
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,640
So my new channel, I focus on following Lisa especially.

129
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,050
Do you think it's interesting?

130
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,570
So you won't dance and show off your gel-polished nails anymore?

131
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,430
I don't get many likes with that, the engagement is low.

132
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,670
Man, that's a pity.

133
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,810
When I was nosey sneaking on you and Chian...

134
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,660
and I watched the videos, I only focused on your face.

135
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,870
You? Nosey? Why?

136
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,700
Me? My Tiktok channel?

137
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,510
Yeah.

138
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,230
You watched me dance?

139
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,910
Why would you being sneaky?

140
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,910
I watched every single video. Your face made me laugh.

141
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,960
That might not be me...

142
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,320
Maybe it was someone else...my twin, maybe?

143
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,090
No, it was you. Your face's funny.

144
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,090
Listen, I don't have a funny face so it wasn't me.

145
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,930
What was that all about?

146
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,010
If you think my face is funny, press like for me.

147
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,530
Why don't you follow me on my channel? This is the new one.

148
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,180
I'm not on Tiktok.

149
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,900
Why not?

150
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,870
I get dizzy watching so many videos.

151
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,400
Download it and give me a like.

152
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,550
No, I'm not gonna be on it.

153
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,920
What? Friends support each other, don't they?

154
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,410
You must understand, it's not my style.

155
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,900
Download it and give me a like!

156
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,060

169
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,130
Yes.

170
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,130
Okay.

171
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,460
Hey, aren't you laughing too hard?

172
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,200
And too loud?

173
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,760
What's so funny?

174
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,240
I can't take it.

175
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,240
It's too much, I can't....

176
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,890
Cotton candy roti.

177
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,180
Hey, ask these two to dance with you.

178
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,340
Shit, I'm annoyed.

179
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,990
Why? What's so annoying?

180
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,800
"Should we try being a couple?"

181
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,440
Shit, you know...

182
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,930
What?

183
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
This shithead is pretending to be sleepy so she'll lay her head on his shoulder.

184
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,700
Lisa brought prosperity!!...Cotton candy roti became a hit.

185
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,430
I'm too lazy to talk to you, Mai.

186
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,990
I'm more sick and tired of you more than you're sick and tired of me.

187
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,760
What? Isn't that too harsh?

188
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,440
That's too harsh!

189
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,240
And you don't think I'm not sick of you?

190
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,770
Hey, is this a deep talk? Looks like it.

191
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,770
This is a deep talk.

192
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,940
So deep.

193
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,470
Action is reaction. And you're just acting out.

194
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:56,940
Hey, how did Tiktok know that I wanted to eat it?

195
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,940
It was meeeee!

196
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,070
Thank you so much for being the first person to give me a like.

197
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,990
Listen, I'm gonna go back to dancing on my new Tiktok channel.

198
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,360
Can you come help me shoot after school?

199
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Of course, see you at 4 p.m.

200
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
I'll put on some make up.

201
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,070
One, two, three...

202
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,070
Yeah, that's it. There you go!

203
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,170
That's nice. That's fab!

204
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,500
You're born on the confidence day, bravery month and fabulous year!

205
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,540
You're like the best of the best!

206
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,960
Oh my gosh, look at that face, it shines to Mars.

207
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,200
You do know the difference between good and bad, right?

208
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,490
Man, but that was really nice. It's so old-schooled.

209
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,660
Old-schooled?

210
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,630
Yeah.

211
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,360
Good old-schooled?

212
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,280
Like, the 00's hottie.

213
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,170
The 00's hottie...

214
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,170
Take a look first.

215
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,819
Did you use the filter?

216
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,060
No.

217
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,650
I told you to use the filter.

218
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,940
No, take a look first. It was really good.

219
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,940
Baa, I told you five times. Look at my sweat.

220
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,869
It was so good though.

221
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,569
Do you see my fucking sweat?

222
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,730
Damn it, you stink.

223
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,730
Come here.

224
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:28,190
Post this.

225
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,240
It's not bad, is it?

226
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,840
It's definitely not bad. Your hair and make up is really nice.

227
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,900
If you don't post this one, I'll go climb up an utility pole.

228
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Look, I'm dead serious. Your shirt is also eye-catching.

229
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,380
Your face is priceless. This one, trust me.

230
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,550
How about that caption? Help me.

231
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,770
Blue-eyed boy?

232
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,420
The path that I choose to walk?

233
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,420
No.

234
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,190
Crossing the road...

235
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
How to cross the road and confuse people?

236
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,560
Yeah.

237
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Okay.

238
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,720
So I'll hit post...

239
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,640
Really?

240
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Listen, it's really good.

241
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,610
Done.

242
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,900
Okay, some dessert?

243
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,030
Where?

244
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,600
I know a secret place.

245
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,400
A secret place?

246
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Yes. Let's move.

247
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,290
Do you know Gluay-Gluay?

248
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,290
At Lido? Yeah, I've heard of it.

249
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,990
You there often?

250
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,150
From time to time, yes.

251
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,670
From time to time, yes?

252
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,670
C'mon.

253
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,470
Come on.

254
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,560
That's enough. There are lots of people.

255
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,570
Our time is running out. Should we ask for half more day?

256
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,530
I think that's it.

257
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:28,530
I've exchanged the receipts with Thai milk tea and had them so much
that my tongue becomes orange.

258
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,650
Then, what should we do next?

259
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,260
I don't know.

260
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,220
What would lovers do?

261
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,550
This?

262
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,750
That's enough.

263
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,520
Hey!

264
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,010
Hang on a sec.

265
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,560
What is it?

266
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,560
It's a gel-polished nails booth.

267
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,930
What's that one?

268
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,690
That's really yellowish.

269
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,090
Hey, I want to have my nails done.
Let's select one and go have them done inside.

270
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,840
Please, my nails are thicker now.

271
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,200
No, mine are still thin. Take a look.

272
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,110
My nails are all messed up. I played an instument too.
They're not strong enough yet.

273
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,790
Come keep me company.

274
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,790
No. Let's go have some smoothies.

275
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Banana, please. Less sweet.

276
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,450
What about you?

277
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,650
You go ahead.

278
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,650
Aren't you hungry?

279
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,860
Here. Nail stickers.

280
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,900
So you won't have to have your nails done.

281
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,280
Right.

282
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
And you can change them often too.

283
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,760
Right, I'm literally barking.

284
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,770
What's with you and barking?
Are you a dog or something?

285
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,250
Twenty more minutes. Are you gonna wait?

286
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,380
Let's call a Lineman instead.

287
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,550
Sorry. I don't wanna wait any longer.

288
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,110
I think I should take a BTS. It will be faster.

289
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,110
I'm off, bye.

290
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,210
Kiss.

291
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,390
I'm so happy that you're very clear about our status.

292
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,830
You're always there for me.

293
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,270
You play an instument like me.

294
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,870
You're there by my side.

295
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,520
Thank you for being my happiness.

296
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,520
I love you, my girlfriend.

297
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,040
Fai Fa

298
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,040
This gets on my nevers. I hope I don't have this kind of partner.

299
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
Post

300
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,540
Happy one-month anniversary, my girlfriend.

301
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,540
What girlfriend? Delete it.

302
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,070
Delete it!

303
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,240
Fou4Mod, delete it.

304
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,450
Delete it now!

305
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,610
I'll report this, shithead.

306
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,540
Delete it now!

307
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,590
Do you want a piece of me? Delete it right now!

308
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,590
What's the fucking matter with you?

309
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,660
Hey, are you free?

310
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,410
Could you help me pay for my board game?

311
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,490
My application won't work.

312
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:30,430
Can you give me your number?
I'll transfer the money to you.

313
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,070
Of course.

314
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,590
Your number...

315
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,390
061

316
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,910
061

317
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,520
097

318
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,520
2263

319
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,630
2263. Okay.

320
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Then, I'll save your number?

321
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,510
Can I?

322
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Actually, I already have someone that I like.

323
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:29,280
Oh, then, it's okay. Thank you very much.

324
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,650
I think this one suits you.

325
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,650
Yeah.

326
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,190
Excuse me.

327
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,640
Hey, I don't think I should do it.

328
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,730
What if Chian and Fou4Mod see this?

329
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,150
Just do it.

330
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,150
You like to have your nails done. What about them?

331
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,640
I feel like I'm the reason that made them break up.

332
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,850
The shoes cover them now, no one can see that.

333
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:03,810
Right.

334
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,170
Turn around.

335
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,110
I'm shooting this.

336
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,600
Excuse me, can I choose the colors?

337
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Absolutely.

338
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,170
This is kinda plain, do you want it?

339
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,140
Alright, alright.

340
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:31,020
You go choose over there. This is my spot.

341
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,020
Hey, over there.

342
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,850
Do you think they'll let us choose whatever we want?

343
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,610
Yeah, it's up to you.

344
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,670
What are you doing?

345
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,110
Trying it.

346
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,940
You're painting it?

347
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,940
Not yet, I'll compare it first.

348
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,510
Yeah, that works.

349
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,630
Do you think these two go along?

350
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,970
No, I think that one is already nice.

351
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,980
Pretty. Period.

352
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,480
Period.

353
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,560
Period.

354
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,850
What are you looking at?

355
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,550
Sit nicely.

356
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,150
You too.

357
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,620
Let's go.

358
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,720
Alright.

359
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
They won't let us choose till tomorrow, right?

360
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,800
This one is fab.

361
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,980
So so fab. Can you see it?

362
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,780
Mine and yours look so cute together.

363
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
Get down.

364
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,350
No, it looks prettier up here.

365
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:40,350
No, mine looks prettier up here.

366
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,480
This looks like a match.

367
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,530
It looks the same, just in different colors.

368
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,960
Your design is bigger.

369
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
Just a bit bigger.

370
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,290
Are you gonna post in on your Story?

371
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,620
Maybe not.

372
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,620
Send me the pic.

373
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,030
Your foot is soft.

374
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,580
Yeah?

375
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,469
Do you feel it?

376
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,699
I can feel it.

377
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,340
Yeah, I've been wanting to try that.

378
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,340
It's like a wet jelly.

379
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,190
Again?

380
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,070
Do you have feelings for me now?

381
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Oh, no. I just wanted to try that.

382
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:18,030
Do you have feelings for me now?
Oh, no. I just wanted to try that.

383
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:34,550
Feelings...

384
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,100
for...

385
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:44,210
me now?

386
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,540
No feelings...

387
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,280
I...

388
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,280
have feelings...

389
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,810
for you now...

390
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,730
I have feelings for you now.

391
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
If you wanna break up, why don't you say so?

392
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,770
You didn't have to go through all that.

393
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,150
You want to break up with me so badly, right?

394
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,950
I asked you, do you want to break up with me?

395
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Shit, your old habits die hard.

396
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:09,970
Alright, we're done. Shithead.

397
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,770
Do you want to copy mine?

398
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:33,770
The school is about to start.

399
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,490
I thought you already left me.

400
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,080
I saw you become close to Bua.

401
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,080
Do you know...I'm upset?

402
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,280
You know, I don't like him.

403
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,390
Are you hitting on Bua, Baa?

404
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,040
No, that's not it. We met at the concert.

405
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,040
We both love Lisa and that's it.

406
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,540
I'll never leave you.

407
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,900
I'm sorry.

408
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,190
Let me copy your homework, shithead.

409
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,190
I have to finish this in time.

410
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,170
Hey, I got Covid.

411
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:08,170
Did you get it too? If you got it, you know how you got it...

412
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:50,050
No, I think I got it from Fou4Mod.

413
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,860
faifashot

414
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:30,340
Fou4Mod and I broke up.
If you wanna know why, ask him. Don't ask me.

415
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:49,390
Hello. I have some errands to run.
I'll come back and finish the work tonight, okay?

416
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,390
Okay, bye.

417
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,680
Thank you.

418
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,680
Take some meds and rest a lot, class.

419
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Baabin's group, stop spreading Covid to other people.

420
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,810
Fou4Mod, stay.

421
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:23,700
There's a senior who wants to talk to you.

422
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,700
Yes, ma'am.

423
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,200
You don't let me get in touch with you at all.

424
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,200
That's why I had to come to you this way.

425
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:55,630
Baabin, I'm sorry.

426
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,930
You helped me before...

427
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,930
and I let your friend go.

428
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,420
You and Faifa broke up, right?

429
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,820
I know...

430
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,820
that I hurt you in the past.

431
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,590
I'm sorry for being unclear.

432
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,320
Actually, I like you.

433
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,490
What are you thinking behind that camera?

434
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,760
Do you still have feelings for me?

435
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,670
Shit!

436
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,920
Give me your Mom's Line ID!

437
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,400
I don't have it.

438
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
How could you not have it?

439
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,760
I think we should clear things up today.

440
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,160
Your grandpa's, auntie's, uncle's Line ID?

441
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,370
Then tell me, who is this?

442
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,370
Hang on one sec.

443
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,070
Who is this?

444
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,460
Excuse me, ma'am, can I take this outside for a sec?

445
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,660
It's your stepdad's!

446
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,430
I'll bring it back to you.

447
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,320
Absolutely.

448
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,320
And how about this? This is your grandma's!

449
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,370
Can you give me one last chance?

450
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:23,690
Please.

451
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,220
All I ask is just one last chance.

452
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,350
If you answer, I'll scold you.

453
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,420
Fou4Mod.

454
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,740
Fou4Mod, don't answer.

455
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,310
In the past, it's been very toxic, you've had enough.

456
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,920
You can tell me if you'd like it or not.

457
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,210
Fou4Mod, don't answer, listen to me first.

458
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,650
You know, even though you're a mess but you're adorable.

459
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,450
You're like Onglee. You're just like Onglee. You're like a celebrity.

460
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:45,450
You're more handsome than Cha Eun-Woo, Kunphol and the members of Bus.

461
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,040
Baa, turn on the mic first.

462
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,770
Baabin

463
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:57,970
Shit.

464
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,540
When did I turn off the mic?

465
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,540
I hadn't heard a thing from you since we're in the class.

466
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,100
Why did you show a mimi heart earlier?

467
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,690
Oh, I just wanted to say...

468
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,690
If you go back to him, your heart will shrink like this.

469
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:30,020
And he might do the same thing to you again.

470
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,020
Don't you remember what he did to you in the past?

471
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,500
If you're back with him, he might do the same thing to you again.

472
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,520
Oh?

473
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:52,650
Okay, hang on a sec.

474
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:10,930
Bua.

475
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,390
Hey, Baabin, you started this meeting, right?

476
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,390
Accept him.

477
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,590
Oh, hey, one sec.

478
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:42,590
Just a sec.

479
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:44,810
Wait, wait.

480
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:45,850
Video filters

481
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:49,850
Okay, alright, what's up?

482
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,740
Bua.

483
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:04,740
Tell Fou4Mod that we aren't a thing.

484
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,130
Fou4Mod.

485
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:23,130
I have never liked Chian, really.

486
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:28,690
We never get close to the word "couple".

487
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,180
We're really just friends.

488
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,990
And who do you like?

489
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:34,180
Actually, I like Baabin.

490
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,180
Huh?

491
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,440
I don't have feelings for you, Bua.

492
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,440
I like Fou4Mod.

493
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:17,080
Oh, okay.

494
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:21,670
Holy piss...

495
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,280
If you don't mind, I'd like to excuse myself...

496
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,330
I'm literally pissing my pants.

497
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,740
Leave meeting

498
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,290
Fou4Mod.

499
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,670
I'll hit on you.

500
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,930
Fou4Mod.

501
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:08,940
IG, Line, Tiktok, that you blocked me...

502
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,760
if you still wanna block me, keep it that way.

503
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,760
When you recover from Covid, I'll go hit on you face to face.
