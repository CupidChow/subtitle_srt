1
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,670
Guys!

2
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,770
What?

3
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,180
I'm outta here.

4
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,740
You can give me an outro.

5
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,900
What? We haven't got any footages, and you're leaving?

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,380
He likes to leave early.

7
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,150
That's not true.

8
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,830
Are you really leaving?

9
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,210
Of course.

10
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:53,850
Really?

11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,010
Guys, get to work.

12
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,610
Alright, alright.

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,610
I'm bigger than that, give me more space.

14
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,420
Chian.

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,490
Hello.

16
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,340
Let's go!

17
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,250
Aha.

18
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,250
Let's go. I'm ready.

19
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,190
Bua.

20
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,380
I don't think I can come help you out with Tiktok so much anymore.

21
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,510
Why not?

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,450
Is your uni far?

23
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,500
I can come see you instead.

24
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
No.

25
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:44,510
It's just...

26
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,510
I don't want other people to get the wrong idea.

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
What about?

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,660
Well, we've been close friends, right?

29
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,660
Yeah.

30
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,500
But others seem to think that we're more than that.

31
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,260
So how are things with Fou4mod?

32
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,180
Are you guys getting along?

33
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,750
Well, we're talking.

34
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,020
Wait, let me retrace the steps.

35
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,020
Okay, got it.

36
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,430
Clap, clap here, okay?

37
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,430
You don't have to do it perfectly, I'll handle it.

38
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,450
Here we go.

39
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,090
Okay.

40
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,550
What's wrong with you? Why are you high every day?

41
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,190
This is so boring.

42
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,830
Let's retake it.

43
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,470
When? When are they gonna stop you from selling?

44
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,470
My son won't have to smell it every day.

45
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,730
It's annoying.

46
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,250
Why don't we give it another shot?

47
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,460
If you think you can raise him better than me...

48
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,450
go ahead, take him.

49
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,420
C'mon. Do you wanna go?

50
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,220
Ma.

51
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,360
Do you wanna go with her? Go!

52
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,200
Hey, when are you gonna stop talking this way in front of him?

53
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,920
When?

54
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,409
He's known about it since kindergarten.

55
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:37,730
Well, but do you have to talk like this again?

56
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,970
Don't you pretend to be a good mom here.

57
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,130
I'm being a good mom here.

58
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,490
That's why you're dancing on Tiktok with him? I'll give you a plate.

59
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,900
Well, my kid loves to do it. So what?

60
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,900
If you're gonna be high, just shut the hell up.

61
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,630
You never say something creative anyway.

62
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,240
You want creativity? Why don't you go home?

63
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,440
No.

64
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,200
And take him with you.

65
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,740
I'm gonna be here, what are you gonna do about it?

66
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,340
Go pack your bags. / I haven't got to see him in so long.

67
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,180
Why do you have to...

68
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,230
Well, it's been three months.
You come here every three months.

69
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,960
Why is that?

70
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,760
He can't even remember you anymore.
He grows taller every time you come see him.

71
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,680
Do you know why I don't come here often?
That's all on you!

72
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,130
That's on me?

73
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,010
I don't wanna...

74
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,000
You get high every fucking day.

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,530
Right, and you're so good.

76
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,179
You don't do shit in a day.

77
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,909
C'mon, boy. Go.

78
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,789
Pack your bags and go live with your mom.

79
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,240
Hey!

80
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,360
Go live with her just for a day.

81
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,330
See how it goes.

82
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,179
Hey, how could you say that?

83
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,020
Just one day, babe, go.

84
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,670
Go pack your stuff.

85
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,840
Hey, you and I, we made a deal.

86
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,650
What deal?

87
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,020
That day, you were the one who said that you're gonna take care of him.

88
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,830
You know I've got my own problem.

89
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,110
That day?

90
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,560
But today...

91
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,080
you wanna dance with him, you wanna be a good mother to him...

92
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,080
so why don't you take him to look after?

93
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,690
Today, we have great news...

94
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,750
for alll Buawaterlily's followers...

95
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,480
So...

96
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,480
we're going to have a new content...

97
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,280
which is...

98
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,200
One day with Bua...

99
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,690
and today's gonna be the first day...

100
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,690
we're shooting this...

101
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,590
So while we're waiting for Nie and Ivan's cake...

102
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,790
I don't know what to do because I've been hungry all day...

103
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,190
for real...

104
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,360
I don't know if I should go see a doctor or shopping...

105
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,240
well, I found this to brighten up my face...

106
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,330
This one, right here.

107
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,250
What are you doing?

108
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,010
I'm transcribing a song.

109
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,580
I'm trying on an outfit, isn't that cool?

110
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,350
Fayefangkaew.

111
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,190
What?

112
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,950
Well, my friend came to me and asked me...

113
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,350
a guy that he's talking to asked him what he's doing...

114
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,400
how should he reply and make it look cool?

115
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,650
What? Tell him what he's actually doing.

116
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,700
If you make it too cool and...

117
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,740
once you date, and he finds out the truth, it will be a shock to him.

118
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,190
Really?

119
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,680
Yes.

120
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,640
If it's not true, he will be shocked.

121
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
My friend asked.

122
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,490
What are you having?

123
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,320
A meal.

124
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,040
Hey, let me have it too.

125
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
No.

126
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,250
Just sitting around.

127
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,780
That's cuteeeee!

128
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,670
That's cuteeeee!

129
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,720
That's cuteeeee!

130
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,450
Fab!

131
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,450
That's cuteeeee!

132
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,130
That's cuteeeee!

133
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,540
That's cuteeeee!

134
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,540
Period!

135
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,070
Are you home?

136
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Hey, I got lots to talk about.

137
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,210
What are you doing?

138
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,560
Bua.

139
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,730
What?

140
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,730
I don't think we should call each other every day.

141
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Why's that?

142
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,810
What's wrong?

143
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
I don't feel comfortable.

144
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,220
What's there to not be comfortable about?

145
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,220
You call your Mom every day.

146
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,110
I think we shouldn't do it anymore. Sorry.

147
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Alright, okay. Okay, it's okay.

148
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,840
My ride is here. I gotta go.

149
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,860
Okay.

150
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,020
Hey, I'm so happy I get to talk to you at 9 p.m.

151
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,150
What's up?

152
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,130
I need some advice.

153
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,250
What is it?

154
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,250
My Tiktok engagement has been so low...

155
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,060
since I become the only one in the shot.

156
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,060
It's kinda dry.

157
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,780
Can you come shoot with me?

158
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,780
No. I don't like to dance. I told you that.

159
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,280
It's alright. It can be taught, you know.
Not everyone is good at dancing.

160
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,510
And it's you. You're gonna be cute anyway if you dance.

161
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,750
C'mon now.

162
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,750
Please, come dance with me. I can't dance alone...

163
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,800
I want a million likes.

164
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,310
I've told you so many times to quit.

165
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,670
If you do it and you get stressed out, you'd be better off without it.

166
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,430
Tiktok is something just for fun, you're too serious with it.

167
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,430
You gotta choose a song, you gotta rehearse. It's exhausting.

168
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,240
Why don't you spend those times to sleep or go somewhere.
Do you want me to take you?

169
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,120
I don't wanna see you stressed out anymore.

170
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,120
You're always like this when you get less likes.

171
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,570
So?

172
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,300
Have you talked to Chian recently?

173
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,780
Not really.

174
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,670
Don't you see his Stories?
They're all about Fou4Mod.

175
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,870
How could he find the time to come see us?

176
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,870
That's true.

177
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
He posted them on Close Friends?

178
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,930
Hello?

179
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,620
Can I see it?

180
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,460
Just don't mind it. It's just Close friends on Instagram.

181
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,670
Right, it's just Close friends on Instagram.

182
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,359
You can do it, you can do it!

183
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,640
Wait, chill, Don't!

184
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Mai, get back here! Get back!

185
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:24,970
Shit!

186
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,490
And the winner is BACONMAI Team.

187
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,770
Yay! That was easy-peasy.

188
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,930
Whoa, you look miserable.

189
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,070
Do you wanna go poop?

190
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,070
C'mon, smile.

191
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,840
I lost. I didn't have my hopes up but I still lost.

192
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,170
You go...

193
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,450
Glen Coco!

194
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,780
On Wednesdays...

195
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,420
we wear pink.

196
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,990
Stop trying to make...

197
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,240
fetch' happen...

198
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,430
it's not going to happen.

199
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,630
You're like really pretty.

200
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,570
Oh, thank you.

201
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,690
So you agree?

202
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,420
You think you're really pretty?

203
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,460
I love your bracelet. Where did you get it?

204
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,460
That's the ugliest effing bracelet I've ever seen. Period.

205
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:50,670
It's okay to lose, you'll win next time.

206
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,110
I'm sorry I laughed at you, I just like seeing people smile.

207
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah, there's the smile I'm looking for.

208
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,720
Another shot, c'mon.

209
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Smile.

210
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,500
Do you know how to smile?

211
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,190
Yes, I do.

212
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,560
Then, smile!

213
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
There, a missing tooth!

214
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,890
You looked like an ape earlier.

215
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,090
Cheese! Cheese!

216
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,030
Chian.

217
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,770
Chian.

218
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,940
If you're not at the dorm, you should tell me.

219
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,890
Are we gonna be strangers from now on?

220
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,890
No.

221
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,110
Well, this is how friends are.

222
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,110
Friends?

223
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,550
What kind of friends do this?

224
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
You've changed.

225
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,080
Do you really not know why I'm being like this?

226
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,370
In the past, I felt for you.

227
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,650
And what would you want me to do?

228
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,090
I just want to have you by my side.

229
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,860
I'm lost without you.

230
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,630
How about when you disappeared to be with Moo?

231
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,630
I was lost too, did you even care?

232
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,890
What did I do to you?

233
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,890
Huh?

234
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,140
I'd always done things with you.

235
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,190
And you went missing and did all that with him.

236
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,790
What you did with me, creating a playlist...

237
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,790
you did it with him.

238
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
I was lost, do you know?

239
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,410
So what? Are you trying to get back at me now?

240
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
If you're mad, why didn't you tell me?

241
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
I'm so stressed about my channel.

242
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,050
I wanted to talk to you about it and you wouldn't talk to me.

243
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,490
I didn't say a word when you're out with Fou4Mod.

244
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,890
And I'm alright with that.

245
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,100
But it's like you've forgotten about me.

246
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,220
You don't understand.

247
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,470
No one compares to you.

248
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I get it now.

249
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,190
I didn't mean it, I'm sorry.

250
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,470
Hey.

251
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,910
I'm sorry.

252
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Safe travels.

253
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
I'll say no to Moo.

254
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,950
Why? Don't do that to Moo.

255
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,560
We won't work it out anyway.

256
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,560
If we date, we'll be frustrated.

257
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,690
And I won't look for anybody else to talk to anymore.

258
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:04,260
If I were to have someone
and that'd make me have a problem with you...well, how about no?

259
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,310
That's all I wanna say.

260
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,640
I've been helping Bua with his Tiktok channel.

261
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,360
The channel's name is Gelboys?

262
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,900
That time that I called you Gelboy...

263
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
I wanted to make him jealous.

264
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,710
But now, it's done for us. Like a real no.

265
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
It's okay.

266
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
Really, it's alright.

267
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,610
Bua wants to become an influencer, right?

268
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,530
He saw me do nails so he asked to shoot contents with me.

269
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,530
And lots of people became interested and gave us so many likes.

270
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,540
So he asked to keep shooting with him.

271
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,660
And the reason I'm telling you this is...

272
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,500
tomorrow Bua asked me to do nails for him.

273
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
And we're gonna shoot a new clip.

274
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,550
I'm gonna go.

275
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,060
Right, can I go tag along?
I wanna have my nails done too.

276
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760
You're gonna go with lots of your equipments anyway, right?

277
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,620
So, what is it between us now?

278
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,390
We can stay like this, for now.

279
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,830
Don't wanna rush things...

280
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Alright.

281
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Your pot stinks.

282
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,210
Hello.

283
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,300
What's your name?

284
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,670
My name is Fou4Mod.

285
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,110
Wow, that's an adorable name.

286
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,830
Where do you go to school?

287
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,510
I'm a senior at Siam Suksa School.

288
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,360
Every student from this school is good-looking!

289
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,680
That's true!

290
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,720
May I ask...

291
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,720
about your status, like, do you have someone special or a partner?

292
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,690
Well, I do.

293
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,500
Oh, no, I'm heartbroken already.

294
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,860
So what's the status? Are you taken?

295
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,900
The status is...no status.

296
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,430
Huh?

297
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:05,840
What's that?

298
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,120
What? No-status status?

299
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,250
Well, it's exacly what it sounds like.

300
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,540
Like, dating this grandma over here?

301
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,670
What? Or dating this ghost over there?

302
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,110
Something like this?

303
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,000
I don't think so.

304
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,170
Can you explain a little bit more?

305
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:25,020
Like, we're talking but we have no status for now.

306
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,020
Wait, what? And what is that status?
Does he or she tell you that he or she misses you?

307
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:50,500
NO STATUS

308
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,310
Hey.

309
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,280
What?

310
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,450
Go finish things up with him now, I beg you.

311
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,380
I know you well. If you don't back off now, you'll get hurt.

312
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,380
He's keeping you on a hook.
You're a substitute now, do you know that?

313
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,900
If you put up with getting hurt like this, you're stupid.

314
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,870
If you don't have the guts to do it, I'll take you to him.

315
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,870
Guts? You don't even have those, how would you speak anything?

316
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,150
Well, no one has bigger guts than your fucking mom!

317
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,760
If you don't cut things off with Chian, you can cut our friendship off.

318
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,930
Calm down, Coach. Calm down.

319
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,750
I like him, you wouldn't understand!

320
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,080
Are you here yet?

321
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
I'm with Fou4Mod now!!!

322
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,640
Where are you?

323
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
I'm about to get off BTS.

324
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Bua.

325
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,860
Chian has just texted me to say that he's arriving.

326
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,230
He's getting off a BTS.

327
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,230
Just a sec.

328
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,420
Are you hurt?

329
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,420
No.

330
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Let me give you a hand massage first.

331
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Are you gonna take a break? Your nails are thin now.

332
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,220
We're here.

333
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:55,660
Fou4Mod is cute.

334
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,270
Huh?

335
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,320
Fou4Mod is cute.

336
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,710
Oh?

337
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,400
So how do you think of him?

338
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
He's quite friendly.

339
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,460
That's good.

340
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,990
Can you remember my fingers?

341
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:12,990
Yes.

342
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,850
Which one is longer? Index or ring finger?

343
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,850
Index, of course.

344
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,630
That was quick.

345
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,630
Take a look.

346
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,710
How about Fou4Mod's?

347
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:35,190
I don't know. Why?

348
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,190
Just asking.

349
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
You seemed to be paying a lot of attention doing his nails earlier.

350
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,650
You want my help?

351
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,650
Yeah.

352
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,460
Okay?

353
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,010
Okay, tuck in your shirt.

354
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,830
All the way in?

355
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,210
No, just the left side.

356
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:55,860
The left side...

357
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,020
Just a bit.

358
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,020
A bit.

359
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,900
Hey, can you be on this side?

360
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,300
His face is better on this side.

361
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,150
Alright, here we go. One, two, go!

362
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,290
It is so hot.

363
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,880
Bua, turn on your Airdrop, I'll send you the video.

364
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Gelboy wants to share a video.

365
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:16,650
Are you full?

366
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,380
Got it?

367
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:37,190
You want the egg? Help me eat this.

368
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,990
Alright, alright.

369
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:40,990
Have the egg.

370
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,720
Chian, do you still remember Gelboys' tiktok's password?

371
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,810
Of course, I was the one who set it.

372
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,610
Did you sneak in to peek at anybody?

373
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:05,570
I saw it all, who texted you to hit on you.

374
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,090
What did you see?

375
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:06,970
Well, well, look who's the hottie here...

376
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,310
I didn't even talk to anybody.

377
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,070
I saw it.

378
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,950
What? You're exaggerating.

379
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,400
C'mon, whisper it.

380
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,360
Whisper what?

381
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,470
The password.

382
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,400
I remember it.

383
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Whisper it.

384
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:27,850
No.

385
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,380
What?

386
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,470
Bua.

387
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,010
Okay, okay, okay.

388
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,580
I believe you now.

389
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,320
Is it not good?

390
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,320
I'm stuffed.

391
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,460
How are you going home?

392
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,270
BTS.

393
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,600
Okay, okay.

394
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
Bua, and you?

395
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,330
You're going back to your dorm, right?

396
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,220
Yeah.

397
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,980
Do you wanna record an audio on the ride?

398
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,980
We're going in the same direction.
When I get home, it'll be done.

399
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,950
But...

400
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:52,950
going with Bua is a good idea too
so...we don't have to set a date to record it another day.

401
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,550
Are you okay with that?

402
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,320
Then, I'm off.

403
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,250
Let me know when you get home.

404
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,250
Line me when you get there.

405
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,820
I don't wanna go home alone.

406
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,060
Do you want my Grab to drop you off first?

407
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,020
What did you say earlier?

408
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,020
I've already eaten something.

409
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:47,090
Lisa, I feel down now.
Can I ask you for some encouragement?

410
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,310
Two. One. Here we go!

411
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,110
Oh, gosh, goosebumps.

412
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,110
Where?

413
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
Fab. Hot.

414
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,400
Oh, you're not watching it anymore?

415
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,370
Are you down?

416
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,370
Yeah.

417
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:55,090
I think this is not worrying.

418
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:59,180
This is jealousy.

419
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:03,030
Have you ever changed the way you look at Chian?

420
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:06,280
Meaning...

421
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,540
Why don't you two become a couple?

422
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,470
And try seeing him as your lover.

423
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:17,470
I think you might not notice that you've liked him for a long time.

424
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,240
At the concert, you encouraged me to go to Fou4Mod.

425
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:26,250
You don't want them to be together, do you?

426
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,120
Let me know when you're done with shooting on Tiktok.

427
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:00,810
Hey!

428
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,810
Let's do this clip.

429
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,340
Start from this and this...

430
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,430
Like this, just once.

431
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:30,250
Alright, let's start. Three, two...

432
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,700
No.

433
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,950
C'mon, man.

434
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:38,100
Relax, relax.

435
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,600
Don't be stiff.

436
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,600
Three...

437
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:57,290
What was that?

438
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:12,510
I knew it, when you're about to lose me, you came back, right?

439
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,620
Huh?

440
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,960
I don't know what's wrong with me.

441
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:12,070
I can't be your partner.

442
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,870
But I don't want you to go see other people.

443
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:38,630
You know what, in the past, I'd liked you a lot.

444
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,090
But I didn't dare to express it.

445
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,090
Because I thought you might back off.

446
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:59,570
And I...I tried liking other people.

447
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:05,410
And it hurt more.

448
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:12,030
Because I'd always liked you.

449
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,040
I don't want to be in the middle of this anymore.

450
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:44,110
I'm gonna be frank, let's stay out of each other's lives.

451
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,090
No need to be anything at all.

452
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:52,090
I want Fou4Mod to be happy.

453
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,760
Fou4Mod.

454
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:31,710
I'm here to tell you that the password of the channel is lovebua55.

455
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,250
And...

456
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:43,210
please change the password for me.

457
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,210
I'm not gonna be on this channel anymore.

458
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,060
I'm gonna quit for good.

459
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,830
No need to change the password, Bua.

460
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,690
Create the password.

461
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:15,690
Change the password.

462
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,020
I've changed it.

463
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,460
Already signed out too.

464
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,360
Coach, are you okay?

465
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,360
I'm okay.

466
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,950
Hey, what are you doing here?

467
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,040
What are you doing here?

468
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,620
Help me think of a new name for the channel.

469
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:24,800
Should we go get our nails done tomorrow? Lol...

470
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:36,500
My nails are thin, I think I should take a break.

471
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:50,320
From now on, I'm gonna be doing nails with my partner.

472
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,330
I guess we won't be doing nails together anymore.

473
01:00:56,350 --> 01:01:00,350
I'm sorry, I don't know if I have to tell you.

474
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,960
Okay, that's good.

475
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:38,520
That's cuteeeee!
