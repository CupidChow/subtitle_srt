186
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,320
Tian, you're being too dramatic.

187
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,390
Don't overdo it.

188
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,080
Why did you hire Qing Tian too?

189
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,100
He Fan was right about one thing.

190
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,120
Qing Tian is just as capable as you are.

191
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,840
You tricked me.

192
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,320
Don't leave just yet, Mr. He.

193
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,960
Didn't you want
to discuss the acquisition?

194
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
I have other matters to attend to.

195
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,510
We'll talk another time.

196
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,370
He Fan,

197
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,750
why?

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,840
Why?

199
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,750
Don't act like you care.

200
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,240
You've never wanted to be with me.

201
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,790
We'll see who gets

202
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,790
the last laugh.

203
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,980
I'm impressed,

204
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,870
Tian.

205
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,480
I'll take that as a compliment.

206
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,700
I said

207
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,940
I'd make this project a success.

208
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,790
I also said

209
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,340
I'd find out

210
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,050
who hurt my sister.

211
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,000
Fan,

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,890
I can't believe
you'd do this to Qing Wan!

213
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,550
Mr. He, you're under arrest

214
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,720
for commercial fraud

215
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,000
and false imprisonment.

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,250
Please come with us.

217

Deng, Qing Tian.

218
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,460
He Lanxue, come with us.

219
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,700
There's one more thing.

220
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,030
I can't wait any longer.
It has to be done now.

221
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,200
