00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,330
He's Lin Xian?

5
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,940
He looks like the man
I've dreamed about.

6
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,110
Who was that just now?

7
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,240
Fan?

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
Why are you only getting here now?

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,460
You missed my amazing performance
on stage.

10
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,440
I knew

11
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,600
you'd do a great job.

12
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,580
Congrats on the successful presentation.

13
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,270
Thank you.

14
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,970
I don't know if it was a success,

15
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,520
but I'm happy

16
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,110
I got someone's approval.

17
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,520
Was it that guy who just left?

18
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah.

19
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,820
Come on.

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,190
Sure, let's go.

23
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:56,880
Jump.

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,660
Seriously, Deng?

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,220
You need to jump here.

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,580
You picked the wrong path.

27
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,240
I...

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,960
Wan,

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,550
come play a round for her.

30
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,850
I can't carry you.

31
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,190

33
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,400
Fan wore a new cologne again.

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,230
So, how far have you two gotten?

35
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,380
Deng, I told you

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,120
we were just childhood friends.

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,280
Exactly.

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,190
Fan would never be into her.

39
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,750
Focus on your game.

40
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,350
How did the presentation go?

41
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,120
Isn't my boss super charming?

42
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,320
Hang on a sec.

43
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,440
His business card?

44
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,570
He gave it to you himself?

45
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,820
He asked me to come
for an interview tomorrow.

46
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,350
Does this mean

47
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,180
we'll be colleagues soon?

48
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,900
Not sure yet.

49
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,030
Something's off.

50
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,950
Hold on.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,510
Mr. Lin,

52
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,850
it's said that Xian Game
is planning to invest two billion yuan

53
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,820
into a groundbreaking
hyper-realistic game.

54
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,730
Could you share some details?

55
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,880
It's going to be

56
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
a truly personalized experience
for every player.

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,190
The in-game world

58
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,180
will be almost indistinguishable
from the real world.

59
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,120
It's unprecedented,
and it will make history.

60
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,970
Once it's launched,

61
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,530
players are welcome to explore it.

62
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,220
All I can say for now

63
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,950
is that the game is called

64
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,600
"Qing Wan's Forest."

65
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,130
"Qing Wan's Forest?"

66
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,530
What kind of game is that?

67
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,380
Have you

68
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,450
betrayed Fan?

69
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,320
Don't butt in
when grown-ups are talking.

70
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,060
Wan,

71
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,970
is this really just a coincidence?

72
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,290
I...

73
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,790
think so?

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,660
I'm not sure either.

75
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,820
The secrecy around this project
is insane.

76
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,750
All I know is that the company
has this game in development.

77
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,690
The boss has never appeared
on camera for any other game.

78
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,030
When "Flying Squirrel"
won the Purple Pupil Award,

79
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,560
it was Mr. Kun who accepted it
on his behalf.

80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,910
But anyway,

81
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,450
we're going to be colleagues soon.

82
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,730
We should pop some champagne
to celebrate.

83
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,620
Nothing's settled yet.
Besides, we don't have any champagne.

84
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,440
I'll go buy some.

85
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,470
Sit down.

86
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,450
As long as you've got the spirit,

87
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,510
anything can be champagne.

88
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,250
Drink this instead.

89
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,160
Sure.

90
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:04,780
What about me?

91
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,690
Drink this, kid.

92
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,720
No alcohol for you.

93
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,330
Oh no,

94
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,590
the interview!

[Love Post Office]

96
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,820
Who would schedule an interview here?

97
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,150
So strange.

98
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,450
Mr. Lin.

99
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,480
Hello.

100
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,950
This is the commemorative figurine

101
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,920
for "Heartbeat Memories,"
your company's new game.

102
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,770
Yes, it's a small gift for you.

103
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,240
"Heartbeat Memories."

104
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,210
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

105
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,330
Have you been here before?

106
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,240
No,

107
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,270
it's my first time.

108
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,680
I like coming here to find inspiration.

109
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,830
So that's why

110
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,480
your first UGC construction game
was called "The Lighthouse."

111
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,190
Looks like you've done your research.

112
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,070
If you were to improve "The Lighthouse,"

113
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,590
what would you change?

114
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,710
"The Lighthouse" does a great job

115
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,270
combining creation tools and gameplay.

116
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,710
A lot of architecture majors

117
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,740
use it for their graduation projects.

118
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,650
Tell me its flaws.

119
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,540
The flaws...

120
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,210
The building engine is too complex,

121
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,510
and it's not easy to get the hang of it.

122
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,320
I think a better example
of a successful UGC game

123
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,450
is "My Homeland" by Starmi.

124
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,620
Its creation tools
are much more intuitive.

125
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,070
Tell me about your "Daydream" project.

126
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,680
Basically, "Daydream" allows players

127
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,560
to relive their personal memories.

128
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,830
It relies on the most advanced
brain-computer interface technology

129
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,800
to convert memories into data

130
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,500
and link them to a physics engine,

131
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,360
turning those memories

132
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,270
into an exciting, personal adventure.

133
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,770
It seems like no existing game model
can define it.

134
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,420
Exactly.

135
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,770
It doesn't need to be defined.

136
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,560
Exploration, adventure, and pursuit

137
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,300
are all primal human instincts.

138
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,440
The game resonates with human nature.

139
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,940
I can offer support for your project.

140
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,980
Really?

141
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,820
On one condition.

142
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,750
What is it?

143
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,830
Change the name.

144
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,710
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin,

145
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,150
but

146
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,510
I'd prefer to stick
with the original name.

147
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,250
Interesting.

148
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,250
Even though you've forgotten everything,

149
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,040
you're still you.

150
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,500
What did you say?

151
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,880
Slow down.

00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,650

153
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,690

My balloon!

155
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,890
Mr. Lin,

156
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,330
may I...?

157
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,390
Thank you, Miss.

158
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,690
You're welcome.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,320
That dream from before...

160
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,000
Mr. Lin, shall we
continue the interview?

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,710
No need.

162
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,680
I already know you well enough.

163
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,320
- Then...
- Come to the company on Monday.

164
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,560
Understood, Mr. Lin.

165
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,510
Is there something on my face?

166
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,150
No,

167
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,300
you just remind me of an old friend.

168
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,920
What a cliché.

169
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,990
Really?

170
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,190
She must be amazing

171
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,570
if she's your friend.

172
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,330
Yes,

173
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,940
she is.

174
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,230
Where is she now?

175
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,690
The balloon.

176
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,900
The balloon.

177
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,990
My balloon!

178
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,990

191
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,920
♪My heart beats for you,
yet I leave it unsaid♪

192
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,000
♪For you, I'd cross mountains and seas
and stir winds and storms♪

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,360
♪Not even time or space
can keep me from you♪
