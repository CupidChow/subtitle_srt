156
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,440

157
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,280
Yes, please.

158
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,810
If it's such a bad deal,

159
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,640
why is Stone pushing up the price
to compete with us?

160
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,900
Stone has been falling behind us

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,520
on all fronts.

162
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,670
My guess is

163
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,170
they see this project as their chance
to surpass us,

164
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,200
boost morale,

165
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,400
and raise their stock.

166
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
Maybe.

167
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
But stock prices are short-term.

168
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,570

169
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,340

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,430

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,960

173
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,440
What are you suggesting?

174
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,700
Mr. Yu.

175
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,050
Have you played Moon Rover?

176
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,520
Moon Rover is

177
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,510
a pretty formulaic open-world game.

178
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,130
Nothing groundbreaking
in terms of gameplay.

179
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,730
But what sets it apart is

180
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,180
its unique chemical-physics
dual-engine system.

181
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,520
The realism

182
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,870
is the best

183
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,560
on the market right now.

184
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,780
So I think

185
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,330
Stone doesn't care about the game,

186
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,420
they want the tech behind it.
