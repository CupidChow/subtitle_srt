Everything generated by the engine

Too much stimulation

play in your dreams.

Yes.

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,860
So, how far along is the development

of the game?

89
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,020
Tell me more
about your "Daydream" first.

90
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,440
Do you know what the lucid dream is?

91
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,000
It's when your rational mind
stays active

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,480
during a dream,

93
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,900
so you can control it

94
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,900
with your own mind.

95
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,620
Exactly.

96
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,160
That's where I got
the inspiration for "Daydream".

97
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,000
But it's missing one critical piece,

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,120

99
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,860
that can translate
the brain's chaotic electrical signals

100
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,560
into a stable time-space structure.

101
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,800
However,

102
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,920
this involves cutting-edge brain science

103
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,000
and brain-computer interface technology,

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,640

105
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,740

You will.

107
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,660
You just need the right resources.
