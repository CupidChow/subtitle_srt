Thank you.

18
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,460
This acquisition of
the "Moon Rover" studio

19
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,150
was all thanks to
Miss Qing's strategic vision

20
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,690
and decisive actions.

21
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,690
If it wasn't for her,

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,320
we might've let Stone beat us to it.

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,240
I wasn't interested

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,350
in Moon Rover's profits,

25
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,740
but in their talent

26
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,650
and patents.

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,380
Miss Qing understood my goal perfectly.

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,930
Everyone should learn from her,

29
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,360
always put the company's interests first

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,130
and find solutions.

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,660
Does she really know

34
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,740
how a big company operates?

35
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,860
Mr. Yu, your contributions

36
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,940
are what laid the groundwork for this.

37
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,460
You're always so perceptive, Lanxue.

38
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,360

on the Special Contribution Award.

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,570
It's not given out often,

43
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,140
and you got it

44
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,380
just by signing your name.

45
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,030
Luck favors those who are capable.

46
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,870
It was your idea
for me to sign that deal, am I right?

47
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,220
You were the one
who made the deal happen.

48
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,470
You dragged her into this.

49
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,100

Do you think you're cut out to be VP?

53

Do you really think
you can help Mr. Lin?

54
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,690
You're overestimating yourself.

55
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,420
Am I overestimating myself,

56
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,030
or are your insecurities
getting the best of you?

58

Thank you.

65
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,700
Be more careful.

66
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,140
I have some ointment.

67
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,080
Does it hurt?

68
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,550
It'll pass soon.

69
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,010
By the way,

70
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,430
how did you know Stone Network
was after Moon Rover's engine tech?

71
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,900
My brother plays Stone Network games
all the time

72
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,130
and he's always complaining

73
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,010
about how bad their realism is.

74
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,700
So, I played

75
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,730
through their games

76
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,310
and found the same issue.

77
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,260
Their realism is weak,

78
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,760
but they're good
at narrative-driven open-world games.

79
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,080
Besides the main storyline,

80
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,570
there are lots

81
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,170
of side quests for players to explore.

82
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,070
If they could

83
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,370
improve the realism,

84
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,670
their games would be on another level.

85
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,490
Your analysis is spot-on.

86
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,140
All done.

87
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,440
Thanks, Mr. Lin.

88
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,080
Let someone else handle the coffee.

89
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,400
For you and your brother,

90
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,930
coffee is a safety hazard.

91
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,280
Leave the coffee to He Lanxue.

92
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,400
He Lanxue?

93
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,460
I'd rather not.

94
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,230
I mean,

95
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,110
isn't she your assistant?

96
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,500
[He Fan: I booked a restaurant.]

97
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,460
[He Fan: I'll pick you up after work.]

98
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,020
Mr. Lin, if there's nothing else,

99
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,440
I'll get going now. Thank you.

I won't make it.]

the whole time?

105
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,050
Thank you.

106
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,110
You must be hungry.

107
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,930
Come on.

108
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,370
Let's grab something to eat.

109
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:30,900
It's alright.

110
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,990
I had a snack earlier.

111
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,810
Then

112
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,340
take a walk with me.

113
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,930
I'll drive you home after.

114
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,930
Okay.

115
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,070
Let's go.

116
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,380
Remember when we were kids?

117
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,110
You were always following me around,

118
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,630
and whenever there was
something delicious,

119
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,230
you'd sneak it to me
behind Qing Tian's back.

120
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,430
You were very protective of us.

121
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,940
I remember how you
took the blame for Qing Tian

122
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,610
when he broke Mr. Qing's window.

123
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,080
You remember that?

124
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,880
Time really flies.

125
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,250
By the way, Fan,

126
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,190
are you going back abroad,
or are you staying?

127
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,230
I'm planning to stay

128
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,700
and make my mark here.

129
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,380
I see the opportunities.

130
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,400
Also, there's...

131
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,080
someone I care about.

132
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,580
You seem to be in a good mood.

133
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,110
Did something good happen?

134
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,020
The good stuff is yet to come.

135
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,640
Mysterious, huh?

136
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,920
Keeping me in suspense.

137
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,430
So, have you decided
which company to join?

138
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,550
I'm not cold, but thanks.

139
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,700
Better safe than sorry.

140
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,280
Looks like you've made up your mind.

141
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,490
What's the name of this lucky company?

142
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,170
It's a secret.

143
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,730
Alright.

144
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,200
Why is he always bothering her?

145
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,930
Fan, I'm home now.

146
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,440
You should head back. It's getting late.

147
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,140
Did you hear that?

148
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,190
Don't stick around.

149
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,210
Go now.

150
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,610
Qing Wan,

151
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,850
can I come in?

152
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,130
I need to talk to you.

153
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,230
What's with the secrecy?

154
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,400
Fine.

155
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,350
Come on.

156
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,130
I wonder if Qing Tian's home yet.

157
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,420
