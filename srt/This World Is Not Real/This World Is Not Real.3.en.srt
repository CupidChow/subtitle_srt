3
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,870
She must be amazing

4
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,080
if she's your friend.

5
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,920
Yes,

6
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,640
she is.

7
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,340
And she's beautiful too.

8
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,530
Where is she now?

9
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,820
Let me give you a ride home.

10
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,230
Mr. Lin,

11
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,450
I want to ask you something.

12
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,200
Go ahead.

13
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,890
You've been developing this game
called "Qing Wan's Forest."

14
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,060
Does the name have any special meaning?

15
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,510
That's a trade secret.

16
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,530
"Qing Wan's Forest" isn't my game.

17
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:02,940
It is

18
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,000
your game.

19
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,330
My game?

20
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,040
Why does he act so strange sometimes?

21
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,890
So what you're saying is

22
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,760
I can be part
of the game's development, right?

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,860
Mr. Lin?

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,550
What are you doing?

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,820
Sorry,

26
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,640
you seemed a bit distracted just now.

27
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,540
Could there be an issue

28
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,920
with the compute power server?

29
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,670
Wan?

30
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,600
Qing Tian?

31
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,420
I've seen you before.

32
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,300
You're Xian Game's CEO.

33
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:09,980
Let me tell you,

34
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,670
I've got a lot of complaints
about your company's games.

35
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,890
- When I file a complaint, I never...
- Well,

36
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,710
Mr. Lin, we'll head home now.

37
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,640
You, come with me!

38
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,430
What are you doing?

39
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,040
I'm not finished!

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,420
You...!

41
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,890
Oh no.

42
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,860
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lin.

43
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,480
I'm so sorry.

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lin.

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,860
- Please forgive us.
- It's fine.

46
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,450
Wan, I gotta go.

47
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:34,920
See you.

48
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,770
- Bye.
- You get back...!

49
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,330
Mr. Lin, I'm really sorry.

50
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,080
How about I pay for your suit?

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,860
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

52
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,420
How about this?

53
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,480
Come home with me,

54
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,550
and I'll help you clean it up.

55
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,640
Does that work?

56
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,540
Hello, Fan.

57
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,800
I've got top-tier intel.

58
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,580
In return, I want a Li Bai skin!

59
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,540
It was just a little coffee.

60
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,820
Why does he need a shower?

61
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,900
Also,

62
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,190
why does he seem so familiar
with my home?

63
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,840
This is so awkward.

64
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,980
On the day of my interview,

65
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,720
my boss takes a shower at my place.

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,810
If word gets out...

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,900
Where are my clothes?

68
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,920
Here.

69
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,480
These are my brother's. They're clean.

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,250
As for your clothes,

71
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,720
I'll take them to the dry-cleaner's

72
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,750
before returning them to you.

73
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,810
Why is your face red?

74
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,550
It's not.

75
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,780

Just a moment.

78
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,070
I'm washing my face.

79
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,550
Could you

80
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,040
hide here for a bit?

81
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,920
Why?

82
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,960
You just took a shower in my house.

83
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,130
I wouldn't know how to explain.

84
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,100
Qing Wan!

85
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,100
Deng.

86
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,580
I left an earring here last night.

87
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,220
- You did?
- Let me take a look around.

88
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,840
Stay here. I'll look for it for you.

89
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,860
You won't find it.

90
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,020
Men's clothes?

91
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,340
These are...

92
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,570
He Fan's. He lent them to Qing Tian
for his interview.

93
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,690
Qing Tian?

94
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,960
He's job hunting?

95
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,040
Yeah, he's interviewing
for a game operations position

96
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,170
so that he can buy items.

97
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,600
Where is it?

98
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,460
Yesterday, I walked from here to...

99
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,050
You're in my way.

100
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,580
Behind the curtains.

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,830
Wait!

102
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,460
It's over there.

103
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,550
It's not here, Qing Wan.

104
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,600
I must have been mistaken.

105
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,430
That's my favorite earring.

106
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,990
Wait a moment.

107
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,750
Fan?

108
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,930
What brings you here?

109
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,540
What are you looking for?

110
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,170
I left a cuff link here,

111
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,810
so...

112
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,140
- I came to look for it.
- Fan, let me help you find it.

113
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,580
No need.

114
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,250
I think I might've left it

115
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,780
somewhere else.

116
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,850
Why are you here?

117
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,660
I lost an earring here too.

118
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,700
Hey, how about this?

119
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,050
Deng and Fan, let me
treat you two to dinner.

120
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,430

for helping me set up

the economic system for "Daydream."

122
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,580
Without him,

123
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,480
I wouldn't have made it
to the presentation.

124
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,340
I'm happy to be of help.

125
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,610
Fan, is there anything you want to eat?

126
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,490
If not, I've been craving
roast duck at that place.

127
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,340
That sounds great!

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:33,820
Good idea!

- Let's go!
- Let's go.

Why is he in "Qing Wan's Forest"?
