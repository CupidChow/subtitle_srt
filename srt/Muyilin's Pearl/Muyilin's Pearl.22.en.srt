1
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,520
Autumn is coming soon.

2
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,080
I've lost count of

3
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,080
how many days and nights I've spent on this grassland.

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,720
Even now,

5
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,440
it still feels surreal to me.

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,039
As if guided by some mysterious force.

7
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,800
Like a destiny spanning many lifetimes.

8
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
And so I came

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,520
4,500 kilometers away from home.

10
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
And somehow, here,

11
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,720
I met a boy.

12
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,800
His name is Samuhar Abdullah.

13
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,240
I know

14
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,400
he's secretly planning our wedding.

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,440
He is the most innocent person

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,600
I have ever met.

17
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,600
When I'm with him,

18
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,640
it's as if all my identity and past experiences

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,900
don't matter anymore.

20
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,200
I'm just this pure person.

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,760
Simply the one he loves.

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,280
Though we both live on the grassland.

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,360
But by his side,

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,240
what I see before me

25
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,720
is the entire world.

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,160
Pearl.

27
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,780
What are you doing?

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,040
I'm creating a surprise.

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,220
What kind of surprise?

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,600
I can't tell you.

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,360
My dear Pearl.

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,920
You said time takes everything away,

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
but also leaves everything behind.

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
This is the only way I can think of

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,160
to preserve what we have now.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I've been preparing for a long time.

37
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,560
Listen.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,960
With the snow mountains as witness,

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,820
and the grasslands as testament.

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,160
You are destined to be my sun.

41
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,360
You are the pearl heaven has given me.

42
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,360
You are the one

43
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,400
I will cherish

44
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,940
for all lifetimes to come.

45
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
Every morning when I wake up,

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,840
I want to say to you:

47
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,160
Janimka,

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,220
which means 'my dear.'

49
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,360
This word

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,320
in our Kazakh language means

51
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,040
'my life.'

52
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,720
You

53
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,280
are the most

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,600
important part of my life.

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,360
Yilin said she wants to be alone for a while.

56
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,040
Okay.

57
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,200
Let's go.

58
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,840
Where to?

59
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,500
To scout the location.

60
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,240
Let's go.

61
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,200
Lu Hui,

62
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
when we go this time,

63
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,720
we need to take more videos

64
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,000
and photo materials.

65
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,880
Sansan,

66
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,240
you'll still be on camera.

67
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,760
Got it.

68
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,440
Ali,

69
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,800
don't you need to go to the restaurant?

70
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,440
Wherever Sansan goes, I go.

71
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,040
Then let's go.

72
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Come on, let's go.

73
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,180
I'll drive.

74
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,760
Get in.

75
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,560
Sit tight,

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,200
we're about to leave.

77
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,240
Let's go.

78
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,120
Let's move.

79
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,200
It's almost winter

80
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,530
and you bring me to the summer pasture.

81
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,960
Lu Hui.

82
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,440
Why are they coming down?

83
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,200
What's going on?

84
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,600
It's the audience participation part.

85
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,400
Dance.

86
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,360
Come on, give it a try.

87
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,040
Do you know how?

88
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,000
It's okay if you don't, come on.

89
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,330
I don't know how either.

90
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,240
Lu Hui.

91
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,160
I like you.

92
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,920
What?

93
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,040
I said I like you.

94
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,720
I didn't hear you.

95
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
I said I like you.

96
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,760
Um, Sansan.

97
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,720
Are you...

98
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,090
really not considering marriage?

99
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,370
Pushing your luck, aren't you?

100
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,480
No.

101
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,000
It's fine,

102
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,640
I'll just keep trying.

103
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,820
That's the spirit.

104
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,840
My mom wants you to come over for dinner.

105
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,240
Sure.

106
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,080
It's so beautiful.

107
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,120
Yilin.

108
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,650
About those three things I promised to help you with,

109
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,480
Samuhar has been found.

110
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,520
What about the other two?

111
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
The second thing,

112
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,320
I've thought of it now.

113
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,760
Be my support.

114
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
The third thing,

115
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,100
we'll talk about it later.

116
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,210
Let's go home first.

117
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,040
What for?

118
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,160
For our date.

119
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,090
What's the date for?

120
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,960
To watch a movie.

121
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,880
Why watch a movie?

122
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,970
To watch a movie.

123
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,720
Don't talk nonsense,

124
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,780
I wasn't planning anything that day.

125
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,360
Were you wearing Xu Sansan's clothes that day,

126
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,880
weren't you?

127
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,960
How did you know?
