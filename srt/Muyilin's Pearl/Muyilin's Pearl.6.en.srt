1
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,760
Officer,

2
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm really sorry

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
for the misunderstanding.

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,960
I apologize.

5
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,120
I'm sorry,

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,490
and I'm sorry to you too.

7
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,520
Mu Yilin,

8
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,800
are you the new tenant?

9
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,960
I'm only staying for one day,

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,130
then I'll leave.

11
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,720
Well,

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,920
I guess that makes us neighbors.

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,720
Um,

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,080
why don't you come out?

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,960
I think there's

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,039
still some misunderstanding between us.

17
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:26,680
I

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,410
can explain it to you in person.

19
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,420
There's no misunderstanding between us at all.

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,080
Hello?

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,360
Okay, I'll be right there.

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,479
I have some urgent business to attend to,

23
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,479
I'll cook dinner for you when I get back tonight.

24
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,009
Make sure you lock the door.

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,160
Come out.

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,690
Moving out is not really an option now.

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,960
I finally found this place

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,420
and I don't even know how long I'll need to stay here.

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,560
Keep my distance,

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,960
I just need to keep my distance from him.

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,040
If I can't handle him,

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,530
I can at least avoid him.

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,960
Bro,

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,520
after your video got all those views,

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
our sales volume has skyrocketed.

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,560
Today we had many customers

37
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
from Kazakhstan coming to stock up.

38
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,970
I'm telling you,

39
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,640
they were showing me that video

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,200
and saying,

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
I want this thing from the video,

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,000
I want that thing from the video.

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
It seems like

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,800
our strategy of driving traffic from overseas online to offline

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
has a lot of potential.

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,320
But...

47
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,720
We don't have weddings to film every day.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,450
That's true.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,420
As for how to implement it,

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,360
let me think about it some more.

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,490
I'm heading out now.

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,520
Lu,

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,980
it's not like you to be so eager to leave work.

54
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,360
I have something to do,

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,820
thanks for your hard work.

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,920
Mu Yilin.

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,620
Let's have dinner together tonight.

58
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,320
Yilin.

59
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,850
Dinner's ready, Yilin.

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,960
You deleted me.

61
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,360
I know what happened

62
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,080
and it made you feel like your privacy was violated.

63
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,610
But I really didn't mean to.

64
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,920
Just give me a chance to explain.

65
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,900
How about this.

66
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,260
I'll share one of my secrets with you,

67
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,600
would that make you feel better?

68
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,960
Ali drank an entire case of my drinks,

69
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,240
and after finishing them, he put the cans

70
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,700
back exactly as they were.

71
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,180
I didn't know that.

72
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,680
I sold that case of drinks.

73
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
And then,

74
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,500
well, you can imagine what happened.

75
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,120
What kind of secret is that?

76
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,560
Wait a minute,

77
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,740
how could Ali be so stupid?

78
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,800
Text message: I'm 6 feet tall.

79
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm 6 feet tall,

80
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,920
and weigh 130 jin.

81
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
But I always tell people

82
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,240
that I weigh 145 jin.

83
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,200
Because if I say I'm heavier,

84
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,760
it makes me look more manly.

85
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,920
Typical man,

86
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,000
what strange logic.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,200
Who cares how tall or heavy you are?

88
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,640
I'm deaf in one ear.

89
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,000
Can't hear from one ear.

90
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,960
Yilin.

91
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,920
Mu Yilin.

92
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,960
The food is getting cold.

93
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
Mu Yilin.

94
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,360
Come.

95
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,240
Have a seat.

96
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,560
Here.

97
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,880
Thank you.

98
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,200
No matter what's happening,

99
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,800
you should never skip a meal.

100
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,360
Try it.

101
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,900
I think my cooking is really good.

102
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,650
How is it?

103
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,760
It's delicious.

104
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,000
Your ear.

105
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,570
My right ear is congenitally deaf.

106
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,240
Right ear.

107
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,920
Actually, today is my 30th birthday.

108
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,580
That's really quite special.

109
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,600
Thank you.

110
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,120
No wonder when I talked to you last time

111
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,250
you didn't respond.

112
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,440
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,290
There's nothing to be sorry about.

114
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,610
When I was in middle school,

115
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,520
I only realized it was considered a disability.

116
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,680
When I was little, I always thought

117
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
that everyone had one ear

118
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,620
that randomly couldn't hear.

119
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,200
Doesn't this affect your daily life?

120
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,400
Not at all.

121
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
So

122
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,440
you don't feel insecure about it?

123
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,440
Not at all.

124
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,240
That's great.

125
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,840
Do all your friends

126
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,559
know about this?

127
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,559
They all know.

128
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,000
Then what kind of secret is this?

129
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,680
Take it easy, Yilin.

130
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,760
Wait, have a seat first.

131
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,840
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
How about this?

133
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,640
This SIM card,

134
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,570
I've been using it for about three months.

135
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,600
I'll

136
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,360
help you accomplish three things you want to do.

137
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,160
How's that?

138
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,840
Do you think you can forgive me this way?

139
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,680
I reluctantly agree.

140
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,920
Great.

141
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,170
The first thing.

142
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,480
The first thing is

143
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,760
I'd like you to help me find what's on this.

144
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,280
This person named Samuhar,

145
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,560
I've asked around about him.

146
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,640
It says here

147
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
that Samuhar owes my mother 100,000 yuan.

148
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,680
I need to get to the bottom of this.

149
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,720
I think we should do this:

150
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,320
tomorrow,

151
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,480
I'll have Ali find a list of people named Samuhar,

152
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,210
and we'll check them one by one.

153
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,800
Find a list of Samuhars.

154
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Sorry to take up a bit of your time. (Kazakh)

155
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,900
She wants to ask you about someone. (Kazakh)

156
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,120
These are all the Samuhars

157
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,250
we could find today.

158
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,080
Ma'am, do you know Pearl?

159
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,360
Grandpa, take a look at this woman,

160
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,040
do you recognize her?

161
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,880
Your name is Samuhar too?

162
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,540
Yes, yes, his name is Samuhar.

163
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,480
Put it down, put it down.

164
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,980
You're sweating a lot.

165
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
So...

166
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,320
Samuhar.

167
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,240
My name is Isser Samuhar.

168
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
Her father's name is Samuhar.

169
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,680
Did your father know

170
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,560
someone named Pearl?

171
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,280
Have you heard him mention her?

172
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,480
No, he passed away many years ago.

173
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,040
Ma'am.

174
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,760
Pearl? No, don't know her,

175
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,620
never seen her.

176
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,440
Thank you.

177
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,820
Yilin, how was the interview?

178
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,760
Xu Sansan.

179
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,400
Xu Sansan.

180
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,930
I've missed you so much.

181
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,280
You're so quick to take action,

182
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,080
arriving here so soon.

183
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,940
Of course, I missed you terribly.

184
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
So Aunt Zhenzhu was in Khorgos,

185
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,360
and she had such a backstory.

186
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,680
But have we lost our lead again?

187
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,760
Yes,

188
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
what should we do?

189
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,200
Hello.

190
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,240
