1
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,040
These are the letters

2
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,970
that were in that small box before.

3
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,600
Ali,

4
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,640
could you help me read

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,000
what's written here?

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,680
I'll read it to you.

7
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,740
Everyone should have at least one dream.

8
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,239
I didn't have one before,

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,880
but after meeting you,

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,200
I finally have a dream,

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,039
which is to wander far away with you.

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,039
This is a love letter.

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,400
Then this one must be

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,530
Aunt Pearl's reply.

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,930
Let me read it to you.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
Dear Samuhar,

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,880
You have such wise eyes

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
that understand everything about me,

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,920
my vibrancy and my emptiness.

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,080
Those eyes penetrate

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,610
the very essence of my soul,

22
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,410
reaching the most authentic me deep within my heart.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
I believe

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,880
I have found

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,800
the love I've been searching for,

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,400
my soulmate.

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,700
Unrestrained,

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,920
passionate,

29
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,960
free.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Yilin, after reading these letters,

31
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,160
I really think it's possible

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,280
that Aunt Pearl

33
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,080
was the one who pursued Samuhar.

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,040
These love letters are so cheesy,

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,770
Samuhar must have been completely love-struck.

36
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,410
So what do you think,

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,000
after our long investigation,

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,000
we can confirm that this Samuhar

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,600
must have been a good person.

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
These letters also prove

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,480
that he was serious about my mother.

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,530
Then what about that 100,000 yuan IOU?

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,760
What's the story behind it?

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,600
Just by reading these letters,

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,640
we still can't fully understand

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,320
the real situation back then.

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,120
Is it true?

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,760
Why aren't any of you answering your phones?

49
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,960
Something happened.

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Our first video just went viral.

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,800
We were flooded with orders by evening.

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,280
But I have to admit a mistake.

53
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,400
I uploaded the wrong video.

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,730
I uploaded both videos.

55
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,160
Both videos?

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
One main video and one behind-the-scenes.

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,120
I uploaded both of them.

58
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,120
And the behind-the-scenes one went viral.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,180
The main video took off along with it.

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,600
Many customers came asking about the product this afternoon.

61
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,930
Where did you post them?

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,850
Everywhere.

63
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,280
I posted on every platform possible.

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,410
Yilin, look at this.

65
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,520
You two are about to blow up.

66
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,320
Don't talk nonsense.

67
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,250
It's true. Everyone's sharing it.

68
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,760
Stop saying that.

69
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,680
Hello, Director Jin.

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,480
I never expected this, Mu Yilin.

71
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,480
You're so dedicated to your work.

72
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,200
I saw that video.

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,760
All the comments say it's beautiful.

74
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,680
They're asking where it is and want to visit.

75
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,360
I told you your plan would work.

76
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,400
Stay a few more days.

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,660
Gather more material.

78
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,560
Director Jin.

79
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,040
I'll have

80
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,960
the salary and travel expenses I owe you

81
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,490
transferred to you by accounting right away.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,730
Pack the goods. What are you standing around for?

83
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,240
Why are you just standing there?

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,080
Don't you want to make money? Hurry up.

85
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,360
Coming!

86
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,220
Package the goods.

87
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,920
Let's go.

88
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,480
Okay.

89
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,010
I'll carry it. Take it slow.

90
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,040
Since I met him,

91
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,330
my luck seems to have improved.

92
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,200
Just a moment!

93
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,200
Hurry up and finish packing,

94
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,930
I'll take you out for something delicious later.

95
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
Packaging and shipping is exhausting.

96
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,400
Indeed.

97
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,600
I swear

98
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,220
I'll order fewer packages in the future.

99
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,720
You're working too hard

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,040
and you should take a break.

101
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,760
Are you crazy?

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,800
By the way,

103
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,080
the Mid-Autumn Festival is coming up soon.

104
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,360
Would you like to celebrate at my place?

105
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,760
You can bring Mu Yilin too,

106
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,360
and I'll ask my dad to make a whole roasted lamb.

107
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,170
Yilin, look at this!

108
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,760
People are already visiting the spot where we filmed our video

109
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,800
to check in.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
Some are even copying

111
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,760
your poses.

112
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,760
Didn't Ali invite you for late-night snacks?

113
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,160
Why aren't you going yet?

114
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,120
I'll ask you one more time,

115
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,040
you're not going?

116
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,080
I'm not hungry at all.

117
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,880
I'll pass.

118
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,810
You two go ahead.

119
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,280
Alright then. Do I look pretty like this?

120
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,800
Drop-dead gorgeous.

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,360
I'm off then. Bye!

122
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,600
Be careful not to gain weight when you get back to Beijing.

123
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,040
The most important thing for you right now

124
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,840
is to take Sansan out for those late-night snacks.

125
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
Right, right,

126
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,650
I almost forgot.

127
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,120
Sansan, are you ready?

128
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,800
Let's go.

129
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,600
Let's go.

130
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,560
Sanmao once said:

131
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,240
My

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,920
love,

133
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,840
if it doesn't come down to dressing, eating,

134
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,600
counting money, sleeping,

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,560
these practical aspects of everyday life,

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,640
it won't last long.

137
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,720
Samuhar bought me a new mattress.

138
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,600
Samuhar said:

139
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,560
I heard people who live in apartments

140
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
all use these,

141
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,160
so I bought one for you too.

142
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,820
To make you more comfortable.

143
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,880
My dear Samuhar,

144
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,940
thank you for everything you've done for me.

145
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,960
Happiness is found in these

146
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,820
little moments of everyday life.

147
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,560
I once told you

148
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,280
how much I love the name Yilin

149
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,760
from San Mao's writings.

150
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,040
It means

151
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,280
vibrant and lively woods,

152
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,080
full of vitality and splendor.

153
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,640
Now being here with you, facing

154
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,760
real grasslands and forests,

155
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,490
surrounded by the overwhelming power of nature,

156
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,280
I finally understand its true meaning.

157
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,640
I hope

158
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,960
we can both be like Yilin, brilliant and passionate,

159
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,680
boldly exploring this burning life.

160
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,240
Brilliant.

161
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,240
Passionate.

162
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,880
Bold.

163
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,080
Mu Yilin.

164
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,960
Have something sweet,

165
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,490
it'll make you feel better.

166
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,080
Thank you.

167
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,280
Tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

168
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,080
I'll take you somewhere nice

169
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,140
to clear your mind.

170
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,370
And do some reconnaissance while we're at it.

171
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,960
How is it? Beautiful, right?

172
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,800
Ali,

173
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,480
aren't you going home for the holiday?

174
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,810
Wherever Sansan is, that's where I'll be.

175
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,440
Come with me.

176
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,740
Where are we going?

177
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,240
Welcome, Xu Sansan,

178
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,400
to beautiful Xinjiang.

179
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
Where are you two going?

180
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,080
Not telling you.

181
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,400
Don't go too far.

182
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,130
Don't worry.

183
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,960
Do you know how to ride?

184
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,760
Of course.

185
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,360
It's a basic life skill.

186
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,960
In Beijing, when I missed the subway,

187
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,920
I relied on this.

188
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,000
How about we

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,200
have a little race then?

190
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,440
Bring it on!

191
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,090
Alright,

192
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,400
get ready.

193
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,840
Three, two.

194
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,800
You're cheating!

195
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Wait for me.

196
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,160
I'm leaving.

197
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,080
Hey!

198
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,640
Wait for me!

199
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Yilin, be careful!

200
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,800
Lu Hui!

201
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,480
Slow down!

202
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,760
Lu Hui!

203
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,880
Ride slower,

204
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,920
wait for me!

205
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,080
Yilin, are you keeping up?

206
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,280
It's okay,

207
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,720
probably just a scratch.

208
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,200
Move aside,

209
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
let me take a look.

210
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,280
Where are you hurt?

211
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,680
Say something. Nothing?

212
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,400
What about your foot?

213
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,280
No, I'm fine.

214
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,540
What's wrong with you?

215
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,800
What's wrong, Lu Hui?

216
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,740
Nothing, I'm fine.

217
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,320
Come on, get up.

218
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,320

219
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,220

220
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,600
Are you feeling unwell?

221
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,400
It's nothing,

222
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,890
really nothing.

223
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,810
Are you okay?

224
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,440
I'm fine.

225
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,400
My hands are fine,

226
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,360
my feet are fine.

227
