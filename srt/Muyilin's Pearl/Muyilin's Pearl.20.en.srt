1
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm sorry, excuse me.

2
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,400
It's okay.

3
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,170
Are you alright?

4
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,880
I'm fine.

5
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,480
Let's go.

6
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,880
Okay.

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,640
I got it.

8
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,920
Thanks.

9
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,400
How's it going?

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,530
Do you have any news?

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,680
With just a name and photo,

12
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,780
we really can't find Samuhar.

13
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,000
It's okay,

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,120
when we get back,

15
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,720
we can expand our search.

16
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,240
Have something to eat first.

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
He should have arrived by now, right?

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,200
Who? Arrived where?

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,360
Chen Peng.

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,920
One million.

21
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,240
I'm here.

22
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,400
My light boat has crossed countless mountains.

23
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,580
Where are the herders?

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,480
Child.

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,120
Is this Hayiche Grassland?

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,329
I don't understand.

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,000
Hayiche Grassland.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Is this the place?

29
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,970
No, it's not. It's not. (In Kazakh)

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,800
Yes.

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,200
Here.

32
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,690
Where are the cattle? The livestock? The people?

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,520
Cattle.

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,840
Cattle.

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
Livestock.

36
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
Where are the people?

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
Winter pasture. (In Kazakh)

38
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,480
Over there.

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,330
It's over there.

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,400
Wait for me

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,940
I'll get you something to eat. Just wait.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,460
What exactly did you tell him?

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,560
I introduced him to a profitable business.

44
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,930
Stay away from Mu Yilin.

45
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,720
Yilin might be someone

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,140
you can trade with for value in your mind.

47
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,800
But for me,

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,130
that's not acceptable.

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,970
Talk. Talk about the business.

50
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,480
I just secured a new distribution channel

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,010
that ordered a large shipment from me.

52
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,560
Our products are in high demand,

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,690
as you already know.

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
It's almost the season

55
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,200
when they sell cattle and sheep,

56
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,440
when consumer spending is at its peak,

57
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,480
understand?

58
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,600
I'll give you an address,

59
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,530
and you take all these goods there.

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,480
Whatever price you sell them for,

61
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,610
if you make a profit,

62
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,980
it's yours to keep.

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
If you lose money,

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,850
I'll cover the loss.

65
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,320
Well...

66
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,120
Okay.

67
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,880
Yilin.

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,480
You rest in the room first,

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,610
I'll go to the store.

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,040
What time do you get off work today?

71
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,560
At ten,

72
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,159
I'll come back right after work.

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,280
Go ahead.

74
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,850
You're here.

75
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,640
Are you

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,400
getting ready for a date?

77
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,560
Not bad, Mu Yilin,

78
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,290
you've finally figured it out.

79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,440
Sansan,

80
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,100
I think I've met the right person.

81
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,240
How so?

82
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,520
I feel like

83
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,850
I haven't misjudged him this time.

84
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,800
Lu Hui

85
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,360
has good values and character,

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,120
and he treats me well too.

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,760
Most importantly,

88
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,320
he respects me a lot

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,200
and has never manipulated me into doing anything.

90
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,360
When I'm with him,

91
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
I always feel

92
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,480
there's a certain strength supporting me,

93
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,850
it's that kind of...

94
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
A confidence I've never had before.

95
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,800
And also,

96
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
Ms. Pearl

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,800
mentioned in her letter,

98
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,320
if love isn't grounded in

99
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,920
eating, dressing, counting money,

100
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,960
sleeping,

101
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,520
all these practical aspects of

102
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,240
everyday life,

103
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,520
it cannot be lasting.

104
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,360
Happiness must be found in these

105
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,760
little mundane things.

106
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,960
When I read this,

107
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
all I could think about was Lu Hui.

108
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,620
That's wonderful.

109
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,360
This kind of relationship is the most comfortable,

110
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,840
and touches the heart the most.

111
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,760
So,

112
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,480
he has already done

113
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,800
so many things for me.

114
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,200
I think

115
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,060
I should do something for him too,

116
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,560
to show him how I feel.

117
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,960
Let me see.

118
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,000
How does it feel?

119
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,720
That's great!

120
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,480
Your sisters will support whatever you do.

121
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,200
The thing is,

122
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,200
this aesthetic vibe you're going for,

123
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,400
just having these things

124
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,560
isn't enough,

125
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,720
you yourself

126
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,000
need to have some aesthetic vibe too.

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,560
Let's go.

128
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,600
Look at this one.

129
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,000
Next outfit.

130
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,320
How about this one?

131
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,820
These are all just everyday clothes,

132
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
don't you have anything

133
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,560
with a bit of aesthetic vibe,

134
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,720
like a cute dress or something?

135
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,760
I do have dresses.

136
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,880
This won't work. It's not suitable.

137
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,040
This time you need to wear something

138
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,120
that will make Lu Hui

139
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,000
immediately impressed,

140
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,260
something that makes his heart race.

141
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,530
Wear something of mine,

142
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm sure there's something suitable.

143
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,520
Let me take a look.

144
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,560
This...

145
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
It doesn't seem quite appropriate.

146
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,280
I know what to do.

147
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,480
I have a precious item

148
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,440
that I've been saving

149
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,500
that I can't even bear to wear myself.

150
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,080
Take good care of it.

151
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,840
Here.

152
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,040
This...

153
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,560
It looks great. Absolutely stunning.

154
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,800
Isn't this too revealing?

155
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
It looks so good!

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,160
What do you mean revealing?

157
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,600
Everything is showing!

158
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,280
I think it's fine.

159
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,720
It really looks good.

160
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,520
He'll definitely be impressed.

161
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,850
Alright.

162
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,400
Now eating, dressing, counting money -

163
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,200
I'm not worried about any of it anymore.

164
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,080
So,

165
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,760
let's

166
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,040
now

167
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,120
talk about

168
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,360
the atmosphere of this section.

169
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,920
Xu Sansan.

170
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,040
Time to go home.

171
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,760
Work's over.

172
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,000
What's this?

173
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,760
Lu Hui.

174
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,880
Since I met you,

175
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,280
I feel like I've gradually

176
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,560
changed in some ways.

177
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,160
These changes

178
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,480
make me feel surprised

179
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,520
and comfortable.

180
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,280
You know I'm not good at expressing myself,

181
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,050
but I understand how you feel about me.

182
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,880
So,

183
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,020
I've decided to take the initiative for once

184
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,760
and follow my heart.

185
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,280
Let's go on a date.

186
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,920
You bought cake too?

187
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,780
You've been working too hard lately.

188
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,120
Didn't I tell you before

189
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,560
that eating something sweet

190
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,090
would make you feel better?

191
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,490
That's perfect,

192
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,520
we have two cakes,

193
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,940
one wish for each of us.

194
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,120
Make a wish.

195
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,320
Two, three.

196
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,090
Don't ask what I wished for.

197
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,740
I'll tell you if it comes true.

198
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,640
Now,

199
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,850
for the second part of our date,

200
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,740
let's watch a movie together.

201
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,600
Resources are limited,

202
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,920
so we'll use this.

203
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,160
Look,

204
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,490
this one.

205
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,410
Sounds good.

206
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,120
While watching the movie,

207
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,880
you need to introduce the main theme.

208
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,720
To put it bluntly,

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,660
throw yourself into his arms.

210
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,360
First.

211
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,720
Casually,

212
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,000
quietly,

213
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,880
rest your head on his shoulder.

214
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,360
Then slowly move your hand

215
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,640
and naturally embrace him,

216
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,600
his broad chest.

217
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,480
Is this right?

218
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,000
How does Sansan make it look so smooth.

219
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,640
And then at this moment.

220
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,800
Legs, slowly move closer.

221
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,680
At this point,

222
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,540
you don't need to do anything,

223
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,560
just feel each other's breathing and heartbeat.

224
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,920
Finally,

225
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,420
you need to whisper something to him.

226
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,880
Why don't

227
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,320
we go inside?

228
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,720
Or else.

229
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,600
Maybe we should go inside.

230
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,120
Okay.

231
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,920
Wait.

232
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
My foot's asleep.

233
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,320
Foot's asleep.

234
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,520
Let me help you.

235
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,160
I'm fine.

236
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,360
Come on, take it slow,

237
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,000
easy now.

238
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,960
Are you okay?

239
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,490
I'm fine.

240
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,440
Is Mu Yilin home?

241
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,000
Who is it?

242
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,720
Let's go down and see.

243
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,080
Take it slow.

244
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,010
Hello, who are you looking for?

245
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,400
Are you Mu Yilin?

246
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,520
I am.

247
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,180
What's your relationship with Zhenzhu?

248
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,320
Zhenzhu is my mother.
