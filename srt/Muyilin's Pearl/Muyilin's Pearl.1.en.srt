1
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,200
Yilin.

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,080
Wait a moment.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Why are you here?

4
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,840
Your brother is getting married.

5
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,640
Your aunt and I have discussed it

6
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,240
and decided to sell the old house where your mother and I used to live.

7
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,300
These are your mother's belongings.

8
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,000
You told us not to touch them.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,160
Now that the house is sold,

10
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,820
there's nowhere to keep them.

11
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,760
Yilin.

12
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,760
Your mother

13
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,570
has been gone for so many years now.

14
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
I, your father,

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,200
have found a new life.

16
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,170
You should let go too

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,720
and start looking for your own new life.

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,960
Start a new life.

19
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
My mother died when I was ten.

20
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,900
Where were you?

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,580
You were getting married.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,860
Haven't you already started your new life long ago?

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,800
Dad, hurry up.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,600
Coming.

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,880
Let's go.

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,280
Starting a new life.

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,100
What do I have to start a new life with?

28
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Hello?

29
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,079
Ms. Mu Yilin, hello.

30
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,520
This is Yuanding Cemetery in Khorgos.

31
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,160
Your mother Pearl's grave in Khorgos

32
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,890
has maintenance fees due soon.

33
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
We found you through household registration records,

34
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,920
please confirm if you'll be renewing the payment.

35
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,960
I'm begging you,

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,880
stop scamming me.

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,360
I really don't have any money,

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,890
and my mother has never even been to Xinjiang.

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,120
Wait a second. What did you just say

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
was the location?

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,690
This is Yuanding Cemetery in Khorgos.

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,880
Yuanding Cemetery.

43
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
How could there be a cemetery there?

44
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,440
Is she okay?

45
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,600
In all these years, someone getting knocked out

46
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,860
after bumping into a horse is quite rare.

47
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,240
She's awake.

48
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,159
Help her up.

49
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,490
Are you alright?

50
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,960
I'm fine.

51
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,080
Why did you come to this place alone?

52
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,410
Did you lose your sheep?

53
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,600
I came here looking for a tomb.

54
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,160
A tomb?

55
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
How could there possibly be tombs on the grassland?

56
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,400
Have you ever seen

57
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,600
any tombs on the vast grassland?

58
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,160
I really am here to find a tomb.

59
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,090
I'm here to find my mother's grave.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This place...

61
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,060
seems familiar to me somehow.

62
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,440
According to the name, it should be here,

63
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,100
but it's not on the grassland.

64
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,330
I'll take you there.

65
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,040
What are you standing there for? Let's go.

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,720
Come on,

67
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,000
thank you.

68
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,159
Let's go.

69
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,240
Goodbye.

70
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,000
Goodbye.

71
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,240
Three, two, one, go!

72
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,400
Slow down.

73
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,920
Yernur,

74
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,680
congratulations on your marriage.

75
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,400
Thank you,

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,130
good luck to you too.

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,720
Hold on tight!

78
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,680
Hiya!

79
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,960
Slow down!

80
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,240
Let me.

81
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,480
Yongji.

82
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,880
Yuangao.

83
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh my goodness,

84
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,040
you really do have a grave here.

85
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,760
What do you mean by this?

86
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,600
Didn't you say we needed to open the tomb?

87
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,920
I saw they had shovels over there,

88
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,980
so I borrowed them.

89
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,120
Hey.

90
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,640
Are you sure your mother isn't buried here?

91
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,680
I'm sure.

92
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

93
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,490
It's okay, don't worry.

94
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,240
Are you hurt?

95
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,240
I might have accidentally hit a rock just now,

96
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,500
it's nothing serious.

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,880
Wait a moment.

98
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,360
This wound needs to be treated right away,

99
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,040
otherwise in this hot weather,

100
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,770
it could get infected quickly.

101
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,320
What are you standing there for?

102
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,980
Squat down!

103
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
Where are you hurt?

104
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,720
Let me see.

105
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,080
It's fine,

106
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,159
just a small scrape.

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
This is alcohol,

108
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,480
it might sting a little when I spray it,

109
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,540
try to bear with it.

110
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,680
Okay.

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,560
Done.

112
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,000
Thanks.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,680
No problem.

114
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,410
Why do you carry these things with you?

115
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,240
In the tourism industry,

116
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
these are just the basics.

117
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,240
Because you never know

118
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,400
when tourists might

119
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,400
have some kind of emergency.

120
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's go.

121
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,680
Hey, Grandpa,

122
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,920
has my mom ever been to Khorgos?

123
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,200
Yes, she has.

124
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,440
What did she go there for?

125
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,640
She ran away from home.

126
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,400
Ran away.
