1
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,680
If a young man doesn't dance the Black Horse,

2
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,880
how can he be handsome and dashing?

3
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,840
If a young lady doesn't dance the Black Horse,

4
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,920
who will unlock her heart of love?

5
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,760
A wedding without the Black Horse dance.

6
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,480
Mu Yilin.

7
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Come on, join us.

8
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,000
Lu Hui, I really can't.

9
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,000
I can't do it, I can't.

10
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,440
Put this on and let yourself go.

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,920
Who will unlock the heart of love?

12
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,360
You're awake.

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,680
Here, have some water.

14
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,520
Thank you.

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,720
I drank too much earlier.

16
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,580
You could say that.

17
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,880
So how did I end up drunk?

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
Let me ask you

19
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,579
something.

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
One drink.

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
One question,

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,600
dare you?

23
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,360
Why wouldn't I dare?

24
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,079
Go ahead.

25
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,480
Yilin, you

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,600
should

27
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,280
stay quiet.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,760
Alright.

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,720
Fine.

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,200
Have you ever

31
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,400
seen it before?

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,640
I truly haven't seen it.

33
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,320
It's fine,

34
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,000
I can figure it out myself anyway.

35
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,410
She can really hold her liquor.

36
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,079
Right?

37
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,540
I think I can drink quite a lot too.

38
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,120
This is my first time,

39
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,400
my first time

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
drinking this much alcohol.

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,160
Back when I was in Beijing,

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,520
I had some colleagues there too.

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,440
But those colleagues of mine,

44
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,760
whenever they went out drinking,

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
they never invited me along.

46
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,040
I also had a boss.

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,640
That boss of mine

48
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,040
was completely stubborn.

49
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,240
I

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,960
worked my fingers to the bone, staying up all night

51
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,480
for a full

52
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,770
three months on a proposal.

53
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,320
She just rejected it without a second thought,

54
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,650
showing no respect at all for my hard work.

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,880
Let's go.

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,680
You're still drinking?

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,800
Come on, let's go.

58
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,400
Ali.

59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,360
I'm not going.

60
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,519
I'm coming.

61
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,000
What's

62
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,120
what's going on with this?

63
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,600
Did you win?

64
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
I won.

65
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,200
Little lamb,

66
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,080
you're mine now.

67
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,560
Let's go.

68
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,920
The whole grassland is ours.

69
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,120
Uncle,

70
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,080
what's up?

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,280
You like her.

72
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
This is the sheep I won.

73
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,640
Come on,

74
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,640
you definitely do.

75
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Lu Hui, look.

76
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,080
This is the sheep I won.

77
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,120
Slow down.

78
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,200
Let me ask you,

79
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,800
have you ever seen my mother?

80
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,560
Never mind,

81
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,250
you probably haven't seen her either.

82
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,600
No one has ever seen her.

83
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,890
Could you please stop staring at me like that?

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,120
Okay,

85
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm fine now.

86
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,520
Let me make a deal with you.

87
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,320
Could you

88
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,160
just pretend that nothing happened today,

89
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,880
and that you've never seen me before?

90
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,760
Thank you.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,120
Yilin, wait,

92
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,450
there's one more thing.

93
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,480
Grandma

94
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,920
please have some tea.

95
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,880
According to the year you mentioned,

96
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,160
this grandmother might know your mother,

97
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,960
let's ask her.

98
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,480
Please take a look.

99
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,810
Do you recognize this person in the photo?

100
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,480
I've seen this person before,

101
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,560
she's Samukhar's wife, Zhenzhu.

102
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,400
Samukhar... Zhenzhu.

103
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,850
You understand what she's saying?

104
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,600
A little bit.

105
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,120
I think I just heard her say Zhenzhu.

106
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,680
Yes.

107
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,280
My mother's name is Zhenzhu.

108
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,760
Let me ask her again for you.

109
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,420
Could you please repeat that?

110
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,120
I saw her thirty years ago,

111
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,600
Samukhar's wife, Zhenzhu.

112
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,720
So,

113
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,560
the grandmother says

114
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,360
thirty years ago,

115
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,680
she met the woman in this photo.

116
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,560
Her name was Zhenzhu.

117
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,320
Really?

118
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,720
She was Samukhar's wife.

119
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,720
My mother was married.

120
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,240
Where is this girl from?

121
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,360
From a city called Lianyungang.

122
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,800
Where is that city?

123
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,640
A city from a very distant place.

124
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,240
This is my first time seeing

125
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,060
a girl from such a big city.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,040
She is truly beautiful.

127
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,080
As you said,

128
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,299
she is indeed very beautiful.

129
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,280
Let's dance together.

130
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,680
The sunset light

131
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,120
shines upon your body.

132
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,920
At that moment, time stops,

133
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,210
leaving only the sound of our heartbeats.
