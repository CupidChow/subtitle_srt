1
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,240
Samukhar (Kazakh language)

2
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,050
Ayim (Kazakh language)

3
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,370
Ayim (Kazakh language)

4
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,000
When I was young

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,039
I was indeed engaged to Samukhar.

6
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,640
I believe that in this world

7
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,300
I was the one who loved Samukhar the most.

8
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
Until your mother appeared.

9
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,120
Dear Samukhar,

10
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,000
thank you for telling me

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,560
about you and Ayim.

12
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,880
You know,

13
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,240
the love I want is

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,160
absolute

15
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,680
and pure.

16
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,920
I know you feel the same way.

17
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,040
I have never doubted

18
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,280
your love for me.

19
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,480
But I also hope

20
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,200
you can resolve this matter properly.

21
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,079
Because nothing is more precious

22
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,460
than one's first love.

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,400
She will certainly be hurt,

24
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,079
but I won't lose you.

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,880
If you handle it well,

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,380
I'll wait for you at the trading area.

27
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,280
Pearl.

28
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,100
Father (Kazakh language)

29
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,560
Samukhar (Kazakh language)

30
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,840
I want to ask you something (Kazakh language)

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,300
If a girl and boy are in love with each other (Kazakh language),

32
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,920
they like each other (Kazakh language),

33
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,120
what should they do (Kazakh language)?

34
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
Then that boy should (Kazakh language)

35
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,920
be responsible for that girl (Kazakh language),

36
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,380
love and take care of her (Kazakh language).

37
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,500
But what if (Kazakh language)

38
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,450
this boy (Kazakh language)

39
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
is already engaged (Kazakh language),

40
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,460
what should he do (Kazakh language)?

41
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,300
Are you talking about yourself (Kazakh language)?

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,640
Yes, Father (Kazakh language).

43
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,200
She likes me (Kazakh language),

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,560
and I like her too (Kazakh language),

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I think I've fallen in love with her (Kazakh language).

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,760
What's wrong with you (Kazakh language)?

47
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,290
What nonsense about love (Kazakh language)?

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,160
Samukhar (Kazakh language)

49
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,840
I know (Kazakh language)

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,930
you don't have feelings for Ayim (Kazakh language).

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,840
But Ayim is also a good girl (Kazakh language).

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,400
We shouldn't hold her happiness hostage (Kazakh language).

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Where are you going (Kazakh language)?

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,860
Where can I go (Kazakh language)?

55
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,720
To Ayim's father's house (Kazakh language),

56
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,839
to apologize to them (Kazakh language),

57
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,760
and seek their forgiveness (Kazakh language).

58
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,840
What if this girl (Kazakh language)

59
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,700
is not Kazakh (Kazakh language)?

60
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,840
Samukhar brother (Kazakh)

61
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,300
Why are you here? (Kazakh)

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Ayim (Kazakh)

63
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,160
There's something I need to make clear to you. (Kazakh)

64
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,880
I've always seen you as a little sister. (Kazakh)

65
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,080
You're probably still young (Kazakh)

66
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,800
and don't understand romantic feelings between men and women. (Kazakh)

67
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,040
But because of our family connection (Kazakh)

68
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,040
you've misunderstood your feelings for me. (Kazakh)

69
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,880
Who are you talking about (Kazakh)

70
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,680
Zhenzhu?

71
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,570
I wish you happiness. (Kazakh)

72
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,800
Feel free to look at whichever one you like.

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,060
Yes, you can browse through all of these.

74
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,040
She is...

75
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,640
She is Ayim.

76
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,920
I want to see what kind of woman

77
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,720
you're interested in. (Kazakh)

78
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,840
Brother Samuhar. (Kazakh)

79
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,520
What's so special about her? (Kazakh)

80
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,920
Can she ride horses? (Kazakh)

81
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Can she drink? (Kazakh)

82
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,120
Can she live with you in a yurt? (Kazakh)

83
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,140
What is she saying?

84
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,570
She says you're beautiful.

85
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,020
Then she's asking if you can drink

86
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,600
and if you can ride horses.

87
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
Of course I can.

88
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,780
Ayim. (Kazakh)

89
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,700
Do you dare to compete with me?

90
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,640
If I win,

91
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,170
you'll give up on Samuhar completely.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,600
I...

93
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,760
I dare.

94
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,330
Don't drink.

95
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
I'm fine.

96
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,880
For your sake, I must beat her.

97
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,080
I'll drink with you.

98
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,640
I'm doing this for him,

99
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,840
and I'm doing it for you too,

100
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,240
you know?

101
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,800
I will never give Samuhar

102
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,440
to anyone else.

103
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
Because he has already given me

104
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,480
so much.

105
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,040
I must also give my all for him.

106
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,920
But,

107
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,280
you're a good girl too.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let me tell you,

109
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,760
don't waste your time and life

110
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,040
on someone who doesn't like you.

111
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:14,880
She...

112
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,080
I won,

113
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,280
Samuhar, I won!

114
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,440
When I touched the last glass,

115
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,520
I knew I had lost.

116
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,080
So...

117
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,960
Just one glass short.

118
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,600
What I lost wasn't that glass of alcohol,

119
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,880
but Pearl's persistence and courage

120
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,120
toward love and life.

121
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,880
What's your real name?

122
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Ayim.

123
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,960
Ayim.

124
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,480
My name means

125
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,320
moon.

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,640
The moon,

127
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,680
when the sun shines brightly,

128
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,280
it cannot appear.

129
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,200
Pearl

130
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,800
is the sun.

131
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,680
So later on,

132
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,880
did you really lose contact?

133
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,800
No,

134
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,640
later your mother and I

135
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,320
came to the trading zone.

136
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,760
I don't know how to do business here,

137
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,000
so I opened a bar here.

138
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,720
She often came here with Samuhar

139
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
to drink.

140
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,170
I don't know from which day,

141
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,520
Samuhar and Pearl

142
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,960
never appeared again.

143
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,880
So I've been keeping this

144
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,000
Sunset Bar.

145
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,840
Waiting.

146
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,080
For my Samuhar, I suppose.

147
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,160
Ayimu.

148
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,080
You've kept this love for so many years,

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,860
was it worth it?

150
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,000
Let's go home.

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,800
Home.

152
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,400
Why not tell them?

153
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,560
Some answers should be found on their own.

154
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,640
I think

155
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,840
they'll find it soon.

156
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,080
Do you know

157
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,960
where Samuhar went afterward?

158
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,760
I heard he went abroad,

159
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,920
or perhaps

160
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,300
to some place very, very far away.

161
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,690
Why is the water shut off again?

162
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,810
There's water here.

163
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,820
Is the water off in the room again?

164
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,450
Wait for me a moment.
