1
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,720
eeeo Chaos

2
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,400
Lu Hui

3
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,160
Today we're shooting this product,

4
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,640
take a look if you're familiar with it.

5
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,319
This spot with the red and blue lines

6
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,440
is your mark,

7
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,840
stand here and don't move,

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,240
then clearly explain the product's advantages

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,000
and that's all.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,480
Okay.

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,720
I have a question,

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Yilin, um...

13
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,480
Jia Dan.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,460
How's it going on your end?

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,560
Let me check.

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,800
The focus is about right.

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
We're recording.

18
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,240
I'm ready.

19
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,560
Three.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,080
Two.

21
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,240
Trekking through the Tianshan Mountains,

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,440
drinking from the snow melt,

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,800
Xinjiang beef is simply the best.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,240
Good.

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,520
I'll check the script

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,640
to see if we missed any shots.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,760
Okay.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,720
Yilin.

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,120
Yilin.

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,840
I know last night

31
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,160
we missed a step.

32
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,880
So

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,580
I want to formally tell you today.

34
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,040
I feel like

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,160
there's always been this kind of

36
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,760
destined energy between us.

37
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,440
That's why I met you.

38
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,220
I can't really explain

39
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,960
if it's the butterflies in my stomach

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,720
or this sweet rush of feelings.

41
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,120
Whenever I'm with you,

42
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,720
I feel happy,

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,320
relaxed,

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,400
and safe.

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,560
Good, that's all set.

46
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,400
Jia Dan,

47
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,440
check the footage

48
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,640
and export it.

49
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,800
For the pacing,

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,360
just edit it according to what I told you before.

51
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
I'll load these things into the car first,

52
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
please pack up the equipment.

53
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

54
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,720
Yilin.

55
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,200
I have something to tell you.

56
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,760
I know.

57
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,040
Last night we were just missing

58
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,160
the final step.

59
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,360
So,

60
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,400
I want to formally tell you today.

61
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,440
Wait, Lu Hui.

62
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,400
I know what you want to say.

63
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,960
I can feel your feelings for me.

64
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,400
It's just that I haven't figured out

65
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
what my feelings for you really are.

66
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm really afraid

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,520
that I might just be caught up in something new,

68
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,400
acting on impulse.

69
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,520
I...

70
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,120
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,120
I know you so well.

72
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,120
We've known each other for a long time.

73
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,570
I found a super delicious new flavor of instant noodles.

74
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,200
They didn't invite me to the company dinner again.

75
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,520
I wouldn't go anyway.

76
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,000
Drinking juice alone

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,530
is better than clinking glasses with a crowd.

78
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,860
Being by myself is the most comfortable.

79
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,560
Dusk

80
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,960
is when people head home.

81
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,640
Mom,

82
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,730
does a rented apartment count as home?

83
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,330
It seems that when the sun sets,

84
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,650
people always feel inexplicably sad.

85
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
But it's okay,

86
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,320
tomorrow is a new beginning.

87
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,720
Yilin.

88
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,920
Yilin.

89
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,200
What's wrong with you?

90
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,520
Talk to me.

91
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,600
I rejected him.

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,730
Did he formally confess to you?

93
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,280
To be precise,

94
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,640
I didn't even let him say it out loud

95
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,120
before I rejected him.

96
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,600
Sansan,

97
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,200
I said some harsh things to him today,

98
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,840
and I'm afraid I might have hurt him.

99
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,170
So that's what you've been worried about.

100
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,960
Lu Hui.

101
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,320
About Yilin...

102
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,840
If she says something to you,

103
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,920
don't take it the wrong way.

104
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,320
She's just not good at expressing herself,

105
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,960
but she's truly

106
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,760
an incredibly kind girl.

107
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,559
I know.

108
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
She's had a tough life,

109
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,159
dealing with her unreliable father

110
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,200
and that irresponsible ex-boyfriend of hers.

111
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,040
No,

112
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,920
what I mean is

113
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,840
she's had no one to rely on since childhood.

114
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,960
Living on her own,

115
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,490
working by herself,

116
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,760
doing everything all alone.

117
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,480
So,

118
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,890
please give her a little more time.

119
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,600
No.

120
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,960
I think it's my fault.

121
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,600
This whole thing

122
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,080
was just too sudden.

123
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,200
I didn't consider her feelings.

124
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,260
I can't just talk about it,

125
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
I need to prove myself with actions.

126
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,400
At the very least, we should get to know each other better,

127
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,040
right?

128
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,420
Most importantly,

129
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,240
I need to

130
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,680
fulfill the promises I made to her,

131
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,610
don't you think?

132
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,520
So,

133
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,360
I'll cook for you guys first,

134
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
wait for me.

135
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,530
Is his thinking always this clear?

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,680
Yilin.

137
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,840
I'll get in the car first.

138
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,720
Okay, I'll be right there.

139
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,360
Okay.

140
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,960
Yilin.

141
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,640
Yilin.

142
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,760
Get in.

143
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,960
Yilin.

144
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,560
We've actually been overlooking

145
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
a very close lead.

146
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,640
There's a bar called Sunset in the city

147
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,300
that's been open for 30 years.

148
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,600
I feel like your mother

149
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,860
might have been there.

150
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,240
Let's go then.

151
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,140
She's the owner of this place.

152
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,160
Everyone says she's very mysterious,

153
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,080
no one knows about her past.

154
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,080
When I first met her,

155
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,940
she was already running this bar.

156
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,380
Later, this place became a popular spot.

157
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,420
The most amazing thing is,

158
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
nobody knows her real name.

159
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,760
Everyone just calls her

160
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,600
One More Glass

161
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,980
One drink, please.

162
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,760
Thank you.

163
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,320
What can I do for you?

164
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,320
I wanted to ask

165
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,120
if you know Samuhar.

166
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,160
I... I do know him. Why?

167
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,290
Is something wrong?

168
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,960
Well,

169
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,840
I have an IOU here

170
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,080
which states that

171
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,240
Samuhar owes my mother 100,000 yuan.

172
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,680
Kid,

173
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,810
this has already

174
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,920
expired.

175
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,840
I know.

176
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,160
But

177
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,360
I still want to get to the bottom of this.

178
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,440
Although I don't know

179
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,300
exactly what happened back then,

180
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,320
or why

181
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,960
he ended up owing this money.

182
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,280
Is it possible that

183
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,960
my mother was deceived?

184
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,650
Your mother wasn't that naive.

185
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
I heard that

186
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,960
after your mother met Samuhar,

187
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,520
she even demanded a house from him.

188
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Cars, houses.

189
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,500
Do you have any?

190
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,040
Buy me a house.

191
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,450
That's impossible.

192
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,580
My mother couldn't possibly be the kind of person you're describing.

193
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,800
Were you close to her?

194
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,400
She was my love rival.

195
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Are you Zhenzhu?

196
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,640
Yes.

197
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,680
Samuhar is my man.

198
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,680
Ayim,

199
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
stop making trouble,

200
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,480
go back now.

201
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Brother Samuhar,

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,160
I've loved you for so many years,

203
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,080
why have you suddenly been

204
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,120
taken away by this woman?

205
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,200
I'm not an object

206
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,400
that can be taken away.

207
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Stop making a scene here and go home.

208
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,130
What are you talking about?

209
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
Nothing, I'm just telling her to go home.

210
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
I'm not leaving.

211
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,560
What's so good about her?

212
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Can she ride a horse?

213
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Can she drink?

214
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,730
Can she live with you in a yurt forever?

215
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,000
Do you dare to compete with me?

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
Whoever wins gets Samuhar.

217
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,520
Fine.

218
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,000
She deliberately kissed

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
Samuhar right in front of me.

220
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,480
Aunt Pearl

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,730
is that bold?

222
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,200
Impossible.

223
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,730
She's never even initiated a kiss with my dad.

224
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,960
Do you

225
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,120
know where Samuhar is now?

226
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,280
No idea.

227
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,610
I don't keep in touch

228
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,240
with men who abandoned me.

229
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,100
One more drink.

230
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,440
I'm getting busy now,

231
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,720
you should head back.

232
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,720
Let's go.

233
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,400
Let's go.

234
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,040
Try this.

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,530

236
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,680
