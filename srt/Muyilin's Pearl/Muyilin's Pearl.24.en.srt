00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,800
Lu Hui.

2
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,240
Lu Hui.

3
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,440
Lu Hui.

4
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,280
Lu Hui.

5
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,079
Lu Hui.

6
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,880
Lu Hui.

7
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,000
Lu Hui.

8
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,800
Lu Hui, where are you?

9
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,720
Lu Hui.

10
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Lu Hui.

11
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,560
Lu Hui, where on earth are you? Lu Hui!

12
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
Lu Hui.

13
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,320
Yilin.

14
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,399
Lu Hui.

15
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,200
Lu Hui.

16
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Lu Hui.

17
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Lu Hui.

18
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,680
Lu Hui.

19
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,840
Yilin.

20
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,680
I'm glad you're okay.

21
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,800
You scared me to death.

22
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,760
Do you know

23
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,720
when I saw that car just now,

24
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,159
I was terrified.

25
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,320
I'm fine.

26
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,740
This is for you.

27
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,200
Look at the situation you're in,

28
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,400
and you're still smiling like an idiot.

29
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,880
Are you sure you're okay?

30
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,040
I'm fine.

31
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,160
I think I just

32
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
bumped my head a little.

33
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,840
I can still walk.

34
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,560
Let's go home.

35
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,360
Giddyup!

36
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,200
Jia Dan.

37
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,930
There's something I need to

38
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
officially inform you about today,

39
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,240
Manager Jia.

40
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,220
This shop is now in your hands.

41
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,640
Lu,

42
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,540
I'll take care of the shop,

43
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,409
don't worry.

44
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,280
But...

45
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,640
Manager Jia!

46
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,000
From now on,

47
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,760
you are this shop's

48
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,960
official partner.

49
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,920
Yilin,

50
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,159
I'm sorry.

51
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,419
There's a whistle.

52
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,440
Why are you here?

53
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,940
I'm here to pick up my girlfriend.

54
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,280
Yilin.

55
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,370
I've prepared the penalty fee for you.

56
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,200
Of course,

57
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,160
I know if I give it to you directly,

58
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,680
you definitely won't take it.

59
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,520
So,

60
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,210
I've come up with a second plan.

61
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,040
Starting today,

62
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,090
I'm going to stick to you like glue.

63
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,840
The shop

64
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,520
is running smoothly now,

65
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
and I've arranged everything with Jia Dan.

66
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,480
Now,

67
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,160
wherever you go,

68
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
I'll follow.

69
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,560
Do you remember the wish you made

70
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,440
when you blew out the candles last time?

71
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,100
Looks like it's come true now.

72
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,400
Yes.

73
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,320
I hope Lu Hui

74
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,240
has success in his career

75
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,610
and can fulfill his dreams.

76
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,020
What about you?

77
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,160
My wish was

78
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,160
for Mu Yilin to succeed

79
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,280
and find her own dream.

80
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,120
Well, if that's the case

81
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
your wish

82
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,320
has probably come true too.

83
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,560
General Manager Employment Contract.

84
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,680
Yilin

85
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,540
your project has great potential

86
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,120
and they're quite optimistic about it.

87
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,840
Horgos

88
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,640
will be the implementation city

89
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,760
so sign the new contract.

90
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,660
Congratulations, Yilin.

91
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,480
Thank you, Director Xin.

92
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,650
However, I'm afraid

93
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,250
you can't join the overseas team anymore.

94
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,690
By the way

95
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,170
Director Jin played

96
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,640
a crucial role in making this project happen.

97
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,560
She's been

98
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,620
advocating for you at headquarters.

99
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,680
Director Jin?

100
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,080
Director Jin?

101
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes.

102
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,720
So

103
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,360
now you need to help me with the third thing.

104
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,600
So

105
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,640
what is it?

106
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,920
Take me back to

107
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,080
Horgos.

108
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,880
Everything's packed this time.

109
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,760
Get in.

110
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,600
Wutiao

111
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,080
we're leaving now, Wutiao.

112
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,440
Goodbye, Wutiao

113
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
we're going back to the grasslands.

114
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
