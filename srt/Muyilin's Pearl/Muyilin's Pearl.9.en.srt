1
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,240
Come take a look

2
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
at the best bags in the trading zone.

3
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,400
Come see

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,360
these bags from Lianyungang port,

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,840
you won't find them anywhere else here,

6
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,600
and they're made with the latest materials.

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,440
Let me see.

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,000
Which one do you like?

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,850
Let me check.

10
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,600
My mom is so amazing,

11
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,800
she took this batch of salvaged goods

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,260
and made them a hot seller.

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,970
Yes, indeed.

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,240
Your mother seemed to have

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,900
endless energy and strength.

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,840
Such a tiny young woman

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,300
carrying all those goods.

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,320
Back then,

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,620
she caused quite a sensation.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,440
The goods from our place

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,900
sold extremely well here.

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,400
After just a few days,

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,000
I had to go back to Lianyungang to restock for her.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,960
And just like that,

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
I made several trips back and forth.

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,600
So,

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,780
what about my mother and Samuhar?

28
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,479
Later on,

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,130
I was busy transporting goods.

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,460
As for the details,

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
I'm not sure.

32
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,720
Let's go.

33
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,730
Let's go.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,480
Didn't that man just say

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,600
that the yurt should be

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,560
somewhere in this area?

37
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,020
Even though it's a bit far,

38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,280
I still want to go check it out.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,410
Is that okay?

40
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
No problem.

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,000
Then

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,220
let's head out.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,520
Here.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,480
Thank you.

45
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,360
Why do you think they suddenly

46
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,000
implemented traffic control?

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,040
The road conditions in that mountain area

48
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,360
are quite complicated to begin with.

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,090
There are often falling rocks,

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,280
and most importantly, it's tourist season now.

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,210
It's probably for safety reasons.

52
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
It's all my fault.

53
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,480
If I hadn't insisted on coming here,

54
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,540
we wouldn't be stranded here now.

55
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,420
What are you sorry for?

57
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,840
No one could have predicted they'd close the road.

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
But coming here

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,080
is actually quite nice.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,740
This kind of experience is pretty interesting.

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,920
So tonight, the two of us

62
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,050
need to find somewhere to stay, right?

63
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,680
In this area around here,

64
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,320
there aren't any hotels.

65
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,040
How about this:

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,000
we could ask some local herders

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,560
if we can stay in their yurt for the night.

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
What do you think?

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,480
Let's not.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,080
We shouldn't trouble the herders.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,800
How about

72
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,409
we just make do in the car for one night?

73
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,890
Would that work for you?

74
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,980
Are you hungry?

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,410
A little bit.

76
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,420
So this is the border gate.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,400
This is the sixth-generation border gate.

78
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,400
Across from here is Kazakhstan.

79
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,480
Do you like it?

80
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,320
Actually,

81
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,240
I haven't been back to China

82
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,760
for almost two years now.

83
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,530
It feels so much safer being back in our homeland.

84
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,860
This is my first time visiting a border city.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
So this is what it feels like.

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,260
Let's sit down for a while.

87
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,240
Sansan,

88
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,560
do you...

89
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,290
Do you have a boyfriend?

90
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,520
No, I don't.

91
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Why do you ask?

92
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,200
No, nothing.

93
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,130
I'm just asking.

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,640
You're so pretty,

95
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,000
and you don't have a boyfriend.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,960
That's great!

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,200
No, no, no.

98
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,160
I...

99
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,040
I didn't mean... um...

100
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,200
What are you laughing at?

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,160
I...

102
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,840
can't help it.

103
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,040
What are you thinking about?

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,800
Nothing.

105
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
You can tell me.

106
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,240
I just feel that

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,960
the differences between people

108
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,690
are really quite significant.

109
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,330
Why did you suddenly think of that?

110
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,080
Like you,

111
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,320
no matter what happens,

112
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,780
you can always solve it optimistically.

113
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,360
And

114
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,720
you can always find

115
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,600
simple and happy ways to do it.

116
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
Everyone has different strengths.

117
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,800
As for me,

118
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,760
whether I'm happy or not,

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,360
each day passes all the same.

120
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,040
So I might as well be happy

121
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,420
and not overthink things.

122
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,100
It's ready now. Let's eat.

123
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
Are the eggs done?

124
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,850
I'll try the noodles first.

125
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,840
This is the best instant noodles I've ever had.

126
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,520
Yilin.

127
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,960
Stars.

128
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Where are the stars?

129
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,000
Here.

130
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,040
And over here too.

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,880
Why can't I see any of them?

132
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,560
Look, over here, and this whole area.

133
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,960
Aren't they everywhere?

134
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,160
Try this.

135
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,090
Follow the direction of my finger.

136
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,960
Can you see it?

137
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,290
It's right here.

138
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,400
Now I see it.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,260
Why aren't they answering their phones?

140
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,370
I hope nothing's happened to them.

141
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,360
Isn't it already

142
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,000
obvious?

143
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,960
Are you stupid?

144
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,060
A single man and woman,

145
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,620
not coming home all night,

146
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,380
phones turned off -

147
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,850
what does that tell you?

148
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
They're together now.
