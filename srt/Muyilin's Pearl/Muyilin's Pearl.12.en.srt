1
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,740
Sansan.

2
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,960
Are they using camera angles for that kiss?

3
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,800
I think so.

4
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,240
Why do I feel like they actually kissed?

5
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,040
No.

6
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
No, they definitely kissed.

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,239
From where I was standing, it looked very real.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,730
Understand?

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,560
The basic movement should be like this.

10
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,400
Even though it's a staged kiss,

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,600
I still need to see some emotion,

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,720
especially in your eyes.

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,160
Got it?

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,520
Let's try again. Come here.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,120
Look, look.

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,720
Got it?

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,410
Let's do this properly.

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,800
Okay.

19
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,280
All the dishes are ready!

20
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,039
What a feast!

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,120
Wait a minute,

22
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,140
you didn't cook this, did you?

23
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,680
Uncle Fei made it.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,280
That's good. Now I can eat with peace of mind.

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,560
Friends, everyone,

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,000
today

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,960
I really appreciate all of you

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,720
for helping me shoot this video.

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,280
Most importantly,

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
thanks to our Teacher Mu.

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,850
A round of applause for Teacher Mu!

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,280
Business is booming, Boss Lu!

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,520
Thank you!

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,940
Cheers, everyone!

35
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,600
Sansan.

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,800
This is the first time I've felt

37
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,160
what it's like to have so many good friends

38
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,000
gathered together like this.

39
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,520
Are you happy?

40
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,600
Of course I am.

41
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,960
That's good then.

42
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,360
You can really drink.

43
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
You can really hold your liquor.

44
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,720
He's talking about you,

45
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,980
saying you drink a lot.

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,400
Is this the first time you realized I can drink?

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,720
Sansan, you can really drink too.

48
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,960
No, I can't.

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm just

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
continuously

51
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,720
drinking.

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,320
Sansan,

53
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,600
I grilled this meat

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,800
especially for you.

55
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,760
Let me tell you, I'm not

56
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,360
Try it.

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,400
drunk at all right now.

58
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,520
Can I not eat it?

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,200
Can't you tell?

60
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Just try it.

61
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,080
I-I don't want to eat it.

62
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,920
I know you can handle your alcohol very well.

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,050
Yilin, he's making me eat the skewers.

64
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,839
Are you okay? Did you fall?

65
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,600
It's fine, it's fine,

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,240
give me your drink.

67
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,040
Put it here.

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,120
It's okay, just leave it here.

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,960
Let's keep our distance from those two.

70
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,760
Be careful not to get caught in the crossfire.

71
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,620
Hey, slow down!

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,280
No.

73
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,160
That's enough, that's enough.

74
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,360
I can't run anymore,

75
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,290
don't fall over.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,680
I can't run anymore, I can't run,

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,940
let me catch my breath.

78
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,320
Yilin.

79
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,680
Thank you.

80
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,040
Sansan.

81
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,680
Actually, I've been upset all day today.

82
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,000
Why can't I be

83
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,960
your male lead?

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,600
And you even kissed him.

85
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
I didn't kiss him. That was just camera angles.

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,280
That's still not okay.

87
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,400
Didn't I tell you

88
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,720
that scene was cut anyway,

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,280
we didn't actually kiss.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,330
Even if there was a kiss,

91
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,000
it should have been with me.

92
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,040
What's that?

93
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,200
Looks like Ali.

94
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Ali?

95
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,120
It really seems to be him.

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,320
It's definitely him.

97
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,330
What's going on?

98
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,920
Good night.

99
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,000
Lu Hui.

100
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,720
Lu Hui.

101
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,420
Lu Hui, you have to listen to me this time.

102
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,800
Yilin is sleeping.

103
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,880
Please don't make noise, okay?

104
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
Yilin, yes, right.

105
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,400
Come on,

106
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,690
follow me to my room.

107
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,280
Alright, alright.

108
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,680
Yesterday, Xu Sansan...

109
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,799
Xu Sansan kissed me.

110
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,919
But today she's denying it.

111
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
She says that

112
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,120
yesterday's kiss was...

113
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,720
A pity kiss.

114
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
It's still a kiss.

115
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you know what emphasis means?

116
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,040
The emphasis in that sentence

117
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,280
is on 'pity'.

118
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,320
Don't focus on the kiss,

119
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,120
okay?

120
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
It's all because

121
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,120
you kept talking about my kissing scene with Lu Hui.

122
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
You were jealous.

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,560
Wasn't I just making it up to you?

124
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,360
No, but

125
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,820
you can't deny that you kissed me.

126
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,410
You need to take responsibility, Sansan.

127
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,680
Besides.

128
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,520
I really like you.

129
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,240
That was my first kiss.

130
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,520
My life, my restaurant,

131
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,720
I can give you everything I have.

132
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,820
Can you make our relationship official?

133
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,560
Not yet.

134
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,050
This is already the fifth time I've confessed to her.

135
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,400
But she also told me to get lost 66 times.

136
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,160
What should I do?

137
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,800
I think

138
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,360
pursuing love is

139
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,320
just like climbing a mountain.

140
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,040
The process

141
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
is definitely challenging.

142
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,960
Isn't persistence the key?

143
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,360
I think as long as you haven't reached the summit,

144
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,240
it means there's still a chance,

145
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,120
right?

146
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,320
I believe with unwavering perseverance

147
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,200
and staying true to your original intention,

148
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,880
you'll definitely reach the top,

149
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,480
you'll definitely succeed,

150
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,490
don't you think?

151
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,360
Yes.

152
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,780
Then I'll keep trying.

153
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,520
Yes, keep at it.

154
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,720
I'll continue to express my feelings

155
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,200
That's right.

156
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,240
so Sansan can understand what's in my heart.

157
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,880
Yes,

158
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,960
I understand.

159
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,920
Lu Hui.

160
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,360
Were you just

161
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,960
coming out of Mu Yilin's room?

162
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,840
How could you...

163
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,280
Last night, you...

164
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,740
I never thought you were this kind of person.

165
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,600
Last night, I...

166
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,250
Oharas Bayisbek

167
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,690
