1
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,760
You're not angry, are you?

2
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,640
A little bit.

3
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,000
And I'm quite

4
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,480
jealous.

5
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,940
I'm allowed to be jealous, right?

6
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,520
Why are you

7
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,880
smiling?

8
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,539
I was really angry yesterday.

9
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,880
But not at you.

10
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,360
I was angry at him

11
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,360
for making you suffer so much,

12
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,400
for bullying you for so long.

13
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,200
But today I'm happy.

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,759
I was smiling

15
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,250
because I'm glad you're sharing all this with me.

16
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,479
Thank you.

17
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,520
Did you come

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,720
to my door last night?

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,360
Why didn't you come in?

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,200
I thought

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,480
you might need some space.

22
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,840
Yilin.

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,600
You didn't do anything wrong.

24
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,020
He's the one who was wrong,

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,200
understand?

26
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,890
What are you smiling at?

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,860
I'm smiling because you're really jealous.

28
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,400
I love eating.

29
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,480
Delicious.

30
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,960
Yilin.

31
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,200
Why are you still here?

32
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,500
I've been waiting for you.

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,920
Yilin.

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,760
I didn't get a chance to introduce myself yesterday,

35
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm Lu Hui,

36
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,840
Yilin's neighbor,

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,250
nice to meet you.

38
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm really sorry,

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,000
but we have things to take care of,

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
so we'll be going now.

41
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,160
This one sold pretty well last time,

42
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,040
300 pieces,

43
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,760
and the price per customer was decent.

44
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
So for the next session,

45
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,760
should we feature this collection,

46
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,760
right,

47
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,160
Mr. Lu?

48
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,860
Someone's spreading gossip about you outside,

49
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,810
I took pictures of everything.

50
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,680
It's him. I've been watching him for a while.

51
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,480
He's been asking around about you

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,160
and saying

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,620
that Lu Hui stole his wife.

54
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
I'll go confront him.

55
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,800
Yilin, wait, wait!

56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,680
What are you doing?

57
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,810
Don't be impulsive,

58
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,060
just calm down.

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
No matter what happened,

60
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
let's find out why he's really here.

61
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,760
Jia Dan.

62
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,880
Go gather some information,

63
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,810
but be discreet.

64
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,560
Got it.

65
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
I'm sorry

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,880
for causing you trouble.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,880
Not at all,

68
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,400
we're all here for you.

69
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,320
Don't worry.

70
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,440
Hello,

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,800
this is

72
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,800
Jia Dan

73
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,920
Li,

74
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,320
you scared me to death!

75
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,130
What are you looking at?

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,490
Why are you two here?

77
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,360
Helping Lu Hui shoot a video.

78
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,420
What are you doing?

79
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,240
Have you seen this before?

80
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Chen Peng

81
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,680
Calm down, calm down.

82
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,960
What exactly do you want?

83
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,480
Tell me,

84
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,450
what are you here for this time?

85
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,440
To find love again.

86
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,840
To find me. I'm looking for Mu Yilin.

87
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,760
Stop pretending. I know you too well.

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Have you ever spoken a word of truth?

89
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,020
No. Is Xu Sansan any of your business?

90
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,600
Fine.

91
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,400
Then tell me.

92
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,360
What were you doing outside

93
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
sneaking around like that?

94
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,840
No, who's sneaking around?

95
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,520
You are.

96
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,560
I want to see

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,680
Just looking.

98
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,480
what kind of people Yilin hangs out with every day.

99
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,800
What's wrong with that?

100
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,530
No, that's not what he's doing.

101
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
He's clearly spreading rumors.

102
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
I heard it with my own ears.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,640
He said my brother Lu Hui is a homewrecker

104
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,560
who stole his wife.

105
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,440
Don't point at me!

106
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,840
He even said they were about to get married

107
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,440
when my brother Lu stole her away.

108
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,200
Isn't that true?

109
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,800
No, it's not.

110
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,680
How is it not?

111
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,440
Lu Hui is nothing but a liar.

112
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,280
How long have you even known him?

113
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,210
Chen Peng, when will you ever stop?

114
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,890
You really think I'm that easy to push around?

115
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,560
Last night,

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,160
after everything you said to me,

117
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,890
I really thought you would change for the better.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
Looks like Sansan was right.

119
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,080
A dog

120
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,160
will never stop eating shit.

121
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,840
People like you

122
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
will never change.

123
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,400
I can see right through you now,

124
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
and I can guess why you came here.

125
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,930
Did you make another bad business deal

126
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
and lose all your money,

127
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,159
so you came all the way to Xinjiang to find me?

128
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,040
You think I'm still as easy to take advantage of as before,

129
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,170
wanting to borrow money from me just to be scammed again?

130
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,159
I used to believe

131
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,290
that when you love someone,

132
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,860
you can willingly give everything for them.

133
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,400
I still believe that's not wrong.

134
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,680
But now I understand

135
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,320
a very important lesson.

136
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Loving someone

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,160
and giving to them

138
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,200
has to be mutual,

139
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
and it has to be for the right person.

140
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,560
Not for someone like you.

141
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,760
Get out!

142
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,960
Get away from here.

143
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,420
Don't let me see you again.

144
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,480
He's just scum. Get out!

145
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,840
Take her away quickly. Hurry!

146
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,640
How could you be in cahoots

147
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,040
with these people,

148
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
birds of a feather?

149
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,690
I don't understand.

150
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,340
It's not good, basically.

151
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,840
He wants you and Jia Dan to go out and close the door,

152
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
I'll handle this.

153
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,480
Okay.

154
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,920
Let's talk.

155
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,130
I really admire your persistence.

156
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,160
Coming thousands of kilometers from so far away,

157
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,600
just to make this trip.

158
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,410
Seems like you won't stop until you get what you want.

159
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,280
Tell me.

160
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,480
What exactly do you want?

161
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,570
Why should I tell you anything?

162
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,200
You don't have to tell me,

163
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,740
but you're spreading rumors about me

164
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,890
and investigating my background.

165
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,720
You're obviously targeting me.

166
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,960
What is it about me

167
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
that attracts you so much?

168
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Look, man,

169
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,440
are you being reasonable?

170
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,680
Yes,

171
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,680
I'm having some business problems,

172
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,340
so I came to ask Yi Lin for help.

173
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,960
But what does that have to do with you?

174
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,340
You surrounded me.

175
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,800
On what grounds?

176
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,000
This is ridiculous.

177
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,960
I understand.

178
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,370
Name your price.

179
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,000
1 million.

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,800
I've done some calculations.

181
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,200
With how viral your videos are right now,

182
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,940
your monthly revenue must be more than that, right?

183
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,480
You're quite greedy.

184
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,880
Asking me for money so directly,

185
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,770
aren't you afraid I'll report you for extortion?

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,860
Just say it if you can't afford it.

187
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,930
You're actually right.

188
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,840
1 million in cash,

189
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,000
if you want me to produce it now,

190
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,260
I really can't do that.

191
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,600
But I have a better solution.

192
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Interested?

193
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,960
Come on.

194
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,740
We've agreed on all the terms, right?

195
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,640
I knew this trip to Xinjiang wouldn't be wasted.

196
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,480
It won't be a wasted trip.

197
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,340
Let's have a meal today first.

198
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,240
Alright.

199
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,320
Well, I'll...

200
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,880
wait for you in the car.

201
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,480
Okay.

202
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,160
See you soon.

203
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,280
Jia Dan.

204
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,520
What's going on?

205
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,600
Listen to me.

206
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,360
Lu Hui, what's going on here?

207
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,730
I'd like to know too.

208
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,720
The goods still need some time to prepare.

209
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,800
Let's eat something first.

210
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,360
Alright,

211
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,200
prepare a plate of beef dumplings.

212
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,000
You make them.

213
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,280
Me?

214
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,800
Sure,

215
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,240
my cooking skills are the best now.

216
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,840
Go ahead.

217
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,440
Really?

218
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,540
What exactly is going on here?

219
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,960
What did you tell him?

220
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,000
Business between men.

221
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,250
Don't worry.

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,640
Here we go.

223
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,880
As the old saying goes,

224
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,440
dumplings before a journey, noodles upon return.

225
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
You're going on a long journey,

226
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,840
so this is your send-off meal.

227
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,880
Try it, try it.

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,060
You're the traveler, you should eat.

229
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,040
Right, you eat.

230
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Go ahead, start eating.

231
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,600
Okay.

232
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,130
It's bitter!

233
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,160
No spitting allowed!

234
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,880
Once you've picked it up with your chopsticks, you must finish it,

235
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,280
otherwise it brings bad luck.

236
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,000
Seriously?

237
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,740
Isn't that right, Ali?

238
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,200
I get it.

239
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,040
No pain, no gain.

240
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,220
Have some more.

241
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,680
Good, right?

242
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,800
R-really good.

243
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,440
Lu.

244
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,440
Everything's ready.

245
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,480
Come on.

246
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,140
All the goods are here.

247
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,480
Wait for my good news.

248
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Don't you want to check the goods?

249
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,720
No need.

250
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,160
I trust you.

251
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,850
What's going on?

252
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,760
How would I know?

253
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,490
Khorgos is really a nice place.

254
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,290
Wait for me a moment.

255
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,690
Just a moment, okay?

256
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,600
Just a moment.

257
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,520
Lu Hui.

258
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,440
Good man.

259
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Cherish it well.

260
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,040
Let's go.

261
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,760
Goodbye.

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,960
Let's go too.

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Where are you going?

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
