1
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,400
Yilin.

2
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,440
Yilin.

3
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,880
Yilin.

4
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,680
She's right here.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,400
Meet at Ali's restaurant.

6
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
He made breakfast for us.

7
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,460
She says she knows.

8
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,080
Don't talk.

9
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,920
Let's go.

10
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,440
Morning, Ali.

11
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,480
Morning, Yilin.

12
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,560
Morning, Lu Hui.

13
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,160
Breakfast looks great.

14
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,900
It's plentiful, eat more.

15
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,480
Everyone needs the nourishment. Smells good.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
What are you smiling at? Why that silly grin?

17
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,240
Can't even stop talking while eating.

18
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Nothing.

19
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,930
I'll take this call.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
Hello.

21
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,520
Hello, is this Mu Yilin?

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,380
Yes, that's me.

23
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,240
Hello, Ms. Mu Yilin,

24
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,480
I'm the new manager

25
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,000
of Huaxing Travel Agency.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
The travel agency you work for

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,079
has been acquired by our company.

28
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,320
Since you're currently on a business trip,

29
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,240
we need you to return to Beijing immediately

30
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,570
to hand over relevant work and contracts.

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,440
But

32
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,480
I'm in Xinjiang right now,

33
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,680
and I haven't finished my work here yet.

34
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,440
Because after our company's takeover,

35
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,300
we currently have no plans for the Xinjiang market.

36
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,330
You can temporarily suspend your business trip.

37
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,240
The company is planning to assign you to the overseas team

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,520
for a long-term posting.

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Of course,

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,260
we hope you'll return to discuss this in person.

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,640
Overseas team.

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,660
I'd like to ask something.

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,079
If I

44
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,760
unilaterally terminate

45
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,160
my employment contract,

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,720
would I need to pay a penalty?

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,920
According to the compensation clause,

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,480
if you unilaterally breach

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,840
and terminate the contract,

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,370
you would need to pay approximately 500,000 yuan in penalties.

51
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
What's wrong?

52
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
What happened?

53
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,690
Tell me about it,

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,600
maybe I can help you solve it.

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,560
Lu Hui,

56
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,040
have you ever felt that

57
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,960
since we met,

58
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,240
everything that has happened

59
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,000
has been too dreamlike,

60
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,360
like a dream?

61
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,530
What do you mean?

62
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,760
I mean it's been too smooth.

63
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,600
I never thought I would come to this place,

64
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,000
let alone meet you here.

65
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,600
Right?

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,080
My mother thought I was having

67
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,540
too hard a time here alone,

68
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,570
so she arranged this perfect match for me.

69
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,080
Made me forget reality.

70
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,480
Made me believe

71
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,240
that I could also recklessly

72
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,900
and bravely fall in love once.

73
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,159
But reality tells me

74
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,600
that I can't.

75
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,040
Yilin.

76
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
You must be under too much pressure.

77
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,090
Whatever problems come up,

78
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,240
we can solve them together,

79
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,040
right?

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,880
You used to be alone,

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,340
but now there are two of us,

82
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,800
we can face everything together.

83
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,040
No, we agreed on this.

84
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,570
This isn't something you should have to bear.

85
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,120
The reality is,

86
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,560
that phone call just now

87
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
completely woke me up.

88
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,040
During this time since I came here,

89
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,400
I never once thought about

90
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,000
having to go back to Beijing.

91
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
I can go to Beijing with you.

92
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,880
What about your shop?

93
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,400
What about Jia Dan?

94
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
And all your merchants?

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,160
These are all problems

96
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,240
I need to solve myself,

97
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,960
I can handle them well,

98
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,400
I can manage everything.

99
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,460
Lu Hui, you don't understand what I mean.

100
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,560
I don't want to be your burden,

101
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,680
do you understand?

102
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,800
Everything you just mentioned,

103
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,640
I can handle well,

104
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,240
I can find ways to solve them all,

105
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
I can do it.

106
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,880
I... I...

107
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,340
I don't know where the problem really is.

108
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,400
I think

109
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,400
it's that I'm not brave enough.

110
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,440
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,880
Lu, are you okay?

113
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm fine.

114
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,680
It's nothing.

115
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,600
Let's go.

116
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,360
Jia Dan.

117
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,200
This month,

118
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,530
let's shoot more videos

119
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,360
and then clear out

120
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,540
all those backlogged ones first.

121
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,440
Lu,

122
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,360
I heard that Sister Yilin is going back to Beijing.

123
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,330
What are you two going to do?

124
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,840
No matter what choice she makes,

125
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,620
I want to try harder for her one more time.

126
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,320
Jia Dan,

127
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,320
are you okay?

128
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,380
The camera is fine.

129
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm asking if you're okay.

130
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,840
I... I think I'm not okay.

131
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,760
Let me see.

132
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,020
I can't move this foot.

133
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,960
Alright, let's go.

134
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,960
Thank you.

135
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,720
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,360
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

137
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,690
Please try again later.

138
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,240
What's going on?

139
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,680
Let me ask Ali.

140
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,440
Hello?

141
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,080
Hey, Ali.

142
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,520
Is Lu Hui with you?

143
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,520
No, he's not.

144
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,100
Slow down, bro. My foot hurts.

145
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,800
Is Jia Dan with you?

146
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,680
Jia Dan and Lu Hui were filming a video today.

147
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,940
There was an accident.

148
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,440
Jia Dan broke his leg.

149
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
What about Lu Hui?

150
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,160
Lu Hui?

151
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,640
Lu Hui seems to have gone back to that forest again.

152
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,720
He went by himself.

153
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,120
