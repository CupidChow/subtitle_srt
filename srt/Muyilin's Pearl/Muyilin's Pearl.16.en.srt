1
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,120
I got too emotional just now.

3
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,319
Did I scare you?

4
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,360
It's okay.

5
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,039
I know you're concerned.

6
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,300
You asked me before

7
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,960
about my ears.

8
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,100
Actually, I wasn't being honest.

9
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,520
I told you that my ears

10
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,120
don't affect my life.

11
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,560
But that's not true.

12
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,700
Boss, I'd like a popsicle.

13
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Coming right up!

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,380
Here you go.

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,080
Let's go home now.

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,240
Let's hurry, Lu Hui.

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,120
For a long time after my parents passed away,

18
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,640
I was irritable and negative,

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,090
full of self-blame.

20
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,610
These emotions stayed with me for a long time,

21
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,640
impossible to shake off.

22
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,520
I was often excluded by others when I was young.

23
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,760
Back then, I felt

24
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,960
sorry for myself.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Very lonely.

26
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,020
I've been trying to convince myself.

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,600
I tell myself,

28
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,240
this isn't your fault,

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
you should let all of this go.

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,680
But I can't do it.

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
I'm scared.

32
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm afraid that because of this ear,

33
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,970
I won't be able to protect the people I love again.

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,300
It was never your fault to begin with.

35
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,480
Besides,

36
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,200
the Lu Hui I see

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,930
has always been positive and optimistic.

38
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,010
Do you know when I first drank alcohol?

39
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,800
It was that same year,

40
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,840
during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

41
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
My mom went to bed early,

42
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,920
and my dad took me to watch the moon,

43
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,780
asking me to have a drink with him.

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,800
I only had a tiny bit,

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,450
but got drunk immediately.

46
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
Your uncle was quite interesting,

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,079
teaching you to drink at such a young age.

48
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,040
How is your alcohol tolerance

49
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,120
still so poor?

50
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
My mom found out the next day,

51
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,940
and chased him around the yard to beat him up.

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,120
Back then, my dad told me,

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,480
'Life is just a couple of drinks,

54
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,160
and in the end, all worries disappear.'

55
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,680
No matter what happens,

56
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,440
never hide it in your heart.

57
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,279
Have a couple of drinks, get some sleep,

58
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,680
and when you wake up,

59
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,920
if something can be solved,

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,360
go solve it right away.

61
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,610
For things you can't solve,

62
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,610
take your time working on them,

63
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,440
there's always a way.

64
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Your uncle lived with such clarity.

65
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,480
It's been a long time since I celebrated any holidays.

66
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Me too.

67
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,960
I think that,

68
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,680
although neither of us has parents by our side

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,409
who accompanied us growing up,

70
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,210
we're still doing well now.

71
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,560
Our inner worlds

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
are incredibly rich.

73
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,800
Besides, I have you by my side now.

74
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,600
And I also have

75
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,480
this group of good friends.

76
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,880
Thank you, Yilin.

77
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,220
Careful, careful.

78
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,480
Have a seat.

79
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,240
Sansan.

80
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,080
You.

81
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,300
How many boyfriends have you had?

82
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,160
Three?

83
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,560
Triple digits.

84
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,280
I'm just kidding.

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
I've interacted with

86
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,820
triple-digit numbers of men.

87
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,080
They all approached me

88
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
with some kind of agenda.

89
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,040
Remember what I told you?

90
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,800
I'm against marriage.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,160
So all these people,

92
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,610
no matter what their intentions were,

93
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,880
once they heard that,

94
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
they all gave up.

95
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,320
This...

96
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Is that why you won't be with me?

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,480
My parents divorced when I was very young.

98
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,800
Soon after,

99
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,680
they each started new families.

100
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
And then quickly,

101
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
they each got divorced again.

102
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,820
Ridiculous, isn't it?

103
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,320
Is this also why

104
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,400
you don't date

105
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,220
or want to get married?

106
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,680
I have an imperfect family background,

107
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,800
and some unsuccessful relationships.

108
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,700
Although I still believe in love,

109
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,680
I prefer to follow my heart.

110
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,360
Because I feel

111
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,200
someone like me

112
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,160
would only bring trouble and pain to others.

113
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,880
So in the end, I might as well

114
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,680
just be a sophisticated

115
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,880
egoist when it comes to relationships.

116
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,360
Ali.

117
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
You grew up surrounded by love,

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,680
so you might not understand.

119
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,440
Maybe our experiences are different,

120
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,240
I understand.

121
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,960
But also, I don't.

122
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,760
It looks great.

123
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
You're back.

124
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,090
Where's Sansan?

125
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,920
I'm here.

126
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,880
Sansan, hurry up.

127
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,480
Coming. Perfect timing. The water's boiling.

128
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
We can eat now.

129
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,080
Okay, watch me.

130
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,680
Here we go.

131
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,280
Three, two, one.

132
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,680
What's going on with you two?

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,740
We just had a fight.

134
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
It's fine. Let's eat.

135
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,680
Thank you.

136
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,280
Yilin,

137
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,000
what happened to your hand? Are you hurt?

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,640
It's nothing.

139
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,480
We went cycling earlier,

140
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,679
and I fell by accident.

141
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,559
He's already taken care of it for me.

142
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,720
How thoughtful.

143
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,000
Thank you for that.

144
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,140
Come on.

145
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,679
Come,

146
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,720
join us,

147
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,679
Ali.

148
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,080
Ali.

149
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,240
Time to eat and drink.

150
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,300
What are you doing?

151
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,840
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

152
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,600
Go ahead and eat.

153
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,280
The pot's boiling!

154
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,480
Everything's ready.

155
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,880
These seasonings smell amazing.

156
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,680
Let's cook the meat first.

157
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,400
I'll put some meat in for you.

158
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,240
I'm full.

159
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
You guys go ahead.

160
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,050
I'm going for a walk.

161
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,640
What's going on between you two?

162
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,940
Don't worry about him.

163
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,400
Ali,

164
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,680
we all came out to enjoy the Mid-Autumn Festival,

165
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,740
don't be like this.

166
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,890
Do you know why I'm acting this way?

167
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,160
Yes, I do.

168
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,920
You can accept everything about me,

169
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,680
like not getting married,

170
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,880
my family situation, you accept it all.

171
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,400
But you can't accept

172
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,440
that I treat you the same way I treat others,

173
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,920
right?

174
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,810
Are you really sure about this?

175
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,200
I don't have any ulterior motives with you,

176
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
I simply like you.

177
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,240
You're beautiful,

178
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,000
smart, and strong-willed.

179
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,040
But I like all of that.

180
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,680
I like being around you,

181
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,560
even when you push me around.

182
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,880
You say no marriage,

183
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
fine.

184
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,940
Then let's just be together forever.

185
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,360
Why won't you

186
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,840
give me a chance to try?

187
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
I'm afraid.

188
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,720
Yes,

189
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,320
I can feel that

190
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,450
you're different from all the others.

191
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,160
No one has ever

192
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,200
pursued me so persistently like you.

193
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,860
But we've known each other for such a short time,

194
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm afraid that all of this

195
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,160
is just my wishful thinking.

196
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,400
I'm also afraid of being...

197
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,260
What about now?

198
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,680
If it's you,

199
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,050
I'm willing to give it a try.

200
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,840
You finally said yes!

201
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,120
What are you thinking about?

202
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
I'm thinking

203
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,450
about this beautiful scenery,

204
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,050
wondering if my mother ever saw it too.

205
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,160
Oh, it's you.

206
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,880
Yeah, I came to apologize to you both,

207
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,240
I feel quite embarrassed about today.

208
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,360
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

209
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,440
Come, join us,

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,660
have a seat.

211
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,520
It's my fault too,

212
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
my cycling skills aren't very good.

213
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,480
No, it's my fault. I was riding too fast

214
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,740
and didn't notice her.

215
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,800
Well, since we've run into each other,

216
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,840
let's celebrate together. Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

217
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,900
Thank you, thanks.

218
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,880
Come.

219
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,480
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

220
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,970
You're drinking this wine too.

221
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,480
We bought ours at Sunset Bar.

222
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,800
We usually buy from there too,

223
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,160
the owner is really nice to us,

224
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,890
often drinks and chats with us.

225
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,920
Someone with a naturally tipsy, mysterious vibe.

226
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
And also a

227
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,440
true love warrior.

228
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,370
What do you mean by that?

229
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,280
One time when she was drunk, she told us

230
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,080
she started dating when she was just three years old.

231
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,320
Three years old.

232
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,680
That's nothing.

233
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,200
I've been in love since I was three.

234
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,720
He's my childhood betrothed,

235
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,680
and I've loved him for 50 years.

236
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Is that true?

237
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,960
Boss, who is he?

238
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,960
His name is

239
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,120
Samuhar.

240
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,760
Why are you lying?

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What?

242
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,760
You were betrothed to Samuhar.

243
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,420
You've loved him for 50 years.

244
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
You've never even lost contact with him.

245
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,080
Where is he now?

246
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,720
And also,

247
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,920
what exactly happened

248
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,280
between you, Samuhar,

249
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,520
and my mother?
