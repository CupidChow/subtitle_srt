1
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,480
You're awake.

2
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,200
I fell asleep just now.

3
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:03,960
Yes.

4
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
It's okay. Why don't

5
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,000
we head back now?

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,960
Let's go.

7
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,840
Let's go home.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,930
The sunshine was

9
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,280
so comfortable just now.

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,840
Yes.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,680
Let's go.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
Okay, I'm coming.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Oh my goodness!

14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,820
Wait for me!

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,640
I've told you everything I needed to.

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,200
That's what's been happening with us recently.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,479
Oh my God,

18
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,120
that's so romantic!

19
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,400
This is definitely Aunt Pearl

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,240
playing matchmaker for you.

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,520
Mu Yilin,

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,960
I'm warning you,

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,360
don't mess this up again, you hear me?

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,100
Why do you always bring up the sore spots?

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,770
Aunt Pearl went through all that trouble,

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,880
coming from so far away,

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,280
to set you up with

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,560
such a handsome guy,

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,000
you need to seize this opportunity!

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,640
Seize what?

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
Don't worry,

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,560
this time your sister will help you check him out thoroughly.

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,680
Don't talk nonsense,

34
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,740
I don't have those kinds of thoughts.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,720
Xu Sansan.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,480
Sansan.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,000
What's up, Ali?

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,360
Delivery. Try this.

39
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,640
You made this?

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,600
Get lost!

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,770
Why are you here?

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,460
I want you to taste my cooking.

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,760
You made this?

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Young Master Ali,

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,100
just stick to managing your restaurant,

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,920
cooking skills can't be forced.

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,840
I really tried this time,

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,440
it's definitely different.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,860
Smells delicious.

50
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,880
Lu Hui.

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,850
I didn't know you had such cooking skills.

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
If they won't eat it but you will, what does that prove?

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,680
What else?

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
We can't let you cook alone.

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,520
Let's go make a couple dishes too.

56
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,960
Come on.

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,080
You can cook too?

58
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,440
Food's ready. Let's eat.

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,320
Coming.

60
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,440
Thank you.

61
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,720
Thanks.

62
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,760
Yilin.

63
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,720
Thanks.

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,570
That's impressive.

65
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,440
If we couldn't cook,

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,000
Yilin and I have been on our own for so many years,

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
we would've starved to death long ago.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm the only restaurant owner who can't cook.

69
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,240
Try it and see how it tastes.

70
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,440
Let's dig in then.

71
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,720
Delicious.

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,040
This dish is good too.

73
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,400
Yilin,

74
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,800
when are you planning to go back to Beijing?

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
I need to stay for a couple more days,

76
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,880
because I'm planning to check out

77
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,240
the tourist routes around here,

78
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,840
since I promised Director Jin

79
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,480
I'd give her five travel routes each month.

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,600
Five?

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,240
So if you're free tomorrow,

82
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,920
I'm planning to check out the attractions nearby.

83
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,720
Where to?

84
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,280
Let's start with the lavender garden.

85
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,360
If you're not busy tomorrow,

86
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,200
you can come with me.

87
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm free tomorrow. I'll go with you.

88
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,740
That works.

89
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,880
You're familiar with this area anyway,

90
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,000
and since you're available tomorrow,

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,260
you can show me around.

92
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,720
No problem,

93
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,780
it's settled then.

94
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,440
Five paths.

95
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,440
Five routes.

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,600
I'll just call you Wutiao then.

97
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,520
From now on,

98
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,840
you're a little lamb with a name too.

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,840
Good morning.

100
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
Morning.

101
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,640
Why are you smiling so happily?

102
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,240
Going out is exciting.

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,400
Coffee.

104
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,460
I brought some too.

105
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,440
Let's have both then.

106
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,680
This is really comfortable.

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,920
Look.

108
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,420
This place looks good from any angle,

109
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,400
doesn't it?

110
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,640
Beautiful.

111
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,640
Little girl,

112
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,340
could you help me with something?

113
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,520
Here we go.

114
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,040
Three, two, one.

115
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,770
Let's take another one.

116
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
One more.

117
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,800
Good. You can choose which ones you like.

118
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,840
Okay.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,920
You two should join in too,

120
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,120
let me take a photo of you together.

121
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,840
Come on, get up there.

122
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,240
We don't need to.

123
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,240
Come on,

124
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,520
let's do it.

125
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,320
Come here.

126
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,440
Come closer.

127
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,640
A bit closer.

128
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Boys will be boys.

129
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,640
Raise your left arm.

130
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,520
Your left arm.

131
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,080
Higher. Higher. More. More.

132
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,880
Lift it more.

133
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,280
Down. This way. This way.

134
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,040
Again. Lift it again.

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,320
Good. That's it.

136
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Perfect.

137
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,280
Here you go.

138
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,040
Thank you.

139
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,120
Here.

140
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,920
Ma'am.

141
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,640
Thanks.

142
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,570
You're welcome.

143
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,720
You young lovebirds

144
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,120
should travel more while you're young.

145
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,680
Unlike us,

146
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,400
who only have time to travel when we're older,

147
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,320
right?

148
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Sir, ma'am,

149
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,120
where are you visiting Xinjiang from?

150
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,920
We came from Khorgos.

151
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
We also came from Khorgos.

152
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,600
Are you locals from Khorgos?

153
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,400
No, no, no.

154
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,980
I'm from Lianyungang,

155
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,840
and I've been

156
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,700
doing business here for decades.

157
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,520
Sir,

158
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,440
do you happen to know someone

159
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,040
who also came here about 30 years ago

160
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,800
to run a luggage business?

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,930
Her name is Zhenzhu.

162
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,640
Zhenzhu?

163
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,410
Is that Zhenzhu from Lianyungang?

164
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,680
Yes.

165
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,040
How do you know her?

166
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,120
She's my mother.

167
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,080
Back then

168
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,800
I was your mother's driver.

169
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
I had never seen a woman

170
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,720
hauling a cartload of goods by herself

171
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,050
to such a distant place.

172
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,120
What's wrong?

173
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,400
Hey!

174
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,440
Help us!

175
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,480
Let me help.

176
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,970
Give me the rope.

177
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,060
Where are you heading?

178
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm going to Khorgos.

179
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,840
Khorgos

180
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,640
is still quite far from here.

181
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,640
Yes.

182
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,530
It's getting dark soon,

183
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,000
and even if you fix your cart before leaving,

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
it would still be dangerous.

185
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,860
My home is just over there,

186
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,570
why not stay for the night and leave tomorrow?

187
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,880
Don't worry, we're good people.

188
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,880
Our yurt is clean,

189
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,640
come have some hot tea

190
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,840
and continue your journey tomorrow.

191
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,520
Alright.

192
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,080
Good,

193
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,920
leave the cart here and follow me.

194
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,720
Wait a moment,

195
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,200
let's take a photo.

196
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,480
Such an amazing experience

197
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,210
would be a shame not to capture.

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,760
Three, two, one.

199
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,600
If I hadn't

200
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,780
followed your mother all the way here back then,

201
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,080
this logistics company wouldn't exist today.

202
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,810
What happened next?

203
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,960
Have some hot water.

204
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,760
Thank you.

205
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,280
The

206
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,040
rain cover,

207
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
I've already set it up,

208
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,160
so we don't have to worry about rain tonight.

209
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,240
Thank you,

210
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,280
thanks.

211
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,800
This place is so unique.

212
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,520
This is how we Kazakh people build our homes,

213
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,380
just like this.

214
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,720
That,

215
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,440
what is that?

216
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,640
Dombra.

217
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,000
Dombra,

218
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
can you play it?

219
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,240
Yes.

220
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,680
Do you know how to sing

221
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,880
Wang Luobin's songs?

222
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,720
Wang Luobin,

223
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,970
I don't know him.

224
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,920
I really love his songs,

225
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
all of his songs,

226
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,320
I love them all.

227
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,840
I also really love San Mao's books,

228
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,800
and I really admire

229
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,000
their love story.

230
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,240
San Mao,

231
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,840
what kind of books are those?

232
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,080
In her books,

233
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,600
there are deserts,

234
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,040
grasslands,

235
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,400
love stories,

236
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,000
and herself.

237
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,370
I haven't read them.

238
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,800
I'll read some to you.

239
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,720
Okay.

240
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,280
Thank you for giving me this false hope,

241
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,640
our beautiful memories

242
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,640
have been blurred by my tears.

243
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,770
When I occasionally remember,

244
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,460
the memories are still fresh,

245
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
just like back then,

246
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,640
I loved you

247
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,320
without any purpose.

248
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,960
I

249
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,880
only love you.

250
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,480
Um,

251
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,010
have some water.

252
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,720
I'll, I'll

253
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,400
sleep outside today,

254
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,000
you can stay inside the yurt,

255
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,300
alright, good.
