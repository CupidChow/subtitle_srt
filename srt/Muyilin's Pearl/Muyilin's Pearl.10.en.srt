1
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,290
What are you two doing here?

2
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,280
What?

3
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,330
Come here right now.

4
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,320
What's going on?

5
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,360
What's the matter?

6
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Hurry up,

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,640
come here.

8
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,820
What are you doing?

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,720
Hurry.

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Tell me the truth.

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,680
You.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,330
Are you dating someone?

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,320
No, I'm not.

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,440
Then where were you last night?

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,800
I just slept in the car last night.

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,080
Just slept?

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,120
Did you take off your clothes?

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,720
Yes, I did.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,560
The temperature difference between day and night is huge there,

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,080
I was afraid she'd get cold.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,810
Did you kiss?

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,480
No.

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,560
You definitely did.

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,400
No,

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,080
why are you being so nosy?

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,160
Let's go, get out of here.

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,090
Xu Sansan, stop your fantasizing.

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,360
Berlin

29
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,040
Okay.

30
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,960
Stand here.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,640
Good.

32
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,400
A little forward. Careful.

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,360
What are you doing here?

34
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,280
I'm waiting for someone.

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,240
Are you a teacher too?

36
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,100
Are you also visiting the museum?

37
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,040
No way.

38
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,280
He must be waiting for his girlfriend.

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,720
A date.

40
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,840
Who goes to a museum for a date?

41
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,480
Who says you can't date at a museum?

42
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,960
I think museums are great.

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,860
It really is a date!

44
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
Go away.

45
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,079
What do you elementary kids know about dating?

46
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,280
Look! There's a pretty lady over there!

47
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,480
Where?

48
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,760
Stop messing around.

49
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,400
Listen.

50
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,880
Do me a favor.

51
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,320
Sansan.

52
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,560
Come take me to the museum.

53
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Brother, you're so handsome.

54
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Sister, you're so beautiful.

55
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,460
You even brought your own cheerleaders.

56
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,040
Great.

57
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,839
Let's go.

58
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,360
Coming.

59
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,440
Here.

60
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,800
This is for you.

61
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,840
Thank you.

62
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,240
Who takes a girl to a museum on their first date?

63
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,880
Don't you like it?

64
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,560
No,

65
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,360
I enjoy visiting museums too.

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,280
I knew it.

67
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,400
That's not what I meant.

68
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
Why do you keep staring at me?

69
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,659
Well, because you're beautiful.

70
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,360
The brother is so handsome,

71
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,600
and looks perfect with the sister.

72
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,160
Did you teach her to say that too?

73
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,480
No, no,

74
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,260
kids just see things clearly.

75
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,520
Fine.

76
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,920
Look,

77
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,480
these are our border defense soldiers.

78
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,060
My grandfather told me

79
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,840
that he once cooked Big Plate Chicken

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,480
for the border soldiers back then.

81
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,400
Really?

82
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,680
Ali,

83
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
tell me,

84
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
did those border soldiers back then

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,860
also find their Big Plate Chicken

86
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,480
too salty and bitter?

87
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,800
Sansan,

88
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,240
you're always picking on me.

89
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,000
Where are you going all dressed up so beautifully?

90
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,000
Guess what?

91
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,920
I think

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,800
you're going on a date with Ali.

93
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,640
How did you know?

94
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,040
You and Ali are together.

95
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,280
You two.

96
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,360
Stop, stop!

97
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,080
No, no.

98
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,280
Don't make things up.

99
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,640
I just have

100
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,400
a little interest in him now.

101
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,160
I really need to thank Auntie Zhenzhu

102
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,080
for not only matchmaking for you

103
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,880
but also setting me up with someone.

104
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,760
Xu Sansan

105
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,640
I have to remind you

106
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,920
that someone once told me

107
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,480
not to fall in love so easily.

108
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,920
You and Ali are

109
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,560
moving way too fast

110
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,240
Don't be ridiculous.

111
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,600
don't you think?

112
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Have you properly checked him out?

113
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,960
Here you go, sir

114
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
the usual.

115
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,000
Cold is fine.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,680
Sure thing.

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,760
Thank you, young man

118
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,400
Cold.

119
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
you're a good person.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm still evaluating him

121
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,170
but I judge men on three things:

122
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,680
good values

123
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,640
good character

124
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,160
and how he treats me.

125
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,200
Let me tell you

126
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,480
good men on the market these days

127
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,810
are really hard to find.

128
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,600
It's not that I'm moving too fast

129
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
you need to step up your game.

130
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,440
Your judgment when it comes to men

131
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,880
needs some improvement

132
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,680
you know?

133
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,960
I'm off

134
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,890
get back to work.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,860
Actually, there's one more thing

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,320
which is whether he's handsome or not.

137
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,400
Bye!

138
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,400
I bet that last point is what you really care about.

139
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,600
As long as he's good to me.

140
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,360
What about his character?

141
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,920
Thank you.

142
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,240
Come on.

143
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
Everyone gets one.

144
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,160
Thanks.

145
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,820
Is it good, sis?

146
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,640
It smells wonderful.

147
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,120
Jia Dan.

148
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,169
For this video traffic,

149
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,640
I know who can help us.

150
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,860
Still working on the plan?

151
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,880
I've already got

152
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,900
a premium three-day tour,

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
a three-day tour for seniors,

154
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,000
a three-day tour for young people,

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,440
and a five-day tour.

156
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,040
I just have one last route

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
to figure out.

158
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,500
What are you doing?

159
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,400
You'll definitely come up with a plan,

160
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,800
but right now the most important thing

161
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,920
is to take a break.

162
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,130
What's this?

163
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,720
A proposal that the boss rejected earlier.

164
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,920
Smile Travel.

165
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,800
Plus.

166
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,970
What does that mean?

167
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,920
The 'plus' means

168
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,800
that during this trip,

169
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,720
you can add anything you want to it.

170
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,200
When I first created this proposal, I thought about

171
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,800
collaborating with social media influencers

172
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,800
and partnering with e-commerce platforms.

173
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,560
Along our entire travel route,

174
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,120
there are many ethnic specialties

175
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,440
and local products.

176
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
So we can

177
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,560
use these specialties and products

178
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,640
to create a dedicated travel route.

179
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,960
This way,

180
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,040
it maintains its tourism aspect

181
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,080
while also achieving some

182
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,480
commercial value.

183
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,440
So everyone makes money

184
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,160
and finds their smile again.

185
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,160
Smile Travel.

186
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,160
Plus E-commerce.

187
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,780
What about the specific plan?
