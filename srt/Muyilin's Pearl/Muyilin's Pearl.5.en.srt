1
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,680
This was my mother's phone number before she passed away.

2
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,520
Why do you have it?

3
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,440
Because I needed to register

4
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,600
for a new media account,

5
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,160
so I bought a SIM card.

6
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,039
I had no idea it was

7
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,840
your mother's previous number.

8
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,479
How long have you been

9
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,820
using this number?

10
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,560
Three months.

11
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,600
Three months.

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
So that means

13
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,440
you've seen all the messages

14
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,500
I've sent during these three months.

15
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,960
But I really wasn't trying to snoop.

16
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,840
Because

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,160
my phone was just sitting here,

18
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,680
and

19
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,280
I'd see the notifications pop up.

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,539
I honestly didn't know it was you before.

21
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,320
So,

22
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,290
you understand what I mean?

23
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:16,880
Well...

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,560
So...

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,040
You've known for days

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,450
that I was the one sending those messages.

27
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,800
That new girl Xiaomei is causing trouble again today,

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,000
she stole the route I've been working on for a month,

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
and then played the victim with me.

30
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,480
But it's fine,

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,640
she can't steal my brain,

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,760
I can still design new routes.

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,360
Everyone goes crazy at work,

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,000
just turn pressure into motivation.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,280
As long as the work doesn't kill me,

36
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,410
I'll work like hell.

37
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,800
Please watch over me,

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
dear mom.

39
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,329
Wrong chat, I guess.

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,850
The weather is really nice.

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,440
She's using this as her personal diary.

42
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,940
Let's leave her with something to remember.

43
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,200
Mom.

44
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,400
What's this about

45
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,220
you having a grave in Khorgos?

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,400
I came here to find my mother's grave.

47
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,600
Your mother's grave.

48
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,960
How could there be a grave on the grasslands?

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,090
Have you met before?

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,040
Mom.

51
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,760
I found your grave in Khorgos today.

52
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,760
What's going on here?

53
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,840
I got lost while looking for your grave,

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,420
even passed out on the way.

55
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,240
Luckily, I met a kind young man

56
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,970
who took me there on horseback.

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,760
It was my first time riding a horse.

58
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,020
You scared me to death.

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,440
That young man...

60
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,240
He's quite special.

61
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,760
It really is you.

62
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,200
I wasn't quite sure before

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
but now

64
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,360
I'm certain.

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,060
Then why did you

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,040
Why did you send that message?

67
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,960
I don't know why

68
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,360
I sent that text

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,880
it's because

70
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,680
that day on the grassland...

71
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
You'd better forget about me.

72
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,200
Just pretend

73
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,960
this never happened, that's all.

74
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,960
Why is he here?

75
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,720
Who's here?

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is someone there?

77
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,720
So he's the tenant here.

78
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
Hello, police?

79
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,200
Yes, that's right.

80
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,320
I need to report

81
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,680
a stranger in our house,

82
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,010
probably a peeping tom.

83
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm not a peeping tom!

84
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,520
Who would want to peep at you?

85
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,480
Please come over here.

86
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,560
Okay.

87
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,920
The courtyard, yes.

88
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,960
That's right.

89
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,290
Hello, comrade.

90
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,600
Hello, officer.

91
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,920
Here's what happened.

92
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,400
I was taking a shower

93
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,280
when I heard a noise outside

94
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,880
so I rushed out immediately.

95
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,800
A peeping tom!

96
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,560
This is terrifying.

97
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,760
Did you see what they looked like?

98
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,820
Let's talk inside.

99
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,480
They darted away

100
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,520
I couldn't see them clearly at all.

101
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
Could you tell if it was a man or woman?

102
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,220
No, I couldn't.

103
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,480
Was anything stolen?

104
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,520
I haven't had time to check.

105
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,680
As soon as I heard the noise, I blocked the door.

106
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,410
They must still be in this room.

107
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,720
What is this room for?

108
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,920
Is this your room?

109
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, it's like this.

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,760
I live in that room,

111
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,160
but my shower is broken,

112
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,320
so my landlord told me I could shower here,

113
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,250
and suddenly there was someone else in there with me.
