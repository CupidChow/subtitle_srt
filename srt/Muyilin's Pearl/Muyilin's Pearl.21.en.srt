1
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,160
I'm sorry,

2
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,800
I didn't ask for your permission

3
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,200
before opening your bag

4
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,060
and looking through your things.

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,200
I found this photo of Pearl.

6
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,600
I was so excited

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,480
when I also found a rental agreement,

8
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,920
so I came straight here.

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,800
How is your mother doing?

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,120
My mother passed away.

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,120
Twenty years ago,

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,120
she became seriously ill

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,840
and died quite suddenly.

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,960
Ma'am,

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,640
how did you know my mother?

16
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,400
She was the person who changed my life.

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,280
Handbags!

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,440

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,240

buy some today!

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,930
What happened next?

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,200
She said

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,280
my grapes are average quality,

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,610
with limited yield,

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,400
and in the trading zone

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,760
they're hard to sell.

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,800
Pearl.

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,480
She suggested trading my grapes

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,160
for her bags to sell instead.

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,640
Here.

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,760
This is your stall now.

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,079
Thank you.

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,920
Good luck.

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,400
Bags for sale! Bags for sale!

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,640
These bags

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,840
are the best in the entire trading zone,

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
come and buy!

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,000
The leatherwork is excellent,

49
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,280
come take a look! Bags for sale!

50
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Her bags

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,560
were hot items back then.

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,120
I became her first

53
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,640
and smallest distributor at the port.

54
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,800
Let's go.

55
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,000
Wait a moment.

56
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,160
You've been doing well lately.

57
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,020
This is for you.

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,450
Thank you, Zhenzhu.

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,560
Back then,

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,440
everyone envied Zhenzhu.

61
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,970
Her business was thriving,

62
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,360
and she had Samuhar, a perfect partner.

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,079
When she came to the trading area to sell goods,

64
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,610
he would come to pick her up.

65
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,730
They ate meat, drank wine, and rode horses together.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When she wasn't at the trading area,

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,600
he would accompany her on the grasslands.

68
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,860
According to Zhenzhu,

69
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,960
he herded sheep, read poetry, and played the dombra with her.

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
If Samuhar is so wonderful,

71
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,400
then,

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,079
why would he

73
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,840
owe my mother 100,000 yuan?

74
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,480
100,000 yuan

75
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,200
isn't a debt.

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,000
Samuhar owes Zhenzhu 100,000 yuan.

77
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,560
That's my bride price.

78
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,160
Bride price?

79
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,160
Zhenzhu,

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,120
in your hometown,

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,040
when people get married,

82
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,120
what do they need?

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,399
For marriage?

84
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,320
Well, a car and a house.

85
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
A car and a house.

86
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Do you have those?

87
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,760
I have a horse.

88
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
Can you buy me a house?

89
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,360
A house? I can't afford it right now.

90
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,570
Then what are we going to do?

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,320
In my hometown, for weddings,

92
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,780
we also need a bride price.

93
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,280
Bride price,

94
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,530
how much does that cost?

95
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,340
It's 100,000 yuan.

96
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
100,000 yuan?

97
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,700
I wouldn't be worth that much even if you sold me.

98
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,400
If I'm marrying you,

99
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,300
I don't need anything,

100
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,760
it's fine,

101
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,300
as long as it's you.

102
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,040
What about Samuhar?

103
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,400
Samuhar.

104
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,560
On that rainy night

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
my mother's condition suddenly worsened

106
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,500
and she was taken to the hospital in town.

107
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,400
Samuhar said he could ride a horse

108
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,300
to take me to see my mother.

109
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,440
The rain is so heavy, you must be careful!

110
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,240
It's fine.

111
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,420
Go back to the yurt.

112
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
I'll be back soon.

113
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,800
Alright.

114
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,520
Let's go.

115
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,890
The flashlight.

116
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,000
The grassland is vast.

117
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,200
When you want to see me,

118
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,600
just blow this

119
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,680
and I'll appear.

120
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,440
Pearl changed my life.

121
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,760
And I changed hers too.

122
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,800
Later, we lost touch.

123
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,960
You should go to a place.

124
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,720
That's what Samuhar left for Pearl.

125
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,640
At that time,

126
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,120
Samuhar was preparing

127
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,360
for Pearl's wedding.

128
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,040
That was Samuhar's surprise

129
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
for her.

130
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,410
All these years,

131
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,440
I've kept it safe.

132
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,020
Hoping that someday she would return

133
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,080
and open it herself.

134
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,360
Now

135
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,880
Yilin,

136
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,880
go check it out.

137
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,840
Thank you.

138
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,360
Thank you.

139
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,920
Our lives

140
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
seem to be full of multiple choices.

141
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,680
Love, career, life.

142
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,610
Sometimes we have choices,

143
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,200
sometimes heaven doesn't even

144
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,800
give us the chance to choose.

145
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,930
No longer passively changing,

146
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,560
passively striving,

147
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,080
passively persisting,

148
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,360
yet still never truly being ourselves.

149
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,280
Is everyone's life

150
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,600
predetermined from the start?

151
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,400
And am I

152
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,560
supposed to live this kind of life?
