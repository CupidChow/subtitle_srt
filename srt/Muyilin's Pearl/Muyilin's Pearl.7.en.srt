1
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,760
Dad,

2
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,560
look at this photo,

3
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,099
where did it come from?

4
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,240
This is Pearl.

5
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,400
In the blink of an eye,

6
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,060
thirty years have passed.

7
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,320
Today is Zhalma Restaurant's

8
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,280
70th anniversary.

9
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,640
There's also an arm wrestling competition here.

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,039
The winner gets a case of beer

11
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,320
and a free meal.

12
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,600
I won!

13
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,000
Pearl,

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,330
let me compete with you.

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,200
Come on, don't go easy on me.

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,000
Sure.

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,800
Drinks are on me.

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,320
She's so strong,

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,169
and can really hold her liquor.

20
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,800
She's beautiful too.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,200
And good at business.

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,600
Pearl,

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,120
is there anything you can't do?

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,560
Samuhar,

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
your acting is terrible.

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,600
You think I don't know

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,260
that you deliberately

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,240
let me win?

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,400
Your mother was such an energetic girl.

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,930
So your drinking capacity is hereditary.

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,000
You've never drunk with me.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,930
I just found out.

33
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,160
This is my first time drinking

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,200
with guests,

35
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,000
and also my first time

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,730
becoming friends with guests.

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,520
Uncle Yerken,

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,160
she and Samuhar,

39
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,600
the two of them.

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Samuhar,

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,200
those two,

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,210
they were dating back then.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,360
A perfect match,

44
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,920
they really looked great together.

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,540
What happened after that?

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,920
Later,

47
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,240
I don't know when it started,

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,730
but they never came back again.

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,440
We lost contact after that.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
However,

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,880
our connection is still quite deep.

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,079
Thirty years have passed,

53
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,740
and unexpectedly,

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,600
I meet her daughter here today.

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,400
How is your mother doing now?

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,079
My mother has passed away.

57
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,600
When did it happen?

58
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,340
What was the cause?

59
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,520
If I count now,

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,440
it's been about 20 years.

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,600
She had a serious illness then,

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,650
and passed away very suddenly.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,360
Uncle Yerken.

64
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,520
Uncle

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,660
Take it easy, slow down

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Be careful, Dad

67
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,880
It's fine

68
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,640
Yilin

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Have a seat

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,080
My dad is just very emotional

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,000
Really

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,480
Don't worry

73
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,800
Uncle just said

74
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,529
my mom might be doing business in the trading zone

75
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,120
So I think

76
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,400
I should go check out the trading zone

77
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,560
We definitely need to go

78
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,890
There must be some clues

79
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,240
Lu Hui works in the trading zone

80
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
He can take you there.

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,280
Yes, I work right over there,

82
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,840
I can take both of you together.

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,400
That works perfectly.

84
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,130
Great, let's go together then.

85
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,000
No, you stay and have a meal.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,080
You just got off the plane,

87
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,400
you haven't eaten yet, have you?

88
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,200
Stay and have something to eat,

89
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
then you can meet up with them later.

90
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,200
Our restaurant is a century-old establishment,

91
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,000
a famous culinary destination.

92
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,720
That's absolutely true.

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,640
Really?

94
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,560
It sounds delicious already.

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,360
Okay, I'll stay and grab a bite first,

96
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,560
then I'll come find you guys.

97
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,880
Great, enjoy your meal here,

98
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,000
alright, we'll go ahead,

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,800
call me when you're done eating.

100
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,820
Go on, go ahead.

101
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,680
Goodbye.

102
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,690
What specialties do you have here?

103
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I'll get you a menu.

104
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,400
Okay.

105
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,440
Let's go.

106
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,480
Everything looks so delicious.

107
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,480
I'll have

108
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,560
one Latiaozi

109
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
and two lamb skewers.

110
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,490
Coming right up!

111
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,160
Thank you.

112
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Uncle Fei, Uncle Fei.

113
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,880
Let me do it, let me do it.

114
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,600
You go ahead,

115
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,720
go take care of something else,

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,680
go on, go on.

117
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,360
Uncle Fei,

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,930
the young master is cooking again.

119
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,280
This customer is in for a treat.

120
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,120
Here you go.

121
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,680
Thank you.

122
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,920
You can go now.

123
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,560
Try it.

124
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,850
Alright.

125
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,480
Looks pretty good.

126
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,480
Hey...

127
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,560
This is way too salty!

128
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
It's so salty it's bitter.

129
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,280
So this is

130
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,720
your century-old restaurant's specialty?

131
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,080
One bite kills your appetite,

132
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,610
giving my taste buds the ultimate challenge.

133
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,360
I actually feel like

134
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,000
I want to cry right now.

135
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,180
This is truly my first time

136
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,200
understanding what it means to cry from bad food.

137
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,260
It's really awful.

138
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
How can someone as beautiful as you

139
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,760
say such harsh words?

140
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,040
But...

141
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,159
you...

142
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,680
Why are you upset?

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,460
You haven't even tried it.

144
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,280
Here,

145
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,570
try it yourself.

146
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,480
I'll ask Uncle Fei to make you another bowl.

147
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,720
Looks like crying runs in your family.

148
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Yilin, over here.

149
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,000
Hello, Mr. Lu.

150
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,200
Yilin.

151
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,960
Let me introduce you to

152
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,640
Jia Dan,

153
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,440
who's also my comrade-in-arms.

154
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,960
Mu Yilin.

155
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,320
Hello, Ms. Mu.

156
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,960
Please,

157
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,840
just call me Yilin.

158
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,320
Sister Yilin.

159
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,200
That works.

160
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,480
Jia Dan,

161
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,250
I need to ask you something.

162
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,640
In this area,

163
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,900
do you know about the luggage merchants?

164
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,000
Are there any suppliers

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,730
from Jiangsu who sell luggage?

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,480
Suppliers.

167
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,920
Brother Lu, for this trading area,

168
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,450
you know it better than I do.

169
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,360
Then there probably aren't any.

170
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,280
Yilin.

171
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,200
Is it possible

172
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
that your mother came here

173
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
but wasn't selling luggage?

174
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,400
Not likely,

175
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,880
my grandfather was in the luggage business back then.

176
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,559
I think we shouldn't rush,

177
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,620
there will definitely be some leads.

178
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,720
Friend.

179
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,080
I-I need to go.

180
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,400
Long time no see.

181
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,880
What brings you here today?

182
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,680
This is

183
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,360
a customer from Kazakhstan.

184
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,720
He-he's not.

185
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
He's from a village

186
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,720
near our border in Kazakhstan.

187
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,920
Lu often sends them school supplies

188
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,450
and Xinjiang nuts and such.

189
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,120
So he always brings wheat in return.

190
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,160
I came to express my gratitude.

191
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,620
Well, I'll accept it then.

192
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,640
Why did you

193
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,280
want to stay and work here?

194
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,000
I actually studied international trade in college,

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,280
which aligns with

196
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,120
what I'm doing now.

197
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,640
When I just graduated,

198
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,770
I heard Horgos had favorable policies

199
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,680
and was very supportive of college graduates starting businesses,

200
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,140
with more opportunities.

201
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,240
So I thought I'd come check it out.

202
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,100
Unexpectedly,

203
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,640
after I arrived, I didn't want to leave.

204
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,880
I want to stay here

205
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,480
and sell products from Xinjiang

206
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,440
and even great products from all over China

207
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,520
to the world.

208
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,600
I want more people to know about us

209
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,800
and buy our products.

210
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,980
What about you?

211
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,450
What are your goals and dreams?

212
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,040
I think

213
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
I don't know what my dream is.

214
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
To be precise,

215
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,400
I don't know what I want to do.

216
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,080
Actually, sometimes

217
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,640
I really envy people who have dreams.

218
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Like you.

219
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
I feel that

220
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,800
you guys have things you like to do,

221
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,280
things you love doing.

222
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,640
That must be really nice.
