1
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,520
Yilin.

2
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,080
Um,

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,120
I'm sorry,

4
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,000
I mistranslated something earlier.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,680
Just now

6
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,400
Ali and I went to see Grandma again,

7
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,480
and she told me

8
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,400
that she saw your mother at Aken's concert 30 years ago.

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
She met her there.

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,280
She said

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,770
your mother was a very special person.

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,200
Later,

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,160
she fell in love with a local young man named Samuhar.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,760
They were in a relationship.

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,840
Thank you.

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,880
Lu Hui.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,800
What's wrong?

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,220
Help! Please help!

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,000
So much work, I'm exhausted.

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,000
Alright, hurry up.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,160
Yilin, I'll go help them first.

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,690
Let's go.

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,280
Mom.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,840
Let me tell you,

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,759
I had such

26
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,490
an incredible birthday today.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,920
Today I

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,040
met that boy from yesterday again.

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,000
When I saw him,

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,600
my heart started racing a little.

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,860
What's that all about?

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,840
He took me to a Kazakh wedding.

33
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,640
We danced, ate delicious food,

34
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,300
and he got me to drink a lot.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,480
I made a fool of myself,

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,370
but my tolerance is actually pretty good.

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,079
I even won a sheep.

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
Mom.

39
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,280
I'm 30 years old now.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,880
If you were still here,

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,260
you would wish me happy birthday, wouldn't you?

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,320
There's no signal here at all,

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,130
I can't get a ride anywhere,

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,360
how are we going to get back?

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
We can't possibly walk back, can we?

46
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,920
Mu Yilin.

47
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,520
You can't get a ride on the grassland at this hour.

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,480
I'm also heading back to the city,

49
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,540
let's go together.

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,000
Even the lambs are eager to go home.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,530
Let's go.

52
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,079
Get in the car.

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,450
Thanks for the trouble.

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,160
Get in.

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,600
Look at you,

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,200
why are you so shameless?

57
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,560
Alright, let's go home.

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,210
It's right here.

59
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,840
Yes, this is the place.

60
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,560
Thank you.

61
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,890
Take it slow.

62
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,159
Don't move. Stay still.

63
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,520
Thank you for today.

64
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,360
I'll head in first.

65
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,120
Get some rest.

66
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,210
Goodbye.

67
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,160
Goodbye.

68
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,880
What's your name?

69
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,570
You don't want to leave,

70
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,570
you really love riding in cars.

71
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,130
Take it easy.

72
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,360
Meeting you,

73
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,360
the snow mountains, grasslands, and sheep herds

74
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,840
all witnessed our love.

75
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,880
You said if we had nothing,

76
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,520
I answered I'd be responsible for making money,

77
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,040
and you'd be responsible for poetry and grasslands.

78
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,720
That's such lovesick thinking.

79
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,280
I went to the places we used to go,

80
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,140
but I couldn't find you anywhere.

81
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,280
Flowers lost their fragrance,

82
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,840
grass lost its green,

83
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,360
sunlight lost its warmth.

84
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,900
The place where I buried our memories

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
lets me see our beginning.

86
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,280
What's happening?

87
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,800
They seem to be the same.

88
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,040
Excuse me,

89
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,000
I'd like to ask you,

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,960
is this Kazakh writing?

91
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,240
Yes, it is.

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,000
Great!

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,040
Could you help me read

94
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,320
what's written here?

95
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,920
Samuhar owes Pearl 100,000 yuan.

96
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,480
What does that mean?

97
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,080
This is an IOU.

98
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,200
An IOU?

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,240
Samuhar

100
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,400
owes Zhenzhu

101
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,760
100,000 yuan.

102
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,200
Look,

103
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,640
I hope my mom wasn't

104
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,200
also scammed out of 100,000 by some guy.

105
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,960
What is it with us,

106
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,850
mother and daughter both attracting losers?

107
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,480
If this was 30 years ago,

108
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,720
that would've been an astronomical sum.

109
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,100
If he had to pay it back now,

110
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
how much would that be?

111
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,040
No,

112
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,900
I need to get to the bottom of this before I leave.

113
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,039
I'll give you one more month

114
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,600
if you can't develop new routes

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,130
pack your things and leave.

116
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,700
I'll do my best, Director Kim.

117
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,440
Hey, Director Kim.

118
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,760
Mu Yilin.

119
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,400
So you're not coming to work anymore?

120
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,840
I'm in Xinjiang

121
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,680
in Horgos.

122
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
If I don't see you at your desk today,

123
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,920
you're fired.

124
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,720
Please don't, Director Kim.

125
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,520
Five routes.

126
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,160
I promise

127
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,320
to give you five travel routes

128
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,680
within a month.

129
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,840
Fine,

130
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,300
you can stay there,

131
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,980
but no funding, no budget.

132
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,800
Five.

133
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,520
Five. That's the limit.

134
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,720
You've got nerve.

135
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,200
Five per month.

136
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,360
That's it.

137
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,880
Come on.

138
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,840
Miss Mu,

139
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,760
at the price you offered,

140
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,880
plus sheep-raising capability,

141
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,280
and daily rental option,

142
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,680
this is the only place that meets your requirements.

143
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,610
Let's go inside.

144
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,720
Come,

145
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
let's take a look.

146
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,480
Beautiful, isn't it?

147
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,600
Take a look.

148
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,480
If you rent this place, it would be a shared apartment.

149
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,520
Would that work for you?

150
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,960
No problem. I'll take it.

151
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,000
Great.

152
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,520
Alright, let's sign the contract then.

153
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,680
Samuhar.

154
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,600
Who exactly is this Samuhar?

155
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,680
And you.

156
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,480
And who are you?

157
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,380
Four

158
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,400
Hello?

159
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,120
Hello? Hi there.

160
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,460
Who is this?

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,560
Hello?

162
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,410
Hello? Hi there.

163
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,120
Text message

164
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,600
This person is also in Khorgos.

165
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,650
