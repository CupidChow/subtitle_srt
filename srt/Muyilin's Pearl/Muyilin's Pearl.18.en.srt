1
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,560
There seems to be some destined energy

2
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,240
that makes me feel grounded, relaxed, and secure.

3
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,320
That led me to you.

4
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,720
I can't tell if it's because of my racing heart

5
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,930
or the sweet impulse filling my heart.

6
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,560
You appear resilient and strong,

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
but I know the loneliness and hardship inside you.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,080
Pearl,

9
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,800
from now on,

10
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,490
has taken on a tangible definition for me.

11
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,520
She

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,860
doesn't just refer to my mother-in-law.

13
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,320
The most important thing

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,400
is that she

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,160
guides me

16
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,400
and helps me find what I

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,520
truly cherish and value.

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,020
Something precious I can hold in the palm of my hand.

19
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,880
Lu Hui.

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,490
I have something I want to tell you.

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,560
What's wrong? Are you going to answer the phone?

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,820
I'll go answer it then.

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,720
Hello?

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,280
Jia Dan just told me

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
that those short video merchants we trained before

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,740
are having some problems.

27
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Then you should hurry and go.

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,680
You,

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
what did you want to tell me just now?

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,160
Nothing,

31
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,440
why don't I go with you?

32
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,400
Wait here, I'll go put on some clothes

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,660
and we'll go together.

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,800
Packing deliveries frantically like last time.

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,930
There's a lot to do, it's complicated.

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,920
Yilin.

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,840
What are you doing here?

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,770
I came to see you.

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,640
Get away.

40
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,280
It's fine, it's fine.

41
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,380
Chen Peng, what are you doing?

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,440
We broke up three months ago,

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,000
and now you bring this person to my home.

44
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,280
It's okay, it's okay,

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,000
let go of me.

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,460
What are you doing?

47
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm pursuing her.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,640
I just had nowhere else to go, that's why I came here.

49
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,040
You can chase whoever you want,

50
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,560
but why come to my place?

51
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,800
Come on, what's the big deal?

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,200
You haven't even changed your password.

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,060
Did you miss me?

54
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,079
Get out!

55
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,720
I'm sorry, miss,

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,840
I just met him,

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,800
I didn't know this was your home.

58
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,760
I don't care who she is to you,

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,680
right now, both of you

60
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
need to get out of my house.

61
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,520
You really ruin everything.

62
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,640
Come back,

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,040
take your trash with you.

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,360
Like this.

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,500
Lend me another 2,000.

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,980
How's it going?

67
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,890
You're still asking for money?

68
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,080
You previously borrowed 100,000 yuan in my name,

69
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,040
and you haven't paid back a single cent.

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,400
Look, if I had 100,000,

71
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,130
would I be asking you for 2,000?

72
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,000
Get out!

73
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,940
Are you leaving or not?

74
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,159
Is this your roommate?

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,240
Hello,

76
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm Chen Peng,

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,860
Mu Yilin's boyfriend.

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,659
Ex-boyfriend.

79
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,080
Your place is really nice.

80
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,400
That's good.

81
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,440
I'm relieved.

82
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,720
Lu Hui,

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,370
why don't you go to the store first.

84
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,850
Don't worry,

85
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,520
I can handle this myself.

86
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,640
Okay.

87
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,880
If anything happens,

88
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,520
call me.

89
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,080
Yilin.

90
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,240
Are you getting used to the food in Xinjiang?

91
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,680
I brought you lots of delicious things.

92
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,400
Get out,

93
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,920
I said get out.

94
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,520
Get out!

95
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,650
How did you find this place?

96
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,860
Phone location tracking,

97
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,660
you never unlinked it.

98
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,560
Tell me,

99
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
what do you really want?

100
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,640
Yilin.

101
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,000
I came to apologize to you.

102
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,680
We've already broken up,

104
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,360
can you please stop being so persistent?

105
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,480
But you were the one who ended things,

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't accept it.

107
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,120
The reason I came all this way to find you

108
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,320
is because

109
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,480
I want you to see my sincerity.

110
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,680
I was wrong.

111
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,170
During this time we've been apart,

112
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,770
I've thought about a lot of things.

113
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,440
I've been reflecting on myself.

114
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,810
You supported my business.

115
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,740
You took care of me.

116
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,770
But what did I do?

117
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,610
I ended up leaving you with a mountain of debt.

118
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,280
I understand now,

119
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,520
it was all my fault.

120
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,840
Will you give me another chance?

121
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,680
Since you know it's your problem,

122
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,450
hurry up and pay me back that 100,000 yuan.

123
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,650
I've already figured out a way.

124
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,200
This time I'll definitely make money,

125
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,400
and once I make money, I can pay you back,

126
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,640
right?

127
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,440
Go,

128
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
leave this place,

129
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,780
don't let me see you again.

130
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,080
Yilin.

131
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,240
If you don't leave, I'm calling the police.

132
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,640
How dare Chen Peng come here?

133
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,770
Is he out of his mind?

134
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,770
How did you find out?

135
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,120
Lu Hui called me and told me everything.

136
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,800
He was worried you wouldn't be safe alone,

137
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,060
so he asked me to rush back to check on you.

138
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,080
Wait,

139
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,610
why did he come here anyway?

140
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,640
He says he's changed

141
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,600
and wants to reconcile.

142
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,800
He will never change.

143
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,600
Yilin,

144
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,440
you didn't agree to get back with him, did you?

145
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,680
Of course not.

146
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,600
But I do think

147
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,720
that since he's

148
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,200
trying to be better now,

149
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
it's at least some progress for him.

150
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,080
Oh my god,

151
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,140
don't you know a leopard can't change its spots?

152
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,000
Calm down.

153
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,160
Let's go.

154
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,480
Eat up.

155
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,600
Why are you just staring?

156
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,080
Come on.

157
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,440
Lu Hui.

158
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,040
That Chen Peng,

159
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,800
he's my ex-boyfriend.

160
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,400
But don't get the wrong idea,

161
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,640
after we broke up,

162
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,300
we never saw each other again.

163
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,900
Yesterday he came to see me

164
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,000
saying

165
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,080
that he couldn't let go,

166
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,800
that he would change and all that.

167
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,440
But I know

168
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,970
that's simply impossible.

169
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,360
I've already been blind once.

170
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,920
This time,

171
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,280
I'm finally getting better.

172
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,360
You're not angry, are you?

173
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,160
A little bit.

174
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,610
Jubarhan Tohtarbek

175
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,650
