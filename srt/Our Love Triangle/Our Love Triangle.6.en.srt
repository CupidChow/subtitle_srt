On a meaningful day like this,

If we ask her directly,
can it even be called a gift?

69

183
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,458
You've always been my toughest nut to crack.

184
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,083
Even back in high school,

185
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,708
I liked you so bad.

186
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,283
But you never looked at me the same...

187
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,708
Gosh whatever!

188
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,458
I've had enough.

189
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,333
Now I won't care about you either.

190
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,542
I'm saying it again.

191
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,875
That was just a mistake.

192
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,000
That stupid photo stand.

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,125
And what happened on that day.

194
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,158
They were all just mistakes.

195
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,208
Woo Jin.

196
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,083
Can you help me clean up?

197
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,700
Sure.

198
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,750
Hey,

199
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,417
did you know?

200
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:49,117
That she used to like him?

201
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,950
No.

202
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,667
I saw his face.

203
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,867
Seemed like he also has something for her.

204
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,875
It all adds up now.

205
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,417
That's why there's tension between you and Eun Hwan.

206
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,950
What?

207
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,700
You like Hae Rin too.

208
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,700
You're really sleeping after all that fuss?

209
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,125
That was...

210
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,000
not a mistake.

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,992
At least to me.

212
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,500
That day, two years ago...

213
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,000
I haven't forgotten it, not even once.

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,667
It was the first time
I wanted something so badly.

215
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,408
But...

216
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,783
At some point, I got scared.

217
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,117
If things went further,

218
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,675
I thought we'd end up like...

219
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,908
Just like what happened with me and my father.

220
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,950
I got scared of losing you.

221
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,825
Happy birthday, Hae Rin.

222
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,283
And...

223
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,117
I like you.

224
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,825
