1
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,750
It's been a while.

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,000
I've missed you.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,217
Yoo Hae Rin.

[Our Love Triangle]

00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:39,625
[EP02. My Guy Friend's Mixed Signals]

6
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,125
Crazy... It's really crazy!

7
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,458
So the one I saw yesterday was really Cha Eun Hwan.

8
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,500
When everyone started coming in yesterday,
I really saw him.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
But I wasn't totally sure he actually showed up at our show.

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,125
So, I was kinda thinking maybe I got it wrong.

11
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,925
But it was really him.

12
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,042
Yeah...

13
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:00,542
For real, it was him.

14
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:03,833
Anyway, he had that total movie star vibe.

15
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,125
He was like, super handsome up close.

16
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,792
He's got the perfect figure. You saw it too, right?

17
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:11,708
I saw what? Shut up.

18
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,667
What was that, Woo Jin?

19
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:14,917
Are you...

20
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:16,685
getting jealous of a hot guy now?

21
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:19,500
- That's enough.
- That's enough.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,875
By the way, Hae Rin.

23
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,083
You didn't know about anything either?

24
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,417
Nope.

25
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,167
Why didn't he tell you anything?

26
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,750
I heard from the others

27
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,550
that you guys were best buds since you were kids.

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,917
Can you just zip it?

29
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:38,592
Why? Why do I have to zip it?

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,125
Why... are you here?

31
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,625
You didn't know?

32
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,300
I applied to return to university today.

33
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,917
What's with that reaction?

34
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:04,208
This isn't what I was expecting.

35
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,217
You didn't miss me?

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,875
Well that's the last thing I want to hear

37
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:14,592
from someone who hasn't hit me up for two years.

38
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,092
Is it?

39
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,833
Well,

40
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,458
I just swung by today to say hi.

41
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,042
Catch you later then.

42
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:25,500
But next time,

43
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,800
maybe give me a warmer welcome, please?

44
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,875
What's going through his mind now?

45
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,050
How's that even possible?

46
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,750
You scared the heck out of me.

47
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,467
Hi again.

48
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,750
Can we just say hi normally to each other, please?

49
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,000
Or are you going to keep up with that?

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,208
Alright, got it. Just, keep the distance.

51
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,750
I'm still not used to it.

52
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,792
You're not used to what?

53
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:18,125
Do you think I got even more handsome
since the last time we met?

54
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,542
Not sure if you're more handsome or what,

55
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:23,008
but I'm pretty sure you're now so full of yourself.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,250
I even swung by to catch your show the other day.

57
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,625
You knew that, right?

58
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,125
Your performance was really impressive.

59
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,592
Maybe it's because you had an awesome acting teacher?

60
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,417
It has nothing to do with you, at all.

61
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,833
It's the result I made myself by practicing.

62
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,875
You should stop claiming you were ever my acting teacher.

63
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,000
That was just for a short bit when I was prepping for university exams.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,875
I wasn't talking about me.

65
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,750
I meant our "Acting Instructor".

66
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,000
So what?

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,467
What are you getting at?

68
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,083
I really think

69
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,375
we're like, totally meant to be.

70
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,958
Mentor 'Hae Rin' - Mentee 'Eun Hwan'

71
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,467
How did we even end up in the same group?

72
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,292
Hate to break it to you, but find someone else.

73
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,542
I'm kinda swamped these days.

74
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:15,583
I already checked out

75
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,675
that we can't swap partners on our own.

76
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:25,042
"Basic Theory of Acting" is a required course, so you have to take it,

77
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:27,208
and the prof for "Intro to Theater Musicals" is super cool.

78
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,792
You can snag easy A's in this class,

79
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:32,175
but it might be tough for you
because there's a bunch of group projects.

80
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:37,750
Hey you, focus!

81
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,500
Don't even think about bugging me later.

82
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,167
I'm already focusing.

83
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,500
I mean,

84
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,000
focus on the task, not me.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,208
I'm just

86
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,883
checking out my old pal. It's been a while.

87
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,333
Is it just a feeling?

88
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,133
Or did you actually get prettier?

89
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,633
Are you nuts?!

90
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,333
You're right.

91
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,250
Am I going crazy?

92
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,342
Thinking that you're actually pretty.

93
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,542
I'm starving.

94
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm seriously hungry now.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So, why don't we go grab a bite?

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,167
We can wrap this up later.

97
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,250
Do you even know what time it is?

98
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,967
Stop talking nonsense and...

99
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,550
How about dinner with Min Joo today?

100
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,542
You're the one who needs to stay focused here.

101
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,958
Hey, give it back.

102
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,342
I'll give it back if you come with me.

103
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,833
Come on, let's just head out.

104
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,208
I'll treat you to something expensive.

105
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,208
Okay? Shall we?

106
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,967
Shall we, huh?

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,583
What do you wanna eat?

108
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,417
How about a course meal?

109
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:02,750
Hey, aren't those kinda pricey?

110
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,958
I told you, I'm treating you to something expensive.

111
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,383
Heard you shot a commercial.
Maybe you're rolling in dough now?

112
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,917
How did you know I shot a commercial?

113
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:14,792
It's like... How could I not know

114
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,333
when everyone's buzzing about it
on our university's community site?

115
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,458
Well, you are right.

116
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,083
Need anything else?

117
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,633
Nope.

118
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,425
Excuse me?

119
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,542
We'd like to have the D course meal, please

120
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:30,792
Alright.

121
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,458
Excuse me, but...

122
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,625
Are you Cha Eun Hwan?

123
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,167
Well, yes.

124
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,958
Then, can we maybe grab a selfie together...

125
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,375
If it's not too much to ask?

126
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,883
Sure.

127
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,633
Thank you very much.

128
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,542
Now you're like, officially an actor.

129
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,925
You've got fans all over the place.

130
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,042
I thought you'd be past your prime post-military.

131
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:05,583
I'm just way too good-looking to be forgotten.

132
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,583
I was one of top rising stars once though.

133
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,333
How could I be over the hill in just two years?

134
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,708
Yeah you're the super star here.

135
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:14,428
But why did you you decide to come back to
university? Instead of just living the superstar life?

136
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,084
I...

137
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:18,542
heard you're about to join a new project.

138
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:21,008
So, you're not working on that project?

139
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,458
Well, I didn't really want to join that project.

140
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,125
But I changed my mind.

141
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,417
Now I've got a solid reason to join.

142
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,458
What is it?

143
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,625
Is it a drama?

144
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,583
Or maybe a movie?

145
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,008
Well...

146
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,508
That's a secret.

147
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,667
Anyway.

148
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,842
Tell me the truth now, please.

149
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,508
You really haven't thought about me at all?

150
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,758
Not really.

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,458
Wow, that's kind of a bummer.

152
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,883
I've thought about you a lot.

153
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,217
I've really missed you.

154
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,967
Your appetizers are here.

155
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:35,875
Can't believe I finished all this.

156
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,050
I'm so full now.

157
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:46,167
Gosh.

158
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,893
You're still so messy when you eat?

159
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,383
Here's your phone.

160
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,000
So, there nothing more to do, right?

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,250
Let's get going then.

162
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,842
Already?

163
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,000
It's really been a while.
Why don't we grab a beer at least?

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,625
We just finished eating,
so it's time for drinks.

165
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,467
Hey.

166
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,425
That's enough.

167
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:20,333
Seems like you're just happy to see me again.

168
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,092
But I'm not.

169
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,342
Ever since then, I've been feeling

170
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,508
uncomfortable around you.

171
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,125
Two years ago, we drank at your house.

172
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,800
You remember that?

173
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,667
Since I couldn't contact you again,

174
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:44,467
I was worried something had happened.

175
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,458
I learned of your enlistment
through an article, not from you.

176
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,583
You literally vanished without a word,

177
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,208
and now you just show up here,
acting like we are super close.

178
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,917
How can you say that?

179
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:02,375
You are one of my best friends, so...

180
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,375
One of your best friends...

181
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, we're friends.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,750
Sorry, I was kinda harsh to my friend.

183
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,833
Hey, Yoo Hae Rin.

184
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,542
Sorry, but I'm really beat today.
So I'd better head out now.

185
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,258
Thanks for the nice meal.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,050
I really...

187
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,667
had no time to tell you anything then.
Everything happened so fast.

188
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,667
It's not like what you think.

189
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,042
There was nothing I could do, so...

190
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,917
But you should've told me something anyway.

191
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:29,167
Do you even know

192
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,842
how I felt when you just left me like that?

193
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,167
Do you remember...

194
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,425
what happened between us on that day.

195
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,217
