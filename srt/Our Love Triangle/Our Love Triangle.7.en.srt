What? How did I end up in my room?

3
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:26,714
What's this?

4
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,975
Is it from Woo Jin?

00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,267
<i>You also like Hae Rin.</i>

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,375
Are you heading to class?

10
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,667
Yes.

11
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:36,250
I really need to rest for a bit.

12
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,042
I did a bit of clean-up yesterday.

13
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:40,142
And now my whole body aches.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,625
What are you looking at so intently?

15
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,392
If you're going, go ahead.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,250
Hey, Son Min Joo. What you said to me yesterday, about...

17
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,583
What?

18
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,183
That you're into Unnie Hae Rin?

19
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,500
Hey, don't worry.

20
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,600
I'll act like I didn't hear a thing.

21
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,708
Anyway,

22
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,833
you're going to sort things out, too.

23
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,433
What?

24
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,375
You also heard everything yesterday.

25
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,875
About what's going on between them.

26
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,458
So let's stop talking about it, okay?

27
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,267
I'll pretend I didn't hear a thing, either.

28
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,100
No, there's no need for that.

29
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,225
I'm going to ask her out.

30
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,208
Hey, you...

31
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,333
What happened between them in the past,

32
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,250
whom Noona Hae Rin liked before,

33
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,350
I don't care about any of that.

34
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,850
I didn't fall for her after keeping tabs, you know.

35
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:43,308
But still,

36
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,225
thanks for the consideration.

00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,708
- Hey!
- Gosh, you scared me.

42
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,958
It seems you're not busy today.

43
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,125
What brings you to the university?

44
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,833
How can I be busy all the time?

45
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,151
What about you? Are you feeling okay now?

46
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,750
Do you remember everything from yesterday?

47
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,250
Yes.

48
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,292
I had some cake yesterday,

49
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,167
did a bit of drinking,

50
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,975
and chowed down on some chicken.

51
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,308
Was there anything else?

52
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,500
Of course, you don't remember a thing.

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,958
Classic you, blanking out whenever you drink.

54
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,042
I was worried for no reason, right?

55
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:55,933
Why are you picking a fight again?

56
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,667
Wait, did I do something crazy yesterday?

57
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,958
Yes, you did.

58
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,125
You were a total mess yesterday.

59
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,208
You don't remember, do you?

60
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,167
The real mess probably wasn't me, but rather you.

61
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:08,100
You just showed up and stirred up trouble for no reason.

62
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,392
That necklace... is pretty.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,500
Right?

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,542
Unlike someone who doesn't give gifts,

65
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:18,708
my sweet Woo Jin left this for me.

66
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,667
What?

67
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,417
He said that? That he gave it?

68
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:24,542
No, but I found it next to me when I woke up.

69
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,808
He said he'd give me a gift a little later.

70
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,167
Should I just tell her myself or...

71
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,333
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,042
Anyway, I'm glad I met you.

73
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:35,000
What is the plan for our mentoring project?

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,917
The report is due this week.

75
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,708
Oh, that movie thing?

76
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,475
That's just...

77
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:43,750
We can go watch one now.

78
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,875
Now?

79
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,225
Yes.

80
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,017
Why are you just standing there? Come on in.

81
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,417
You know,

82
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:02,042
I said we should go watch a movie.

83
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:03,208
Why are we at your place?

84
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,600
You said you'd be uncomfortable in theaters if people recognize us.

85
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,975
Where else could we go?

86
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,500
Oh gosh, are you serious?

87
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,417
Hey, why the heck did you...

88
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:22,833
Why? You said you would throw it away.

89
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,725
So I took it, all neat and tidy.

90
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,250
No, but...

91
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,667
Why did you put it over there?

92
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,625
- Just throw it away.
- Hang on.

93
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,375
Why throw it away? That's just wasteful.

94
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,225
I suffered so much taking that picture that day.

95
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,084
Here. Wait for a minute, please.

96
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:43,933
Let me first take off my jacket.

97
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,625
What was that all of a sudden?

98
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,183
Oh, it's not an important scene anyway.

99
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,392
Why?

100
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,667
Are you scared I'll do something?

101
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:28,225
Wh-What are you talking about? Such nonsense.

102
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,792
What are you looking at?

103
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,500
Just watch the movie.

104
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,875
Sorry, but I'm not thinking about doing something, either.

105
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,917
Who even said anything?

106
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,975
You're making a fuss all by yourself.

107
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,500
<i>You also heard everything yesterday.</i>

108
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,433
<i>About what's going on between them.</i>

109
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,083
Oh, were you at home, Min Joo?

110
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,458
Yes, you've been somewhere?

111
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,333
I didn't see you at the university today.

112
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,917
I was at Eun Hwan's place.

113
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,875
Sunbae Eun Hwan's place?

114
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, it was for the assignment.

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,058
I used to head over there sometimes.

116
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,042
That's a necklace I haven't seen before.

117
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,625
Did you buy it?

118
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,125
Oh, this?

119
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,958
No, looks like Woo Jin left it here yesterday.

120
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,958
I forgot to call him.

121
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,208
It would be better to thank him in person tomorrow.

122
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,417
Go get some rest.

123
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,292
Unnie, you're really...

124
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,058
You have it good.

125
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,542
What?

126
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:58,501
It's nothing.

127
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:00,225
Get some rest, Unnie.

128
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,917
Anyway,

129
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:19,042
once we start filming and really kick things off,

130
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,458
things will change a lot from how they are now.

131
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,250
I know you're already famous, but...

132
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,042
You get what I'm saying, right?

133
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,417
Totally. Don't worry.

134
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:30,517
I've been cutting back on social media lately.

135
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,417
Eun Hwan, please take good care of her, okay?

136
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,583
That's what friends are for, right?

137
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,000
You don't have to worry about that.

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,708
He's already helping me a lot.

139
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,917
We're super tight, you know.

140
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:44,642
That's good to hear.

141
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,350
Sorry, I have to take this call.

142
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,183
Yes, yes it's me.

143
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,625
Right.

144
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,042
I just remembered; wasn't it Hae Rin's birthday recently?

145
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,542
I had it in mind

146
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:10,308
but was too busy to even send wishes.

147
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,542
Maybe we should all hang out together soon,

148
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:16,125
just like the old days.

149
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,625
Whether we like it or not, we will be seeing each other more often.

150
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,750
We need to get used to this all over again.

151
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,750
Maybe I'll hit her up (contact) today.

152
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,708
I can just tell her to swing by.

153
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,542
We were best friends at one point.

154
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,892
- Why should we stay awkward with each other-
- Park Seo Ah.

155
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,308
Stop it already.

156
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,250
Stop acting chummy (friendly) with Hae Rin.

157
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,475
You're not even that close with her.

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,642
Don't you remember?

159
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,625
<i>What? Do you want me to say it again?</i>

160
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,975
<i>Yoo Hae Rin likes you.</i>

161
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,500
<i>Looks like I was right.</i>

162
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
<i>You already knew it, too.</i>

163
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,558
<i>But you went out of your way to avoid it.</i>

164
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,375
<i>So here's what I'm thinking.</i>

165
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,225
<i>I've got a suggestion for you.</i>

166
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,583
<i>How about you date me?</i>

167
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,125
<i>- What?
- I'm saying you can use me.</i>

168
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,917
<i>I'll let you do that.</i>

169
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:15,833
<i>Then you can stay friends with Yoo Hae Rin forever, just like now.</i>

170
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,292
<i>I thought you guys were friends.</i>

171
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,725
<i>- Why go so far-
- It's just not fair.</i>

172
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,850
<i>I've got to steal you away from her at least once.</i>

173
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,750
<i>Do you know what's my biggest regret right now?</i>

174
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,667
It's joining hands with you back then.

175
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,917
Even if it meant never seeing Hae Rin again,

176
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,933
I shouldn't have done that.

177
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:40,500
So please just leave her alone.

178
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,917
You don't need to try that hard anymore.

179
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,667
You're doing way better than her anyway.

180
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,708
You don't have to feel inferior-

181
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:50,200
Eun Hwan, why would you say such things?

182
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,708
That really hurts, you know.

183
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:55,433
I was just trying to get along with Hae Rin, that's all.

184
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,167
Fine.

185
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,000
I guess I was being too sensitive.

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,308
Sorry.

187
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,142
Woo Jin!

188
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,958
Sorry for asking to meet out of the blue.

189
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,183
No, it's fine. I had something to tell you, too.

190
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,433
But why are you drinking alone? You could've drunk with me.

191
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:39,792
I felt like I needed to get a bit tipsy first.

192
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,833
What do you need to get tipsy for?

193
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,142
Did you get dumped or something?

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,208
Hey, I was just joking.

195
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,125
It's not something like that, right?

196
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,850
No.

197
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,750
Not yet.

198
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,350
I really thought you...

199
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,683
Wait, "not yet"?

200
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,225
Do you have someone you like?

201
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,708
- Yes.
- Who?

202
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,558
Do I know her, too?

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,433
Noona, before we get into that...

204
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,958
What's this?

205
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,808
It's your birthday gift.

206
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,125
Sorry it's late.

207
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,875
But I wanted to give this to you in person.

208
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,042
Didn't you already give me a gift?

209
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,267
What?

210
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,792
This necklace.

211
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,892
Didn't you give this to me?

212
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,100
I don't think it's me.

213
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,667
It can't be.

214
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,042
That day, when I was asleep...

215
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:01,225
<i>Happy birthday, Yoo Hae Rin.</i>

216
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,958
Cha Eun Hwan.

217
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,508
<i>And, I'm in love with you.</i>

218
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:20,558
<i>That necklace... is pretty.</i>

219
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:23,808
It was you...

220
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,542
Woo Jin, I'm so sorry,

221
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,792
but I really need to see someone right now.

222
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,625
Let's talk again later.

223
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,933
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

224
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,267
Eun Hwan! Hey, Cha Eun Hwan!

225
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:01,792
- What, why are you here?
- Why didn't you answer your phone?

226
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:02,958
I didn't hear it ring.

227
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,125
Why? What's up?

228
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,640
Did something happen?

229
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:13,200

From now on, you...

231
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,058
Tell me honestly.

232
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,083
- What...
- No lies.

233
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,350
And no running away.

234
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,892
Only straight talk, okay?

235
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,058
You...

236
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,642
Do you like me?

237
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll ask again.

238
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,250
But this is the last time.

239
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,475
So please answer sincerely.

240
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,392
You...

241
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:53,392
Do you really... like me?

242
00:14:58,042 --> 00:14:59,475
