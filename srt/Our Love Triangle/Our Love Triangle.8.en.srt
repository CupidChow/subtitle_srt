00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
From now on, you...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,975
Tell me honestly.

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,167
What...

4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,808
You...

5
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,267
Do you like me?

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,917
I'll ask again,

7
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,167
but this is the last time.

8
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:21,500
So answer sincerely, please.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,375
You...

10
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,542
Do you seriously...

11
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:27,142
like me?

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,330
I do.

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,267
Wait.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,475
This time, it's not a mistake, right?

20
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,808
- That's your concern right now?<br>- It's important!

21
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,933
Today's just like that day.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,333
"Just like that day"?

23
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,708
Stop playing dumb.

24
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,708
The day we ended up sleeping together like this.

25
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,250
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,833
We slept together?

27
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,641
You and I?

<i>(Episode 8: What is our relationship?)</i>

30
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,792
Why are you bringing this up only now?

31
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,417
You never asked.

32
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:58,083
And what's there to tell or not?

33
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,167
Nothing happened.

34
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,850
You didn't know all this time?

35
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,708
How can nothing have happened?

36
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,292
We definitely kissed,

37
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:10,125
and went right into the room.

38
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,708
Yes, into the room.

39
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:16,750
And I thought we slept together.

40
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,458
Yes, you slept.

41
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,142
Slept like a log.

42
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,808
Wait! Wait!

43
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:36,767
Hey, Hae Rin! Are you all right?

44
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,583
Wow! You puked out everything,

45
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,167
and then immediately fell fast asleep.

46
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,083
I nearly killed myself moving you to the bed.

47
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,058
That can't be.

48
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,042
Hey, but don't you think you're too mean?

49
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,625
No matter how it seemed,

50
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,083
I'm not that big of a jerk.

51
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,833
What do you even think of me?

52
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,083
What was I supposed to think?

53
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,600
I thought you were trash.

54
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,584
What?

55
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:10,167
But still, you ran away.

56
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,625
After that kiss...

57
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,833
Hey, that was...

58
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,225
You heard me explain, why ask again?

59
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:19,917
No, I didn't hear anything.

60
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:22,833
You gave me this necklace, that's all I figured out on the way here.

61
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,792
Why? Did you say something?

62
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you trying to say now?

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,167
No, I'm just curious.

64
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,375
Did you really say something? Come on, tell me.

65
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,850
I really didn't hear anything.

66
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,100
Are you embarrassed?

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,167
Fine, I'll just pretend I heard something and—

68
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,058
I like you.

69
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,208
What?

70
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,542
I said I like you.

71
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,517
Sorry I said it too late.

72
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:22,525
<i>Cha Eun Hwan. It was him.</i>

73
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,475
<i>(Son Min Joo)</i>

74
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:28,542
Min Joo, you haven't left for class yet?

75
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,767
Yes, not yet.

76
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:35,542
By the way, did you stay out last night?

77
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:38,100
Oh, about that...

78
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,433
Yes.

79
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,142
With Sunbae Eun Hwan?

80
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,242
- Well, yes but— <br> - Are you guys finally dating?

81
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:50,100
It's not like that.

82
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:57,408
Did you already know that I like him?

83
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,167
Anyway, it seems to be going well.

84
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,767
Congrats.

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,725
It looks good on you.

91
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,000
No, never.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,480
Just once.

93
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,450
♫ <i>I found you, you</i> ♫

94
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,950
♫ <i>I found you</i> ♫

95
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,240
It's tasty.

99
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,850
I feel so good.

100
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,500
Me too.

101
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,858
By the way, what is with you today?

102
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,558
What do you mean?

103
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,183
Did you put on perfume?

104
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,958
No, it's hand cream. Want to try it?

105
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,642
Yes.

106
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,433
I'll do it myself.

107
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,058
Sure.

108
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,583
Oh, nice!

109
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,308
What's the brand?

110
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,517
It's not sticky

111
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,625
and smells so good.

112
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,667
Maybe I'll get one, too.

113
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,083
Let's go.

114
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,683
Okay.

115
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,642
What's up with you, all of a sudden?

116
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,792
No, what's up with you?

117
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,583
There's no word from you all day.

118
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,167
And why didn't you come to class?

119
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:55,233
Just because. I felt tired.

120
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,433
Are you sick?

121
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,708
Did you come because you were worried?

122
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,333
No, it's not that.

123
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,958
Then, is it about Unnie Hae Rin?

124
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,142
Seems like she's doing well with Sunbae Eun Hwan.

125
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,517
You knew it already.

126
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,292
So what now?

127
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:23,667
What are you going to do?

128
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:26,667
- Don't say you still— <br> - Nothing will change.

129
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:31,058
Even so, my feelings won't change.

130
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,958
That means,

131
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,417
there's no room for me with you till the end.

132
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:41,017
What?

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,975
- What did you mean by— <br> - I like you.

134
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,958
From the first time I saw you,

135
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,975
up until now.

136
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,000
Go inside, it's late.

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,667
I just realized that anything can happen in this world.

138
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,708
You walked me all the way home.

139
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,583
Back in high school, when practices ran late,

140
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,542
I always did this.

141
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:20,667
Go in.

142
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,975
I need to head to work tomorrow morning, too.

143
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,125
All right.

144
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,725
I'm off.

145
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,475
Hey, Eun Hwan!

146
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,392
Just be careful on your way back home.

147
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,592
<i>(A photo has been sent)</i>

148
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:19,167
I received a confession and went on a date,

149
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,100
but why does it feel like nothing has changed?

150
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,792
Min Joo! You're home.

151
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:31,517
I'm heading to bed early today.

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,850
<i>(To Cha Eun Hwan: Why haven't you asked me to be your girlfriend?)</i>

153
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,808
<i>(By the way, what are we now?)</i>

154
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,725
Noona.

155
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,292
Did you have a class to attend?

156
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,167
I called you out so suddenly.

157
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:20,042
It's okay. I've got a long gap between classes.

158
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,683
That's a relief.

159
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,000
Actually, it's not about anything else,

160
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,917
but I was just wondering if something's up with Min Joo.

161
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:30,917
She seemed not okay when she came home yesterday,

162
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,667
and didn't even leave her room today.

163
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,933
Do you know why she's like that?

164
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,667
This is really...

165
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,083
I'm asking just in case...

166
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,417
You told me that you have someone you like.

167
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:50,100
Does it have something to do with this?

168
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,875
If not, then never mind.

169
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,250
I just thought there might be something between you and Min Joo.

170
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,808
I'm being too nosy, right?

171
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,558
Yes, it has something to do with that.

172
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,225
I...

173
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,933
like you, Noona.

174
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,667
I like you, Noona.

175
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,308
I've liked you for a really long time.

176
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,417
Woo Jin...

177
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,333
I-I mean...

178
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,475
This is so sudden, so...

179
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,417
Woo Jin, actually I—

180
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,183
Later.

181
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,250
I didn't say this to get an answer right away.

182
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,517
So please answer me later.

183
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:54,333
Whenever that is,

184
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,267
