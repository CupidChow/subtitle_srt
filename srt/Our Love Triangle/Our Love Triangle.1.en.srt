5
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,416
Thank you very much.
Please enjoy the show.

6
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,875
Thank you! Please enjoy the show.

7
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,466
Thank you very much. Please enjoy...

8
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:56,333
What was that?

9
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,508
Was that guy...?

10
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,666
No way.

11
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,633
Thank you! Please enjoy the show.

12
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:21,708
- Noona.
- Yes?

13
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,083
We need to go now.

14
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,133
Alright, I'm coming.

15
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,466
Are you okay?

16
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,666
I'm a little nervous for no reason now.

17
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,791
I can make it... right?

18
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,291
Of course you can.

19
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,166
You've been so dedicated throughout the whole vacation.

20
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,166
And...

21
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,333
I'll be right there with you.

22
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,466
So don't be nervous.

23
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,508
So...

24
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,583
What I was trying to say is...

25
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,583
I've had a thing for you...

26
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,675
Like, for a really long time.

27
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:03,666
I've been thinking about this for a long time,

28
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,166
and realized that we can't just stay friends anymore.

29
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,041
So...

30
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,416
whatever it takes,

31
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:12,208
let's make it official now.

32
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,758
What?

33
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,425

34
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,216
Alright, let's toast!

35
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,583
We totally rocked our show today.

36
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,666
So, no one's bailing tonight.

37
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,833
Especially you three.

38
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,916
Don't even think about sneaking off this time.

39
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,958
We never did.

40
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,666
But we've all got classes tomorrow morning.

41
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,708
Hey.

42
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,041
Forget about classes right now.

43
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,791
Think about all the things we've had
with the show all summer.

44
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,333
Yeah, and we didn't even have
one team dinner during the vacation

45
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,333
because you guys were too busy prepping for the audition.

46
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,166
So let's live it up tonight.

47
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,541
Right, the audition. When do you find out the results?

48
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,291
They said they'll get back to us sometime this month,

49
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,791
but no clue on the exact date.

50
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,041
So, anyway,

51
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,591
I really hope all your hard work pays off.

52
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,542
By the way,

53
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:26,625
Woo Jin, your acting skills have seriously leveled up!

54
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,125
Nah, it just looked that way

55
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,075
because Hae Rin totally nailed it today,
and I was just there beside her.

56
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,708
Why are you so humble all of a sudden?

57
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,550
You were like, "You can totally rely on me today."

58
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,583
Gosh.

59
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,208
Did you really say that?

60
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,666
I thought she seemed super nervous at the time...

61
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,666
Are you really sure about that?

62
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,091
Or was it, like, low-key flirting?

63
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,041
No way! Flirting? It's not like that at all.

64
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,583
I'm pretty sure it is.
Look at him. He's being all weird.

65
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,583
How did we get sidetracked here?

66
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,083
I was just trying to make fun of him.

67
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,166
Maybe I shouldn't have done it.

68
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,416
But hey, look.

69
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,958
Hae Rin, don't you feel

70
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,716
Woo Jin's always extra nice, especially to you?

71
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,083
So, spill it Woo Jin.

72
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,466
You sure you're not into her?

73
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,416
Hey, come on! The clock's ticking.

74
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,291
Why don't we start drinking?
Let's toast together.

75
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,719
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

76
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,541

77
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,125
I'm going out now first,

78
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,675
we'll catch up there.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,958
Hey, did you guys hear that Cha Eun Hwan
got discharged from the military??

80
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,458
I saw the news today.

81
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,083
Already?

82
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,458
Well, he joined a while back.

83
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,758
So, it's about time, right?

84
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,833
Now he's definitely an actor with a big-time agency.

85
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,708
His agency's already putting out articles about his discharge.

86
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:11,508
True. I heard he's already picking his next project.

87
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:15,467
It really was Cha Eun Hwan that I saw.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,417
So, he's not coming back to university?

89
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:22,967
Hae Rin, you know anything?

90
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,292
Well I'm clueless too...

91
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,750
He didn't tell you anything?

92
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,583
You've been BFFs since you were kids.

93
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,883
Oh right! You both went to the same high school, right?

94
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,625
I haven't been in touch with him lately either.

95
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,050
He knows what he's doing. So...

96
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,008

You sure you can get home alone?

100
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,875
It's pretty late already.

101
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,375
I'll just grab a taxi.
Of course, I can get home on my own.

102
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,625
So, just don't be late for
practice tomorrow, okay? I'm out!

103
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,300
Hey Hae Rin.

104
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,675
You can, sleep here...

105
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,459
I mean...

106
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:20,833
I can sleep in the living room, so...

107
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,550
If you want... Then you can stay here...

108
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,875
You sure about that?

109
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:29,383
We're both a bit tipsy. What if something happens?

110
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,508
Never mind, what could possibly happen between us.

111
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,875
What are we?

112
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:43,383
What do you mean? We're friends, obviously.

113
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,383
Are we really...

114
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,883
Just friends...?

115
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,300
You alright?

116
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,758
You don't seem okay.

117
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,675
I'm good.

118
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:10,633
I just couldn't handle the heat in there.

119
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,708
We should hurry.

121
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,925
My bag is still inside.

122
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,375
Of course you've got it already.

123
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,342
Let's go.

124
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:37,000
Spicy hot pot is like the ultimate hangover hero, isn't it?

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,458
You tell me now.

126
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,333
You just booze up for moments like this, don't you?

127
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,583
Hey, didn't you know that?

128
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,125
Do you know how many times
I said no to myself

129
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,500
whenever I wanted this like,
during all the crazy prep for the audition?

130
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,792
Then...

131
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,792
Is it that one?

132
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:54,293
The one that Donghwan said he may participate as a staff?

133
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:56,501
- What was the name of that project again?
- "Destined MELO!"

134
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:58,550
Yeah! That one!

135
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,708
Wait, you guys both tried out for the same role?

136
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,875
Yeah.

137
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,050
So, you're like, competing against each other?

138
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,208
Well, technically speaking, yeah.

139
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,208
But honestly, I'm not keeping my hopes up.

140
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,833
I didn't have enough time to prepare
because we were working on our show too.

141
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,250
Since Min Joo prepared harder than me,
she's more likely to make it!

142
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,375
No way, I'm the one who totally messed up!

143
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,458
I was super nervous.

144
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,925
I didn't even realize what I was saying at the time.

145
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,250
Anyways, "Do your best and leave the rest to God!"

146
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,583
So why don't we...

147
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,333
Drink a toast to ourselves as competitors?

148
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,750
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

149
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,709
Hang on.

150
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:36,875
You're not even competing, why are you joining in?

151
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,000
Hey!

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,133
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

153
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:52,625
- You really...
- I already knew it.

154
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,167
Are you really okay?

155
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,500
Nah... I feel like I'm about to keel over any minute now.

156
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,333
Maybe you should chill out for a bit?

157
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,833
If I mess up this semester again,

158
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,342
my mom's definitely gonna boot me out this time.

159
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,958
Is there some event here today?

160
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,750
That's weird. What's happening over there?

161
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,875
You haven't heard anything?

162
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,375
Aren't you on the student council?

163
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,792
Nope, haven't heard a thing.

164
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,467
Noona!

165
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,375
What's all this fuss about?

166
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,883
I have no idea.

167
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,458
But why do you look so out of it?

168
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,833
She kept drinking last night even after we got back.

169
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,750
She's mega hungover right now.

170
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,292
I see.

171
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:34,917
That explains

172
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,750
why you look especially rough today.

173
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,667
I'm too wiped to even get mad, so zip it, please.

174
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:40,750
Hey Hae Rin.

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,800
You're here.

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,333
Why didn't you give me the heads up?

00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,293
- What do you mean?
- I mean, about Eun Hwan!

178
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:50,708
I heard he applied to come back to university today.

179
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,292
What are you on about?

180
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,292
Who applied for what?

181
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,375
What?

182
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,633
You seriously didn't know about this?

183
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,708
It's been a while.

184
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,000
I've missed you.

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,675
Yoo Hae Rin.

186
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:46,800
So, what are we?

187
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,675
What do you mean? We're friends, obviously.

188
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,967
Are we really...

189
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,633
Just friends?

190
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,467
