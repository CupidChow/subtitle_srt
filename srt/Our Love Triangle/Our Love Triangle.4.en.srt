You even know her schedule?

I do.

7
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,375
Because we're actually

8
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,217

that we're starting a new project together.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,167

I'm the one who's always been there for her, not you.

16
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,750
So don't be sad.

She's just going back to where she belongs.

Well...

19

But I felt that Hae Rin actually really hated that.

20
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:07,125
I think you're the one who's mistaken.

21
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,342

And it's so beautiful, especially today,

184
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,175
that I can't just go to class.

185
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:49,383
I don't want to regret it.

186
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:54,333
I meant the weather.

187
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,667
That's right, the weather.

188
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes the weather is beautiful today.

189
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,375
You thought I was talking about you?

190
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,842
No! I didn't.

191
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,133
You've got something on your face.

192
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:22,258
Were you an athlete by any chance?

193
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,958
Why do you ask?

194
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,250
Well I noticed you have some calluses on your palms.

195
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,875
I've been curious about that.

196
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,383
Ah, you mean these...

197
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,842
- Yes, you're right.
- What sport did you play?

198
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,792
Baseball.

199
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,250
I was a pitcher.

200
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,167
Oh really?

201
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:43,458
When did you quit?

202
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,292
When I was 17.

203
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:47,333
So it's almost 4 years ago.

204
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,050
4 years ago?

205
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,592
Then...

206
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:03,092
Why?

207
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,917
I don't know, it's just kind of interesting.

208
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:09,092
Because I also quit ballet about 4 years ago.

209
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:12,917
It would be fun to go to a baseball game together someday.

210
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,792
I'm totally up for it.

211
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,750
But what are we going to do next?

212
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,833
You even skipped class.
It's too sad to just head home.

213
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,633
Well...

214
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:25,300
Actually, there's something I've been wanting to do with you.

215
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,417
You really wanted to do this?

216
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,375
It's not just 'this'.

217
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,467
I've wanted to do this 'with you'.

218
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,084
Noona.

219
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,717
Yes?

220
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:47,958
What is it?

221
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,792
There was little dirt on your shirt.

222
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:50,833
I see.

223
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,208
I got it off.

224
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,050
Shall we start now?

225
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:17,668
3... 2...

226
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:18,925
1!

227
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,917
You closed your eyes in this one!

228
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:24,292
That's why we should've picked the other one!

229
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,583
But this one is the funniest.

230
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,492
This really cracks me up.

231
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:31,250
Yoo Hae Rin.

232
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,250
- What? What are you doing-
- We are...

233
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,758
On a date now.

234
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,883
