1
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:08,000
I want an answer to my confession.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,042
Right now, please.

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,375
Just as we've been doing,

4
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:16,208
I want to stay by your side.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,842
Would you... let me do that?

00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,542

<i>(Episode 10: Our Love Triangle)</i>

8
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,083
Why are you staring at me like that? It's kind of scary.

9
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,250
I just can't film with you.

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,208
To be precise, I won't do it.

11
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,208
But it seems you don't exactly plan to back off.

12
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,375
So I'll sort things out first.

13
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,533
I called you to tell you that.

14
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:04,833
That's rather hilarious.

15
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,792
What can you actually decide for yourself?

16
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,458
You're an actor since your mom wanted you to act.

17
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,083
She does all the behind-the-scenes work for you.

18
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:14,158
Why do you think you can decide to quit?

19
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,667
Can you do anything on your own?

20
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:18,875
Eun Hwan,

21
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,042
just go along with it.

22
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:23,250
As you always do,

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,000
live like others tell you.

24
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,158
If you're done, I'll go.

25
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:54,167
<i>He is acting in a movie, right?</i>

26
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,958
<i>- I bet his mom set it up for him. <br> - Man, I'm jealous.</i>

27
00:01:56,958 --> 00:02:00,917
<i>If my mom were a CEO and famous actress, even I'd debut easily.</i>

28
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:03,408
<i>That doesn't sound right.</i>

29
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,167
<i>Even if your mom were a CEO and famous actress,</i>

30
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:10,542
<i>- you still wouldn't make it. <br> - What?</i>

31
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:13,142
<i>You know what I mean. Your grades aren't great.</i>

32
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:15,542
<i>You're not good at acting or good-looking.</i>

33
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:18,208
<i>If you were even a bit diligent, I'd shut up.</i>

34
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,792
<i>But no, you're always out drinking.</i>

35
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,292
<i>We're not in the 80s anymore.</i>

36
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:24,792
<i>Do actor parents naturally make you one?</i>

37
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:27,917
<i>Options come to those who are well prepared.</i>

38
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:29,375
<i>Instead of grumbling in envy,</i>

39
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,750
<i>try making efforts, even a fraction of Eun Hwan's.</i>

40
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,833
<i>Who knows?</i>

41
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,417
<i>Maybe in your next life, you'll be born as Eun Hwan's son.</i>

42
00:02:57,292 --> 00:03:00,167
<i>People spread rumors without knowing anything.</i>

43
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,250
<i>So don't let them get to you.</i>

44
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,000
<i>I've been there next to you.</i>

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,208
<i>I saw how hard you worked for success.</i>

46
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,792
<i>Witnesses know the truth.</i>

47
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,080
♫ <i>It became a beautiful memory of mine</i> ♫

48
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,625
You.

49
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,833
Why only now?

50
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:34,033
Someone asked... what I could do on my own,

51
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,125
and if I could do anything myself.

52
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,933
But those words seemed true,

53
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,325
and I wanted to run away again.

54
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,000
But I recall you said,

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,458
"Witnesses know the truth."

56
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,292
"Don't be swayed by people who don't know."

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,842
So I will show myself to them.

58
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,000
But to do that,

59
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,750
I need you.

60
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,833
Actually,

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,292
I wanted to hide since I fear losing you again.

62
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,958
But I choose to be brave

63
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,225
because you believed in me.

64
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,375
So now, I'll believe

65
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,333
that you'll stay by my side.

66
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:34,325
So let's do it together,

67
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:36,083
you and I.

68
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,333
Let's show them.

69
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:42,375
I feel I can do it if you're with me.

70
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,083
From now on,

71
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,833
will you stay beside me?

72
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,875
You are so silly.

73
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,167
Why take so long to say such a simple thing?

74
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:14,083
I was waiting for so long.

75
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,750
You're right.

76
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,375
Why did I delay?

77
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,750
I apologize,

78
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,917
I am late again.

79
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:24,833
Accept my remorse.

80
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,250
You already drank a lot.

81
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,542
Let's head out. I'll take you home.

82
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:44,792
It's okay.

83
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:47,375
I didn't call you to escort me.

84
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:55,042
Ji Woo Jin.

85
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:59,167
I'm giving up on you.

86
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,042
So...

87
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,583
instead of me,

88
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,250
could you apologize to Unnie Hae Rin?

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't really have the right,

90
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,542
nor do I have the guts.

91
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:23,750
Also, please stay by Unnie Hae Rin's side.

92
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,208
Protect Unnie Hae Rin, please.

93
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,917
I can't do that, either.

94
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,625
I was rejected yesterday,

95
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,500
completely.

96
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:53,383
<i>I'm sorry, Woo Jin.</i>

97
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,125
<i>To be honest, after you confessed,</i>

98
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,333
<i>if I said my heart didn't flutter at all, I'd be lying.</i>

99
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,125
<i>But no matter how I think,</i>

100
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,792
<i>I can only see myself with him.</i>

101
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,417
<i>He didn't contact you</i>

102
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:14,083
<i>and leaves you alone even now.</i>

103
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:17,708
<i>I know.</i>

104
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:21,542
<i>Frankly, I'm super angry at him now.</i>

105
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,417
<i>I resent him so much.</i>

106
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:27,500
<i>But still, I like him even more.</i>

107
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,458
<i>So I'll believe in him</i>

108
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,667
<i>and try to wait.</i>

109
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,583
<i>But still, thank you.</i>

110
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,750
<i>Having someone as good as you by my side</i>

111
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,583
<i>helped me be a better person, too.</i>

112
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,167
<i>I'm really grateful.</i>

113
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,042
<i>Thank you</i>

114
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,750
<i>for everything back then</i>

115
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,417
<i>and for now too.</i>

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,917
Maybe...

117
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,375
I already knew this would happen.

118
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,583
I was just too late.

119
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:26,400
So I'm going to give up completely

120
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,167
if that's better for her.

121
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,167
Now that things have turned out this way,

122
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:37,542
how about a toast to the rejected ones?

123
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,917
Are you a psychopath?

124
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:42,583
You reject me then say that?

125
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,208
That guilty feeling...

126
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,083
I've had it, too, so I know.

127
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,417
You need to get over it fast.

128
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:54,125
Only then can you quickly start again.

129
00:08:55,917 --> 00:09:01,067
So you don't end up regretting like I do.

130
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,167
Min Joo's here!

131
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,150
Why did you drink so much?

132
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,542
Unnie Hae Rin's here.

133
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:19,708
Let's head to the room first.

134
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,625
No, let me go.

135
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,375
Unnie.

136
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,708
Don't be so nice to me anymore.

137
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,167
Why do you keep being so nice? Why?

138
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,167
What are you...

139
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,667
How am I...

140
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,583
How am I supposed to deal with all that guilt

141
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:37,667
after all that I did to you?

142
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:41,942
I... did all sorts of terrible things

143
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:45,292
to ruin your life.

144
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,875
Why do you still care about me?

145
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,925
Min Joo, you're not—

146
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:12,917
Have a drink.

147
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,833
It seemed you were throwing up all night.

148
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,708
You'll end up hurting your stomach.

149
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,667
I'm so sorry, Unnie.

150
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,833
I must have lost my mind.

151
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:39,417
I knew I shouldn't,

152
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:42,042
but I just kept hating you.

153
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,458
I knew you did nothing.

154
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,958
I knew it wasn't even your fault.

155
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:52,292
I was just so jealous and envious.

156
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,292
It's all my fault.

157
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,042
I messed everything up.

158
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:05,242
Really... I'm really sorry.

159
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,917
Min Joo.

160
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,708
Can you just give me some time?

161
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,000
I know what it's like to lose something precious.

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,667
I know it so well.

163
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,375
In my head, I totally get it.

164
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,833
But my heart can't forgive you yet.

165
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,042
But no matter how much I think,

166
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,458
I don't want to hate you.

167
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,792
You mean too much to me.

168
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:42,125
I don't want to lose another precious person.

169
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,792
So just give me some time

170
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:47,542
so I can fully forgive you.

171
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay?

172
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:57,050
But still, thank you for being honest and spilling it all.

173
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:03,842
I'm going to shower first.

174
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:19,590
<i>(Entertainment news reporter)</i>

175
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:26,000
We should've reached out to you first.

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,208
It has been hectic these days, so we couldn't contact you.

177
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,792
The agency keeps pressuring us about the actress issue,

178
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,375
the shooting has been delayed,

179
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:36,217
and articles, PR or not, keep popping up.

180
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,708
I'm telling you this so you don't misunderstand.

181
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,500
We never planned to change the actress.

182
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,125
If that were the case, we would've contacted you first.

183
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,458
No, that's not what I meant.

184
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,292
I just felt like I've been a burden on the project.

185
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:55,783
Then just go all out with 120 percent effort.

186
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,375
By the way, after I received Eun Hwan's call yesterday,

187
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:03,067
I got the video ready as soon as I got to work.

188
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:17,333
<i>So you're really leaving like that? <br> (The lead actress of "Destined Melo!" Hae Rin's audition video revealed!)</i>

189
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,000
<i>Just one word would've been enough, but you never said a word.</i>

190
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:24,500
<i>Is "sorry" that hard to say?</i>

191
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:26,583
Hae Rin is quite good at acting, right?

192
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,458
Hey, check this out!

193
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,833
Hae Rin's video is out!

194
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,042
Who, Yoo Hae Rin?

195
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,500
It's an acting video!

196
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,250
She's really good.

197
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,625
<i>(What? She's actually good at acting.)</i>

198
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,667
<i>(Considering it's her first work, she's really good.)</i>

199
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,833
<i>(It doesn't look like she got in just because of connections.)</i>

200
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,250
Wow, she's super pretty, isn't she?

201
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,667
Look at her getting into all the emotions.

202
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,792
<i>(I saw Hae Rin in a Hankuk University theater play. She was really good.)</i>

203
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:52,542
Why is she so good?

204
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:53,500
I'm totally surprised.

205
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,625
I told you. She didn't pass the audition for nothing.

206
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,833
Was that article mistaken?

207
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,042
<i>It's I who must end it...</i>

208
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:08,792
<i>What's all this about?</i>

209
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,875
They canceled the casting?

210
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,250
I told you.

211
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,333
The production company also wants to stick with the original cast.

212
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,333
And now there's no reason to switch.

213
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,708
What's the fuss about an audition video?

214
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,875
Where's the CEO?

215
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:26,125
- I'll go myself— <br> - Seo Ah, we have something to ask before that.

216
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,083
What's all this about?

217
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,625
We haven't been informed about this.

218
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,870
<i>(SNS Star Park Seo Ah involved in covert advertising deals?)</i>

219
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:36,500
Did you handle these ad deals on your own without going through the company?

220
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,958
And what's all this about covert advertising?

221
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,667
Seems it's not just a few instances.

222
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,917
- How did you— <br> - You know this is a breach of contract, right?

223
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,708
So what happens to Park Seo Ah now?

224
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,292
They'll probably terminate her for breaching the contract.

225
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,833
I heard she had other problems too.

226
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,875
With all the covert advertising and forced sponsorships,

227
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,458
I guess she will lay low for a while.

228
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,667
From what I heard from the manager,

229
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,542
it sounds like she might take a break from university as well.

230
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,750
It's a bit unpleasant.

231
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,833
Why now of all times?

232
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,958
It's like someone planned this whole thing.

233
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,483
Good triumphs over evil. Don't you know?

234
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,750
Get home safely.

235
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,958
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.

236
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,125
See you tomorrow then.

237
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,542
Yoo Hae Rin.

238
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,083
I'm off.

239
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,917
What is this?

240
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,125
Yoo Hae Rin.

241
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,500
We're officially dating starting today.

242
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,167
See you.

243
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,875
Love you!

244
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,830
♫ <i>Will it change anything?</i> ♫

245
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:22,060
♫ <i>You said I've lost a lot of weight</i> ♫

246
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,708
It feels like I only ever come here with you.

247
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:32,958
I won't be able to make it here for a while.

248
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,333
I just wanted to have one last meal with you.

249
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,292
I'm going to enlist in the military.

250
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,375
I wanted to finish this semester, but things got moved up.

251
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,375
Why so sudden?

252
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,875
Because I can't stand the thought of you dating another man.

253
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,500
I'm just kidding.

254
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,292
Things just worked out this way.

255
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:00,042
You'll keep in touch, right?

256
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,958
Of course.

257
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,333
But... I haven't given up yet.

258
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,708
Just take care until I get back, okay?

259
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,792
It's getting cold; let's eat.

260
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,175
<i>(A few months later)</i>

261
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,042
Seriously.

262
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:27,958
Why am I doing this on my precious break?

263
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,042
I even rented out this party room.

264
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:32,500
I could've been on a date.

265
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,125
Why are we celebrating his birthday instead?

266
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:41,708
Wow. Now you're blatantly ignoring me?

267
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,792
It's like this now that I'm totally yours.

268
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:50,333
I'll call up my female friends, too,

269
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,708
and hang out without you.

270
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,500
Do you even have female friends?

271
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,458
I was your only ex-female friend.

272
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,500
Darn, you really have the exact reply.

273
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,560
And the one and only current girlfriend too.

final credits

276
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,708
Hey, inviting people over and

277
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,208
being so openly affectionate, isn't that a bit much?

278
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,667
Exactly.

279
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,417
I thought my birthday was the main event here.

280
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,458
Looks like we are just extras here.

281
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,833
You two have your last shoot next week, right?

282
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,250
- Yes. <br> - It's almost done now.

283
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,583
I know, right?

284
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,725
It's been a month since we moved out.

285
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:42,667
Time really flies.

286
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:46,250
Min Joo, your final performance is coming up, right?

287
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,583
I'll definitely come see it.

288
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,458
It won't be that easy, I think.

289
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,042
Thanks to your heavy promotion,

290
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,000
every show's been selling out.

291
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,875
- Really? <br> - Wow, Son Min Joo!

292
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,167
I didn't set aside any spare tickets.

293
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,250
I also wanted to see it while I'm on leave.

294
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,875
It seems I'll miss it, too.

295
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,500
You're thinking about catching a musical.

296
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,542
Guess you're on extended leave?

297
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,958
The military's sure gotten easy.

298
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,375
Back in my day,

299
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,875
you'd get one day out and that was it.

300
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,208
Yes, I totally hear you, Sir.

301
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,083
Oh? How dare you speak that way

302
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,958
to the great reserve soldier.

303
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,500
All right, everyone, that's enough.

304
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,542
Let's take a photo before we get drunk.

00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,420
