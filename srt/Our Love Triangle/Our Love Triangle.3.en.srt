Do you remember...

2
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,725
What happened between us on that day.

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,250
Alright, just forget about it.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,391
I'm outta here. Take care.

7
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,167
I was so stupid.

8
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,642
Why on earth did I bring up that story.

9
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:59,267
How am I gonna face him now.

10
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,850
So so stupid.

11
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,975
I want to do a musical for my next assignment.

12
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:11,308
Noona! Min Joo!

13
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:16,875
What's the rush?

14
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,750
You okay? Or anything happened?

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,958
No, no, I just...

16
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:24,333
- Did you know they already emailed the audition results?
- When?

17
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,375
I heard they sent out the results by email this morning.

18
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,558
Haven't you checked yet?

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,417
I've got nothing here yet.

20
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:36,058
You sure they emailed the results?

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,042
Oh my.

22
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:40,750
Guys...

23
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,042
I...

24
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,458
Made it!

25
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:44,500
Really?

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,933
Let me check!

27
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,333
You really made it!

28
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,875
Congrats, Noona!

29
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,679
Congratulations, Unni.

30
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,250
I'm alright.

31
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,125
At least you made it, so I'm happy for you.

32
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,500
So, why don't we

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,058

It's on me tonight.

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,625

I'm gonna order everything there.

Don't even think about getting hammered again, Min Joo.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,833
Congrats, Hae Rin.

41
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,833
I heard you passed the audition.

42
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,833
My assistant just told me about it.

43
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,708
Where's the applause?

44
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,475
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

45
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,458
By the way,

46
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,392
are there students who haven't got their timetables?

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,792
Seems like Cha Eun Hwan is

48
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,808
still not here.

49
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,433
Park Seo Ah?

50
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:51,100
She doesn't seem to be here either.

51
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,458
Good afternoon, professor.

52
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,208
Sorry I'm late.

53
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,208
And your name?

54
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,708
I'm Park Seo Ah.

55
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,643
I just got back to university today.

56
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,625
That was close. You're still not late.

57
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,475
Have a seat over there.

58
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,417
Everyone, quiet down please.

00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,392
Let's do the roll call now.

60
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,917
I'm so jealous.

61
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:32,250
Can we follow each other?

62
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,037
Can I follow you on instagram?

63
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,833
Hae Rin?

64
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,625
You're Hae Rin right?

65
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,000
What? We're in the same class?

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,250
Why didn't you even say hi to me.

67
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,708
It's really been a while.

68
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,167
Right.

69
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:49,625
You're coming back to university?

70
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,417
Well, yes.

71
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:53,333
I was also thinking about texting you.

72
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,933
There's Hae Rin.

73
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,292
- Oh?
- How have you been?

74
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:59,542
She is... She is...

75
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:02,250
Hey, why is she here?

76
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,205
Who is she?

77
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:06,333
She is the Instagram influencer, Seo Ah Park!

78
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,958
Unni!

79
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:08,875
This is crazy.

80
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,083
Nice to meet you.

81
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,125
I'm a huge fan of yours.

82
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:16,625
I even bought that moisturizer you posted about recently.

83
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,708
Really?

84
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,333
She's your friend?

85
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,250
Yes, they're both my best Hoobaes.

86
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,917
So, they're freshmen?

87
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:26,517
Nice to meet you all.

88
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,625
Are you...

89
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,000
friends?

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,558
That's so awesome.

91
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,250
Sorry Seo Ah, but we actually have plans today.

92
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,667
So we need to go now.

93
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:39,792
Oh really?

94
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:41,250
Then that's even better.

95
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,292
We need to get to know each other. Mind if I join?

96
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,500
No, of course not.

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,183
It's okay, right?

98
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,725
I'm a huge fan of hers.

99
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,667
But you should have told me something anyways.

100
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:10,917
Do you even know

101
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:13,558
how I felt when you just left me like that?

102
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,375
Sorry!

103
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,417
I haven't had time to post much these days.

104
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:04,475
It's all good, take your time.

Midnight munchies strike again!
Still hopelessly addicted to midnight snacks!

106
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,142
Done! Let's eat now!

107
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:33,292
So you guys have been friends since high school?

108
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,542
From the same high school?

109
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:35,583
Right.

110
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,792
Eun Hwan and I majored in acting.

111
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:38,208
Hae Rin majored in ballet.

112
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,125
Later she switched to acting too,

113
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,042
and we got into the same university together.

114
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,000
Which means we've known each other for a long time.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,500
Recently we haven't got much chances
to get together though.

116
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,250
I see.

117
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,000
I heard about it too

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,042
that you used to major in ballet.

119
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:54,517
But why did you decide to quit?

120
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,708
Well... That's because...

121
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,917
What?

122
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,225
They don't know anything about it?

123
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,292
Actually, she got injured and...

124
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:06,142
Sunbae!

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,333
You're here.

126
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,708
I asked him to come by.

127
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,642
It's okay, right?

128
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,250
You guys used to date?

129
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,542
Right.

130
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:32,708
Since we were in high school till we got into the university.

131
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,292
Then how are you two... like this now...

132
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:37,500
We were kinda young back then,

133
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,708
and broke up because things got hectic.

134
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,375
I've always wanted to apologize to him for that.

135
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:47,208
Because, he really tried to get back with me.

136
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,500
Did I?

137
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,042
Now you're messing with memories?

138
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,417
What? Are you pretending to forget?

139
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,725
Why? Embarrassed?

140
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:58,792
Or do you...

141
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,392
still have a thing for me?

142
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,267
Thanks.

143
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,167
You said you'd come next week.

144
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,042
My schedule changed a bit.

145
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:28,167
And I wanted to say hi to everyone.

146
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:31,125
Then I just happened to run into Hae Rin today.

147
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,058
It's like, there's always an invisible connection between me and her.

148
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,583
Yes.

149
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,333
Whatever it is,

150
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,183
there's something between me and her.

151
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,350
I need to get some fresh air.

152
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,392
I like him.

153
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,208
You know, I have a thing for--

154
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,583
Of course I know.

155
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,708
Of course I know you like Eun Hwan.

156
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,167
But what if

157
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,333
I like him too?

158
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,167
And to be honest,

159
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,892
you just have a crush on him, that's all.

160
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,542
So I'm telling you now

161
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:29,417
that I want to get serious with him too.

162
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:30,625
So I...

163
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,475
Don't really have feel uncomfortable, right?

164
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,225
What are you doing out here by yourself?

165
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,433
Isn't it too hot here?

166
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,558
It's even stuffier in there.

167
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,167
You're so carefree.

168
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,917
Anyway, she's your ex-girlfriend.

169
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:02,083
Aren't you uncomfortable at all?

170
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,308
It looks like you still have feelings for her.

171
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,475
What about you then?

172
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,475
- What do you mean?
- Are you still uncomfortable around me?

173
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:17,017
Well...

174
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,642
Is it...

175
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,975
- because of what happened on that night..?
- No!

176
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,375
Th-that was a mistake. We were both too drunk...

177
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,833
I know.

178
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,850
It has nothing to do with that.

179
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,308
I was just on the edge yesterday, sorry about that.

180
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,017
I already knew you would say that.

181
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,875
Anyways...

182
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,517
It's good to hear

183
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,558
you say so.

184
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,975
I heard

185
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,558
you passed the audition.

186
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,292
You didn't even come to class, how did you know?

187
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,792
You must be happy about it.

188
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:13,667
Of course I'm happy about it.

189
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:16,500
You would be even happier later.

190
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,100
What do you mean?

191
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,475
You'll see.

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,417
What are you still chatting about here?

193
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,042
I'm jealous of you now.

194
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,125
Why are you all coming out together?

195
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,625
It's pretty late already, we should head home.

196
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,433
We've paid the bill.

197
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,292
Why did she get so drunk.

198
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:38,083
I can take her home.

199
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,292
And you guys?

200
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:42,125
We live nearby, so we can walk home.

201
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,625
Alright then, see ya.

202
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,017
Aren't we going barhopping?

203
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,458
Let's head home now.

204
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,183
Yeah, let's go.

205
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,250
Finally back home.

206
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,417
I need to wake up early tomorrow.

207
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,183
That's a problem.

208
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,208
A surprise gift for passing the audition.

209
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,667
What is this, so sudden.

210
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,183
I look forward to working with you, Hae Rin.
