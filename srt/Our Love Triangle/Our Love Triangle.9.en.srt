00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,083

5
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,416

<i>(An insider says Park Seo Ah might be female lead.)</i>

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,850
<i>(Park Seo Ah seems more suited for the role.)</i>

10
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:23,959
It's insane.

11
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:26,333
Did Cha Eun Hwan pull strings to get his girl a role?

12
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,916
It seems Yoo Hae Rin had connections.

13
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,666
I knew it.

14
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,600
Now it all makes sense.

You got here so quickly.

23
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,652
Did you sprint over or something?

24
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:13,667
It's you, right?

25
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,250
Did you report that I got the audition unfairly?

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,500
Why would you think that?

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,458
Who else would go so far as to take photos of me?

28
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,333
Who else but you?

29
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,641
You always try to steal everything I have.

30
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,000
Are you still voicing what happened in high school?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,083
That I took Cha Eun Hwan from you?

32
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,500
Hae Rin.

33
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,041
Do you still think that

34
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:37,375
it all went down only because I'm a mean girl?

35
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,541
You remain so naïve.

36
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,350
That's why you get back-stabbed.

37
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,208
- What did you just— <br> - Cha Eun Hwan knew it all back then.

38
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,183
He knew you liked him.

39
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,708
I didn't take Cha Eun Hwan from you.

40
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,625
He chose me,

41
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,558
cowardly.

42
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,900
So what about it?

43
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,050
It seems you already know why he acted like that,

44
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,891
but that's not the case anymore. So stop pointless tricks—

45
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:08,525
Do you really believe that?

46
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:10,933
Do you think this time will be different?

47
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,666
Doesn't seem that way to me.

48
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,541
There's already a rebuttal article published.

49
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,875
What?

50
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,666
Cha Eun Hwan is still cowardly,

51
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,891
and you'll be abandoned again.

52
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,250

Nothing has really changed, has it?

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,391
Seriously, what's your deal with me?

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Since you did the same to me,

56
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,608
whether you meant it or not.

57
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:42,141
You always took what should have been mine.

58
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,333
If you're done, can I go?

59
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,016
I have another appointment.

62
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:05,084

What do you mean by what will happen?

79
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,761
It's already over before she can try.

80
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,083
But hey, you took really good photos.

81
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,583
You made it seem this is really going on.

82
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,958
You have some real talent.

83
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,833
There's a rebuttal article published.

84
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,541
Then doesn't that mean it's all already erased?

85

You know, I know,

86
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:51,416
and university students already know it.

87
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,600
Who would believe he didn't get her the role?

88
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:59,850
It's still valid, right?

89
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,516
Our deal, the second lead.

90
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,291
Of course.

91
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,083
Thanks to you, I might get the lead role for free.

92
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,625
Of course, I should at least give you what I had.

93
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,391

98
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:33,833
That doesn't matter.

99
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,500
Since things cooled off, it's all we need.

100
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,875
I was swamped cleaning this whole mess, you know.

101

If you have something to say, let's talk later.

102

But you should have asked me first!

103
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,266
- Making such announcements without checking— <br> - Then

104
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,541
you wanted me to just watch you

105
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,958
ruin your career for some unknown girl?

106
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:56,083
Or embarrass me for making you famous? Is that what you wanted?

107
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,708
You barely made a comeback!

108
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,566
Now you're messing around with that trainee—

109
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:02,841
Making my... comeback?

110
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:08,500
I thought I got the audition on my own and returned that way.

111
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,466
I joined the company after filming my first work.

112
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,616
But did you really... have a hand in that?

113
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,333
Yes, right.

114
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,375
Yes, it's even better.

115
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,708
You.

116
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:31,116
If you don't want her to be tagged as the actress made by you,

117
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:33,208
you'd better end it now.

118
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,808
The switch in the female lead is already a done deal.

132
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:41,458

Don't tell me...

139

What are you saying?

144
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:13,825
<i>Just the other day, the director asked me if I knew you.</i>

145
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:17,308
<i>He said Yoo Hae Rin recommended you for auditions.</i>

146
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:21,042
<i> She said you're a hard-working actress,</i>

147

<i>who deserves another chance.</i>

148
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:28,667

Look, your ankle...

155
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,250
Was it really you?

156
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,433

<i>I was benched due to an injury,</i>

160

<i>and I wondered if I should just give it all up.</i>

161
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:06,792

162

168
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,208

<i>Why aren't you doing rehab?</i>

171
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,125
<i>What's the point of rehab without a guarantee it'll get better?</i>

172
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,667
<i>It's worse than I thought.</i>

173
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:24,100
<i>The doctor said the impact on my ankle was lethal.</i>

174
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,808
<i>Feels like a sign from above to quit ballet.</i>

175
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,100

176
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:38,017

00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,292
I get it more than anyone, what it feels like

179
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:52,567
to surrender a dream against your will.

180
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:56,458
Then I quit baseball.

181
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,450
I happened to come to Hankuk University, where I saw you by chance.

182
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,975
Relieved to see you walking well,

183
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,975
I was happy to see you smile.

184
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,475
Then somehow,

185
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:14,267
I wanted to keep seeing you that way.

186
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,267
I was still living kind of pathetically,

187
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,850
but it seemed you weren't.

188
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,708
That's why I'm here.

189
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:30,300
I thought being around you might help me change, too.

190
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,083
At first, I wanted to tell you right away.

191
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,642
But...

192
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:37,225
as time went on, I just couldn't find the words.

193
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,642
I was afraid that...

194
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,225
bringing up the accident would hurt you more.

195
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:54,750
Why would you think that way?

196
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:00,892
That day, you saved my life.

197
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:10,008
I wouldn't have kept up with ballet anyway.

198
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,500
I was in such a slump.

199
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,475
That's why I didn't pay attention to traffic.

200
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,333
I gave up on my own.

201
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,475
It wasn't because of the accident.

202
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,833
Thank you

203
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,975
for saving me on that day.

204
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,208
You...

205
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,583
Are you crying now?

206
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,167
I worried you'd feel uncomfortable around me.

207
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:50,417
I was tense about that.

208
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,750
Hey, why feel bad?

209
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,225
I'm so happy right now.

210
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:01,167
Do you know how long I looked for you?

211
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,250
But I didn't even know your name or face.

212
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,583
How could I find you?

213
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,225
I never thought you'd be hiding here.

214
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,250
I know it's really soon,

215
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,808
and I know you're having a tough time now.

216
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,350
But can I be selfish just this once?

217
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,933
I want an answer to my confession.

218
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,767
Right now, please.

219
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,000
Just as we've been doing,

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,808
I want to stay by your side.

221
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,475
Would you... let me do that?

222
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,640
♫ <i>I will stay, I will stay</i> ♫

223
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,210
