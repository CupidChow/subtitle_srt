1
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,359
Sweetie, carrying so much stuff?

2
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,239
Come on, put it in my car.

3
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,879
It's fine, Grandpa Tong, don't worry about it.

4
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,799
You just go ahead.

5
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,879
Just act like you're out for a stroll.

6
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,079
Just ignore that we're here.

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,439
Your mouth is so sweet.

8
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,200
You'll definitely find a good husband someday.

9
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,159
Let me help you.

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,400
It's fine, you can't carry it all alone.

11
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,879
Give it to me.

12
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,560
Not even looking at me, scared of me?

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Why would I be scared of you?

14
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,680
You have a crush on me?

15
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,759
Don't talk nonsense.

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,879
Keep your voice down.

17
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Uncle Tong is up ahead.

18
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,680
Alright, I can stop talking nonsense.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,039
But you have to help me with something.

20
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,280
With what?

21
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,879
My photography exhibition.

22
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,960
Needs a lot of old items collected.

23
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,360
Looking around...

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,319
You're the idlest one in the whole alley.

25
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,599
So I have to entrust this glorious task to you.

26
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,360
No way.

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,240
Grandpa Tong!

28
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,000
Actually, Uncle Ma and I before...

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,680
Don't shout! Don't shout! Don't shout!

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,639
What? You scared me.

31
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,879
It's nothing, Uncle Tong.

32
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,639
Don't you shout.

33
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,240
I'm warning you.

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,439
Don't talk nonsense.

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Fine, I'll help you.

36
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,439
Alright.

37
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,680
Okay, hurry up, hurry up!

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,120
We're still waiting to cook, hurry up!

39
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,759
Okay, okay!

40
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,639
Don't mess around.

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,439
Hello?

42
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,439
Dad?

43
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,039
Yuanyuan!

44
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,759
Dad.

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,199
Next Monday is our Family Sports Day.

46
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,319
Don't worry.

47
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,479
Dad remembers.

48
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,639
No, Dad.

49
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,879
What I wanted to say is...

50
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,919
Could you help...

51
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,479
...tell Auntie Qianqian?

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,199
To ask her to come too.

53
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,800
Then why didn't Xuanxuan say anything?

54
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Xuanxuan really wants to go.

55
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,879
But he's afraid Auntie Qianqian is too busy.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,879
So he's been refusing to say anything.

57
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,560
Dad, can you help Xuanxuan?

58
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,840
No problem.

59
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,439
Dad will help Xuanxuan, okay?

60
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,400
Thanks, Dad.

61
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,920
Weiguo.

62
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,079
If you really want to grow your business...

63
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,240
...consider joining forces with me.

64
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,000
Right now...

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,720
...given your relationship with Li Lianbao and the others...

66
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,759
...investing in Peng Le Xuan...

67
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,879
...might just end in a total mess.

68
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,920
So you should consider my suggestion.

69
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,000
Hello? What now?

70
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,120
About that school Family Sports Day...

71
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,079
Do you know about it?

72
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,879
What Family Sports Day?

73
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,120
What? Xuanxuan really didn't tell you?

74
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,199
I'm telling you, the way you mother...

75
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,519
No matter how busy you are...

76
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,879
...you can't neglect spending time with your child.

77
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,639
Are you crazy, Li Lianbao?

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,759
Is it because Peng Le Xuan hasn't opened yet...

79
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,879
...that you have nothing better to do?

80
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,759
Think about it.

81
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,639
When the school holds the Family Sports Day...

82
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,360
...all the other kids' parents are there.

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,000
Only Xuanxuan doesn't.

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,519
What do you think goes through the child's mind?

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,759
I think it's because Weiguo is around...

86
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,519
...there's no place for you at Peng Le Xuan.

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,279
How about this instead...

88
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,639
...just transfer your shares to me.

89
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,160
Don't you worry about it.

90
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,399
If you have time...

91
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,519
...spend more time with Xuanxuan.

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,399
Don't be busy with your work and career all day.

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,639
When Xuanxuan grows up, you'll realize...

94
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,120
...you missed all the wonderful childhood moments with him.

95
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,839
You'll regret it.

96
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,240
Still thinking about Peng Le Xuan?

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,560
Not a chance.

98
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,480
What, tired of writing?

99
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,519
Xuanxuan.

100
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,399
Your school next week...

101
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,920
...has a Family Sports Day, right?

102
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,040
Then why didn't you tell Mom?

103
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,639
Because every time I wanted to say it...

104
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,759
...you happened to be busy.

105
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,759
Mom was neglectful.

107
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,040
If Mom is busy...

108
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,279
...you can call me.

109
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,240
Or send a voice message, anything.

110
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,160
As long as it's about you...

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,199
...Mom will make it a priority, okay?

112
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,399
So can you come to the Family Sports Day?

113
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,279
I'll try my best to adjust my schedule.

114
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,879
Washing the car again?

115
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,800
You're going to rub the paint off.

116
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,240
Stop talking nonsense.

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,279
We're picking up Feifei tomorrow.

118
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,399
Should've gone to get him long ago.

119
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,759
All these days...

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,279
...he must have suffered a lot.

121
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,680
Don't know if he could handle it or not.

122
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,680
But I'm really looking forward to seeing him now.

123
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,639
Seriously, you, as his uncle...

124
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,759
...how can you be so heartless?

125
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,519
The kid's weird too.

126
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,160
Insists on listening to you.

127
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,560
Isn't that asking for trouble?

128
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,920
Let me tell you.

129
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Feifei, this kid, he's perceptive.

130
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,279
He believes I have his best interests at heart.

131
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,040
No, the way you show you care...

132
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,399
...is just torture.

133
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,920
Besides, haven't you thought...

134
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,519
...about whether others accept it or not?

135
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,040
Acceptance isn't important.

136
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,399
What's important is the result.

137
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,279
I believe Feifei will definitely grow from this.

138
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,519
You just need to play your role well.

139
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,519
You'll definitely get the answer you want.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,959
What role are you asking me to play?

141
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,160
Do you remember what I told you in the car?

142
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,040
I want you to be his role model.

143
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,319
Alright.

144
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,279
The kid's difficulty is getting into college.

145
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,559
My difficulty is roasting ducks.

146
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,679
Then let's overcome all difficulties.

147
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,039
Let's take the "exam" together.

148
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,080
Fine, see you tomorrow morning.

149
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,000
Your Feifei...

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,120
...is really just too smart.

151
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,639
As soon as he arrived, he talked about...

152
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,519
...some "resource integration."

153
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,159
Look, he took all the vegetables in the village...

154
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,399
...and the chickens and whatnot...

155
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,759
...and brought them all here.

156
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,519
He even put on some kind of makeup...

157
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,639
...looking like a young lady.

158
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,159
That day, he went around the town all day...

159
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,879
...leading a few young guys.

160
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,159
Look, he set up his phone like this...

161
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,519
...and livestreamed to sell goods online.

162
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,039
Selling our agricultural products.

163
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,519
They sold so well!

164
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,000
Look at all these uncles and aunties...

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,279
...fighting to buy them.

166
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,759
Don't let him leave, okay?

167
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,759
Keep him here...

168
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,639
...to lead us to prosperity.

169
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,279
Friends from the south in the livestream...

170
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,039
...you can buy some to taste.

171
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,639
Our northern muskmelons...

172
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,480
...definitely have a unique flavor.

173
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,159
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

174
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:09,639
Uncle.

175
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,080
This time you've made me completely understand...

176
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,320
...that going to college is truly useless.

177
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,559
Now, not only can I make money myself...

178
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,080
...but I can also help others make money.

179
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
That's so hard to do!

180
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,559
If I start making money livestreaming now...

181
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,799
...I'll make four years' more money than others.

182
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Was this all your idea?

183
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,799
I...

184
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:34,559
You know what? If I had a Gatling gun right now...

185
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,919
...I'd shoot you full of holes.

186
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,840
Dad.

187
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,080
Yuanyuan.

188
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,080
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

189
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,600
Why hasn't Xuanxuan arrived yet?

190
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,960
Will Auntie Qianqian come?

191
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,840
Let's wait a bit longer.

192
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
They will definitely come.

193
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,320
Tom.

194
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,080
Seems you and Jenny are getting closer.

195
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
Of course.

196
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,320
This is my daughter.

197
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,200
Yuanyuan.

198
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,080
What event are you planning to enter?

199
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,480
It's the Three-Legged Race Relay with two families per team.

200
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,840
But only one parent can participate.

201
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,519
Alright.

202
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,120
We'll definitely get a good score.

203
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,919
Come on, let's go find a place to sit over there.

204
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,200
Let's go, let's go together.

205
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,600
One, two, three.

206
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,440
Awesome!

207
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,639
One, two, three.

208
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,480
Yuanyuan! Yuanyuan!

209
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,080
Xuanxuan!

210
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,720
Xuanxuan is here.

211
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,360
Go ahead.

212
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,960
Xuanxuan, you play with Yuanyuan.

213
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,480
Okay.

214
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,720
See, that's the way.

215
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,440
It's never wrong to spend more time on your child.

216
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,960
Xuanxuan.

217
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,360
Mom is going to sit over there.

218
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,840
Look, if you step into this pit...

219
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,200
...it becomes a hole.

220
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,360
This side is the river.

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,799
Check-in is starting! Check-in!

222
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,039
Kevin, hurry and take Jenny to check in.

223
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,360
Tom.

224
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,200
You should race with Jenny this time.

225
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,200
For today...

226
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,080
...Jenny has been practicing for a long, long time.

227
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,840
It's a rare chance to be with her.

228
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,600
You go.

229
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,000
No, Kevin.

230
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,080
You've practiced with Jenny for so long.

231
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,480
You two have coordination.

232
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,480
Well, no one else has practiced with Jenny either.

233
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Don't hold our Jenny back when the time comes.

234
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
What are you saying?

235
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,200
Who's holding anyone back?

236
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,960
Do I need to practice with my own daughter?

237
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,399
We have natural chemistry.

238
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Come on.

239
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,759
You've never been reliable.

240
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,320
No, I believe in Tom.

241
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Even though he's usually joking around...

242
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,200
...I know him very well.

243
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,840
Once he sets his mind on something...

244
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,960
...he gives it his all.

245
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,720
We are the same kind of people.

246
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,960
Did you hear that?

247
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,360
Look how clearly Laokai put it.

248
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,480
Learn from him.

249
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,840
Yuanyuan, let's go.

250
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
Let's go check in.

251
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,799
I don't get it.

252
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,200
You men are baffling.

253
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,519
Two, one, two.

254
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,279
Okay.

255
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,639
We'll do it just like this later.

256
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,159
Let's do some warm-up exercises first.

257
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:20,679
Okay.

258
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,519
Come on, ready, together.

259
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,000
One two, one two, one two.

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes, just like that.

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,039
You must listen to the command.

262
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,279
Next, let's do front leg stretches.

264
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:30,840
Alright.

265
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,679
Twice for each leg.

266
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,039
Okay.

267
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,480
Switch legs.

268
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,039
Switch legs.

269
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,759
Quick, rotate your wrists.

270
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Rotate your ankles.

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,039
Don't want to sprain anything later.

272
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,600
Then rotate your knees.

273
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,159
Dad, are you okay?

274
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,480
I'm fine, I'm fine.

275
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,399
Two, two, three, lift your arms.

276
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,200
Come on, the race is about to start.

277
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,360
The race is starting.

278
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,559
Attention, parents.

279
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,279
This round tests your ability to work together.

280
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,240
Two families per team.

281
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,679
One family runs the first fifty meters.

282
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,840
The other family runs the relay for the next fifty.

283
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,399
Good luck, everyone.

284
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,600
Go for it, students!

285
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,240
Go!

286
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Ready...

287
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,399
Ready

288
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,679
Three

289
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:38,919
Two

290
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,720
One

291
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,919
Go

292
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:52,679
Go, go, go! One, two, one, two!

293
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,720
Go, Xuanxuan!

294
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,919
One, two, one, two

295
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,960
Go, go, go!

296
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,679
Xuanxuan

297
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,159
Go!

298
00:14:59,159 --> 00:14:59,799
Xuanxuan

299
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,759
Go, go!

300
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,399
One, two, one, two

301
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:12,759
Go, go, go!

302
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Go, Jenny!

303
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,440
Jenny

304
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,480
Jenny, go!

305
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,120
Go, go, go!

306
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,720
Go, go!

307
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,799
Jenny, Jenny, go!

308
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:27,799
Go!

309
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,080
Go, go, go!

310
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,519
Go!

311
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:38,039
Go, go, go!

312
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,240
Entrepreneurs over thirty years old

313
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,639
I won't invest in.

314
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,320
Sorry, I can't make it tonight.

315
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,679
We have another round of meetings tonight.

316
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,919
Honey, where are we eating tonight?

317
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,240
I've got something to do, gotta go.

318
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,799
Can't you really see it?

319
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,200
Are they coming for you?

320
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,440
Lianbao

321
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,919
You're so unreliable.

322
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,559
You used my name to raise funds.

323
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,159
Used Big Bro's name to open a shop.

324
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,320
Is that what you mean?

325
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,240
Dad, are you okay?

326
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,159
Go, go, go!

327
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:55,559
Go, go, go!

328
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,799
Go, go, go!

329
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,839
Jenny, Jenny

330
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,759
Go, go!

331
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,960
Go, go!

332
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,880
Awesome!

333
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,799
Jenny

334
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,440
You have gout and still competed?

335
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,880
Was it worth pushing so hard?

336
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,440
As long as Yuanyuan is happy,

337
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't care about myself.

338
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,319
But,

339
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,200
I knew you'd come today.

340
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,559
You talk like you know me so well.

341
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,519
But,

342
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,519
Thank you.

343
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,960
Cheers.

344
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,039
Dad

345
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,079
Dad was amazing today.

346
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,200
Tom

347
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,000
Actually, when I laid you off before,

348
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,759
it was all considering the company's situation.

349
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,440
Personally, I always thought highly of you.

350
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,240
Thanks, but no need.

351
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,279
I know.

352
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,960
Back then, you helped someone out

353
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,440
and also invested in a small tech company.

354
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,759
Called Hive.

355
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,079
You worked on it for many years.

356
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,839
It never really took off.

357
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,440
But you never complained once.

358
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,000
I've always believed

359
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,160
investing in a project is like investing in a person.

360
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,839
For that reason alone,

361
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,480
I'm willing to work with you.

362
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,400
Don't.

363
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,559
I'm afraid you'll sell me out later.

364
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,160
Besides,

365
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,480
this tech sector

366
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
isn't my expertise.

367
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,640
I'll just mess around in my own familiar field.

368
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,440
That's enough.

369
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,559
Understood.

370
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,799
Peng Le Xuan is a roast duck restaurant with a great story.

371
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,920
If you can seize this opportunity,

372
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:15,160
it might become an instant hit.

373
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,559
Right?

374
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,880
I'll take your kind words.

375
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,160
My advice is,

376
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,319
you must seize this moment.

377
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,599
The overall environment is changing too fast now.

378
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,880
New industries are being born,

379
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,519
old industries are dying.

380
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,720
Opportunity is fleeting.

381
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,559
If you catch it,

382
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:38,200
it can change your whole life.

383
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,880
Miss it, and you miss it for life.

384
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,319
Alright, Lao Kai.

385
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,200
Your Chinese is getting better and better.

386
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,960
This "whole life, whole life"

387
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,720
you've phrased it quite neatly.

388
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,079
Dad

389
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,039
How long is a whole life?

390
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,279
It's like when Dad misses Yuanyuan,

391
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,680
and has a very, very long dream.

392
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,839
That dream ends quickly.

393
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,880
But,

394
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,720
Dad missing Yuanyuan never stops.

395
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:04,720
Right?

396
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,279
Tom

397
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,160
Are you and Martin working together smoothly?

398
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:12,799
It's okay.

399
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,160
I know a bit about Martin too.

400
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,359
He's very capable.

401
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,200
But he's always too domineering

402
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,680
with his partners.

403
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,200
He offends people without realizing it.

404
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,160
People at other companies

405
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,839
have a lot of complaints about him.

406
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,200
You should be careful.

407
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,000
Our business is none of your concern.

408
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,799
We're out for a meal.

409
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,599
You two keep talking about work.

410
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,720
Work all day,

411
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,960
twenty-four hours just work, work.

412
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,039
Sweetie, life is short.

413
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,279
Keep this up and I'm taking Jenny and leaving.

414
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,440
I know, I know, sweetie, sorry.

415
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,720
Men just can't help themselves when they meet.

416
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,119
Alright, from now on,

417
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,000
no one is allowed to talk about work.

418
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,920
You should say who.

419
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,079
Jenny is right again.

420
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,400
Cheers.

421
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,680
Cheers.

422
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,920
Cheers.

423
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,640
Mom, this is it.

424
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,519
It's nowhere near as good as the ones in the village.

425
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,599
Really? Are you serious?

426
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,359
It's true.

427
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,160
You have no idea.

428
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,039
I did a live stream for them, what's it called...

429
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,440
A livestreaming to aid farmers.

430
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,240
After it was over,

431
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,039
all the fruit and produce

432
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,720
that had been stockpiled in their village before

433
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,559
were completely sold out in that one go.

434
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,599
Ever since then,

435
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,000
the whole village has really taken a liking to me.

436
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,720
You know what the village chief said?

437
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,960
He said he wanted to marry his daughter off to me.

438
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,160
Me...

439
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,880
How could that work?

440
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,880
You're getting more and more ridiculous.

441
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,279
What kind of nonsense is this?

442
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,319
Look, look, look.

443
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,480
Look at your dad, the moment he got back,

444
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,000
he's been wearing a long face.

445
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,519
Weiguo wants you to write that summary.

446
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,160
We should still write it, right?

447
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,039
Right, the summary still needs to be written.

448
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,720
But it's okay.

449
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,519
I know

450
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,039
our Old Wang might not be able to write it.

451
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:16,839
But no problem!

452
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:17,880
Young Wang can write it.

453
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,000
Write it for him? I'll write nothing for him!

454
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,559
No, you're saying Ma Weiguo

455
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,839
just, just, just helps him like this?

456
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:25,720
Educates him?

457
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,319
Didn't he keep telling me

458
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,319
he'd definitely help him within three months?

459
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,839
Look at the situation now.

460
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,279
He completely doesn't want to go to college anymore.

461
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,880
He didn't say he's not going, right?

462
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,279
Right.

463
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,079
Look at you, the moment you got back,

464
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,039
Lights off, lights off. Go to sleep, go to sleep.

465
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:37,839
you just make your dad angry.

466
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,039
Go, go, go. Hurry up and go to bed.

467
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,079
Put your phone there.

468
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:44,799
Close the door.

469
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,799
Look at you.

470
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,039
You start yelling again, don't you?

471
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,000
He didn't say he's not going. That's not...

472
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,920
Lights off, lights off.

473
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,119
Turn all the lights off.

474
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,599
Okay.

475
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,680
On the surface,

476
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,599
President Ma is just in Beijing

477
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,160
catching up with old friends.

478
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,279
There's no clear movement.

479
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,519
But I looked into it carefully,

480
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,039
and I found that President Yang of Ke Yong

481
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,359
is also in Beijing right now.

482
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,039
And coincidentally,

483
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,319
he returned just before President Ma left his job.

484
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,880
It's hard to say

485
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,920
if there's any connection between the two of them.

486
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,720
Old Yang has been our rival for years.

487
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,599
Old Ma wouldn't go to him

488
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
to team up, would he?

489
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,640
Although this is the only lead I've found so far,

490
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,720
we can't rule out that possibility.

491
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,839
Furthermore,

492
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,039
I've also heard some rumors

493
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,880
that President Ma is planning to enter the restaurant industry

494
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,480
and is deeply involved with a roast duck restaurant called Peng Le Xuan.

495
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,519
He's gotten quite entangled with it.

496
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,039
It seems Martin still got the jump on us.

497
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,279
We've all been fooled by him.

498
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,279
You summoned us here with such formality

499
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,160
Is it time for the formal investment?

500
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,599
We've all had a good rest lately.

501
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,799
And made our adjustments.

502
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,880
Now it's time to get down to business.

503
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,400
Big Bro.

504
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,400
It's time to hand in your summaries.

505
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,720
I never planned to write one.

506
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,319
I knew it.

507
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,000
I knew that would be your attitude.

508
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,000
Darn right.

509
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,319
Why should I?

510
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,359
Did you accomplish what you promised me?

511
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:25,079
Why should I do what you tell me to do?

512
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,599
You really found a perfectly logical excuse.

513
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,599
Big Bro.

514
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,000
I think your skill at making excuses

515
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
is much smoother than your roast duck skills.

516
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,920
Don't give me any of your nonsense.

517
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,640
These past few days,

518
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,920
we went on food tours and tastings.

519
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:42,720
You know full well your skills are inferior.

520
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,640
Yet you keep talking tough.

521
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,319
Do you think that saves your face?

522
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,000
You don't even dare to lie to yourself.

523
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,640
Say whatever you want.

524
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,880
Every day you talk about keeping up with the times.

525
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,160
But as soon as Feifei's issue came up,

526
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,240
you were completely lost.

527
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,920
All that stuff you read online

528
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,160
is simply not valid.

529
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,599
Let me tell you,

530
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,359
making roast duck is your last shred of dignity.

531
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,160
Now that fig leaf has been torn to shreds.

532
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,720
Just admit it.

533
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,880
You've been left behind by the times.

534
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,480
Don't talk to me about "the times."

535
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,839
I've lived through plenty of eras.

536
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm quite comfortable right now.

537
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,119
Hey, you can't talk to Big Bro like that!

538
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,200
It's not your turn to speak.

539
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,799
You're useless too.

540
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,640
What about me?

541
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,480
Can't compete with the young kids at work.

542
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,079
Who pays the mortgage?

543
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,720
Your wife does.

544
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,279
A grown man,

545
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,839
not focusing on building a career.

546
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,039
Yammering every day about going to Xi'an to see his wife.

547
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,519
Have you no shame?

548
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,079
When we were tasting food,

549
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,400
you had the nerve to eat roast duck.

550
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,720
How could you face eating it?

551
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,880
I drive over a hundred kilometers a day.

552
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,160
I was hungry!

553
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Sit down. Sit down.

554
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,480
Enough! Are you done yet?

555
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,519
Always playing the Monday morning quarterback.

556
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,400
Didn't you say you could help Feifei?

557
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,920
Didn't that blow up in your face too?

558
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,319
A few small setbacks on the road to success

559
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,640
are perfectly normal.

560
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,400
You're something else.

561
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,519
Our minor flaws

562
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,880
are major issues to you.

563
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,720
Exactly!

564
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,920
The moment we criticize you,

565
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,359
you say everything's normal.

566
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,319
Anyone can talk trash.

567
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:13,880
Let's the three of us roast him. Roast him!

568
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,279
That guy, roast him first.

569
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,079
You, you go first.

570
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,480
Roast him, roast, roast, roast.

571
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,599
I think you, you... just you...

572
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:21,559
I'm not listening, not listening, not listening!

573
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,880
I'm not listening.

574
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,319
See?

575
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,160
I'm not listening.

576
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,480
What are you doing?

577
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
When you criticize us,

578
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,319
we have to listen.

579
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,119
When we criticize you,

580
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,519
you say you won't listen.

581
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,359
Big Bro, ignore him. Let's do it ourselves.

582
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,000
Don't miss this trend.

583
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,559
You have the nerve to talk about trends?

584
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,039
Your past success

585
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,240
was only because you relied on the platform.

586
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,559
Trend, trend.

587
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,559
How shameless.

588
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:43,079
Even a pig can fly

589
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,039
if you put it in the right trend.

590
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,960
Ma Weiguo!

591
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,720
Can you speak like a human being?

592
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,759
Do you think you're gravity itself?

593
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,359
The Earth won't spin without you, is that it?

594
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,799
I'm not as narcissistic as you think.

595
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,160
I know. What you need isn't me.

596
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
It's my money.

597
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,920
You went around before,

598
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,279
could you have gotten any money without my name?

599
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,039
I...

600
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,759
Face the facts.

601
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,920
I don't want you to listen to me.

602
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,079
Listen to the money.

603
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,880
Fine.

604
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,079
Think it over carefully.

605
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,039
And one more thing.

606
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,119
You still owe me an apology.

607
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,480
What kind of person are you?

608
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,960
Kick him,

609
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,720
kick him out of our group chat.

610
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Where are you going?

611
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,079
Avoiding me as soon as you see me?

612
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,079
I only criticized you a little,

613
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,359
and you can't keep your cool.

614
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,920
With that attitude, how can you start a business?

615
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,359
Boss Ma.

616
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,039
I work at a bank.

617
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,839
There's a start and end time to my day.

618
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,559
Starting a business with you,

619
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,400
I can't even catch my breath.

620
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,799
I was waiting here for you

621
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,480
precisely so you could catch your breath.

622
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,000
How about this.

623
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,559
I'll give you two days off.

624
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,480
Go back to Xi'an to be with Xiaoshi.

625
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,559
Handle your family matters properly.

626
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,799
After you've sorted things out,

627
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,039
come back and work hard.

628
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:11,799
How about it?

629
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,079
Really?

630
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,039
I knew you

631
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,960
have a sharp tongue but a soft heart.

632
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,920
You've worked at the bank for so many years.

633
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,160
You have some discernment and potential.

634
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,839
Right now, you just lack an opportunity.

635
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,599
Once you seize this opportunity,

636
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,839
you'll have a chance to succeed.

637
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,359
Alright. When I get back from Xi'an,

638
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,920
I'll give it my all.

639
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,519
Go on.

640
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,160
You rascal.

641
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,440
Your past success

642
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,519
was only because of the platform.

643
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,680
Even a pig can fly in the right trend.

644
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,279
You went around before,

645
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,039
without my name,

646
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,160
could you have gotten any money?

647
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,039
Dong Qian used to always pick on me.

648
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,599
She said I was just riding on the platform's coattails,

649
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,519
with a bunch of people kissing up to me.

650
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,400
If I ever left the platform,

651
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,359
I'd be nothing.

652
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,440
President Dong was just trying to get under your skin.

653
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:28,759
Brother Liu.

654
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,599
Haven't you ever thought about a backup plan for yourself?

655
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,279
Manager Li.

656
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,000
I still want to keep working for you.

657
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,599
No matter where you go,

658
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:40,920
as long as you'll have me,

659
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,160
I'm willing to follow.

660
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,599
I could introduce you to

661
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,720
a better job.

662
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,160
Once you're past forty,

663
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,119
with a non-local residency permit,

664
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,240
a kid going to school in Beijing,

665
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,400
a wife who's a temp worker,

666
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,599
and renting a place...

667
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,640
With my situation, it's the same anywhere I go.

668
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,200
I don't have the energy to cater to a new boss.

669
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,039
I'm used to working for you.

670
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,599
Really, I'm not lying.

671
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,359
I went too far before.

672
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,640
I owe you an apology.

673
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,039
Actually, all these years,

674
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,519
towards you...

675
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,880
I haven't been completely without feelings.

676
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,240
It's just that...

677
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,799
I could never bring myself to say it.

678
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,680
You might not know this,

679
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,839
but ever since I was in third grade,

680
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,000
I wanted to be with you.

681
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,799
When the thing with Feifei happened,

682
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,880
you just lost your bearings.

683
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,039
All that stuff you read online every day

684
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,279
is completely useless.

685
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,720
Let me tell you,

686
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,440
making roast duck is your last shred of dignity.

687
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,359
Now that fig leaf has been torn off.

688
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,079
Just admit it.

689
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,400
You've been left behind by the times.

690
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,960
Big Bro, please.

691
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,480
Please.

692
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,279
Head Chef.

693
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,799
Welcome.

694
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,640
Here we are.

695
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:11,400
Let me show you guys my current knife skills.

696
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,239
I'm not bragging,

697
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,599
but I feel like I'm almost catching up to my grandpa.

698
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,360
That's a fact.

699
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,239
Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.

700
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,599
This skill of slicing the duck

701
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,679
has to be precise down to the millimeter.

702
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,679
Don't think you can master it just by practicing hard.

703
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,079
Before you start, you have to have the right attitude.

704
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,239
Stand straight, chest out, stomach in.

705
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,400
Hold that breath up high.

706
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,480
If you don't take it seriously,

707
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,960
it'll trip you up.

708
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,920
Understand?

709
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,559
Once that breath is gone,

710
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,440
no matter how many years you practice, it's wasted.

711
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,639
You, you, how old are you?

712
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,920
I, I'm thirty-nine.

713
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:43,920
Thirty-nine.

714
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,000
How, how many years at this shop?

715
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,280
Twenty-one years.

716
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,519
Most chefs here are around my age.

717
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,679
My skill level is considered average here.

718
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,199
We graduated from culinary school,

719
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,000
and after that,

720
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,800
every day it's just roasting ducks, slicing ducks.

721
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,960
For over a decade, it hasn't stopped.

722
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,199
This roast duck,

723
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,920
it's not just roasting a duck.

724
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,519
What it's roasting is

725
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,679
our passion for the chef profession,

726
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,880
our patience,

727
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,400
and our gratitude towards our patrons.

728
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,519
For over a decade,

729
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,039
whether there are customers or not,

730
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,840
I have to make a roast duck meal.

731
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,880
If I don't smell roast duck for a day,

732
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
I can't sleep well.

733
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,719
So whether my skill has improved or not, I don't know,

734
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,280
but my feelings for roast duck

735
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,119
grow deeper every day.

736
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,239
Lift your foot.

737
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,400
The most important part of Golden Broth Buddha Jumps Over the Wall is the broth.

738
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,639
The core of the broth is this chicken.

739
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,360
Lift your foot.

740
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,119
Dad.

741
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,480
I'm not even planning to take the college entrance exam.

742
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,199
So why don't you just stop roasting duck too?

743
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,679
No matter how it turns out,

744
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,119
it won't affect us opening the shop.

745
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Don't bother with the effort.

746
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,159
Besides, Second Brother and them started this business

747
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,079
just to borrow our family's name.

748
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,000
It's not like they actually need

749
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,159
your roast duck to be that good.

750
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,400
What nonsense are you talking?

751
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
What do you know?

752
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,159
Go do your homework.

753
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,000
No, let me be honest with you.

754
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,639
I just don't want the hassle.

755
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,320
Our life is fine as it is, right?

756
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,440
Why would I bother? Really.

757
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,360
No, can you stop following my mop around?

758
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,679
I mop where, you sit where. You...

759
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,199
Go do your homework.

760
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,079
President Zhang.

761
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,880
Honey.

762
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,559
This person insists...

763
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,119
Okay, you can step out for now.

764
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,119
Why did you come without telling me?

765
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,880
I have so much to do today.

766
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
You'll have to wait for me.

767
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,159
You're busy, you're busy.

768
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,320
Alright, we can be lovey-dovey back home.

769
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,079
I'm too busy today.

770
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,719
You could've given me a heads-up.

771
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,000
I missed you.

772
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,920
I missed you too.

773
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:20,360
Really?

774
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:21,920
People are watching.

775
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,559
I've...

776
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,880
I really have been a bit busy lately.

777
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,760
Sorry, I was late.

778
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,599
About this Peng Le Xuan thing,

779
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:33,920
Big Bro, Second Brother, Weiguo...

780
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,239
they're at each other's throats.

781
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,760
Honey, I have a call.

782
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,679
Wait for me a moment, okay?

783
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,000
President Huang, I saw the contract.

784
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:48,039
It's a bit different from what we discussed.

785
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,599
Hold on a moment.

786
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,400
It hasn't been revised into the contract yet.

787
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,280
Right.

788
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,119
Then there's the promotional content.

789
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,480
The main thing is...

790
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,880
Yes, yes.

791
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,800
Right now, there's no clear...

792
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,719
It's about our scheduled themed livestream.

793
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:17,920
In that case...

794
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,440
Okay, goodbye.

795
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:24,119
I really have a lot to do today.

796
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,039
Honey

797
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,239
Didn't I promise to buy you a bag before?

798
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,119
Take a look.

799
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,159
Look.

800
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,400
Just a moment, just a moment.

801
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,079
One moment.

802
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,239
Honey, you should spend less money like this in the future.

803
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,239
No, it's just that this bag...

804
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,400
I promised.

805
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,039
I was thinking...

806
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,039
If we have money, we should save it first.

807
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:01,880
Oh, right.

808
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,880
My performance bonus this month is very high.

809
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,559
It's about fifty thousand.

810
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,440
Let's put it in savings.

811
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,599
Don't touch it for now, okay?

812
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,320
How much?

813
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,960
Fifty thousand.

814
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,960
That's almost three months of my salary.

815
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,719
No matter how hard I work...

816
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:19,280
...it can't keep up with how much you spend.

817
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,320
Look at this trip of yours.

818
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,760
A bag, flowers...

819
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,000
You don't seem to mind the cost.

820
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,199
No, no.

821
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,960
The ticket was a last-minute deal, very cheap.

822
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:26,920
As for this bag...

823
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,719
Wait, I have another meeting.

824
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,760
We'll talk more when I get back, okay?

825
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,159
When will it end?

826
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,119
I don't know.

827
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,440
When will you be back?

828
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Hard to say.

829
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,159
You don't know, and it's hard to say.

830
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,320
It's all question marks.

831
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,440
Then what should I do?
