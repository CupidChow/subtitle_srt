1
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,400
Old Tong, I really didn't see it coming.

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,480
You're quite the operator.

3
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,000
You got Director Qiu on your side.

4
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,879
And you've got a big shot backing you.

5
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,959
A true master stays hidden.

6
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,719
Manager Liu, I really don't.

7
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,920
I know.

8
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,599
You and Xiao Jia have never quite gotten along.

9
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,680
I've already made arrangements for you.

10
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,319
No, no, I really don't mean anything by it.

11
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,760
I get it, I get it.

12
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
It has nothing to do with you, don't worry.

13
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,079
I really don't mean that.

14
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,280
Given that Comrade Jia Zhilong

15
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,039
has had poor performance recently,

16
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,639
it has been decided after discussion

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,439
to adjust his position.

18
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,039
Comrade Tong Qiu,

19
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,280
has shown outstanding performance and a serious attitude.

20
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,759
After collective deliberation by management,

21
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,039
it is proposed to appoint him as Assistant Branch Manager.

22
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,280
This has been reported to the relevant authorities.

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,360
Good. Meeting adjourned.

24
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,120
Well, well.

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,599
Congratulations.

26
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,719
Congratulations!

27
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,960
You went straight for the big move.

28
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,280
Old Tong.

29
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,639
I always said you'd make something of yourself.

30
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,000
Brother Tong.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,479
I told you so.

32
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,759
Our Brother Tong was bound to get promoted.

33
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,360
Exactly.

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,120
You're treating us to a meal!

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,759
You're buying dinner!

36
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,240
You absolutely have to treat us tonight!

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,479
No, no, no, Manager Jia.

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,439
Why are you so upset?

39
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,960
Alright, alright, just ignore him.

40
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,719
Where are we eating tonight?

41
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,639
Barbecue.

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,280
No, it's not that.

43
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,800
This is just the leadership showing me favor.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,280
The leaders appreciate me.

45
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,960
What are you being modest for?

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,280
I'm not being modest, not at all.

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,080
Not being low-key either.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,840
Okay, okay.

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,319
We'll... we'll do it later, later.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll treat everyone later, I promise.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,879
No, no, we're treating you.

52
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,479
No, no, no, it's on me, on me.

53
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,520
I'm heading out first.

54
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,800
How come he's all flustered

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,439
after getting a promotion?

56
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:27,800
Let's go.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,039
He's just dizzy with excitement.

58
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,520
Let's go, let's go.

59
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,840
We're out of here too, let's go.

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,520
Let's go.

61
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,520
Honey.

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,560
Listen to this.

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,879
Something huge happened to me today.

64
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,919
Don't rush, don't rush. Take your time.

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,599
Just now.

66
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,759
Just now.

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,800
I'm getting promoted. Assistant Branch Manager.

68
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,199
You scared me.

69
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,120
I thought something bad happened to you.

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
No, no, no.

71
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,840
It's just that I feel...

72
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,120
The more I think about it, the more nervous I get.

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,319
What are you nervous about?

74
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,560
You've been hoping for this for so long.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,120
Don't you worry.

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,360
You earned this all by yourself.

77
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,000
No, no, no, that's not it.

78
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,039
Look.

79
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,759
I finally figured it out now.

80
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,560
If I just rise up like this,

81
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,639
how many eyes will be watching me?

82
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,279
Take Xiao Jia, for example.

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,879
He was originally the Assistant Branch Manager.

84
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,920
By convention, after a full year he'd be promoted to Vice President.

85
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,120
Now that I'm going up, he's going down.

86
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,639
You have no idea how he was glaring at me.

87
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,920
Alright, alright.

88
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,600
Don't overthink it.

89
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,959
If you're afraid of this and afraid of that,

90
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,680
you might as well not go to work at all.

91
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,000
Husband, you do your job well.

92
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,839
No one's going to do anything to you.

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,360
Trust me, okay?

94
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,319
Right? Yeah, you're right.

95
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,120
Well, then we'll just take it one step at a time.

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,800
Right?

97
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,800
Okay, I'll get back to work then.

98
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,959
Bye, sweetie.

99
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
Love you.

100
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,800
Yeah.

101
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,279
Yeah.

102
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,000
Time to get off work.

103
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,600
He really got promoted.

104
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,000
Promoted.

105
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,000
You're not lying to us this time, are you?

106
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,519
I'm really not lying to you.

107
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,600
Great! That's great!

108
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,439
Good son. You've made something of yourself.

109
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,639
So, with this promotion...

110
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,519
...your salary should go up a bit, right?

111
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:47,839
Yeah.

112
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,199
The salary will increase. It definitely will.

113
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,079
If the salary goes up...

114
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,439
...the financial pressure won't be so heavy.

115
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,199
Then Xiaoshi...

116
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,800
...can be transferred back sooner, right?

117
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,360
About whether she can come back or not...

118
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,879
I... I'll wait until I'm officially in the position,

119
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,079
then I'll discuss it properly with her.

120
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,360
Don't worry about that for now.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,439
Don't be in such a rush about this.

122
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,600
A promotion has its advantages,

123
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,920
but it also comes with pressure.

124
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,120
You just focus on doing a good job at work.

125
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,920
From now on,

126
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,360
our family's life will just get better and better.

127
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,199
Right?

128
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,560
Yes, Dad.

129
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,199
Let me tell you,

130
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,519
our family's good days are just beginning.

131
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:21,920
As for you...

132
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,519
...really, don't put so much pressure on yourself.

133
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,879
Take your time with that script.

134
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,360
Okay?

135
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,839
Okay, okay, okay.

136
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,920
Alright, I'll take it easy. I'll take it easy.

137
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,319
Right, right, right.

138
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,199
Qiu'er!

139
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,800
You got promoted!

140
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,360
Chunsheng.

141
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,199
Promoted, promoted, promoted!

142
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,759
Uncle, Auntie.

143
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,040
Then we have to celebrate!

144
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,439
Come to my place for some good food. Let's go.

145
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,600
Let's all go together.

146
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,879
No, no. You boys go ahead first.

147
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,800
I still have some lines to work on.

148
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,839
You go on ahead.

149
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,759
Alright then, we won't stand on ceremony with you two.

150
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,439
Let's go, let's go, Qiu'er.

151
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,560
Let's go.

152
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,519
Sorry about that.

153
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,639
What good food do you want to eat?

154
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,959
Hairy crabs!

155
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,079
This is perfect now.

156
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,199
Delicious.

157
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,639
Let me propose a toast to everyone.

158
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,199
Special thanks to all the leaders for attending my...

159
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,360
...humble promotion celebration.

160
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,879
This promotion banquet, right?

161
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Special thanks to Brother Wang, Brother Wang...

162
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,839
No, Director Ma!

163
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,079
Director Ma!

164
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,879
Brother Ma, Brother Ma, my apologies, apologies.

165
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,519
Pleasure, pleasure.

166
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,560
Li, Li, Li... Sis Li, Li... Sis Li!

167
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,160
Long live Sis Li! Sis Li!

168
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,319
Coming, coming!

169
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,600
Pleasure, pleasure.

170
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,800
He's happy today.

171
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,600
I'm telling you, don't...

172
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,079
Don't drink it all. Don't drink anymore.

173
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,759
Here, have some fruit.

174
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,439
Come on, come on.

175
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,920
Hurry, hurry, hurry up.

176
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,519
Eat some fruit.

177
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,199
Eat fruit.

178
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,800
How did he get this drunk?

179
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,759
A toast just for you. Just for you.

180
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,079
Come on, come on.

181
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,920
Isn't he just happy about the promotion?

182
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,040
You, hurry up.

183
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,800
Here, you take charge.

184
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,360
He can't drink anymore.

185
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,519
Yes, I know, I know, I know.

186
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,199
Come on, come on. Let me toast everyone.

187
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,160
Sis.

188
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,519
Okay, thank you, Sis.

189
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,519
Thank you all.

190
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:44,920
Thanks.

191
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,079
Enjoy the food and drinks.

192
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,800
Please offer your valuable suggestions in the future.

193
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,639
Right, more valuable suggestions.

194
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,560
You're too kind.

195
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,399
I'll finish mine. Everyone, drink at your own pace.

196
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:51,759
Okay.

197
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,120
Alright.

198
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,759
Thank you.

199
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,120
Alright.

200
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,560
Come on, come on, let's dig in.

201
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,399
Eat, eat, eat some fruit.

202
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,759
Have some fruit. Have some fruit.

203
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,800
Have some dishes.

204
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,000
Should I go get some water?

205
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,920
Go get some, go get some.

206
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,000
Go get some water.

207
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,160
What's wrong?

208
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
You're really something, you know that?

209
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,399
You were the one who told me not to meddle before.

210
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,839
You were the one who left without a word.

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,360
And now you're back, making a complete mess of things.

212
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,519
What exactly do you want?

213
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:40,159
You're still angry about the cafe thing?

214
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,919
You've misunderstood.

215
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,000
Feifei was worried you'd be tricked,

216
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
so she asked me to check out...

217
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,519
...that guy's character, that's all.

218
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,159
Everyone in this whole alley...

219
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,879
...combined doesn't have as many schemes as you do.

220
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,320
Let me say this one more time.

221
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,120
Matters of the heart...

222
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,519
...if anyone's to meddle, it's not your turn.

223
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,639
That's my uncle's job.

224
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,759
And work matters are even less your business.

225
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,559
You pulling Wang Fei into this...

226
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,000
...I can let that slide.

227
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,159
You fooled everyone with a fake medical report...

228
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,840
...and I don't want to expose you either.

229
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,120
In short,

230
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,039
from now on, let's just leave each other alone, okay?

231
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,159
You knew all along.

232
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,840
After all that trouble...

233
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,200
...you came back just to hold the exhibition and fulfill your wish, right?

234
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,399
Why can he help you...

235
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,399
...but I can't?

236
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,559
He helps me, I help him.

237
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,840
We're friends helping each other.

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And you? Why do you want to help me?

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,759
Isn't it clear in your heart?

240
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,240
I...

241
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,799
You... you what?

242
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,000
We're friends too, aren't we?

243
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
I've said it before.

244
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,000
You don't owe me anything.

245
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,360
You know my situation very well.

246
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,639
It's not that I don't want to do many things.

247
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,480
It's that I can't.

248
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,279
That so-called kind of...

249
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,200
promise.

250
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,120
Given my condition, I can't make one.

251
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,639
Don't you get it yet?

252
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,759
Yes, I confessed my feelings to you before.

253
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,120
But when I said I liked you,

254
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,559
I wasn't asking for anything in return.

255
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,399
Because I thought you felt the same way I did.

256
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,120
I thought if I said it out loud,

257
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
you'd stop running away.

258
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,159
You'd pull yourself together a bit.

259
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,480
You'd find the courage to fight your illness.

260
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,919
But I guess I was wrong.

261
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,000
Because you're a complete coward.

262
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,320
You don't have the courage to face your own feelings.

263
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,639
Or the courage to face your own condition.

264
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,759
I've thought about it too.

265
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I think someone like you...

266
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,559
isn't worth my affection.

267
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,000
If you interfere in my life again,

268
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,879
I'll move out of the hutong immediately.

269
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,000
You can leave now.

270
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,879
Wang Chunsheng.

271
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,159
What have you been doing all this time?

272
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,159
What's this about?

273
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,320
Got a date today? All dolled up.

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,639
No.

275
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,159
Isn't Teacher Xia Tian coming to collaborate?

276
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,039
I gotta spruce myself up a bit.

277
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,919
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

278
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,080
What?

279
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,639
Hey, all these years we've known each other,

280
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,080
I've never seen you spruce up for me.

281
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,559
Here.

282
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,279
For us...

283
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,279
Aren't you just wasting your time?

284
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,960
How am I wasting your time?

285
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,639
Let me tell you something.

286
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,480
If you've got nothing better to do,

287
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,080
you should watch more of...

288
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,639
Teacher Xia Tian's live streams.

289
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,399
Look how dark you are.

290
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,240
You should whiten your skin when you can.

291
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,639
Here.

292
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,679
You've got that pretty-boy vibe today.

293
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,080
Hey, what are you doing?

294
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,600
This is ridiculous.

295
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,960
You're putting it on me?

296
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,559
Isn't this thing too wet to use?

297
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,759
You're being ridiculous, you know that?

298
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,720
It does feel pretty good.

299
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,159
How long do I leave this thing on?

300
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,639
Take it off when it's dry.

301
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,120
Should've wrung it out more then.

302
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:44,559
Xia...

303
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,200
Teacher Xia Tian, you drove yourself?

304
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,240
Master Wang, is it okay to park my car here?

305
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,360
No problem. If it's in the way later, I'll move it for you.

306
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,759
First of all, thank you for gracing our humble establishment.

307
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,840
It truly brings honor to my humble abode.

308
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,240
You're too kind.

309
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,519
This is my first time venturing into the food industry.

310
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,360
You're the expert here.

311
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
No, no, no.

312
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,399
I don't deserve that title.

313
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,559
I should be learning from you.

314
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,399
Please, come inside.

315
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,320
So this is the century-old plaque you mentioned.

316
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,519
Yes, that's from my grandfather...

317
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,399
passed down from his grandfather's generation.

318
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,559
You could say it's weathered many storms, seen it all.

319
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,720
Please, let's go inside, inside.

320
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,159
Come on, come, come, come.

321
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,320
Watch your step, here.

322
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,759
Our little shop here...

323
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,720
Although it's faced its share of troubles,

324
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,559
it's still kept the old flavors alive.

325
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,879
You could say it's a kind of legacy.

326
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,159
Then I must have a taste.

327
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,559
You absolutely must try it.

328
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,679
Here, please have a seat.

329
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,159
You're back.

330
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,080
This is my wife.

331
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,559
Quick, go get Teacher Xia some water.

332
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,240
Hurry, hurry!

333
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,039
Please, sit, sit, sit.

334
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,879
Well, this craft of mine...

335
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,360
I learned it from my grandfather.

336
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,159
You could say...

337
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,559
I've spent half my life...

338
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,679
right here in this shop.

339
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,360
Here's some water.

340
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,200
Thank you, sister-in-law.

341
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,679
Hey, why are you bringing plain water?

342
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,240
Go get my good tea.

343
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,279
No need, no need, this is just fine.

344
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,240
No, no, absolutely not. Go get the good tea, go!

345
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,200
Don't trouble yourself, sister-in-law.

346
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,879
It's no trouble at all.

347
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,399
Here it is.

348
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,519
So this is the situation on the first floor.

349
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,960
Let me take you upstairs to have a look.

350
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,840
The view up there is something special.

351
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,879
Once you go up and take a look,

352
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,360
you can see all of Beijing from up there.

353
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,000
It really is.

354
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,639
And it's a great spot for filming, you know?

355
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:21,879
You know what I mean?

356
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,559
Right, come on, come on.

357
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,559
This way, please, this way.

358
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,759
You go get the tea, hurry up, quick!

359
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,240
Come on, come on, this way please.

360
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,639
Be careful now.

361
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes, I confessed my feelings to you before.

362
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,360
But when I said I liked you,

363
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,720
I wasn't asking for anything in return.

364
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,639
Because I thought you felt the same way I did.

365
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,279
I thought if I said it out loud,

366
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,279
you'd stop running away.

367
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,360
You'd pull yourself together a bit.

368
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,639
You'd find the courage to fight your illness.

369
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,159
But I guess I was wrong.

370
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:30,159
Because you're a complete coward.

371
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,519
You don't have the courage to face your own feelings.

372
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,799
Or the courage to face your own condition.

373
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,039
I think someone like you...

374
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,240
isn't worth my affection.

375
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,039
Martin.

376
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,640
In your brainstem,

377
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,359
a glioma lesion has been discovered.

378
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,200
Surgery is recommended immediately.

379
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,000
If the nerves can be spared

380
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,200
and the lesion successfully removed,

381
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,200
then you can live a normal life.

382
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,119
Just like before.

383
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:49,880
I'm here.

384
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,920
I made you some more soup.

385
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,440
Thank you, big brother.

386
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,119
How have you been these past couple days?

387
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,920
Pretty good, see?

388
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,839
That's good to hear.

389
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,839
I just finished up my work,

390
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,279
so I said I'd hurry over to see you.

391
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,440
It's fine.

392
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,279
Been in touch these past couple days.

393
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,880
How's it going over there?

394
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,240
When can the treatment start?

395
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,039
Big bro, don't worry.

396
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,160
There's a waiting list.

397
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,759
Don't you fret, I've got it all arranged.

398
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,440
So now we just have to wait?

399
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:28,880
For... for now, yes.

400
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,720
No, if that's the case, let's just go there first.

401
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,759
Let's go over there and wait.

402
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,519
It's a queue, right?

403
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,759
What if, in the meantime...

404
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,440
A few people don't show up, you know?

405
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,680
Then we'd be first in line.

406
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,559
What do you think?

407
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,519
Big bro...

408
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,480
Wasn't it you guys...

409
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,839
who dragged me back from abroad?

410
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,119
Back then...

411
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,119
Didn't you think I was all alone out there...

412
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,359
What if I got a bit depressed...

413
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,119
and did something, you know?

414
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,240
Now you know it can be treated.

415
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,160
So let's just go quickly, what do you say?

416
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,240
Big bro, there's no rush.

417
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,519
Besides...

418
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,519
All that back-and-forth travel...

419
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,519
isn't good for my condition either, right?

420
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,960
No, no.

421
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,240
You're doing pretty well now, aren't you?

422
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,319
Whether we go through the hassle early or late...

423
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,240
don't we have to make that trip anyway?

424
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,519
Teacher Xiatian came, didn't she?

425
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,759
How did your talk go?

426
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,680
Let me tell you about Teacher Xiatian...

427
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,519
She's extremely satisfied with us.

428
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,440
She told me...

429
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,400
she wants me to do livestreams with her.

430
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,759
I saw Lianbao and Qianqian...

431
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,160
are also coordinating very smoothly.

432
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,759
Right.

433
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,039
Once everything here is on track...

434
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,319
I'll go back and focus on treatment, okay?

435
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,039
With that promise from you...

436
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,160
it's a deal.

437
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,039
You can't fool me again, Weiguo.

438
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,440
How could I fool you?

439
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,599
Good.

440
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,400
Come on, come on.

441
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,240
Drink the soup while it's hot, come on.

442
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,680
It'll get cold in a bit.

443
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,400
I adjusted the flavor for you again this time.

444
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,119
Try it.

445
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,799
Thanks, big bro. I'm just getting hungry.

446
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,079
No need for thanks. Try it.

447
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:54,640
Okay.

448
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,240
How is it? A bit more palatable?

449
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,000
Seems about the same.

450
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,200
This, this, this...

451
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Then I'll adjust it for you again next time.

452
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,440
I refuse to believe it.

453
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,720
It's fine, it's okay.

454
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,880
Jing'er.

455
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,119
A gift for you.

456
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,559
From France.

457
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,680
High-end skincare. Very expensive.

458
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,160
This... this must be really pricey.

459
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,119
Listen, Chunsheng...

460
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:37,839
From now on...

461
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,119
you really shouldn't waste money like this.

462
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,519
Buying useless things for me.

463
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,119
No, this didn't cost any money.

464
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,680
Teacher Xiatian gave it.

465
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,000
Just do as she says.

466
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,759
Use it consistently for three months.

467
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,640
By then...

468
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
your skin will be as good as Teacher Xiatian's.

469
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,960
I'm fine the way I am now.

470
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,240
No, in the future...

471
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,359
we'll have a long-term partnership with Teacher Xiatian.

472
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,720
Then I can give you lots of things.

473
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,279
She has tons of good stuff.

474
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,680
Dad, you finally wised up.

475
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,880
Knowing to give Mom such nice skincare.

476
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,400
Teacher Xiatian gave it.

477
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,680
Now, one word from Teacher Xiatian...

478
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,640
is worth ten thousand from your mom.

479
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:19,960
Feifei.

480
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,160
Later, I'll be doing livestreams...

481
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,559
with Teacher Xiatian.

482
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,240
I need to fix up my look.

483
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,839
Come here, come here. Help me choose.

484
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,640
I picked out a few. Take a look.

485
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,759
Mom, Mom.

486
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,400
Where are you going?

487
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Something at the shop.

488
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:34,960
Come back early.

489
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,400
Is the window not closed or something?

490
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,920
Such a loud noise.

491
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,119
Let me see.

492
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,680
No, what was that sound just now?

493
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,480
The window wasn't closed?

494
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,720
Right?

495
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,880
Isn't the opening today?

496
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,759
And brought a huge wave of traffic for my dad.

497
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,359
Look at all these, one after another.

498
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,039
Well, then post more.

499
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,680
Later, people will come swarming...

500
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,720
all looking for your dad, right?

501
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Listen to your mom.

502
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,000
You're so out of touch.

503
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,200
You're clueless, Mom.

504
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,920
Posting videos, it's...

505
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,599
Don't explain to your mom, she won't get it.

506
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,400
Let's you and I discuss it.

507
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,359
No, son.

508
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,759
You, explain it to Mom.

509
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,039
Mom wants to learn too, right? I, I...

510
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:42,400
I'm telling you...

511
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,559
Can't you do something within your capabilities?

512
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,759
Go cook noodles.

513
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:21,799
Weiguo

514
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,559
Sis

515
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,680
Why are you back again?

516
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I... I thought there was something at Penglexuan.

517
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,759
But once I got here, I thought...

518
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,000
It can wait till tomorrow.

519
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll head back first.

520
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,559
Let me keep you company for a bit.

521
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,519
Alright.

522
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,880
Okay, come on, have a seat.

523
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,759
How have you been lately?

524
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,039
Are you okay?

525
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,240
I just wanted to get out for a walk.

526
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,640
And then, as I walked...

527
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,519
I don't know how...

528
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,000
I ended up at Penglexuan again.

529
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,519
Just now, standing at the door, I was thinking...

530
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,559
My day-to-day life...

531
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,880
It's just home and the restaurant.

532
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,880
I don't even have an "off-duty" time.

533
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,799
Lately...

534
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,680
Big Brother's been busy with the Duck King competition,

535
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,880
busy opening the new shop,

536
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
and collaborating with that Teacher Xiatian.

537
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,960
He hasn't been paying much attention to you, has he?

538
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,519
It's been over an hour since I left.

539
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,319
Not even a single message.

540
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,799
Honestly, Sis...

541
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,200
Do you think...

542
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,880
Big Brother and that Teacher Xiatian...

543
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,440
No, not at all.

544
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,559
Really, no.

545
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,440
Really, no.

546
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,559
I know your Big Brother.

547
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,000
Actually, your Big Brother...

548
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:50,960
He's got no real faults.

549
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,319
First, no bad habits.

550
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Second...

551
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,160
He's not the type to fool around outside.

552
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,720
And he's a fantastic cook.

553
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,519
I don't know how it is where you're from,

554
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,839
but around here, a man like your Big Brother...

555
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:14,319
is absolutely top-notch.

556
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,319
One in a hundred, a great guy.

557
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,519
I think...

558
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,000
You two should really have a good talk.

559
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,599
Haven't you been lacking communication lately?

560
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,000
Weiguo...

561
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,759
What do you mean by "more communication"?

562
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,240
Take me and your Big Brother, for example.

563
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,200
We either talk about Feifei,

564
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,799
or we talk about Penglexuan stuff.

565
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:44,200
There's nothing else to talk about.

566
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,759
Especially recently...

567
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,759
He and Feifei are working on that...

568
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,680
That thing of his...

569
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,119
That... that account.

570
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,119
I know.

571
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,160
When they talk about it...

572
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,559
I... I really can't understand it.

573
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,799
And second...

574
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,200
When I try to join in...

575
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,000
I really can't get a word in.

576
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,119
We're not like...

577
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,000
Teacher Xiatian, right?

578
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
She's...

579
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,759
In the end, it's still about that Teacher Xiatian, isn't it?

580
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:15,200
It's really not, nothing like that.

581
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,759
How about this, Sis.

582
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,200
I have an idea for you. Will you listen?

583
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,400
What idea?

584
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,640
You should go stay at your parents' place for a few days.

585
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,119
Put aside things at home and the restaurant.

586
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,079
Just let them be for now.

587
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,720
No, no, both places need someone.

588
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,920
Didn't you say...

589
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,039
you never get a break all year?

590
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,839
This time...

591
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,119
just treat it as giving yourself a big vacation, okay?

592
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:41,880
That wouldn't work, would it?

593
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
What if something happens?

594
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,039
Just give it a try.

595
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,119
Nothing will happen.

596
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,480
What could possibly happen?

597
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,599
Alright.

598
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,000
A big vacation.

599
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,519
Okay.

600
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,839
Relax, just rel...

601
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,400
Jing'er, get me a pair of socks.

602
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,119
Jing'er, get me a clean pair of socks.

603
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,279
Jing'er?

604
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,160
Jing'er?

605
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,480
Where's your mom?

606
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,160
Get me a bowl of congee.

607
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:11,599
Jing'er?

608
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,119
Dad, what's wrong?

609
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,039
Old problem, it's fine.

610
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,920
I'm helping my mom take care of him for a few days.

611
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,720
Wait, should I come over to check?

612
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Don't bother.

613
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,519
Aren't you swamped with things at the restaurant?

614
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:22,759
I'll be back in a couple of days.

615
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,039
Okay, then give my regards to Mom and Dad.

616
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,640
Let me know if anything comes up.

617
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,480
Dad, did Mom wash those new insoles for me?

618
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,200
Have you seen them?

619
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,759
Are they on the shoe rack?

620
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,000
I looked, they're not there.

621
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,799
Call your mom and ask.

622
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,839
You didn't get the chopsticks.

623
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,240
Hold on a sec.

624
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:06,720
Boss.

625
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,720
We're getting ready for customers.

626
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,240
Bro, it's almost time for customers to arrive.

627
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,720
Why isn't Sister Jing here yet?

628
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,720
What are we supposed to do?

629
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,200
No, your sister-in-law has some family matters.

630
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
She went back to take care of it.

631
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,599
Isn't the restaurant just these few things?

632
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,960
Sister Jing usually handles everything.

633
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,920
Without her, we have no backbone.

634
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
Am I not here?

635
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,720
Go on, get busy.

636
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,559
Alright.

637
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,440
Let's all pick up the pace then.

638
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,160
Big Brother.

639
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:39,720
What's up?

640
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,240
What's wrong?

641
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,359
No, you sit down here first.

642
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,039
It's nothing, nothing.

643
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,599
What's wrong? What's wrong?

644
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,680
It's nothing, nothing, nothing.

645
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,480
It's fine, it's fine.

646
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,400
I accidentally broke it.

647
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,440
I'll clean it up, it'll be fine.

648
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,119
You scared me!

649
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Qiu'er, what's wrong?

650
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,920
Weiguo, that financial product of yours...

651
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,319
When do you estimate you'll buy it?

652
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,200
There are still some procedures being processed.

653
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,119
Soon, very soon.

654
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,920
I haven't even become Assistant Branch Manager yet,

655
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,680
and I already have a ton of tasks.

656
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
I'm not trying to pressure you.

657
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,039
When it's convenient, let's just...

658
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,480
be a bit more swift.

659
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,559
Okay, I got it.

660
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,200
Lao Tong, the boss is looking for you again.

661
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,720
The boss is looking for me again?

662
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,160
Liu Xing

663
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,519
Quick, quick, quick, have a seat.

664
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,160
Although your approval isn't official yet,

665
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,640
based on past practice,

666
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,759
this is a done deal.

667
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,920
So we need to get to work right now.

668
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,519
This is the bank's newly set

669
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,640
key performance indicators for next quarter.

670
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,880
Here, take a look.

671
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,480
How... how did it jump so much all at once?

672
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,759
Doing business is like rowing upstream.

673
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,279
If you don't advance, you fall behind.

674
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,359
We...

675
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,240
We didn't even meet last month's target.

676
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,839
That's exactly why we're bringing you up.

677
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,880
Otherwise, I'd just keep Xiao Jia, wouldn't I?

678
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,720
You really should have kept Xiao Jia.

679
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
No, it's just...

680
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,799
Everyone's already under a lot of pressure.

681
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,359
If you go by this,

682
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:29,400
I'm afraid everyone will have complaints.

683
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,920
Without pressure, a person is aimless.

684
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,640
Pressure is also motivation.

685
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Lao Tong, you're capable.

686
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,559
Motivate the team more.

687
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,400
You... I really think this is a bit unrealistic.

688
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,880
Look at how much it increased.

689
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,240
I think this... this...

690
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,160
This can't be done.

691
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,119
Aren't you cozying up to Director Qiu now?

692
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,400
Just keep going down that path.

693
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,599
That circle of close friends around her,

694
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,400
how you won over Director Qiu,

695
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,480
just keep doing that to win them over.

696
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,400
You really think highly of me.

697
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,920
Win over her circle of friends?

698
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,119
The whole group... it's a total wipeout.

699
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:09,359
Understood, got it.

700
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,599
And that wealthy relative of yours,

701
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,119
hurry them along.

702
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,799
Don't just make noise without action.

703
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,119
If you heard what I said, then you understand.

704
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,359
Lao Tong, why are the targets increased again?

705
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,640
It's simply impossible to meet.

706
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,400
Yes, yes, yes.

707
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,200
Brother Tong, I'm just not doing it anymore.

708
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,799
Look at me, I'm all messed up.

709
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,039
All messed up.

710
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,880
Brother Tong, how did you talk to the Vice President?

711
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,640
It's clearly impossible, isn't it?

712
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,119
Yes, yes, yes.

713
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,160
Right, last month's performance targets,

714
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,920
How are you talking to Brother Tong?

715
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,640
Aren't you just adding pressure for him?

716
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,400
Brother Tong definitely has a plan.

717
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,480
Anyway, I haven't paid this month's rent yet.

718
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,160
Right, right, right.

719
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,400
No, hey, hey, everyone, don't panic.

720
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
I... I understand all your concerns.

721
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,680
I... I'm also trying to figure something out.

722
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,039
I'm trying to figure something out too.

723
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,680
What's going on here?

724
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,160
I ordered the sauteed lamb in sauce.

725
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
What did you bring me?

726
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,240
Scallion lamb stir-fry.

727
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,400
How many times have I told you?

728
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
I don't eat scallions. I don't eat scallions!

729
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,440
Why can't you remember?

730
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,640
So sorry, sir.

731
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
We must have mixed up your order.

732
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,119
I'll change it for you right now.

733
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,400
And I'll give you half a Peking duck on the house.

734
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,160
How does that sound?

735
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,240
Please, calm down.

736
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,400
That's more like it.

737
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,920
Alright, hurry up and change it for him. Quick.

738
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:40,920
Okay.

739
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,920
Hurry, and don't mess it up this time.

740
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,559
Xiao Zhang.

741
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,920
What payment?

742
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,279
Thank you, thank you.

743
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,519
Come again, come again!

744
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,400
Take care.

745
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,920
Wait, these matters...

746
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,279
Doesn't your sister-in-law usually

747
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,559
handle the contact for those?

748
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,160
No, don't worry.

749
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,559
We won't shortchange you.

750
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,119
Here's what you do.

751
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,400
Send me that invoice.

752
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,440
I'll transfer you the money now.

753
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,000
No problem, no problem.

754
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,159
Alright then.

755
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,639
Does it really take this long to settle a bill?

756
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,119
Sorry, sorry, just a moment, please.

757
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,039
Such a big restaurant,

758
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,880
and you can't even issue a receipt?

759
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,679
Let me tell you something.

760
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,920
Don't give me excuses.

761
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,639
If you don't give me a receipt,

762
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,639
I'll call and report you right now.

763
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,159
No, no, no, miss.

764
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,119
Wh-what's going on?

765
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,679
We're out of receipts, boss.

766
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,400
Sister Jing usually applies for them.

767
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,559
I don't know how.

768
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,239
Miss, I'm so sorry.

769
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,119
We're having a bit of a situation at the shop today.

770
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,639
How about this?

771
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,400
Get a piece of paper and a pen.

772
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,239
Could you write down your company name

773
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,440
and your mailing address for me?

774
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,920
I'll mail it to you by express.

775
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,320
And then, for this bill,

776
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,679
I'll give you a twenty percent discount, okay?

777
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,400
Quick, get her a drink.

778
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:48,920
Alright.

779
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,639
Get an expensive one.

780
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,400
Thank you, miss.

781
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,920
Come again, come again!

782
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,440
Master.

783
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:53,920
What's up?

784
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,400
Why haven't we gotten paid yet?

785
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,119
Wasn't it supposed to be yesterday?

786
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,239
Yeah.

787
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,679
Usually, the mistress sends it out first thing.

788
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,320
You know my family situation.

789
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,880
Thank you, thank you.

790
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,280
I really need the money.

791
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,800
Sorry about this.

792
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,280
Right, it hasn't been sent, has it?

793
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,320
Here's what you do, I, I, I...

794
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,920
I'll... I'll transfer it to you right now.

795
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,000
Later, have your sister-in-law

796
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,119
handle the formal transfer for you, okay?

797
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,199
Thanks, Master. I'll go serve the duck now.

798
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:11,599
Alright, alright.

799
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,119
Go on, get back to work.

800
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,239
Where's my duck?

801
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:19,960
Sorry.

802
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,559
What are you doing here causing trouble?

803
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,199
Go back home and rest.

804
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:24,679
Go on, get out of here.

805
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,440
A bit lost without your wife around, huh?

806
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,280
Can't handle it all, can you?

807
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,800
It's okay. Just busy for a bit, that's all.

808
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,760
Waiter!

809
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,679
Coming!

810
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,400
When's my roast duck coming?

811
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,119
I've been waiting forever.

812
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,880
Alright, I'll hurry them up for you.

813
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,960
What about that customer's roast duck?

814
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,119
What's up?

815
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,039
Come here, let's talk.

816
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,800
Come on, sit, sit.

817
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,920
So, what did you want to talk about?

818
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,199
Ma Weiguo.

819
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,199
You're lying to us again, aren't you?

820
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,199
When will you ever tell the truth?

821
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,840
Brother Bao, that thing you asked me to check,

822
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,559
about the Harvard Cancer Research Center...

823
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,719
I've looked into it.

824
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,280
They don't have any

825
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,079
new technology for glioblastoma.

826
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
How can that be?

827
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,599
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

828
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,280
The person I asked was Mike,

829
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,559
Professor Zhou's assistant.

830
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,559
This guy even said,

831
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,719
if this new tech gets developed,

832
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,320
next year's Nobel Prize in Medicine

833
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,760
is a sure thing.

834
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,039
Ma Weiguo!

835
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,719
Ma Weiguo, get out here!

836
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:36,920
Uncle.

837
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,880
What did he do to upset you this time?

838
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,199
This jerk lied to us again.

839
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:45,360
You mean the Harvard Cancer Research Center,

840
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,320
the new technology thing, right?

841
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,960
What new technology? It's all fake.

842
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,159
You knew all along?

843
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,360
I know a fair bit about his condition.

844
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,599
A quick check showed it was fake.

845
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,440
Then why didn't you tell me sooner?

846
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,000
I was afraid you'd get worried again if I told you.

847
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,800
How can I not worry?

848
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,679
We all care about him so much,

849
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,360
and what does he do?

850
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,800
Hires an actor to fool us.

851
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,199
What was he thinking?

852
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,519
If he has the energy for that,

853
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,760
why doesn't he focus on getting better?

854
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:14,320
I know, I thought the same way at first.

855
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,519
But after this time,

856
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,239
let's not worry on his behalf.

857
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,800
There's a patient support group.

858
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,559
I learned about his situation in there.

859
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,719
His case isn't that unusual.

860
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,079
Some people don't want to burden their families.

861
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,119
Some are just angry with themselves.

862
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,840
And others just want to let things run their course

863
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,079
until the end of their lives.

864
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,559
I think the illness is his own.

865
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,519
Our worrying for him is useless.

866
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,039
It just makes everyone feel bad in the end,

867
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,960
and puts a lot of pressure on him.

868
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,039
So I think...

869
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,599
I think we should respect his choice.

870
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,199
She really

871
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,719
said that to you?

872
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,719
She sees things clearer than you do.

873
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,320
I didn't want to lie to you all either.

874
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,119
I just...

875
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:04,840
Alright, alright.

876
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,679
Don't say another word.

877
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,760
I'll just pretend I know nothing.

878
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:09,880
Lian Bao.

879
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,480
If I were you,

880
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,280
I'd find a way to live.

881
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,440
Even if there's only the tiniest bit of hope,

882
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,480
I wouldn't give up.

883
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,679
But I'm not you.

884
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,119
Right.

885
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,679
No one can make decisions for someone else.

886
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,719
Not even with good intentions.

887
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,159
So I don't agree with you.

888
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,639
But I respect you.

889
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,400
Jing'er.

890
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,719
Feifei, where's the toilet paper?

891
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,079
Let me look.

892
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,000
Hey, you used up the paper

893
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,159
and didn't put in a new roll?

894
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,679
Mom usually changes it.

895
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,159
I don't know where it is.

896
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,480
There isn't any.

897
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,400
Come on.

898
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,440
Then bring me some of the tissues from outside.

899
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,400
Tissues?

900
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,920
The tissues are gone too.

901
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,719
Then find me an old test paper.

902
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,360
Why is the power out?

903
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,079
Yeah, why's the power out?

904
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,360
Hey, hurry up and buy some electricity with your phone.

905
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,400
Okay.

906
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,960
Dad.

907
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:44,639
To buy electricity, you need to enter the user number.

908
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:46,320
Is it ten digits or thirteen?

909
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,159
Do you remember?

910
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,639
How would I remember? Your mom always does it.

911
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,360
Call your mom and ask.

912
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,760
I can't even stand up right now.

913
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,559
Ask your mom when she's coming back.

914
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:00,760
Okay.

915
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:02,800
I heard you.

916
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:06,400
Mom, how... how many more days are you staying out?

917
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,360
She says she needs to stay a few more days.

918
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,599
Get me an old test paper.

919
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,719
My old test papers...

920
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,920
I haven't finished checking the answers yet.

921
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,480
Fine.

922
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,880
Feifei.

923
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,599
Have you seen my razor?

924
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,559
Nope.

925
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:44,079
Have you seen my headphones?

926
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,199
Nope.

927
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,199
Check the clothes.

928
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,079
I was using them just yesterday.

929
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,159
Found them!

930
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,159
Hey, where do you think you're going?

931
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,920
Did you find them?

932
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:39,719
Not yet. I'm digging through this basket.

933
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,559
Were they expensive, those headphones?

934
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,119
Pretty expensive.

935
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:46,360
I was listening to them yesterday.

936
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,880
Wait, yesterday...

937
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,199
you were wearing these pants, right?

938
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,039
Yeah, weren't they washed?

939
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,119
Darn it, darn it, darn it!

940
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,239
You forgot to check the pockets!

941
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:01,239
I haven't done laundry in over ten years!

942
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,559
Try... try if they still... still work.

943
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,400
No, no, no.

944
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
This is bad, really bad.

945
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,960
Don't turn them on yet. Don't plug them in.

946
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,679
Uh, you know what?

947
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:15,159
First, dry them with a hairdryer.

948
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:15,599
Okay.

949
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,760
Dry them first.
