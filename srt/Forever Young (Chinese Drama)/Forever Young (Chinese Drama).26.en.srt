1
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,959
Wait, you yesterday...

2
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,239
...wore these pants, right?

3
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,079
Yeah, didn't they get washed?

4
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,200
Darn it, darn it, darn it.

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,400
You forgot to empty the pockets!

6
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,280
I haven't done laundry in over ten years!

7
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,640
Try it, see if it still... still works.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,480
No, no.

9
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
This won't do, won't do.

10
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,040
Don't turn it on yet, don't put the battery in.

11
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,760
You, uh...

12
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,239
...dry it with a hairdryer first.

13
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,680
Alright.

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,840
Dry it first.

15
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
Weiguo.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,719
Let me tell you.

17
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,039
You really have a way.

18
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,439
Sis, Big Bro isn't being stubborn anymore.

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,680
He keeps asking every day when you're coming back.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,080
So when should I go back?

21
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,240
Your big brother is so careless.

22
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,719
I've been away for days now.

23
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,680
I don't know how things are at home.

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,879
Don't worry, hold out a few more days.

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,960
Besides, I'm here.

26
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,680
Don't you worry.

27
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,439
Okay, I'll listen to you then.

28
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,800
Hanging up now.

29
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,319
Auntie.

30
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,319
Tongtong.

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,159
Haven't seen you in so long, I've missed you.

32
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,199
Where are you?

33
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,039
You're so sweet, remembering your auntie.

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,240
So, have you seen Feifei lately?

35
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,000
Feifei? Feifei's doing just fine.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,319
Where are you? I'll come find you.

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,240
Okay, good. Let's do that.

38
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,479
I grew up in this very alleyway.

39
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,159
I saw it last time I was here.

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,120
Dad.

41
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,960
Teacher Xiatian is here.

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,840
Teacher Xiatian.

43
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,960
Master Wang, something on your mind?

44
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,000
No.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,680
Just thinking about the shop's business.

46
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,199
What a coincidence.

47
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,199
I came today...

48
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,199
...to formally discuss a partnership with you.

49
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,240
Oh, right. Okay, let's go inside and talk.

50
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,159
Actually, here's an idea.

51
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,680
My third son...

52
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,479
...he's more skilled in this area.

53
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,719
You two should have a chat.

54
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,560
Feifei, quick.

55
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Take Teacher Xiatian inside.

56
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,719
Get some water, pour some tea.

57
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,759
Please, come inside, come inside.

58
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,680
This way, please, this way.

59
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,759
Mind the step.

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,000
Where are you going?

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm going to pick up your sister-in-law.

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
My life...

63
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,759
...can't keep being such a mess.

64
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
Fine, go find her then.

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,000
Be careful.

66
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,480
Dad, I called Jing'er...

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,160
...but she hasn't been answering.

68
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,279
Is, is she with you?

69
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,399
She left the day before yesterday.

70
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,279
What? Went where?

71
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,680
No, wait, hold on.

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,959
Alright, look, I'm coming over right now.

73
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,759
You wait for me at home.

74
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,199
What do you mean 'left'? Gone?

75
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,639
Auntie.

76
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,319
Have a seat.

77
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:10,920
Wow.

78
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,319
You look so beautiful, Auntie.

79
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,519
Completely different from before.

80
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,800
Well, a few days away for a makeover.

81
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,639
Really, it's a whole new you.

82
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,639
What would you like to drink?

83
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,800
An Americano.

84
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,519
Waiter, an Americano here, please.

85
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,160
Coming right up.

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,519
Does it look good?

87
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,120
Yes, very pretty.

88
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,240
So, Auntie, planning to go back?

89
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,800
Been away for several days.

90
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,639
Time to go back.

91
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,439
About time.

92
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,759
So, has Uncle Wang reflected enough?

93
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,600
He should have by now.

94
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,000
You know, Tongtong...

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,439
...when I was young...

96
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,240
...I'd often meet up with my girlfriends.

97
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,040
Have a coffee date for afternoon tea.

98
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,399
Go shopping, buy things.

99
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,920
What about my uncle then?

100
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,040
What did he like to do?

101
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,079
Him?

102
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,279
Back then, he was chasing me.

103
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,040
Just riding that beat-up motorcycle of his.

104
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,240
Wherever I went, he'd just hang around.

105
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,279
So annoying.

106
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,040
Such a show-off.

107
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,680
Yeah.

108
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,279
Later, I stopped drinking coffee too.

109
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,160
Not because the coffee wasn't good.

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,439
Mainly because your Uncle Wang has a weak stomach.

111
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,759
So I...

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
...switched to drinking tea with him.

113
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,439
Auntie, you sacrificed a lot for Uncle Wang.

114
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,000
I wouldn't call it sacrifice.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,240
After your Uncle Wang married me...

116
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,800
...he stopped playing in his band.

117
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,160
Stopped riding his motorcycle.

118
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,639
I never forced him.

119
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,680
When we were dating...

120
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,399
...we'd also call each other 'darling' this and 'darling' that.

121
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,600
Always on our lips.

122
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,680
But I don't know when it started...

123
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,279
...that 'darling' became 'Lao Wang' and 'Jing'er'.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,839
I've been thinking these past few days.

125
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,519
When it comes to living a life together...

126
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,160
...it really has to be this 'Lao Wang' and 'Jing'er'.

127
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,000
Right?

128
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,040
When two people are together...

129
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,800
...you can't just think about yourself.

130
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,240
You have to consider the other person too.

131
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,399
See?

132
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,319
He didn't force me...

133
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,360
...to not drink coffee.

134
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,399
And later, he didn't insist on living...

135
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,920
...his carefree life.

136
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,000
Right?

137
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,839
How's Feifei? He's fine.

138
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,240
Feifei is doing well.

139
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,079
Thank you.

140
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,839
Thanks.

141
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,879
But they've all been asking me about how you are.

142
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,680
Okay, hearing you say that, I understand now.

143
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,639
Come back with me.

144
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,360
What do you say?

145
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,040
Let's go back.

146
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,519
Let's go back.

147
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,480
I'm happy for you, Auntie.

148
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,639
This is Manager Zhou from the branch's HR department.

149
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,399
She's here specifically about your promotion.

150
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,720
Manager Zhou, this is Lao Tong.

151
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,959
Hello, hello, Manager Zhou.

152
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,360
Thank you for making the trip.

153
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,759
You look quite like the photo.

154
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,560
Yes, yes.

155
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,879
Photo?

156
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
The person in this photo is you, correct?

157
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,039
It's me, but...

158
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,679
Where did you get this photo?

159
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,960
We received an anonymous tip-off letter.

160
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,360
It accuses you of using improper methods

161
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,399
to acquire clients and illegally solicit deposits.

162
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,960
Impossible! No way!

163
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,240
That's not true, not true at all!

164
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,279
Let me explain this to you...

165
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,279
Ask Vice President Liu!

166
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,240
No matter how you explain it,

167
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,799
this photo is real, isn't it?

168
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,879
Yes, it's real.

169
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,639
Once this photo gets out

170
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,000
and falls into the hands of people with ulterior motives

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,080
who spin it a certain way,

172
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,200
the negative impact on our bank

173
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,480
would be immense.

174
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,799
Yes, it would definitely cause a bad... impact.

175
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,279
But that's not what happened!

176
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,279
Vice President Liu knows the whole story! You...

177
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,519
Vice President Liu, could you... Manager Zhou...

178
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,960
Could you... say something?

179
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,519
Vice President Liu?

180
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,399
Alright, you can leave now.

181
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,240
The leadership's decision

182
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
will be communicated to you later.

183
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,639
But... but...

184
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,000
Vice President Liu, you...

185
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,039
Please explain to her...

186
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,240
It's not like that!

187
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,799
You, don't get too anxious.

188
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,600
We will conduct further verification.

189
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,519
So you're still verifying, right?

190
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,039
Correct.

191
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,879
Please see the truth! See the truth!

192
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,240
This...

193
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,000
really needs to be clarified.

194
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,799
Don't worry, don't worry.

195
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,320
Please close the door for me.

196
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,799
Okay.

197
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,360
Door's closed.

198
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,279
Alright, let's talk about your issues.

199
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,600
Manager Zhou, he did this mess privately.

200
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,759
I... I had no knowledge of it at all!

201
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,879
No knowledge?

202
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,279
How can you be a leader if you were unaware?

203
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,600
The tip-off letter we received

204
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,639
tells a different story.

205
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,000
It says you not only knew about it,

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,360
but you also instructed Tong Qiu to do it proactively.

207
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,399
Slander!

208
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,320
Pure slander!

209
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,039
And your problems go far beyond this.

210
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,559
The letter also states

211
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,240
that you have long ignored actual conditions

212
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,840
to set excessively high KPI targets,

213
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,840
causing widespread complaints among frontline staff.

214
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,759
Furthermore,

215
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,639
you approved loans in violation of regulations

216
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,279
and accepted bribes privately.

217
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,879
After deliberation by the branch's senior leadership,

218
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,399
you are relieved of all your duties

219
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,919
pending an internal investigation.

220
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,320
Subsequently, we may refer the case to the public security organs

221
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,559
to pursue criminal liability.

222
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,200
You are expected to cooperate at that time.

223
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,919
Why are you back alone?

224
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,600
Your sister-in-law is missing.

225
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,639
What?

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,279
My father-in-law told me

227
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,200
that a couple of days ago,

228
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,000
she went out with a girlfriend to have fun.

229
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,519
Then I texted her, called her...

230
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,639
and she just stopped responding.

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
When was the last time you contacted her?

232
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,000
This morning.

233
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,240
This morning I asked her,

234
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,519
"When are you coming back?"

235
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,960
Then she said she'd be back in a couple of days.

236
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,759
After that, she went off the grid.

237
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,799
That shouldn't be.

238
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,559
Why is she improvising?

239
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,759
What do you mean, improvising?

240
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,320
I told her

241
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,200
to go stay at her parents' place for a couple of days.

242
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,759
But I didn't tell her to go out and have fun.

243
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,399
Wait, you told her to stay at her parents' for two days?

244
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,360
What's your deal? What do you mean?

245
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,960
Big brother, to tell you the truth,

246
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,600
she's angry with you.

247
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,399
Angry with me? What did I do to make her angry?

248
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Think about it yourself.

249
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What have you been doing lately?

250
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,600
What have I been doing?

251
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,399
Think about it.

252
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,080
I, I, I...

253
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,759
I've just been busy in the kitchen, right?

254
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,000
Then I work on my self-media account.

255
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,559
Right?

256
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,600
And then I hang out with you guys,

257
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
we chat together, right?

258
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,080
And also, I...

259
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,600
the collaboration I'm discussing with that Teacher Xiatian.

260
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,840
Anything else?

261
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,279
No, that's about it.

262
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,399
See? You listed so many things,

263
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,399
and not a single one involves sister-in-law.

264
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,519
Haven't you been neglecting her?

265
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,759
No, hasn't it always been like this?

266
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,639
How is that neglecting her?

267
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,039
You and Feifei,

268
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,799
working on that self-media account,

269
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,840
you think sister-in-law doesn't understand it,

270
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,919
so you have nothing to talk about with her.

271
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,840
And also,

272
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,320
I think maybe you're

273
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,039
paying too much attention to that Teacher Xiatian.

274
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,759
No, with Teacher Xiatian, we...

275
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,360
Is she jealous about that?

276
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,200
It's not about jealousy.

277
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,519
Then think again.

278
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,840
During this time sister-in-law has been gone,

279
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,399
how have you been feeling?

280
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,200
What have I been feeling?

281
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,519
I just feel like everything, at home and at the shop,

282
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,960
is all messed up, I tell you.

283
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,000
Usually,

284
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,840
you feel like sister-in-law doesn't do much,

285
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,080
but once she's gone,

286
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,320
neither home nor the shop runs smoothly, right?

287
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Big brother, honestly,

288
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,120
sister-in-law has done so much for you,

289
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,000
but you never make her feel seen.

290
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Tell me, how could she not be angry?

291
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,960
Is it sister-in-law?

292
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,679
What did she send?

293
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,799
I'm out having fun.

294
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,639
Don't keep calling me for no reason.

295
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,399
Isn't that infuriating?

296
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,559
And even sent a photo over.

297
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,720
Looks pretty happy.

298
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,519
Big brother, just relax.

299
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,759
Sis-in-law is a grown woman.

300
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,960
It's fine if she goes out for a couple days.

301
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,000
What do you mean 'fine'?

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,399
Let me talk to her.

303
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,759
Jing'er?

304
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,840
Well, if nothing's wrong, come back early.

305
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,960
Let's have a proper talk, okay?

306
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,000
Alright, big brother.

307
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,759
Don't worry.

308
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,399
Sis-in-law is a grown woman.

309
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,080
Playing for two days shouldn't be a problem.

310
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,399
Besides, she already sent a photo.

311
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,519
Don't worry about it.

312
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,080
Show her a little more concern.

313
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,480
No, the question is when is she coming back?

314
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,879
I don't know that.

315
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,480
How about this, send her a message.

316
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,440
See if she replies.

317
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,879
Just call her directly, give it a try.

318
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,639
She answered.

319
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,480
Hello? Sis-in-law?

320
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,279
Did you change your phone?

321
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:56,960
It's me, Weiguo.

322
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,639
Where are you?

323
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,639
In Sanya, right?

324
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,320
Okay, alright, alright, okay.

325
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,799
No, don't worry, I won't tell big brother.

326
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,840
No, what are you doing in Sanya?

327
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,240
Okay, that's it then.

328
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,159
Hello?

329
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,320
You're the one who took sis-in-law, right?

330
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,440
So clever.

331
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,759
What's the reason?

332
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,840
She's been trapped in her own little world for too long.

333
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,600
Wants to rebel a little.

334
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,759
But doesn't dare go too far.

335
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,360
I'm just lending her a little courage.

336
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,240
So how far can she go?

337
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,320
Don't know. That's up to her.

338
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,600
Oh, right. Lianbao told me.

339
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,799
About that fake doctor thing.

340
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,240
Thank you.

341
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,360
Thank me for what?

342
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,120
For helping you hide it from everyone?

343
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,879
Or for dragging my feet and not letting you get treated?

344
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,639
If exposing you would actually do any good,

345
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:30,240
I'd love to tell the whole world right now

346
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,320
about your lies.

347
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,120
Suit yourself.

348
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,879
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

349
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:39,840
Bye.

350
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,880
Jing'er.

351
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,519
Mom.

352
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,440
You're... you're back.

353
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:22,720
Uh...

354
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,599
I'll... I'll go throw this out.

355
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,839
Just put it in the fridge.

356
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,480
Jing'er.

357
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,599
Still mad?

358
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,279
I know.

359
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:45,960
That...

360
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,920
All these years, I...

361
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,279
Don't say it.

362
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,799
That... me and that Teacher Xiatian...

363
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,839
There's really nothing going on.

364
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,720
I just wanted her

365
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,240
to help promote Penglexuan.

366
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,079
Wang Chunsheng.

367
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,359
You really underestimate me.

368
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,839
Dinner's ready, it's in the pot.

369
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,240
Go ahead and eat.

370
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,960
Feifei.

371
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,160
You haven't changed clothes these past two days, have you?

372
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,759
Didn't your dad wash them for you?

373
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,039
Yeah.

374
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,000
Mom, where did you go this time?

375
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,599
Was it fun?

376
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,960
Did you take any nice photos?

377
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
It was okay.

378
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,000
Here.

379
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,480
Later on,

380
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,240
the three of us should go on a trip together.

381
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:55,119
It's been a long time since we went together.

382
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,839
Then we have to pick a place

383
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,240
that Mom likes to go to.

384
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,599
Right, right, right.

385
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,359
Let's go there.

386
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:02,720
Okay.

387
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,240
Great!

388
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,759
This... this dish smells amazing.

389
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:06,240
This...

390
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,640
Smells great.

391
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,119
Scrambled eggs.

392
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,559
Haven't had this in a long time.

393
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,039
You haven't been eating properly these past two days?

394
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,400
Didn't your dad cook for you?

395
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,039
He did.

396
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,039
But it's nowhere near as good as this, right?

397
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,480
Gotta eat three bowls of rice today.

398
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,359
Thanks.

399
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,359
Feifei, come on, have some meat.

400
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,759
Eat some of this meat.

401
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,880
Sir, how many in your party?

402
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
I'm waiting for someone.

403
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,720
Manager Dong.

404
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,799
You're exactly the kind of

405
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,200
exceptionally classy woman.

406
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,279
You flatter me, President Luo.

407
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,200
No, no, no, don't be awkward.

408
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,799
Come on, come on.

409
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,240
A toast to you.

410
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,039
Cheers.

411
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,000
President Luo, then we'll consider this matter settled.

412
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,319
I'll send you the contract later.

413
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:54,720
Sure.

414
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,559
To be honest with you,

415
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,119
the reason I'm willing to work with your company

416
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,119
is because of you.

417
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,200
Thank you, thank you.

418
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,119
You can rest assured.

419
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,440
I certainly won't let you down on my end.

420
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,559
I believe that.

421
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,559
Your watch is off, isn't it?

422
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,279
Come on, let me adjust it for you.

423
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,200
Let me adjust it.

424
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,759
Actually,

425
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,240
I wanted to tell you

426
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,519
I hope our cooperation

427
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,319
can be a bit closer.

428
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,400
You...

429
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,720
Oh, it's already this late.

430
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,799
Sorry, Director Luo.

431
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,599
I have something else to attend to.

432
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,599
I need to head out first.

433
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,039
I've already taken care of the bill.

434
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,079
Is it something urgent?

435
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,079
Yes, I have to pick up my kid from school.

436
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,119
You stay a while longer.

437
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:47,960
Picking up the kid is important.

438
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,240
Come on, I'll have my driver take you.

439
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,079
No, no, no.

440
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,880
No, I drove myself.

441
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,440
It's fine. If you're leaving,

442
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,599
what's the point of me sitting here alone?

443
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,240
Come on.

444
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,119
Anyway, Qianqian,

445
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,200
we had a pleasant chat today, right?

446
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,400
Yes, very pleasant.

447
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,039
But it feels a bit unfinished.

448
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,200
I'll find a place another time,

449
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,079
and we can have a proper chat, okay?

450
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,759
Where do you think you're putting your hand?

451
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:08,759
Are you out of your mind?

452
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,079
What? Who the hell are you?

453
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,200
Who am I? I'll smack you!

454
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,759
Li Lianbao!

455
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,440
You...

456
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,200
Are you insane or something?

457
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,559
Don't hold me back!

458
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,079
No...

459
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,039
No...

460
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,400
What are you doing?

461
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,920
What? Didn't you see that jerk had bad intentions?

462
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,720
Who are you calling a jerk?

463
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,839
I'm talking about you!

464
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:28,960
Look,

465
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,279
there are too many people here.

466
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,599
Let's go somewhere else to talk.

467
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,720
Let's go.

468
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,240
Say whatever you have to say right here.

469
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
I think it's necessary

470
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,279
for us to be clearer with each other.

471
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,799
What's unclear between us?

472
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,079
You knew perfectly well I was working, entertaining a client.

473
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,640
You got so worked up just now.

474
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,720
What were you trying to do?

475
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,920
Situations like this will happen a lot in the future.

476
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,880
So, every single time,

477
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,799
are you going to drag the guy out and beat him up?

478
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,680
Or do I have to have you watching me

479
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,920
every time I go out to work from now on?

480
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,119
I know

481
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,359
you've definitely encountered

482
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,359
this kind of thing more than once.

483
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,839
And I believe you have the ability

484
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,920
to handle people like that.

485
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,319
But when I see it, I can't stand it.

486
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,000
I can't bear to see the woman I love

487
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,279
being harassed like that by someone else.

488
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,079
Li Lianbao,

489
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,039
we're both adults.

490
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,359
Don't mix work and feelings together.

491
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,119
Okay?

492
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,599
And I made it perfectly clear to you before.

493
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,119
I don't want our relationship

494
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,039
to get too complicated.

495
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:42,319
Don't interfere with each other's work and life.

496
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,839
But now it seems

497
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,119
you simply can't do that.

498
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:45,839
No.

499
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
Isn't our relationship simple enough?

500
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,559
I was just acting out of concern and a desire to protect you.

501
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,039
Was I wrong for that?

502
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,079
What are you to me?

503
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,599
Fine.

504
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,160
I overthought it.

505
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,519
I'm sorry.

506
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,119
I have things to do.

507
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,880
Come in.

508
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,039
Come in.

509
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,359
See, the home really needs you.

510
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,119
It's much more comfortable with you here.

511
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,079
That's a really beautiful dress.

512
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,359
I've never seen this dress before.

513
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,640
I just bought it a couple of days ago.

514
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,480
Close the door and have a seat.

515
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,559
Look at this of mine...

516
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,880
Then this pillow of mine, I'll...

517
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:07,920
You haven't said a word all day.

518
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,880
For so many days, you've had no news either.

519
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,160
No, it's just... you're like this...

520
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,880
It's a bit scary, you know?

521
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,920
Is it really that scary?

522
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,839
No.

523
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,839
I thought you were going to... you know...

524
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,240
What?

525
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,599
I thought it was to...

526
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,279
...divorce me.

527
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,559
Divorce?

528
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,119
In your dreams.

529
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,440
I'll outlive you, I will.

530
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,440
Um...

531
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,039
Um... I'll put this here.

532
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:00,599
Put it there.

533
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:06,039
Actually, I've been thinking these past few days too. Really.

534
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:06,880
This... this...

535
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,480
This me...

536
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,000
I have my own problems.

537
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,240
And also, the way we've been living...

538
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,720
You know, these twenty-some years...

539
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:17,119
It's just been a bit too...

540
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,240
Right? Just being together all the time...

541
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,720
It's just... like left hand and right hand.

542
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,920
When other people say that...

543
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,160
I think it's really true.

544
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,680
We just coordinate so well...

545
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,480
But then...

546
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,720
You know, if one were really missing...

547
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,720
Right? It just... it just...

548
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,240
It feels completely lost and helpless.

549
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,680
I've also been thinking these past couple days.

550
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,240
Why did I let myself become...

551
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,920
...so unkempt?

552
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,000
Like an old housewife.

553
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,480
Alright, alright, you don't look like an old housewife at all.

554
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,039
Really.

555
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,720
Starting today...

556
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,480
Even when I sleep...

557
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,880
I have to look pretty.

558
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,000
Right, right, right. Pretty.

559
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
And also...

560
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,160
I...

561
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,240
I shouldn't place all my happiness...

562
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,519
...on you and our son.

563
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
My happiness should come from myself.

564
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,200
No, there's a bit of a problem with that, you know?

565
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,119
You should place your happiness...

566
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,559
...on us.

567
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,680
And I, I should also place my happiness...

568
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,119
...on you.

569
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,279
But neither of us should...

570
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,240
...place our happiness...

571
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,119
...on that little jerk.

572
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,839
He's about to take the college entrance exam, right?

573
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,119
He'll say "off to college" and be gone.

574
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,039
He'll leave us in the dust then.

575
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,680
He'll have his own life, right?

576
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,440
We should just ignore him.

577
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,559
We'll be happy on our own.

578
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,920
Let me tell you, starting today...

579
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,680
I... I looked up a famous quote, you know?

580
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,200
I think it's absolutely right.

581
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:47,279
It's about how a wife...

582
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,799
...I should treat like a lover.

583
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,880
Wang Chunsheng, let me tell you...

584
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,480
That Xiao Zhang from your department store...

585
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,799
And that whole string of things before...

586
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,559
You still haven't explained them clearly to me.

587
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,799
Look, look, look.

588
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,759
I bought you this.

589
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,039
This... this...

590
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,599
You always said not to buy you things.

591
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,480
But they say...

592
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,599
...even if you just buy some meat or something...

593
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,920
Take a look.

594
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Stop shaking it around.

595
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,880
Aren't you just wasting money again?

596
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,680
No, you... I think...

597
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,920
How much did this cost?

598
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,559
As a woman...

599
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,039
I believe you deserve to have this in your life.

600
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,680
Come on, come on, let me put it on you.

601
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,759
No, this...

602
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,000
Don't throw this box away later.

603
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
Look at the ring, not the box.

604
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,279
No, no.

605
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,920
Don't throw the box away, I'll use it for something else later.

606
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,119
This is really nice.

607
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,240
Yeah, it can even be a night light.

608
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,160
When you get up to use the bathroom or something.

609
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,039
How much was it?

610
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,039
Who cares how much?

611
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
I told you not to buy it.

612
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,160
Look at you...

613
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,000
You're always wasting money like this.

614
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,799
You... this, this, this...

615
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,240
No, no.

616
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
What do I earn money for?

617
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,880
Isn't it to buy you things?

618
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,359
When I go to work later...

619
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,039
I'll have to take it off.

620
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,039
What if I lose it?

621
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,240
What would we do then?

622
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,599
See, see? You... you're such a...

623
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,000
You just held it together for a little bit...

624
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,240
You're still destined for manual labor, I'm telling you.

625
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
This... this must be really expensive, right?

626
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,880
Annoying. Wasting money.

627
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,160
Do you like it?

628
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,079
This... you...

629
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,599
You... you...

630
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,200
Just say you like it, for goodness' sake.

631
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,119
No, I...

632
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,160
I'll even wear it to sleep.

633
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,960
Just don't lose it or anything later.

634
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,559
As long as you like it.

635
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Go to sleep.

636
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,599
Put the pillow down for me.

637
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,599
Who do you think you're ordering around?

638
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,759
Fine, fine, fine. I'll do it myself.

639
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,319
Myself, myself, myself.

640
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,000
Such a hard life.

641
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Hurry up.

642
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,759
Faster.

643
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,200
No, are you going to sleep with it on?

644
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,079
Let's take it off.

645
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,720
You... why do you talk so much?

646
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,400
You get in bed first. Turn off the light.

647
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,480
Get in.

648
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,200
Weiguo: five hundred thousand.

649
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,039
Manager Qiu's deposit commission: one hundred thousand.

650
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,640
Weiguo buying my shares: five hundred thousand.

651
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,279
Manager Qiu's deposit commission: one hundred thousand.

652
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,119
I still have less than one hundred ninety thousand myself.

653
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,160
It'll work. It'll work.

654
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,920
It'll work.

655
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,799
It'll work.

656
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,519
Alright then.

657
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,200
Great.

658
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,279
From now on...

659
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,480
Dong Qian is our official partner.

660
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,680
We're a family again.

661
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,400
Then let's have a pleasant cooperation from now on.

662
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,160
Pleasant cooperation.

663
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,759
Pleasant.

664
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,960
Good. From now on, it's a partnership.

665
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,519
Big Bro, I've got something else to do.

666
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,559
So I'll head off first.

667
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,000
Leaving?

668
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,279
Uh, see him out.

669
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,559
I'm off, Weiguo.

670
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:33,759
See him out.

671
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,279
No need, Big Bro.

672
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,160
I'll walk you out.

673
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,200
Really, it's fine.

674
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,200
Why are you two acting so weird?

675
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,000
What nonsense are you talking?

676
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,680
I've got things to do too, I'm off.

677
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,960
Sorry for asking you out on such short notice.

678
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,440
I just suddenly became very interested in some things.

679
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,039
I think you can give me the answers.

680
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,680
The reason you stirred up all that trouble...

681
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,799
...was to take Lianbao's shares...

682
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,440
...in Hive Tech, right?

683
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Or rather...

684
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
...the reason you were willing to invest in Pengle Xuan before...

685
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:19,599
...was for this.

686
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,319
Sorry.

687
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,400
That's a trade secret.

688
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,599
I can't tell you.

689
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,279
I don't know how important this Hive Tech...

690
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,039
...really is to you.

691
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,799
But I'll figure it out soon.

692
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,519
I hope you don't try any tricks.

693
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:35,519
Martin, you should think first...

694
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,799
...about how to live a little longer.

695
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,599
You worry about yourself first.

696
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,559
Lao Zhang.

697
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,160
I want to make a deal with you.

698
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,119
I can give up all my equity in Rice.

699
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,039
But you have to do me one last favor.

700
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,360
Kevin has invested in many new agricultural companies...

701
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,760
...in Southeast Asia and China these past two years.

702
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,639
And he's been in frequent contact...

703
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,119
...with various countries' agriculture ministries.

704
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,599
Hive is a company that makes entertainment-focused...

705
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,400
...wearable products.

706
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,320
I don't see any connection to agriculture.

707
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,000
Maybe you're overthinking it.

708
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,079
Alright, I'll think about it some more.

709
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,599
Naive.

710
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,199
You...

711
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,400
...don't reply to messages or answer calls.

712
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,119
I thought you were rejecting me again.

713
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,599
I was just on a call.

714
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,119
You finally took the initiative to ask me out.

715
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,119
Because I understood a saying.

716
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,519
"Only the fish knows if the water is warm or cold."

717
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,079
A lot of things in life are probably like that.

718
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,199
He didn't force me...

719
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,280
...to not drink this coffee.

720
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:07,280
Later, he didn't insist on living...

721
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
...his carefree life either.

722
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,480
When two people are together...

723
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,239
...you can't just think about yourself.

724
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,760
You have to consider the other person too.

725
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:15,800
Right?

726
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,360
So you were convinced by her just like that?

727
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,840
I wouldn't say I was convinced by her.

728
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,840
I figured it out myself.

729
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,360
Some of my own problems.

730
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,480
What problems?

731
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,840
I always say you're self-righteous...

732
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,000
...but actually, the self-righteous one is me.

733
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,960
I thought the onlooker sees most of the game.

734
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,000
But actually, with many things...

735
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,159
...only when you're in the situation yourself...

736
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,400
...do you know what the hardship is like.

737
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:46,719
Of course...

738
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,599
...it's quite easy to give advice to others.

739
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,840
But actually, I shouldn't have done that.

740
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,920
Of course, I definitely hope...

741
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,320
...you can have the surgery as soon as possible.

742
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,360
It's just that from now on...

743
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,719
...I won't...

744
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,920
...force my ideas onto you.

745
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,599
About that photography exhibition...

746
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
...can you help me contact some venues?

747
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,119
If the exhibition makes a profit...

748
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,400
...I can give you a cut.

749
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,400
What about that blond friend of yours?

750
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,800
Xiaoqi?

751
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:24,280
I don't know his name.

752
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,400
He went home to deal with other things.

753
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:32,920
Alright?

754
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,280
Alright.

755
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,760
After I finish handling things at the shop...

756
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,719
...I'll help you.

757
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,599
It's settled then.

758
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,199
Deal.

759
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,280
I will.

760
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,280
No going back on your word.

761
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:48,840
Okay.

762
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
The cold cucumber salad for table three is almost ready, right?

763
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,840
Almost ready, almost ready.

764
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,920
You scared me! What are you doing?

765
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,760
I'm busy!

766
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:36,320
I saw this from way over there...

767
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:38,239
...it's so shiny!

768
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,559
Really dazzling.

769
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:42,400
I'm telling you, my hand feels heavy wearing this.

770
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,719
You're just secretly pleased with yourself.

771
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,960
I'm always afraid it'll fall into a dish.

772
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Don't let a customer chew on it.

773
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,239
Food's coming up!

774
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,719
Cucumber salad.

775
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,400
Taking the cucumber salad over.

776
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,760
Thanks for the hard work, really.

777
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,440
What did I come here for?

778
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,480
All the dishes are here.

779
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,719
Big Bro.

780
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,719
If the flavor isn't to your liking, just let me know.

781
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:05,679
Sis-in-law, everything's okay now?

782
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,239
When was there ever a problem?

783
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,199
Right, your...

784
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:12,159
...how's that Harvard thing going?

785
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,559
Here we go again.

786
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,239
No, I'm applying for the visa right now.

787
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,159
What are you planning?

788
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,679
I'll go with you!

789
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:20,239
No, it's such a major surgery...

790
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,719
...and it's a new technology too.

791
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:23,239
I won't feel at ease if I don't go.

792
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,199
No need, Big Bro.

793
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,440
I'm a grown adult, it's not necessary.

794
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:27,199
What do you mean 'not necessary'?

795
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,039
Chef!

796
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,400
This plate...

797
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,679
Right, right, right.

798
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,119
Go attend to your work.

799
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,159
Listen to me, I'm telling you...

800
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,159
...we're settling it like this.

801
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:33,880
You hurry back and get some rest.

802
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,760
We'll talk later, we'll talk.

803
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,400
Don't you 'we'll talk later' me!

804
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,360
Coming, coming!

805
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,719
Plate!

806
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,639
Sis-in-law.

807
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,599
You and Big Bro are okay now?

808
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,440
That's good, really good.

809
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,039
You hurry, hurry back and rest.

810
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,199
You take care and rest.

811
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,719
You're positively glowing.

812
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,639
I'm off.

813
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:53,880
Get some good rest.

814
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,920
Uncle, I need to talk to you.

815
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,119
Close the door.

816
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:13,800
Okay.

817
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,639
Go ahead, what is it?

818
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:25,719
Never mind, you don't have to say it. I know.

819
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,679
You have a crush on someone, right?

820
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,559
Is it a classmate or an online friend?

821
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,119
Neither.

822
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,360
She's just a really pretty girl.

823
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:40,119
Uncle, when you like someone...

824
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,079
...should you tell her?

825
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,039
That depends.

826
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,440
But first, you need to be sure...

827
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,559
...if she likes you back.

828
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,440
I really can't be sure about that.

829
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,679
Then you should just tell her.

830
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,519
It's always better to say it than not.

831
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,159
So you won't regret it later.

832
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,280
However...

833
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,760
You need to be mentally prepared.

834
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,039
In case she rejects you...

835
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,159
...you have to be able to accept it.

836
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,360
That would be pretty awkward.

837
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,639
Her rejecting me is okay.

838
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,039
As long as she doesn't tell anyone.

839
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,199
Uncle, so...

840
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,480
Based on your experience...

841
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,280
...how should a guy confess to make a girl like it?

842
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,800
You're asking the wrong person.

843
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
Do you know why?

844
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,599
Why?

845
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,000
Your Third Uncle never needed to confess.

846
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,559
I get it.

847
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,079
That was back in my youth.

848
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,239
Then I'll go ask my dad.

849
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
Don't bother asking him.

850
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,679
He's washed up.

851
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,360
Go check it out.
