1
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,599
About Weiguo...

2
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,200
He doesn't seem right.

3
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,239
What's wrong with him?

4
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,079
He's wearing glasses.

5
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,120
It's like the doctor said,

6
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,439
something is pressing on his...

7
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,560
optic nerve.

8
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
It's pressing on the optic nerve.

9
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,400
So what do we do?

10
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,959
He won't even drink water.

11
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,120
Won't answer when spoken to.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,240
We have to help him.

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,719
Help him live to the end.

14
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,000
He needs to look like a person too.

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,080
We mustn't let him think

16
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,000
we see him as a patient.

17
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,639
Make him feel he's still a normal person.

18
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,520
Well...

19
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,439
Then you gotta tell those two brothers.

20
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,439
Talking about those two.

21
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,439
This one's hiding from trouble, right?

22
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,000
And the other says he's busy.

23
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,879
Spoiled rotten.

24
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,960
When you lecture me,

25
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,240
you're full of big talk.

26
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
But when trouble lands on *their* heads,

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,439
They're useless.

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,240
Every single one, they just can't handle it.

29
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,400
They just need a good beating.

30
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,240
Beat them? Can you even manage that now?

31
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,759
Same as before.

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,960
If there's really no other way,

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
then we'll do it my way.

34
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,000
Tomorrow at noon,

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,400
everyone meet at Weiguo's place.

36
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,240
Anyone who doesn't show up...

37
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,840
don't call me Big Brother anymore.

38
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:25,960
Hey, hey...

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,520
Don't be hasty.

40
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,560
Big Brother.

41
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,439
Alright.

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,439
So you all still recognize me as Big Brother?

43
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,680
You all came when I called.

44
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,639
Big Bro, what's that for?

45
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,080
What do you think it's for?

46
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,280
You're serious?

47
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,919
Ow! That hurts!

48
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,479
Oh, you know what pain is now?

49
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,479
Look at yourselves now.

50
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,919
Acting like you can't even go on living.

51
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,520
Right now,

52
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,039
Auntie is gone.

53
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,160
Uncle Tong isn't here anymore either.

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,720
The older generation isn't around to look after you.

55
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,959
Now I'm the eldest.

56
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,800
Starting today,

57
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
*I'll* look after you.

58
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,240
And I'll do it my way.

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Big Bro, I...

60
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,199
Shut your mouth!

61
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,279
It's not your turn yet.

62
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,839
Second Brother, get over here.

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,480
What for?

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,399
I'm hitting you, that's what for!

65
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Why?!

66
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,160
Why?

67
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,680
I told you our brothers had a problem,

68
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,800
to come back and discuss it with me.

69
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,839
You told me you were busy.

70
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,240
Busy with what?!

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,240
Is anything more important than our brothers?

72
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,040
Do I deserve to hit you?

73
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,399
Yes.

74
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,480
You, come here.

75
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Sit your ass down there.

76
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,600
Big Bro, actually...

77
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,720
Not your turn yet!

78
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,120
You shut your mouth!

79
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,600
Qiu'er, you come here.

80
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,720
Know why I'm hitting you?

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,600
Yes.

82
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,639
Xiao Jia bullied you.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,759
And all you know is how to hide.

84
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,360
You hide from your mom.

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
You hide from your wife.

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,480
Where else you gonna hide?

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,399
Get over here!

88
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,360
Go sit over there.

89
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,160
Weiguo, you get over here.

90
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,279
Bro, how about...

91
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,680
I take the beating for Weiguo.

92
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,560
I'll take Weiguo's beating, okay?

93
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,040
You take it for him? Can you really?

94
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,800
Let's see you try.

95
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,519
Come here.

96
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,480
Big Bro, I don't need it.

97
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,240
I'm fine.

98
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,959
You pretend all day long that you're fine!

99
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,160
You think I can't see through you?

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,720
I'm not pretending. I really am fine now.

101
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,120
I've decided to have the surgery.

102
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,120
Really.

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,920
I wanted to tell you as soon as you walked in,

104
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,600
but you didn't give me a chance.

105
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,759
You just started hitting people.

106
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
You just needed a good whack, you know that?

107
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,600
Big Bro, I was wrong.

108
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,839
I admit it.

109
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,519
Lately, my emotions have been all over the place.

110
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,279
But I've really made up my mind.

111
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,240
I'm fully determined.

112
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,319
I'm going to have this surgery.

113
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,560
I just haven't had the chance yet

114
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,879
to tell all of you.

115
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,839
Really, I've decided.

116
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,759
Don't be angry anymore.

117
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,920
Okay?

118
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,120
Let's focus on the surgery.

119
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,600
It's okay, Big Bro.

120
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,639
Alright then.

121
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,240
Sit down, sit, just sit first.

122
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,399
You sit down too.

123
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,360
Second Brother.

124
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Third Brother.

125
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,800
And me, your Big Brother.

126
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,480
Qiu'er is our brother.

127
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,360
He's been bullied.

128
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,399
What should we do?

129
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
We deal with him.

130
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,839
Let's go deal with him!

131
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,600
Let's go, go!

132
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,279
Qiu'er, you watch from the side. Let's go!

133
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,279
Go!

134
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,279
Where are you brothers off to?

135
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,240
You saw how pathetic Tong Qiu looked, right?

136
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,399
Hello, last four digits of your phone?

137
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,279
6066.

138
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,879
Okay, please fasten your seatbelt.

139
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,840
Bro.

140
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,159
I'll go in alone. I can handle it.

141
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,200
Okay?

142
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,440
No problem.

143
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,320
Jia Zhilong

144
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,440
What do you want?

145
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Following me?

146
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,480
I want to have a proper talk with you.

147
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,080
What do we have to talk about?

148
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,159
I know it was you who reported me, right?

149
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,159
Can you go to the bank and explain

150
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,039
this matter clearly to everyone?

151
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,840
If you do that, then we can

152
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,440
let bygones be bygones, okay?

153
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,519
Let bygones be bygones?

154
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,159
Can't make it out there anymore, huh?

155
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,279
Want to come back to the bank?

156
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,559
Fine.

157
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,120
Beg me.

158
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,399
My word carries weight at the bank now.

159
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,759
You beg me to put in a good word for you.

160
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,279
Not convinced, are you?

161
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Alright, hit me.

162
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:10,799
I don't dare.

163
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,559
It's so simple.

164
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,120
Either you beat me up,

165
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,519
or you beg me.

166
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,840
Qiu'er.

167
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,799
*You're* the one talking about letting bygones be bygones?

168
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,159
Here.

169
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,399
This video is you, right?

170
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,639
I'm not wronging you, am I?

171
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,360
*You* want to let bygones be bygones with *me*?

172
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,639
Beg me.

173
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,200
Beg me.

174
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,120
You beg me to delete this video,

175
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,720
and then I'll go plead for you at the bank.

176
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,440
Acting like a jerk, are you?

177
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,559
Qiu'er, are you insane?

178
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,919
You believe I'll call the police?

179
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,799
Go ahead, call them.

180
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,639
Call them.

181
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,799
Hurry up and call.

182
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,679
No phone, huh?

183
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,559
Use mine to call.

184
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,320
Here, use mine to call.

185
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,799
Explain everything clearly to the police.

186
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,399
Tell them exactly what's going on between us.

187
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,440
Do you think I want to go back to that bank?

188
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,159
Let me tell you, I'm not going back!

189
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,919
Come on, I'm telling you to call! Call!

190
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,679
No matter what,

191
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,440
no matter what it takes,

192
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,799
I have to let everyone know everything.

193
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,159
Let me tell you,

194
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,440
do you think I still want to work at the bank?

195
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,679
I quit!

196
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,559
Call, hurry up!

197
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,399
Call, call, call!

198
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,440
I don't dare.

199
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,639
I don't dare.

200
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,960
I really overestimated you before.

201
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,879
I kept giving you ground, step by step,

202
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,679
and you just kept pushing for more.

203
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,000
You just had to push your luck, didn't you?

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,039
Now you don't dare.

205
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,679
Afraid everyone will find out.

206
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,559
Alright, no problem.

207
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,559
I'm telling you,

208
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,039
I'll go investigate and gather evidence.

209
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,679
I will definitely submit this defense material.

210
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,879
I'll find all the evidence.

211
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,159
Then you can figure out what to do.

212
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,519
I'll buy you three phones.

213
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,000
What are you doing?

214
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,159
You think it's easy for me, don't you?

215
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,320
It's settled.

216
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,399
I'm heading out first.

217
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,000
Where are you going?

218
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,679
To find Xiaoshi.

219
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,879
This guy.

220
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,679
Leaving, huh?

221
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,399
Maybe you think I can't see reality clearly,

222
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,519
but actually, I see things clearer than many.

223
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Between people,

224
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,399
between matters, between feelings,

225
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,080
someone always has to make a concession.

226
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,519
Honey.

227
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,120
I know I've let you down a lot over the years.

228
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,039
I always hide in my own

229
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,559
comfort zone.

230
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,639
When I encounter problems, I hide.

231
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,519
I hide from problems.

232
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,120
Hiding became a habit for me.

233
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,159
You got used to it.

234
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,720
Everyone got used to it.

235
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,679
Sometimes, you know,

236
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,240
when I get drunk

237
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,519
and wake up the next morning,

238
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,000
I feel like

239
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,919
by hiding and hiding,

240
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,799
I'm about to hide even my comfort zone away.

241
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,720
So I just

242
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,639
lie flat.

243
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,879
I become a pile of mud,

244
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,159
letting people shape me however they want.

245
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,159
Whatever shape they mold me into, that's what I am.

246
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,120
And I'm okay with it.

247
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:50,799
But after being molded and molded,

248
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,879
I forgot what I used to be like.

249
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,759
I even forgot what I should be like now.

250
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,879
What should I be like?

251
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,879
Tell me, what should I be like?

252
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
But I want to thank Big Brother.

253
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,960
I want to thank you.

254
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,559
And I want to thank our baby.

255
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,120
It's you who made me realize

256
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,720
it's time for me to be strong.

257
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,399
It's time for me to change.

258
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,600
It's time for me to have responsibility.

259
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,480
Because I'm a father now.

260
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,879
I'm a father now.

261
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,240
Wife, believe in me one more time.

262
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,200
This time, I will definitely do it myself.

263
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,679
I'll personally mold myself,

264
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,559
even if in the end I'm molded

265
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,159
into a broken basin,

266
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,840
like a broken gourd,

267
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,440
I think I'll still have my own value.

268
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,600
I'll have my own proper shape, and I accept it.

269
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,000
I can't hide anymore.

270
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,480
I absolutely will not hide anymore.

271
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,879
In the past, I would

272
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,919
always feel tired,

273
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,200
want to escape,

274
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,720
not want to go on.

275
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,759
So I wanted everyone to wait a bit longer.

276
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,440
For you to wait.

277
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,480
For myself to wait.

278
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,319
But this time,

279
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,599
I don't want you to wait anymore.

280
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,200
My transfer request has been approved.

281
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,400
I'll be back in Beijing in a few days.

282
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,480
What about the director position?

283
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,759
I'll be promoted to director upon returning to Beijing.

284
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,160
That's really well written.

285
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:27,799
Without Manager Li,

286
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:30,119
my Honeycomb Tech might have been done for long ago.

287
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,880
During my most difficult time,

288
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,160
it was Old Li who lent a helping hand.

289
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,559
He helped us get through the tough times.

290
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,000
Of course, for Manager Li,

291
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,039
this might have been just a small effort,

292
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,599
but for Honeycomb Tech,

293
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,359
I don't know if this trick of yours

294
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,720
will actually work.

295
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,200
Let's give it a try.

296
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:49,920
He's not answering.

297
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,759
Still not answering.

298
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,000
Try calling again.

299
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,200
Alright, stop calling.

300
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,519
So this is the plan you came up with to talk me around?

301
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,880
I was out of ideas.

302
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,200
But you saw it.

303
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,880
Your colleagues and partners,

304
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
they're all very grateful to you.

305
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,640
Yeah.

306
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,799
Lianbao, all these years,

307
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,920
you've been quietly looking after the brothers.

308
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,319
I, as your Big Brother, thank you.

309
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,720
Second Brother.

310
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,880
All these years, you've always

311
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,119
always taken care of me.

312
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,400
And my dad and mom,

313
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,039
they've also received your care.

314
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,279
Your little brother thanks you.

315
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,240
Lianbao, when my dad passed,

316
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,880
you were the one who helped me through it.

317
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,960
All these years, I've owed you a thank you.

318
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,000
Thank you, Second Brother.

319
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,000
Thank you.

320
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,160
Actually, you're already very successful.

321
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,359
You don't need to prove anything more.

322
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah.

323
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,279
It's too late.

324
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,039
I've already met with Kevin.

325
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,119
I still don't get what you mean.

326
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,680
Isn't it simple enough to understand?

327
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,440
I admit defeat.

328
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,240
You'd actually admit defeat?

329
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,000
Lao Kai.

330
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,119
Don't think just because your Chinese is okay,

331
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,799
you actually understand the Chinese spirit.

332
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,000
I admit,

333
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,279
my ability right now is indeed inferior to yours.

334
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,960
But I can learn again.

335
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,160
When I've grown stronger in the future,

336
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,519
I'll take back what belongs to me.

337
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,000
It's just Ah Q spirit.

338
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,359
Spiritual victory.

339
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,359
No matter what you say,

340
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,920
I've already let go of some things now.

341
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,799
Oh, right.

342
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:31,960
And Yuanyuan.

343
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,880
I absolutely will not agree to her emigrating now.

344
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,200
When she wants to go in the future,

345
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,519
I'll go with her.

346
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,119
Aren't you just trying to scare people? That's what you're doing.

347
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,440
You guys don't know,

348
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,759
the other day I almost lost Yuanyuan.

349
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,400
It scared me to death.

350
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,519
Afterwards, I started thinking,

351
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,720
with all the trouble I've been causing,

352
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,119
was it really for Yuanyuan,

353
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,759
or was I just using Yuanyuan as an excuse?

354
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,680
Now I understand.

355
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,279
Causing all that mess,

356
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,000
and even neglecting Yuanyuan...

357
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,640
I'm just a total jerk.

358
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,640
Don't talk about yourself like that.

359
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,279
As long as you've realized it now,

360
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,720
then you're still a good dad.

361
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,480
That video was filmed by Qianqian, you know.

362
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,799
You should at least show some appreciation.

363
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,039
Thank you.

364
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,880
Perfect timing.

365
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,400
Come outside, I need to talk to you.

366
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,440
No, no, no.

367
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,039
Let's go outside.

368
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:29,720
Let's go outside.

369
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,279
Let's go outside.

370
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,200
Excuse us.

371
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
I was actually planning to find you today.

372
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,440
What for?

373
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,960
I really did write you a love letter back then.

374
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,160
I just didn't have the courage to give it to you.

375
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,640
Let me read it to you.

376
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,680
Dear Qianqian,

377
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I like you.

378
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,160
I believe you like me too.

379
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,519
Alright, alright, stop reading it.

380
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,920
I'm getting goosebumps listening to this.

381
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,160
Just keep listening.

382
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,160
When you were little, you were like a tomboy,

383
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,720
not cute at all.

384
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,240
You were also very proud,

385
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,519
pretentiously aloof.

386
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,519
Coming first in every exam,

387
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,880
really annoying.

388
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,200
Is this a love letter you're writing,

389
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,359
or are you insulting me?

390
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,920
Don't be impatient.

391
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,440
There's a big twist coming right up.

392
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,039
Later, I discovered you were very smart and driven,

393
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
understanding and considerate,

394
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,200
and I became captivated by you.

395
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,680
I wanted to confess to you

396
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,960
when I scored higher than you on a test.

397
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,640
Sadly, I never managed to beat you.

398
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,559
The enemy was too strong.

399
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,720
Then later,

400
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,240
we were both set for direct admission to Beihang University.

401
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,759
I was so excited.

402
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,240
I kept thinking,

403
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,359
on the day we stepped into Beihang's campus,

404
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,680
I would loudly tell you,

405
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,920
I like you.

406
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,680
Later, the direct admission didn't work out.

407
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,640
I was too embarrassed to give you this letter anymore.

408
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,480
Let me see, is that how it's written?

409
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,359
You aged this stationery yourself?

410
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,359
Pretty impressive.

411
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:25,720
No, you have no idea how much effort that took.

412
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Look, before, I was wrong.

413
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,440
My attitude was bad when you tried to advise me.

414
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,440
And that matter with Manager Luo, I overstepped.

415
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,680
I should have trusted your professional ability.

416
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,039
From now on, I'll follow your pace.

417
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,759
I promise not to make you angry.

418
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,279
Give me another chance.

419
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,880
I can't miss out on you again.

420
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,119
Okay.

421
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,039
If you don't agree,

422
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,079
I'll understand.

423
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,240
I promise I won't bother you anymore in the future.

424
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,079
What's this?

425
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,160
You're giving up already?

426
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,519
I'm just teasing you.

427
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,400
I knew you still cared about me.

428
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,480
What?

429
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,440
I'm telling you, it's not as simple as you think.

430
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,000
I still need to observe you some more.

431
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,759
Fine.

432
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,960
You can take your time observing me for the rest of my life.

433
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,440
Let go.

434
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,079
You're so annoying.

435
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,119
This one is way too ugly.

436
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,559
You scared me.

437
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,079
So, what do you think?

438
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,400
A face that could launch a thousand ships, right?

439
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,000
That's just a rumor going around.

440
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,960
I've thought it through.

441
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,599
Being a carpenter isn't right for me.

442
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,279
Let's plant flowers together.

443
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,599
Sunflowers?

444
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,640
Sure.

445
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
I told you before.

446
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Whatever you want to do in the future,

447
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,519
I'll be there with you.

448
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,640
But...

449
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,799
Could we plant a different kind of flower?

450
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,480
Because sunflowers take way too long to bloom.

451
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,400
No matter when they bloom,

452
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,960
we can wait for them slowly.

453
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,440
Will you wait for the flowers with me?

454
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:55,920
I will.

455
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:58,799
Thank you.

456
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,960
Food's here!

457
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,720
Smells amazing.

458
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
This is a feast.

459
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,440
Duck's here!

460
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,240
Drinks are here!

461
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,200
Put the drinks on the table.

462
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,920
Got it.

463
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,920
Dad, I'm getting up now.

464
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,480
Alright, thanks for the hard work, kid.

465
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,440
Where's Weiguo?

466
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,400
Coming!

467
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,359
Coming!

468
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,200
I bought soda for everyone.

469
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,960
This...

470
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,720
You silly kid.

471
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,200
What are you all...

472
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,440
Second Brother, drink, drink, drink!

473
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,119
Come on, come on.

474
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,200
Fine, I won't say a word.

475
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,599
That's more like it.

476
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,119
Bro.

477
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,720
Here, Qiu'er.

478
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,720
Qiu'er, give Shishi the soda to drink.

479
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,640
Sure thing.

480
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,960
Got a bottle opener?

481
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,599
Here you go, Qiu'er.

482
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,200
Thanks, bro. Thanks.

483
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,039
Wife.

484
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:45,720
Wife.

485
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,119
Second Brother and Second Sister-in-law should also make a toast.

486
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,720
Hold on, Second Brother and who?

487
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,279
Second Brother and Second Sister-in-law.

488
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,599
Second Sister-in-law.

489
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,880
Alright.

490
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,799
Later, Qianqian and I will do a linked-arm toast.

491
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,440
Okay?

492
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,359
Okay.

493
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,039
Who's doing a linked-arm toast with you?

494
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,160
Oh, right.

495
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,440
There's something I want to announce to everyone.

496
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,400
I've decided to have the surgery.

497
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,599
In the next couple of days.

498
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,359
Come on.

499
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,359
Come on.

500
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,440
Let's have a toast.

501
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,359
Come on, everyone.

502
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:18,880
Here.

503
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,279
Come on, let's all raise our glasses.

504
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,720
Come on, come on.

505
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,599
Smooth sailing.

506
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,480
Smooth sailing.

507
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,720
Smooth sailing, smooth sailing.

508
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,960
I especially want to thank Tongtong.

509
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,319
She's the one who gave me the courage.

510
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,599
Saying that...

511
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Just being polite for show.

512
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,759
Cheers.

513
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,440
So sweet.

514
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,200
Thank you.

515
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,039
Really...

516
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,160
Hey, Qiu'er, Xiaoshi.

517
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,680
Wishing you smooth sailing too.

518
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,160
Thanks, bro.

519
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,759
Thank you, Big Brother.

520
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,799
Come on, come on, all together.

521
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,119
Come on, together.

522
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,519
May everyone get better and better.

523
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,480
Better and better.

524
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,599
Hey, Feifei, you better study hard for your exams.

525
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,119
Okay.

526
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,000
Well then, I'll have one.

527
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,279
Less, pour less.

528
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,400
Someone's eager to drink, huh?

529
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,799
That's right, Sister-in-law, let me tell you.

530
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,960
You are so right.

531
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,799
Come on, come on, drink up!

532
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,559
Yes, yes, yes.

533
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,720
Hey, Big Brother,

534
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,319
you're not holding up well today.

535
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,079
Qiu'er!

536
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
You let it slip.

537
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,200
What's wrong with you, Tong Qiu?

538
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

539
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,799
Everyone has their own life.

540
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,480
Let me tell you,

541
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,599
Big Brother just threw up the drink again.

542
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,039
Don't drink with him anymore.

543
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:40,960
Stop drinking.

544
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,680
He'll puke on your faces in a minute.

545
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,359
Big Brother can't keep track over there.

546
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,759
Big Brother, don't fall asleep. Come on.

547
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:57,799
Chunsheng.

548
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,079
Hurry up and control Qianqian.

549
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,079
Since everyone's here, let's take a photo, okay?

550
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:08,920
Okay, okay, okay.

551
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,160
Let's all go over there.

552
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,519
You organize everyone.

553
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:16,359
Big Brother, you should sit down.

554
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,039
Maybe you should just sit.

555
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,160
Bro, sit down.

556
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,799
Okay, Big Brother?

557
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,200
Weiguo.

558
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,759
Here.

559
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,279
One, two.

560
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,759
Actually, actually, just act natural.

561
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:28,799
I'm just taking candid shots.

562
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,359
Two.

563
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,039
Three.

564
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
What are you sighing about?

565
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,559
Here, take it slow.

566
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,559
He might even need craniotomy.

567
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,240
You know what?

568
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,160
He's out.

569
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,480
Weiguo.

570
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,160
Relax, it's okay.

571
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:05,599
Don't worry.

572
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,400
Don't you worry.

573
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,160
Good people have heaven's favor.

574
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,480
Yes, yes, yes.

575
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,480
It's fine.

576
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,319
Get in the car.

577
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,039
Once he's treated, he'll be back.

578
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,160
We'll all be waiting for you.

579
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,960
Waiting for you to come back.

580
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,319
Take it easy now.

581
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,319
Easy does it.

582
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,039
Don't you fret.

583
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,319
Weiguo.

584
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,000
Don't worry.

585
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,640
Everything's alright.

586
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,440
Just take it easy, okay?

587
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,720
The soup.

588
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,240
We forgot the soup.

589
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,319
Family, please wait outside.

590
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:08,799
Mom.

591
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,960
I'm back.

592
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,599
Honey.

593
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,000
Making dumplings today.

594
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,799
Don't trouble yourself, I'll do it.

595
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,759
Smells good, right?

596
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,240
Mom's filling is so fragrant.

597
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,640
Pork and chives.

598
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,839
Mom.

599
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,880
I need to tell you something.

600
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,920
My, uh...

601
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,319
My appeal materials were confirmed.

602
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,640
They want me back at the bank.

603
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,519
That's wonderful news!

604
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,559
Well, that misunderstanding is cleared up.

605
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,359
And the knot in my heart is finally undone.

606
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,039
But I'm not planning to go back.

607
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,880
Why on earth not?

608
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,079
I've talked it over with Xiaoshi.

609
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,480
I want to finish writing my dad's script.

610
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,279
About my dad's script...

611
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:14,400
I don't want it to be left unfinished.

612
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,599
Don't you think so?

613
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,240
But if you don't go back to the bank...

614
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,519
Is that really okay?

615
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,359
Mom.

616
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,519
Qiu'er was always pushed along by others.

617
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,920
He never truly did what he wanted.

618
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,960
Now he's figured it out.

619
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,799
What he loved most as a kid was telling stories.

620
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,279
Let him take up Dad's mantle and write properly.

621
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,400
If your dad knew you were like this...

622
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,440
He'd be at peace too.

623
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,319
Look at you, talking and then...

624
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,880
Getting all emotional.

625
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,839
This is a good thing, Mom.

626
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,839
Right?

627
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,680
Isn't it?

628
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,719
Here, Xuanxuan.

629
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,599
This one, this one, this one's big!

630
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,599
It flew! It flew!

631
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,239
A few years back, Old Ma led a team to develop...

632
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,440
Motion capture and image tracking tech.

633
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,519
Recently, we made some improvements.

634
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,639
Quickly developed a product with lower cost...

635
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,559
And higher precision.

636
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,559
Cooperated with agriculture ministries worldwide...

637
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,800
And snatched a huge chunk of Kevin's orders.

638
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,199
Kevin's having a tough time now.

639
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,599
He's already agreed...

640
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:40,920
To buy back Penglexuan's shares at the original price.

641
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,360
And he keeps begging me...

642
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,079
To act as a bridge for you all.

643
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,199
He's behaving now.

644
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,159
Here it is! Here! Here!

645
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,679
Daddy, come play with us!

646
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,039
Come on!

647
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,320
Coming!

648
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
I gotta go.

649
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,039
Didn't shake any out.

650
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,440
None came out.

651
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,679
I want to poke it! Poke!

652
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,480
Don't you hold it!

653
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,599
You can blow bubbles!

654
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,440
Let Uncle make you lots and lots.

655
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,599
So many!

656
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,920
So very many!

657
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
There's no wind now.

658
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,639
Do you even know how?

659
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,599
You got it all over your head.

660
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,119
*With bamboo staff and straw sandals, lighter than a horse...*

661
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,840
*In the scent of rice blossoms, we speak of a bountiful year.*

662
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,760
*This period of time will be deeply etched in my heart.*

663
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,719
*Here,*

664
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:48,639
*I touched the most ordinary,*

665
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,800
Yet most vivid, the fireworks of human life.

666
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,320
*I met the most genuine,*

667
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,360
*And most sincere friendships in the world.*

668
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:15,079
*I've seen the cowardly who still choose courage,*

669
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,840
*Answering the distant call with their footsteps.*

670
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,079
*He chooses bravery,*

671
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,880
*Not because fear is gone,*

672
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,840
*But by carrying that clear,*

673
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:27,599
*Trembling fear,*

674
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,519
*Step by step,*

675
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,960
*Walking towards a self,*

676
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,559
*And a distant place never before reached.*

677
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,400
*I've seen those bearing heavy burdens,*

678
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,000
*Yet walking with calm composure,*

679
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:24,119
*Gently reconciling with their ordinary selves in their stubbornness.*

680
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,960
*He too once resented the ordinariness of fate,*

681
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,679
*Wanting to live as someone extraordinary in others' eyes.*

682
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,840
*Until one dusk,*

683
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,199
*He finally understood,*

684
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,960
*That true reconciliation*

685
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,199
*Is not surrender,*

686
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,519
*But seeing clearly one's own limits,*

687
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:39,960
*And then gently*

688
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,679
*Embracing that imperfect self.*

689
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,880
*I've seen those with eternally blazing eyes,*

690
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,280
*Full of energy,*

691
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,119
*Becoming a shore others can lean on.*

692
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,320
*Their palms*

693
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,760
*May not always be warm,*

694
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,039
*Yet always, at the crucial moment,*

695
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,880
*Offer the most solid strength.*

696
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,599
From them

697
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,199
I glimpsed life's truest, grandest expanse

698
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,960
The greatest endeavor in this world

699
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,719
is none other than living well

700
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,400
Living bravely

701
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:23,840
Living diligently

702
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,559
Eyes fixed straight ahead toward life's end

703
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:28,960
and rushing toward it with abandon

704
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,840
Thus

705
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,039
I feel a happiness like never before

706
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,079
This happiness

707
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,960
comes not just from the fullness of each second lived

708
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:40,320
but more so because within my life

709
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,840
now resides a lasting hope

710
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,480
a person worth waiting for

711
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,360
See you tomorrow

712
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,320
See you tomorrow

713
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,800
What now?

714
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,960
Weren't you going to see the doctor?

715
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,719
I'm not going

716
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,960
Why won't you give up?

717
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,320
If you're still alive

718
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:58,559
If you can wake up

719
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:01,039
If you've forgotten everything

720
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,239
then you must remember these few things

721
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:06,760
Never underestimate a man

722
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,320
who reeks of duck grease

723
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:11,000
Because within that smell of duck grease

724
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,719
lies

725
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:13,760
not just the responsibilities of a father

726
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,400
a husband

727
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,920
and a Big Brother

728
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,800
but also the dream and tenacity

729
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,159
to make a roast duck soar to the sky

730
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,079
Never mock a single father with a daughter

731
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:27,239
because he'll do something even crazier

732
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,960
until you shut up

733
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,239
Never let a fence-sitting yes-man

734
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,920
grow into a great tree

735
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,079
because when the storm comes

736
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,239
he's tougher than any tree

737
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,559
Remember

738
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,199
the wooden frame's dimensions are

739
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,599
thirty-six by forty-six

740
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,480
Don't ask why

741
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,239
because a female artist once said

742
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,039
"Negative space is eternal"

743
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,280
And there's a reckless boy

744
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,840
remember not to teach him how to do things

745
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,840
because the choices he makes himself

746
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,559

747
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,400
Oh, right

748
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,880
If you see an old screenwriter with a worried face

749
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:08,719
remember to tell him

750
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,840
there's a mission we shouldn't forget

751
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,000
To be born human

752
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,960
is not to endure suffering and misfortune

753
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,920
but to seek happiness
