1
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,519
I think we should stop this, Second Brother.

2
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,159
Look at Weiguo.

3
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,560
He's such a sincere guy.

4
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,640
I want to see how long he can keep this up.

5
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,959
Fine, you guys can fight all you want.

6
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,959
I just have one request.

7
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,359
Don't ruin my deal, okay?

8
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,280
Go on, get out of here.

9
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,960
Hey, whose side are you on now?

10
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,560
I think you're in a dangerous position.

11
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,639
Do you want to help Ma Weiguo

12
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,400
deal with us, is that it?

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,240
No, I don't, Brother.

14
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,680
Traitors don't end well, you know that?

15
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,879
I'm not a traitor, Brother.

16
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,520
Shut up.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
After I drive Ma Weiguo away,

18
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,599
I'll deal with you back home.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,599
Deal with me? Why would you deal with me?

20
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,560
Let's go.

21
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,639
Listen, Boss Ma.

22
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,280
This place is indeed a bit expensive.

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,599
If you're having difficulties,

24
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,879
don't force yourself.

25
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,599
Alright, stop messing around.

26
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,280
Qiu'er.

27
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,400
You've seen quite a few houses these past days.

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,319
Give us your opinion.

29
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,159
We're all smart people here.

30
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,120
I'll speak frankly.

31
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,520
I know exactly

32
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,479
what you're thinking.

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,919
And don't take us to see

34
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,319
any more fancy villas.

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,199
I think this one is acceptable.

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
If you agree, I'll pay in full.

37
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,599
If you don't think it's good,

38
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,439
then let's forget this whole thing.

39
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,719
No, no, no, wait!

40
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,879
This must cost over twenty million.

41
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,360
Some people just can't stand

42
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,199
seeing you get such a huge benefit.

43
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,919
Don't listen to him, Qiu'er.

44
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,960
He's trying to drive a wedge between us.

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Qiu'er, stand up straight.

46
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,159
If you let him use this money

47
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,120
to knock you down,

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,879
you'll never be able to stand tall again.

49
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,080
My back's never been straight, Brother.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,120
Make up your mind, be decisive.

51
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Twenty million.

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
I can give it to someone else just as easily.

53
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,080
If you don't want it, I'll give it to someone else.

54
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,560
No, no, no, don't!

55
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,919
Let's do it.

56
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,520
This is the one.

57
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,159
It's really quite good.

58
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,120
I want this house.

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,520
I think it's great, really.

60
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,479
Don't try to stop me.

61
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,919
I'll get mad at anyone who tries.

62
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,560
That's it.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,159
The door's over here.

64
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:56,240
Why did my dad hide it so well?

65
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,919
Found it.

66
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,319
What is this thing?

67
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,360
It's a good thing!

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,120
Sis, we need to go to your room to look at this.

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,560
It's not good if my dad sees it.

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,399
Come on, hurry up.

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,199
Weiguo.

72
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,240
I'll go back and have my parents move out.

73
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,399
I promise to vacate the house for you.

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,199
I'll clean it up spotless for you.

75
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,079
So you can live comfortably.

76
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,600
Or how about I come over every noon and evening

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,839
to cook for you?

78
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,720
You living alone,

79
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,360
all these miscellaneous chores

80
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,199
aren't suitable for you to do yourself.

81
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,920
Quit your job.

82
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,439
Quit your job,

83
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,800
and when Auntie moves in,

84
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,000
you can take good care of her.

85
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,519
You can even learn some acupuncture or massage.

86
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,800
Auntie could use that anytime.

87
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,600
Taking care of Auntie is no problem.

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,360
But my job, I...

89
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,560
I'll give you a sum of money.

90
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,720
Consider it your salary, okay?

91
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,920
Is five hundred thousand a year enough?

92
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,279
Weiguo.

93
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,480
My mom is also free.

94
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,120
How about both of us come work for you?

95
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,480
Count it as two salaries.

96
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,199
Or one and a half is fine too.

97
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,639
Get down here, get down!

98
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,279
I mean, why are you being so servile?

99
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,560
Can't you see?

100
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,439
He's using money to humiliate you.

101
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,319
And you're groveling. Isn't it shameful?

102
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,959
How is it humiliating me?

103
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,920
I think it's great.

104
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,639
I... I need money right now.

105
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,839
My dad's treatment costs money, right?

106
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,639
Xiaoshi having a baby costs money, right?

107
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,000
Me getting a bigger house costs money, right?

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can't get promoted now, I have no money.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,439
I wish someone would humiliate me with money.

110
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,800
Go ahead and humiliate me.

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,000
I feel ashamed just being with you.

112
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,000
What's wrong with that?

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,720
It's easy for you all to talk.

114
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,279
Big Brother, you have a huge roast duck restaurant.

115
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,920
You won't starve even if you do nothing.

116
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
Second Brother, you...

117
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,959
You have so many apartments inside the Third and Fourth Ring Roads.

118
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,240
And me? I have nothing.

119
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,959
This is an opportunity.

120
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,040
I have to seize it.

121
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,000
Is this an opportunity?

122
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,639
It's a trap.

123
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,519
Don't look at me, I can't be bothered to lecture you.

124
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,720
Alright then, let me say one more thing.

125
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
I... I think Weiguo is a good person.

126
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,160
He came back and helped me

127
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,920
solve this urgent problem.

128
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,600
Without a second thought,

129
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,959
he settled the house matter for me.

130
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,560
Let me say something unpleasant too.

131
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Big Brother, Second Brother, tell me.

132
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,079
We've known each other for almost forty years.

133
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,439
You... you've never thought about

134
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,680
helping me with this, have you?

135
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,040
From now on, when you go out,

136
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,480
don't say you're my brother.

137
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,079
Hey, why are you getting angry again?

138
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,199
I... I didn't mean it that way.

139
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,120
Cut the crap.

140
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
Get that guy down from there.

141
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
I... I... I really... I...

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,560
Wait.

143
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,040
Ma Weiguo, get down!

144
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,560
I really...

145
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,920
Brother.

146
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:53,920
I...

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,199
Weiguo, what are you doing?

148
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:10,759
This...

149
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,519
Welcome

150
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,439
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

151
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,120
This is...

152
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,360
Is this the four of them?

153
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,240
Yeah, look.

154
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,600
The one with long hair is...

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,040
So cool.

156
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,519
That's my dad.

157
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,720
This is Uncle Wang.

158
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,839
He was pretty flashy back in the day too.

159
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,279
Long hair, and wearing sunglasses.

160
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
Let me see.

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,319
Who's this?

162
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,040
This little... this kid is...

163
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,600
Uncle Qiu.

164
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,279
Uncle Qiu.

165
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,519
So charming.

166
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,759
And with two girls.

167
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,079
But still pretty cool.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,720
This is a gift for you.

169
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,800
He even gave a gift.

170
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,319
That's nice.

171
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,160
What are you looking at?

172
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,920
Let me see.

173
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,439
My dear Tong Qiu,

174
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,279
you are the handsomest guy in our alley.

175
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,159
I was just afraid Big Brother and Second Brother

176
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,519
would mess this up for me.

177
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,519
Ma Weiguo is still the most domineering.

178
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,679
He didn't even blink.

179
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,039
He just agreed to it.

180
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,679
Let me interview you three.

181
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,360
Why aren't you excited?

182
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,840
We're about to live in a villa.

183
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,039
A detached one.

184
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:03,399
Why is Ma Weiguo giving you a villa?

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
This sounds fishy to me.

186
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,360
Mom, just relax.

187
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,559
He wants me to take care of Auntie in her old age.

188
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,840
You dare ask for a villa for such a small thing?

189
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,600
Ma Weiguo and I have been friends for so many years.

190
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,679
Don't you know how deep our friendship is?

191
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,960
Food handed out in contempt will give you a stomachache.

192
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,840
What's wrong with you three?

193
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,840
Dad.

194
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,159
Could you please not get angry first?

195
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,519
I get it.

196
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,960
Are you afraid you won't get used to living in a villa?

197
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,799
Can't we just try it out first?

198
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,519
If it really doesn't work out, we can sell the villa later.

199
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,799
It's worth tens of millions.

200
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,519
We can lie down sideways, lie down lengthwise...

201
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,120
What difference does it make how we lie down?

202
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,799
So what if I didn't get promoted?

203
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll even quit my job then.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,399
I'm done.

205
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,000
What?

206
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,480
So you didn't get promoted after all?

207
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,919
You lied to us.

208
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,080
No, no, no, no, no.

209
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,399
Alright.

210
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,720
Dad, Mom.

211
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't get angry yet.

212
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,519
I, I, I admit it.

213
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,879
I did lie to you before.

214
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,440
But I meant well.

215
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,000
I apologize, I apologize.

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,240
But that doesn't matter now.

217
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,799
Dad.

218
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,519
Then you can use the best medicine.

219
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,720
Take as much as you want.

220
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,039
Don't hold back at all.

221
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,720
Mom.

222
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,120
You've worked hard all these years.

223
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,279
We'll hire a maid for you then.

224
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,840
You can rest properly and enjoy life.

225
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,279
Wife.

226
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,320
Let's not go to Xi'an.

227
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,080
If necessary, we'll quit that job.

228
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,240
We'll just stay home peacefully.

229
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,320
Focus on having a baby.

230
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,200
This guy is going crazy.

231
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,200
You stop right there, stop!

232
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,000
Stop!

233
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,759
You brat!

234
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,799
Look at your sorry self.

235
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,879
You were almost kneeling to him.

236
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,120
Your legs went weak over a villa.

237
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,200
What did I teach you when you were little?

238
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,960
Did you study all those years for nothing?

239
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,480
Enough.

240
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,120
You... you...

241
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,960
Fine, you didn't get promoted.

242
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,720
Why did you lie to us?

243
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,200
Yes, not getting promoted was my fault.

244
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,679
But we have a villa now.

245
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,440
Is getting promoted really that important?

246
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,200
Even a small thing like a promotion...

247
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,679
...is earned by your own ability.

248
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,679
So what?

249
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,840
Shouldn't you take care of Auntie?

250
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,279
How dare you ask for his villa?

251
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,159
Come on, come on.

252
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Come, come.

253
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,080
Go take a piss, take a piss...

254
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,879
...and take a look, take a look...

255
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,840
...see what kind of person you are!

256
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,039
You're going to be the death of me.

257
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,720
Alright, alright.

258
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,360
Be careful, you're still sick.

259
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,799
You really are...

260
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,559
Sick? Then just die from it.

261
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,639
Stop the medicine, I won't take it.

262
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,120
Dad.

263
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,639
You...

264
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,240
I'm so angry.

265
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,399
See?

266
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,799
The family finally gets together for a meal...

267
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,519
Alright, I'll go talk to your dad.

268
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,279
You didn't even back me up.

269
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,120
What could I say?

270
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,519
You shouldn't have lied in the first place.

271
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,799
How long can you keep this up?

272
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,440
Yeah, every moment I can hide it is a win.

273
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,279
My dear, don't be angry.

274
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,759
We're about to live in a big villa.

275
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,440
Our living situation...

276
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,759
...is about to be solved, isn't it?

277
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,679
Have you ever thought...

278
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,639
...that when I said I wanted a villa,

279
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,120
I meant through our own hard work.

280
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,399
Not through someone else's charity.

281
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,159
Yes, yes, yes.

282
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,960
But Weiguo isn't just "someone else."

283
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
It's not that I'm not trying.

284
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,559
I just don't want to play those dirty games.

285
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,279
You have no idea...

286
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,200
...the filthy stuff involved in promotions.

287
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,519
I can't even be bothered to talk about it.

288
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,320
You talk as if I've never had a job.

289
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,679
So, my promotion and raise in Xi'an...

290
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,039
...were also through dirty means, right?

291
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,960
No, no, that's not what I meant.

292
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,639
Here you are.

293
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,360
Uncle Wang.

294
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,120
What can I get you?

295
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,080
I need to get some water.

296
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,159
Can you carry it?

297
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:36,799
Yes.

298
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,039
I really didn't mean it that way.

299
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,639
I... I just think that right now...

300
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,159
...improving our life is more important.

301
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,120
I don't think you've grasped...

302
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,559
...the main point at all.

303
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,879
Yes, yes, we'll figure it out slowly.

304
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,759
Don't worry about it. Go pay.

305
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,960
So I'm wrong again, huh?

306
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,679
Young couple having a spat?

307
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,879
N-no, we're fine.

308
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,679
Here you go, here you go.

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,799
Uncle Wang.

310
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,000
Sometimes I'm just so tired.

311
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,360
Some people haven't even clocked out by 3 a.m.

312
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,879
Some are already at work by 5 a.m.

313
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,720
East, west, south, north, from the 4th to the 6th ring road.

314
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,600
Boss Wang from Yanjiao.

315
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,960
Lucy from Tiantongyuan.

316
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,440
Vivian from Tongzhou.

317
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,399
Andy from Yizhuang.

318
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,639
Who isn't squeezing onto the subway...

319
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,960
...for two hours at dawn to get to work?

320
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,480
Who doesn't want to conquer the world?

321
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,279
Tong Qiu.

322
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,039
What are you drinking?

323
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,720
Dayao.

324
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,840
Have some lemon water.

325
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,159
Thanks, sis.

326
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,960
Tongtong, have some too.

327
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,399
Okay.

328
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,679
Oh, right, sis.

329
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,360
I have a client who's an agent for this brand.

330
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,480
They have an employee discount.

331
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,320
I got one for each of you.

332
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,679
You two have a lot of expenses right now.

333
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,559
No, don't get one for me.

334
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:41,799
Is it pretty?

335
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,000
Thanks, Auntie. I like this one.

336
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,039
It's with the discount, not expensive.

337
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:48,879
Take a look.

338
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,519
I love you so much, Auntie!

339
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,600
I like this one.

340
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,159
It's pretty.

341
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:54,799
Look at this.

342
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,440
Sis, try it on.

343
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,679
Alright, let me just look at it first.

344
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,600
This... this is too, too expensive.

345
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,919
It's not for someone like me.

346
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,600
Sis, just try it on.

347
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,600
I bet it'll look great on you.

348
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,120
Try it, Auntie. See how it looks.

349
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,720
Come on.

350
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,840
See? Pretty, right?

351
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,720
Pretty.

352
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,559
It looks good, Auntie.

353
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,159
Really pretty.

354
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:22,960
It suits you so well.

355
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
Look at this fabric. You can tell...

356
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,639
...you can tell it's too expensive.

357
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,519
I work every day.

358
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,720
If I get oil on it, it'll be hard to wash.

359
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,440
What I wear now is fine, practical for work.

360
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,519
I'd have no chance to wear it.

361
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,960
You haven't seen...

362
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,000
...your aunt's photos from when she was young.

363
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,919
Full of floral dresses and such.

364
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,360
So stylish and beautiful.

365
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,240
Really? I want to see the photos too.

366
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
Everyone was young once.

367
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,200
And she wasn't even showing off.

368
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,279
Sis, just take it.

369
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,679
We'll go out together sometime.

370
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,919
You'll have a chance to wear it.

371
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,519
Yeah, wear it for Uncle Wang then.

372
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,840
I guarantee he'll be head over heels.

373
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,279
Who has time to charm him?

374
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,600
We're an old married couple.

375
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,279
With his smell of duck grease all over...

376
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,600
...I don't even want to smell it.

377
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
And he can't be bothered to look at me.

378
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,919
If I put this on...

379
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,159
...I might scare him.

380
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,799
He'll think I did something wrong.

381
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,720
That wouldn't happen.

382
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,360
It really is pretty.

383
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,519
You startled me.

384
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,519
Does it look good?

385
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,840
Y-yes, good.

386
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,799
Xiaoshi gave it to me.

387
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,720
I was just thinking...

388
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,159
...I don't usually wear things like this.

389
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,320
Maybe I should give it back.

390
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,120
Then give it back.

391
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,000
You'd really give it back just because I said so?

392
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,120
Then keep it.

393
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,000
No, you...

394
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,200
Look. Does it look good or not?

395
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,519
Tell the truth. Think before you speak.

396
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:51,960
This...

397
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,200
Tell. The. Truth.

398
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:57,759
This...

399
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,039
Think carefully before you speak.

400
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,039
No, I think this dress...

401
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,559
Wh-what about it?

402
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
...kinda looks like...

403
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,680
Wang Chunsheng, I'm warning you.

404
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,440
If you say I look like a foot-washing, cupping therapist...

405
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,519
...I'll tell Xiaoshi right now.

406
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,400
Your big brother said...

407
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,559
...this dress makes you look like a foot-washing, cupping therapist.

408
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,599
No, but you... you...

409
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,400
Weren't you the one who said to give it back?

410
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,240
Why would I give it back? I...

411
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,960
No, are you all crazy? Darn it.

412
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,039
Who's crazy? Who's crazy here?

413
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,000
Look at me. Do I look good?

414
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,519
I'm going to pick up Feifei.

415
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,000
Boring

416
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,319
Isn't school over?

417
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,039
I'm picking up my son, not a bad guy.

418
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,640
Coming, coming.

419
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:50,720
Alright.

420
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,359
Tough job.

421
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,319
Come here, Wang Fei.

422
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,400
Why are you here again?

423
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,480
What do you mean, 'why am I here again'?

424
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,119
Didn't I tell you?

425
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,599
From now on, I have to manage you.

426
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,880
Seriously, when will this end?

427
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,720
Hold on.

428
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,640
I've studied it.

429
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,680
Your study schedule.

430
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,519
You're not exercising enough, you know?

431
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,240
It's not good for your brain to rest.

432
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,799
Alright then.

433
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,759
Starting today,

434
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,480
on the way home, I'll ride, you run.

435
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,960
I run?

436
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:23,920
I've been in class all day.

437
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,200
Where do I get the energy to run?

438
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,279
Listen, let me tell you.

439
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,240
Back when I was into the gym,

440
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,079
once you ran for twenty minutes,

441
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,359
you wouldn't feel tired anymore.

442
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,799
You just couldn't stop running, you know?

443
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,759
Slow down, slow down!

444
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,400
Watch for cars! Watch out!

445
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,799
Hey, man.

446
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
We've been walking the whole way.

447
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,759
Can't you run a few steps?

448
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,000
Run! Start running!

449
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,559
What's the deal, man?

450
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,319
Just a few more steps, turn the corner,

451
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,599
and we're basically home.

452
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,400
Can't you just run a few steps?

453
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
I said I don't want to run.

454
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,559
And I don't want to endure hardship.

455
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,079
I'm not following your schedule either.

456
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:13,640
What?

457
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,200
Running a few steps counts as hardship to you?

458
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,079
Our generation

459
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,119
endured hardship all the way here.

460
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,440
Why can't you endure a little hardship?

461
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:19,920
Dad.

462
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,640
Back in your day, conditions were bad.

463
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,039
You *had* to endure hardship.

464
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,200
Our generation is different.

465
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,960
When I clearly don't need to, why would I

466
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,279
go looking for hardship?

467
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,519
Let me ask you one question.

468
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:33,960
The shop, this house...

469
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,799
You'll leave them all to me eventually, right?

470
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,240
Don't you start eyeing that stuff.

471
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,039
Then that's it, isn't it?

472
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,000
Exactly.

473
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,799
So from now on,

474
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,319
I'll stop studying.

475
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,559
In the future, I won't do anything.

476
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,119
I'll still have a place to live, money to spend.

477
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,240
Besides, I can do live streams now.

478
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,519
I can earn money myself.

479
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,519
I don't need to work hard at all.

480
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,440
I can retire early

481
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,480
and enjoy life.

482
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,039
This so-called live streaming of yours

483
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,079
is all temporary, you know?

484
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,200
Fine, it's temporary.

485
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,400
Then let me put it another way.

486
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,920
If I do as you say,

487
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,480
struggle and grind through my studies,

488
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,759
get a PhD,

489
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,440
graduate in the future,

490
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,720
get a job at a big tech company,

491
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
then work 996, competing with everyone,

492
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,799
grind until I'm over forty,

493
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,880
my hair's gone,

494
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
skin's dry, face full of wrinkles.

495
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,039
What's it all for?

496
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,119
What's the goal?

497
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,799
Isn't it still to retire early and enjoy life?

498
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,759
I can achieve that right now.

499
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,400
Don't give me this useless talk.

500
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,160
Prove yourself by getting into university first.

501
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,680
Then talk about your PhD plans.

502
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,160
You right now,

503
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,519
you've been brainwashed

504
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,799
by those online 'lying flat' types.

505
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,319
Brainwashed, you know?

506
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,960
If you start slacking off like this now,

507
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
your whole life will be ruined.

508
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:34,880
Ruined?

509
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,880
I'm not breaking any laws.

510
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,079
I'm not doing anything bad.

511
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:41,759
I just want to live my one life well.

512
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,000
That counts as ruined?

513
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:51,880
So what?

514
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,079
I was the one who reported the cafe tutoring class.

515
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,920
I heard you talking with Second Uncle.

516
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:56,960
You stop right there!

517
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:58,279
What?

518
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,240
What did you say, you little brat?

519
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,599
You reported it?

520
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,279
I'm telling you, acting like this,

521
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:06,559
you'll ruin that cafe, you know?

522
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,480
Think of all the people working there.

523
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,799
They'll lose their jobs, you know?

524
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,880
You hit me?

525
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,400
Fine, hit me. Go on, hit me again.

526
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,279
All you know is hitting.

527
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,759
Serves you right for fighting and going to jail.

528
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,880
I won't leave you a single cent.

529
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,240
Even when I die, I'll donate it all.

530
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,759
Go ahead and donate.

531
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,519
Donate it to whoever you want.

532
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,480
Go away!

533
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,640
Wang Chunsheng, how could you really hit him?

534
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,519
How can you be so unreasonable?

535
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,559
If you hurt our son, I'll fight you to the death.

536
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,039
*I'm* the one feeling awful here.

537
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,680
What's going on?

538
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,000
But you still can't hit your son.

539
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,920
This incident,

540
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,519
I'll never get over it.

541
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,640
I remember one year,

542
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,000
my old man

543
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,319
also in the alley,

544
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:15,759
kicked over his Phoenix brand bicycle

545
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,599
and slapped me.

546
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,319
Pointed at my nose and said,

547
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,960
Darn it.

548
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,319
Another year,

549
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,440
I said,

550
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:38,759
"You're the most failed father I've ever seen."

551
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,200
He laughed after hearing that.

552
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,839
Pointed at my nose and said,

553
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:44,920
"Kid,

554
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,920
we'll see about that."

555
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,839
We'll see.

556
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,079
Why aren't the lights off?

557
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,480
And you didn't take off your headphones.

558
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:28,480
Feifei.

559
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,599
Actually, about me hitting you...

560
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,960
Deep down inside,

561
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,279
why should I apologize to you?

562
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,920
I'm your father.

563
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,200
A father hitting his son is justified.

564
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,279
And I haven't hit you that many times.

565
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,400
But I also know

566
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,039
that from now on, outside,

567
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,000
I should save you some face.

568
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,279
I'll avoid hitting you if I can.

569
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,680
So you're starting to feel bad for him?

570
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,440
Why would I feel bad for him?

571
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,880
But this kid...

572
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,680
just look at that fiery spirit.

573
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,599
He's definitely my own flesh and blood.

574
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,240
That goes without saying.

575
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,039
Let's go, let's go.

576
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,960
Branch Manager, you're back.

577
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,359
Sit.

578
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,480
Old Tong,

579
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,559
I remember you have

580
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,359
a few long-term clients, right?

581
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,839
Yes, those old clients.

582
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,519
I've maintained them quite well.

583
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,160
Hand them over.

584
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,839
Transfer these clients

585
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,279
to Xiao Jia.

586
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,519
Why?

587
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,640
And also,

588
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,039
your tardiness and leaving early

589
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,079
have been far too frequent lately.

590
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,359
It's created a very bad impression.

591
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,000
Your bonus for the second half of the year is canceled.

592
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,119
You... this...

593
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,359
This is... too sudden.

594
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,599
Wh-why?

595
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,920
You ask me why?

596
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,480
How many chances have I given you?

597
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,640
They were practically begging to meet with you,

598
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,799
and you showed them zero respect.

599
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,359
And you still ask me why?

600
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,200
You're the important one, you're the precious one.

601
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,839
No, no, no.

602
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,240
Get out.

603
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,720
It's not that, sir...

604
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,799
Let me wash that for you.

605
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,279
Honey.

606
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,680
I know you're in a bad mood right now,

607
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,880
but my thing about going to Xi'an

608
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,240
really can't be delayed any longer.

609
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,640
I need to give them an answer soon.

610
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,440
What are you actually thinking?

611
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,960
Why go to Xi'an?

612
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,680
What a hassle.

613
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,079
I'm about to get a promotion soon.

614
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:38,559
Don't go.

615
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,720
You're always talking about a promotion.

616
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,960
How many years has it been?

617
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:43,319
Besides one raise of less than two hundred yuan

618
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,440
and a bellyful of anger,

619
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,400
what promotion have you gotten?

620
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,680
How are we supposed to provide for a child like this?

621
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,839
Brother Wang.

622
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,720
Could you please send me the quote

623
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,319
for our old house? Thank you.

624
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,720
You raise a child according to your means.

625
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,960
If you're poor, you raise them one way; if you're rich, another.

626
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,440
Besides, look at Big Brother.

627
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,440
A few years ago, he wasn't even earning as much as us.

628
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,920
Didn't Feifei still grow up fine?

629
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,359
Then why don't you compare yourself to Second Brother?

630
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,599
Or Sister Qian?

631
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,880
Their kids, Yuanyuan and Xuanxuan,

632
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,440
are learning piano, learning painting,

633
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,799
and often go abroad to broaden their horizons.

634
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,680
Our child

635
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,319
can't fall behind at the starting line either.

636
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,799
Alright, thanks, Brother Wang.

637
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,839
Tong Qiu.

638
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,599
Let's not argue.

639
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,119
What happens in the future,

640
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,000
no one can predict.

641
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,119
Worrying about it now is useless.

642
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,440
Don't just brush me off like this.

643
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,480
Alright, alright, alright, let's sleep.

644
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,799
No, no, no, you get up.

645
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:34,359
Go to sleep now.

646
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,039
You need to think about the future too.

647
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,880
I'm tired, I'm tired, let's sleep first.

648
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,480
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

649
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,880
Sleep, sleep.

650
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,079
I'll make you sleep.

651
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,759
Big Brother.

652
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,039
You heard it the other day too, right?

653
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,160
That guy from the next courtyard, three against one ganging up on Qiu,

654
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:11,960
kicking Qiu

655
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,240
out of our "Trident" group.

656
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,319
He was kicked out long ago.

657
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,400
Nice.

658
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:18,759
A traitor

659
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,319
never comes to a good end.

660
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,359
You see, these rich people,

661
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,160
how can they be so unscrupulous?

662
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,720
That bastard Qiu,

663
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,240
betrayed us for just one apartment.

664
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,720
We can't let him knock us down with his money.

665
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,759
What are you doing?

666
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,559
I'm getting revenge on Ma Weiguo.

667
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,400
What grudge do you have against him?

668
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,440
It's because of him

669
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,400
my dad went to prison back then.

670
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,240
That's why his psychological trauma is so severe now,

671
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,440
that's why he's become so twisted.

672
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,960
So, tracing it back to the root,

673
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,160
it's because of Ma Weiguo

674
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,400
that my dad slapped me,

675
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,279
that he hit me.

676
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,440
You're digging way too deep for the root cause.

677
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,160
So how do you plan to get revenge?

678
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,720
I'm going to play a trick on him.

679
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,079
There's a flue over there.

680
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,759
I'm going to smash it open

681
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,640
and then put the rats from our courtyard

682
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,640
There are rats in the courtyard? Really?

683
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,160
Of course there are rats in a single-story house.

684
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,119
inside so they bite him at night.

685
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,359
The rats, some are this small,

686
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,680
and some are this big.

687
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:25,400
What?

688
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,720
Wang Chunsheng and his crew causing trouble wasn't enough,

689
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,440
now it's your turn?

690
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,680
Of course not me.

691
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,920
I'm not involved at all.

692
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,759
You think my dad and them are just making trouble for no reason?

693
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,279
Then let me ask you,

694
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,119
who in this alley actually welcomes you?

695
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,319
Uncle Qiu's family?

696
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
Our family?

697
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,119
Ever since you came to this alley,

698
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,680
there hasn't been a single peaceful day.

699
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,039
As for your dad hitting you,

700
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,400
that has absolutely nothing to do with me.

701
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,519
How is it not related to you?

702
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,440
If it weren't for you back then...

703
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,039
You didn't even experience what happened back then.

704
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,279
How do you know what your dad says is right?

705
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:58,920
That's ridiculous.

706
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,960
Do you think I should believe you,

707
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,000
or believe my dad?

708
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,240
Honestly.

709
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,799
Hey, kid.

710
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,839
What?

711
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,519
Let's have a chat.

712
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,200
Go on.

713
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,240
The matters of the older generation...

714
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,400
you shouldn't get involved.

715
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,880
First of all,

716
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,200
you need to decide what you want for your own future.

717
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,519
Obviously.

718
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,079
If I could decide for myself,

719
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,000
would I be fighting with my dad?

720
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,400
You don't want to go to college

721
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,839
because whether you go or not,

722
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,039
the future you see

723
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,240
makes no difference.

724
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
And your dad,

725
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,559
keeps pushing you to go to college

726
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,319
because he never went himself.

727
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,599
So it's his obsession.

728
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:42,279
Both of you are stuck in your own obsessions.

729
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,160
That's why you can't communicate.

730
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,799
That makes sense.

731
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,519
Let's make a deal.

732
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,359
An equal deal.

733
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,680
Fair and square.

734
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,799
She can be our witness.

735
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,680
You? On what grounds?

736
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,519
Even though I dislike my dad,

737
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,519
I wouldn't go so far as to betray him.

738
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,239
Why are you with him?

739
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,280
Come over here. Sit down.

740
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,760
Now I've thrown down the gauntlet.

741
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,039
Next, I have to challenge you.

742
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,239
I can solve Wang Fei's problem for you.

743
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,239
He doesn't want to go to college, right?

744
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
And he feels nothing is worth doing.

745
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,519
I can help him.

746
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,239
Are you out of your mind?

747
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,559
He's my son.

748
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,000
What do I need you for?

749
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,599
Let me tell you something.

750
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,679
Stay away from my son.

751
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,840
No, Dad.

752
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,199
I really want to give it a try with Third Uncle.

753
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,280
Feifei.

754
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,159
No, Second Uncle.

755
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,159
That's not what I meant.

756
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,320
I just want to see

757
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,280
what he can possibly do to me.

758
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,000
What? What did you say?

759
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,480
You really want to try this with him?

760
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,639
Yeah, let's give it a shot.

761
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:13,039
How do you think you can help him?

762
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:13,760
Big Brother.

763
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
No, no, don't get upset yet.

764
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,280
I'll do my best.

765
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,119
If I help him,

766
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,639
you agree to one condition of mine.

767
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,039
First, let me hear what this condition is.

768
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,679
If I succeed in helping Wang Fei,

769
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,039
I want one of the shadow walls on the roof of Penglexuan.

770
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,400
It will belong to me from then on.

771
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:30,440
See?

772
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,719
The conspiracy is coming to light right away.

773
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,119
Trying to dismantle Penglexuan? No way.

774
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,159
I only want the shadow wall.

775
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,760
I don't want anything else.

776
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,360
Not a single brick or tile of Penglexuan

777
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,599
will be given to you.

778
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,679
Alright then.

779
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,679
Think it over carefully.

780
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,840
Which is more important, a few bricks or your son?

781
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,400
You figure it out for yourself.

782
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:55,639
Are you insane?

783
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,519
Big Brother, you see it now, right?

784
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,760
His goal is still Penglexuan.

785
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,440
No, you really want to try this with him?

786
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,559
Why?

787
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,119
Dad, I...

788
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,199
I don't know why either.

789
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,039
But didn't you say the other day,

790
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,360
as long as I'm interested,

791
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,559
you would support me?

792
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,440
Well, right now, I just...

793
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,599
I want to try it with him.

794
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,320
I want to see what method he has.

795
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:17,880
Second Uncle.

796
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,599
I think Third Uncle is actually a good person.

797
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,239
Really.

798
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,400
Dad, I really want to try.

799
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,119
Morning, Uncle.

800
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,599
So where are we going today?

801
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,719
You'll know in a bit.

802
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,800
In a bit?

803
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,440
You're being quite mysterious.

804
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,519
What, are we walking there?

805
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,960
Why so many questions?

806
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,880
What are we going to do?

807
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,360
Just follow me.

808
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,920
So many questions.

809
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,119
Third Uncle, you even rented a car?

810
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,480
With a driver too?

811
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,239
What, don't you like it?

812
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:22,639
I like it.

813
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,440
Get in.

814
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,000
Driver, close the door.

815
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,280
Now this is living.

816
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,719
Don't get sentimental yet.

817
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,199
The best part is still to come.

818
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,199
So how exactly are you planning to help me?

819
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:10,199
Your dad wants you to endure hardship, right?

820
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,639
We'll do the opposite.

821
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,000
I'll take you to enjoy life.

822
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,559
Uncle, why didn't you come back sooner?

823
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,280
This is great.

824
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
Can I eat all of this?

825
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,440
Eat.

826
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,159
Off to enjoy life!

827
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,239
Take this card.

828
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,360
Use it freely.

829
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,639
Anything money can solve

830
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,840
is not a problem.

831
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,440
Mr. Wang.

832
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,320
You have successfully topped up fifty thousand yuan.

833
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,679
Here is your bill.

834
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,119
Enjoy your meal.

835
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,320
Brother Fei, Brother Fei.

836
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,119
Can I borrow your account to play next time?

837
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,079
Godfather.

838
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:13,800
Sure, Brother Fei.

839
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,519
This piece is our

840
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,599
autumn new arrival, the star player signature edition.

841
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,159
We can see the signature embroidered in gold thread on the collar

842
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,960
and the exclusive numbered nameplate.

843
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,599
It's a global limited release of eight thousand pieces.

844
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,400
Breakfast is served on the thirty-second floor

845
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,920
at the Executive Lounge.

846
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:28,880
Mr. Wang.

847
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,280
Marriott International wishes you a pleasant stay.

848
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:51,800
Take a look

849
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,199
Come and get it

850
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,880
These headphones

851
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,039
not only have a great look and fit,

852
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:58,440
but also

853
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,800
This essence water I'm holding

854
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,920
can provide the skin with

855
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,519
ample nutrition and moisture.

856
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:03,239
It hydrates effectively.

857
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,480
What tier is Konglongniao in outdoor apparel?

858
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
I don't need to say more.

859
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,400
No need to worry about fakes, folks.

860
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,159
Let me clarify.

861
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:19,880
There won't be any

862
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,599
ridiculous event like gold falling from the sky.

863
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,960
So don't count on it.

864
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,679
And if you see it, don't you dare copy it.

865
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,119
As for the reason,

866
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,679
it's not some grand philosophy.

867
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,159
Just think about it.

868
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,559
You're burning money,

869
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,400
with a crowd cheering you on.

870
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,519
Doesn't that look like watching a monkey show?

871
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,360
Would anyone envy the monkey?

872
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,440
Old Yang

873
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,239
Coming.

874
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,440
Get me ten tickets.

875
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,880
Ten quick-pick tickets, right?

876
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:48,320
Alright, ten quick-picks.

877
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,639
I see your Feifei

878
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:53,039
hanging out with Weiguo every single day.

879
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:53,800
What's the deal?

880
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,599
Did you give your son away to him?

881
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,400
Cut the darn nonsense, will you?

882
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,760
I sent you the money.

883
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,360
Okay.

884
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,679
Wait, tell me.

885
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,400
Me handing my kid over to Weiguo,

886
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:07,760
is that a reliable plan?

887
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,199
It's fine, right?

888
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,679
It's a huge problem!

889
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,280
Bro, I was just looking for you.

890
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,679
What? What's the problem?

891
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,159
You've seen it yourself.

892
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,920
Ma Weiguo's sugar-coated bullets

893
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,079
are a fierce offensive.

894
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,559
Feifei's just a kid.

895
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:23,880
How can he resist that?

896
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,280
I'm guessing

897
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,280
your standing in Feifei's heart

898
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,440
is lower than Ma Weiguo's now.

899
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:32,440
I think Weiguo means no harm.

900
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,440
He's spending real money.

901
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,119
I just regret

902
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,079
why I don't have a son, you know?

903
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,519
Come on, have you ever seen a decent person

904
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:40,840
educate a child like this?

905
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,880
The thing is, I've never seen

906
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,280
such a decently rich person either.

907
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,199
Playing around like this every day,

908
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,320
how can he focus on studying?

909
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,360
Right.

910
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:48,639
Bro.

911
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,000
About this studying abroad thing,

912
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,360
I've already made all the arrangements.

913
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:52,440
If you don't need it,

914
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,199
I'll just cancel it with them.

915
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,400
No, no, no.

916
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,880
I think the person you found

917
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,119
is actually quite reliable.

918
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,599
Of course he is.

919
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,199
Feifei's education is a big deal.

920
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,079
Yes.

921
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,440
Wow, a Mercedes. A Maybach even, look.

922
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,719
Wang Fei.
