1
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Impossible.

2
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,799
Absolutely impossible.

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,719
Forget about the company agreeing,

4
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,519
I personally wouldn't agree either.

5
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,959
Haven't I already explained this to you?

6
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,560
Using your company's name

7
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
to buy out Kevin's shares

8
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,480
is the simplest and fastest way.

9
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
We've just started cooperating,

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,079
and you want to kick out an original shareholder.

11
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,200
This will definitely affect

12
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,079
the company's confidence in this project.

13
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,959
Besides,

14
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,840
asking us to fork out

15
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
so much money all at once,

16
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,599
how could the boss possibly agree?

17
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,960
He might even terminate the cooperation.

18
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,840
I'm not asking your company to pay for nothing.

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,759
Think about it.

20
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,240
If Peng Le Xuan grows big, strong, and goes public,

21
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,599
then the investment you make now

22
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,199
will also bring returns, won't it?

23
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,439
Li Lianbao,

24
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,560
this is not normal business conduct at all.

25
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,599
It's purely acting on impulse.

26
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,120
To put it bluntly,

27
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,879
you still don't trust my judgment and ability.

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,080
That's two completely different things.

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,759
No matter what,

30
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,960
I have to kick Kevin out.

31
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,120
If you can't help me,

32
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
I'll figure it out myself.

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,879
Li Lianbao!

34
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,719
Can you calm down right now?

35
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,960
Alright, stop talking.

36
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,879
Li Lianbao, I haven't finished!

37
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,080
Li Lianbao!

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Stubborn mule.

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,240
Sister Tongtong.

40
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,479
Feifei.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,400
So serious, carrying a notebook.

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,560
Of course I am.

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,280
Sis, how's your photography exhibition going?

44
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,319
Working on it.

45
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,800
You know,

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,360
why I came back to Beijing to hold this exhibition?

47
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,840
Let me tell you a story.

48
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,400
Before my grandfather went abroad,

49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,919
he grabbed a handful of Beijing soil in the hutong,

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,360
wanting to take it overseas.

51
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,680
But it was later confiscated by customs.

52
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,639
Then my father took a photo

53
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,800
of that handful of soil.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,120
My deepest memory growing up

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,520
is often seeing my grandfather

56
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,240
staring blankly at that photo.

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,520
My dad said,

58
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,240
right before my grandfather passed,

59
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,919
he was still clutching that photo in his hand.

60
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,000
Chunsheng.

61
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,639
Still worried about Second Brother's situation?

62
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,920
No, but as the eldest brother,

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,439
I have to help him somehow.

64
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,720
Even though Second Brother is your blood brother,

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,639
when you and I got together,

66
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,519
his beard stubble wasn't even firm yet.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,399
What a good wife.

68
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,759
Nothing is a big deal.

69
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,360
Just help as much as you can.

70
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,040
What are you doing?

71
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,920
I'm fine.

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,279
You two carry on.

73
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,399
Carry on what? What are you doing?

74
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,240
What?

75
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,399
I have serious business.

76
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,279
Here, take a look, you two.

77
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,639
You've already decided on this school?

78
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,639
This one's good.

79
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,519
This one's great.

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
The doctor who treated my dad

81
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,639
graduated from this school, he's excellent.

82
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,800
Right?

83
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,639
Then let's go with this one, okay?

84
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,759
Dad.

85
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,399
You keep supervising my studies from now on.

86
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,800
That schedule you made before,

87
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,759
let's keep following it.

88
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,240
And go running with me every day.

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,360
How about it? Deal?

90
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,519
Wishful thinking.

91
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,079
Work hard on your own.

92
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,519
The college entrance exam is right around the corner.

93
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,399
Soon you'll be leaving home.

94
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,120
From now on, you,

95
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,120
the ocean's wide for the fish to leap, the sky's high for the bird to fly.

96
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,439
No way, really?

97
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,920
You... you're really not going to manage me anymore?

98
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,439
The two of us,

99
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,680
we have our own things to do.

100
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Come on, Jing'er, get up here.

101
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,959
Alrighty.

102
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,920
There really isn't a spot for me here.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,439
Jing'er, look, see that moon?

104
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,839
It's really bright.

105
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,600
That moon represents my heart.

106
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,639
Sing a few lines.

107
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,560
Really sing?

108
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,639
Sing.

109
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,800
You ask how deep my love for you is,

110
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,199
how much I love you.

111
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,920
My feelings are true,

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,439
my love is real.

113
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:39,040
The moon represents my heart.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,199
A deep kiss...

115
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,879
Can you all hear me?

116
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,920
Let me give you a general overview first.

117
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Motion capture

118
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,279
is a very new technology.

119
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,079
Many movies

120
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,839
and TV shows are starting to use it.

121
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,959
Let me explain it to you roughly.

122
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,279
It digitizes the movements

123
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,839
of humans or

124
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,720
animals.

125
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,839
It's used in analysis and animation production.

126
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,519
For example, the production team

127
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,639
will capture an actor's performance.

128
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,160
Good morning

129
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,600
What are you planning to do today?

130
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,600
No need to be so eager.

131
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
I'm not even ready yet.

132
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,360
This is exactly the kind of authentic footage I want.

133
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,040
It's not like I'm asking you to pose or anything.

134
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,759
Don't mind me, just brush your teeth.

135
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,160
Get some more close-ups.

136
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,799
Making it look like a reality show.

137
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,559
Natural, very natural like this.

138
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,879
Very lifelike.

139
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
One, two.

140
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,480
We can even get a shot together.

141
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,080
Look.

142
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,159
Look at me, like this.

143
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,080
Two, three.

144
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,120
Perfect.

145
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,039
See?

146
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,399
It's really good, right?

147
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,720
It's okay.

148
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,279
What are you doing next?

149
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,120
Going to wash your face?

150
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,440
Just brushing my teeth.

151
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,519
Is this okay?

152
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,039
Sure.

153
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,879
Just brush.

154
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,120
Buddy.

155
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,320
This proposal...

156
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,720
I've had you revise it five times now.

157
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,679
Do I really have to hold your hand through everything?

158
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,440
Now the client is here.

159
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,200
And you're still not...

160
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,120
You're completely out of line!

161
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,200
Can you handle this or not?

162
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,679
The client is waiting!

163
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,519
Hurry up, hurry up!

164
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,360
Quick, quick!

165
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,080
You're passenger 3518, right?

166
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,360
What's going on with you?

167
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
The app said two minutes.

168
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,440
I've been waiting over ten minutes!

169
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,639
Step on it!

170
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,120
I'm so sorry.

171
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,080
I just missed the exit on the ring road.

172
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,440
Had to go around again.

173
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,679
I knew you were a new driver.

174
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,519
Do you know how much I've had to delay

175
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,440
just waiting for you this morning?

176
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,919
Yes, yes, I'm really, really sorry.

177
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,000
W-wasted your time.

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,519
I'll try to drive faster for you.

179
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,519
Drive faster!

180
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,240
Don't wait for the red lights!

181
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,519
What if there's traffic?

182
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,679
Let me tell you...

183
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,679
If it weren't so hard to get a cab this morning,

184
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,759
I would've canceled on you.

185
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,080
I should report you.

186
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,440
No, no, Director Zhang.

187
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,159
I wasn't talking about you.

188
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,159
Not reporting you.

189
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,320
Sorry, sorry.

190
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,679
I'm having a bit of a situation here.

191
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,679
There's some traffic.

192
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,320
Could you please wait just a little longer?

193
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,639
I'm just around the corner.

194
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,600
Sorry, sorry.

195
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,320
Okay, okay, okay.

196
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,399
Okay, okay, okay.

197
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,320
Alright, alright.

198
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,120
See you soon, see you soon.

199
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,159
Bro, we're not just around the corner.

200
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,799
Stop with the nonsense.

201
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,960
Hurry up.

202
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,320
Please, don't try to talk me out of it anymore.

203
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,080
I have to do this.

204
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,360
Alright then.

205
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,399
We won't try to stop you.

206
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,879
Take this money.

207
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,759
Use it for now.

208
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,000
These five hundred thousand, from Weiguo, you take it.

209
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,519
You're really decided?

210
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,759
I don't agree with you.

211
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,679
But I respect your decision.

212
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,159
How much more do you need? I'll cover it.

213
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,320
Logically speaking,

214
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,639
I shouldn't support you.

215
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,399
But in terms of friendship,

216
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,879
unconditional support.

217
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,679
Thank you all.

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But I can't take this money.

219
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,440
I have to handle this myself.

220
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,240
No, what do you mean 'yourself'?

221
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,720
This isn't just your business either.

222
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,039
Isn't this about Peng Le Xuan?

223
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,080
Take the money.

224
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,639
Yeah.

225
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,240
It's Peng Le Xuan's business.

226
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Why are you being so polite?

227
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,639
Making it feel distant.

228
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,159
Can you come up with that much money alone?

229
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,879
Don't you worry about that.

230
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,120
I have a way.

231
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,240
Manager Zhang.

232
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,000
So you've seen the apartment.

233
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,519
Three bedrooms, one living room.

234
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,840
Just renovated a couple of years ago.

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,320
Usually just me living here.

236
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,240
Rarely cook.

237
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,759
The furniture is also very new.

238
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,759
The place is decent.

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But, Boss Li,

240
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,919
you know how it is.

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,559
These days,

242
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,639
housing prices change every day.

243
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,440
The price you mentioned...

244
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,840
won't sell quickly at all.

245
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,519
I understand, I understand.

246
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,799
The price is negotiable.

247
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,519
It's just that...

248
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,279
I need the money urgently.

249
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,960
Could you please list this apartment?

250
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,480
Make it a priority, okay?

251
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,039
Got it.

252
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,279
Price is negotiable, everything's flexible.

253
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,559
Wait for my news then, I'm off.

254
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,360
Alright.

255
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,279
He's going all in.

256
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,519
Exactly.

257
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,039
And us brothers,

258
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,039
said we'd help him,

259
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,279
but he just won't have it.

260
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,799
He insists on doing it himself.

261
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,519
What I'm mainly afraid of

262
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,519
is that this move of his

263
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,519
will take all the savings he's built up over the years

264
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,039
and just throw it all away.

265
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,559
This Li Lianbao...

266
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,919
How about

267
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,159
you try talking to him again?

268
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,559
Me?

269
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,240
Big brother,

270
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
You see, he won't even listen to you guys.

271
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,720
Me talking to him...

272
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,320
No, it's not that.

273
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,759
The relationship between us and him

274
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,480
is different from your relationship with him.

275
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,679
What's the difference?

276
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,759
Him and I...

277
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,919
There's really nothing between us.

278
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,000
No, no, no.

279
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,720
We're not concerned with whether there is or isn't.

280
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,480
But I know

281
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,679
the position you hold in his heart

282
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,480
is very important.

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,360
Please, just try talking to him again.

284
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,960
Alright then.

285
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,440
I'll give it another try.

286
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,159
Okay.

287
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,440
It's about time.

288
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,519
I'll head up first then, big brother.

289
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,679
You... you go ahead with your business.

290
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,519
I'm off.

291
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,039
Go on, hurry, tend to your things.

292
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,720
I'm leaving, big brother.

293
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,600
Go on, go on.

294
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,960
Waiter, the check please.

295
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,240
They're over there.

296
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,639
They've come back around.

297
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,720
Xuanxuan.

298
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,840
Yuanyuan.

299
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,759
Do you want to play, Yuanyuan?

300
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,720
Here.

301
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,759
This is left and right.

302
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,960
This is forward and back.

303
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,360
A remote control car, that's so cool!

304
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,000
You two can have a race.

305
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Let Xuanxuan show you how.

306
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,200
Back, back to the starting point.

307
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,360
Yuanyuan, you play with Xuanxuan then.

308
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,440
Let's come over here.

309
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
If you get thirsty, come find me for water.

310
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:32,840
Come here.

311
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,440
Okay.

312
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,240
Play nicely with Yuanyuan.

313
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,799
Things have been good lately.

314
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,039
I thought I couldn't get you to meet up anymore.

315
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,080
Let's be clear first.

316
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Today is about spending time with the kids.

317
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,519
If you're thinking of trying to persuade me again,

318
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,919
then let's just not talk about it.

319
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,039
I'm not that much of a busybody.

320
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Besides being with the kids today,

321
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,799
I also wanted to thank you.

322
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,440
Thank me?

323
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,440
That's a rare thing.

324
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,200
Do you remember last time, also right here,

325
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,480
you brought Xuanxuan and Yuanyuan here to play?

326
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,120
I was really furious that day.

327
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,000
I said I'd finally managed to instill

328
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,159
some good habits in Xuanxuan,

329
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,679
and you went and ruined it all.

330
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,240
But after going back home,

331
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,919
I thought about it more carefully.

332
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,039
Ever since my divorce,

333
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,240
I've actually always felt in my heart

334
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,759
like I've really let Xuanxuan down.

335
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,200
I kept thinking about

336
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,799
how to give him a better future.

337
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,200
But I never once thought about

338
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,799
whether these things are what he wants,

339
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,519
whether he would be happy,

340
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,159
or whether he'd hate me in the future.

341
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,519
Of course,

342
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,879
luckily you reminded me that day.

343
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:07,759
So, thank you.

344
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,159
It's nothing.

345
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,440
And also,

346
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,080
that matter with Director Luo.

347
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,600
I know

348
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,639
you actually had my best interests at heart.

349
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,679
Maybe my reaction that day was a bit over the top.

350
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,639
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,440
It's all in the past, no need to bring it up.

352
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,559
They crashed!

353
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,559
Are you okay?

354
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Who's broken?

355
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,240
We're both broken!

356
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,720
This part is broken.

357
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,639
I'm not broken.

358
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,399
This part of yours, this part fell off.

359
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:53,960
That's not mine.

360
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
No, no.

361
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,600
Look here, look here.

362
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,639
I've figured it out now.

363
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,960
Sometimes for a person,

364
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,000
taking a step back is also a step forward.

365
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,440
You can't always force yourself to charge ahead.

366
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,640
If you don't hit the brakes in time,

367
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,880
you could very likely end up shattered to pieces.

368
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,799
This sounds like there's something behind your words.

369
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,799
Actually, Kevin is that wall in your heart.

370
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,880
Right now, you just want to smash yourself to pieces against it.

371
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,599
Right?

372
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,119
You really took a long way around to say this.

373
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,599
Lianbao.

374
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,599
To put it bluntly,

375
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,640
you just can't stand

376
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,200
Kevin always being on top of you, right?

377
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,160
Kevin is right in front of your face now.

378
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,480
You can only see him.

379
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,720
If you don't force yourself to take a few steps back,

380
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,599
you won't be able to see anything else.

381
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,160
You'll never beat him.

382
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,480
Alright, alright, alright.

383
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Stop talking.

384
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,559
We just agreed earlier

385
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,440
that today was about taking the kids out to play.

386
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,720
No work talk.

387
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,960
Aren't you usually pretty smart?

388
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,160
Right now, you're just the person in the game who's lost perspective.

389
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,640
If you don't want to play with the kids,

390
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,599
I'll just take Yuanyuan and head back first.

391
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,680
Dad.

392
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,200
Mom.

393
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Your mom... your mom went grocery shopping, right?

394
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,680
Why do you keep staring at me?

395
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,000
You're still here scribbling away furiously.

396
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,319
Take a break. Get some exercise, do some movement.

397
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,799
Why do you keep staring at me?

398
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,839
I haven't been writing the whole time!

399
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,440
What?

400
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,000
Not the whole time?

401
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,200
Not the whole time, huh?

402
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,000
No.

403
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,640
Fine. As long as you weren't writing the whole time.

404
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,039
Dad

405
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,839
About that job thing of mine

406
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,960
It's pretty much settled.

407
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,839
Don't worry.

408
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,839
Really?

409
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,559
That's great!

410
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,279
You have an appointment slip?

411
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,640
What's going on?

412
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,759
Just... just running some errands.

413
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,519
Alright.

414
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,799
Your old man's fine.

415
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,319
Son.

416
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,839
Go on, go on.

417
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,799
Go do your thing.

418
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:56,480
Okay.

419
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,000
You really should take it easy.

420
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,400
I will, I will, I'll definitely rest.

421
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,720
Dad's fine, go on.

422
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,880
Even though Li Lianbao and I

423
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,359
had an agreement

424
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,039
not to interfere with each other's work,

425
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
given his current situation,

426
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,480
I'm really quite worried.

427
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,359
I can't just stand by and watch.

428
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Yeah.

429
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,640
Between people,

430
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,880
once there's a bond,

431
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,519
it's hard to draw clear lines.

432
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Actually, on the surface right now,

433
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,160
he's competing with Kevin,

434
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,240
but in reality,

435
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,720
he's competing with himself.

436
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,680
He's angry with himself.

437
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,759
Exactly.

438
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,480
He just can't get over that hurdle in his own heart.

439
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,559
Anyway, I've said my harsh words,

440
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,880
and I've said my soft words.

441
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,359
I've analyzed what needed analyzing,

442
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,480
and advised him as I should.

443
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,000
He just won't listen.

444
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,359
How to put it...

445
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:25,960
It's easier to defeat an enemy in the mountains than one in your heart.

446
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,359
That's his obsession.

447
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,640
It's also that very drive

448
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,039
that got him to where he is today.

449
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,960
If you suddenly ask him to let it go now,

450
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,759
I think he'd lose himself.

451
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,240
Then what should we do?

452
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,440
We can't just

453
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,759
watch him struggle like this forever.

454
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,240
I'm worried that

455
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,799
if something else happens to him,

456
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,000
it'll be really hard for him to get back up.

457
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,279
I have a not-so-brilliant idea.

458
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,359
It might work,

459
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,039
but I need your help.

460
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,519
What method?

461
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,319
How is it?

462
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,039
Let me adjust it.

463
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:05,599
Okay.

464
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,039
Ready?

465
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,480
Okay.

466
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,559
Director Li is my benefactor.

467
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,039
He's also my buddy.

468
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,720
Without Director Li,

469
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
my Hive Technology

470
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,759
might have been done for long ago.

471
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,599
During my toughest time,

472
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,880
it was Old Li who lent a helping hand.

473
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,279
He helped us pull through the crisis.

474
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,759
Of course, for Director Li,

475
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,599
it might have been a simple favor,

476
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,519
but for Hive Technology back then,

477
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,960
it was a matter of life and death.

478
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,519
Even though he's withdrawn now,

479
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,599
I believe

480
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,440
he must have his reasons for withdrawing.

481
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:39,279
Personally, I'm still extremely, extremely grateful to him.

482
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,119
Therefore,

483
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:42,200
if Hive Technology ever goes public,

484
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,440
I will definitely invite you

485
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,119
to come ring the bell with me.

486
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,240
Good.

487
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,119
That's good.

488
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:51,559
Good, good, good.

489
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,279
That works, that works.

490
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:53,480
Thank you.

491
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,640
It's the least I could do.

492
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,559
Are you okay?

493
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:26,759
I'm fine.

494
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,720
What's wrong?

495
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,880
Nothing, nothing, I'm completely fine.

496
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,559
Don't worry, don't worry.

497
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,519
You go ahead, it's fine.

498
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,200
Really, you're okay?

499
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,279
I'm fine.

500
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,359
Doing great.

501
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,640
Son.

502
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,599
Dad?

503
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,759
It's your dad.

504
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,680
You

505
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,640
need to come over right away.

506
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,680
What's wrong? What happened over there?

507
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,039
Your dad's appetite is really good today.

508
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,559
I want to eat some fried liver.

509
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,960
That stuff has way too much cholesterol.

510
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,240
Why would you eat that?

511
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
No, no, no.

512
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,559
I really want fried liver today.

513
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,680
Be a good son.

514
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:54,759
Dad...

515
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,079
If you're not busy,

516
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,720
come over quickly.

517
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,880
Hurry up.

518
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,200
Alright, alright, I'm not busy, I'll come right now.

519
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,279
Coming right now.

520
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,599
Good son.

521
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,480
Dad loves you.

522
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,440
Son

523
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,559
Being cooped up in

524
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,480
Courtyard 36 every day,

525
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,440
and then suddenly coming out here,

526
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,079
this place has changed so much.

527
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:07,960
I've been telling you,

528
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,720
don't just stay holed up at home.

529
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,759
It's so much better to get out and stroll around more.

530
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,000
No, I have to write my book.

531
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,880
Alright, alright, alright.

532
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,559
Dad,

533
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,559
how come you suddenly got a craving for fried liver today?

534
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,240
Right after we moved from Guanzhuang to the city,

535
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,519
I saw lots of people eating this stuff.

536
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,319
I tried a couple bites,

537
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,160
couldn't swallow it.

538
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,039
Later on,

539
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,319
accompanying, uh...

540
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
what's-his-name's dad...

541
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,160
Accompanying Weiguo's dad.

542
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,240
Right, right, Weiguo's dad.

543
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,160
Spent a long time with him,

544
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,440
always went with him to eat it.

545
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,000
Later, when I savored the taste,

546
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,480
it started to grow on me.

547
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,839
Not bad.

548
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,039
I really didn't know

549
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,720
this place only serves breakfast.

550
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,920
Closes so early.

551
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,359
Tonight, I'll go to the Shazikou area

552
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:54,000
and at least bring you back a couple of bowls.

553
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,960
Don't bother, why go to all that trouble?

554
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,240
Don't.

555
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,720
What trouble is it? Honestly.

556
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,000
Not eating it. No, no, no.

557
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,920
From now on, when you want to go out,

558
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,000
just tell me if you want to stroll around.

559
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,160
It's not like there's traffic at midday anyway, right?

560
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,440
Here's what we'll do.

561
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,720
I, after I'm done working today,

562
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,039
I'll be passing by Hufangqiao anyway.

563
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,240
I'll bring you some fried cakes,

564
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,240
fermented bean juice, that sort of thing.

565
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,519
That fermented bean juice is good.

566
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,079
Your old man loves drinking that the most.

567
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,440
Sour and tangy.

568
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,960
You gotta have some pickled vegetable shreds ready.

569
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,720
Pickled vegetable shreds.

570
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,839
Deep-fried dough rings, mustard greens.

571
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,680
Deep-fried dough rings.

572
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,440
Fried dough twists.

573
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:21,920
Fried dough twists.

574
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,640
Get it all prepared.

575
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,839
I'll have it all ready for you, don't worry.

576
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,680
Authentic, authentic.

577
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,279
What's wrong? Why are you coughing?

578
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,000
Are you okay?

579
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,160
I'm fine, I'm fine.

580
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:30,920
You sure?

581
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,880
Alright, alright, drive carefully, drive carefully.

582
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,000
This kid.

583
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,519
It's nothing, rest assured.

584
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,559
Your dad will keep an eye out for you.

585
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,559
No need, it's fine.

586
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,920
I'm taking some video, for keepsakes.

587
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,000
It hasn't been easy.

588
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,559
Alrighty.

589
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,119
Alrighty.

590
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:25,960
Alrighty.

591
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,400
Got it, take it slow.

592
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Open the door for me.

593
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,160
Coming!

594
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,519
Come on, come on.

595
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,880
Take it easy, take it easy.

596
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,559
We're home.

597
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,480
Getting old.

598
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,440
You're not old.

599
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,599
What do you mean not old?

600
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,200
Qiu'er,

601
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,799
you, uh...

602
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:48,960
you go attend to your business.

603
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm fine here.

604
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,519
Okay, then I'll try to come back early today.

605
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,200
If you get hungry,

606
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,680
have some snacks to tide you over first.

607
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,519
Drive safe.

608
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,680
I know, I know.

609
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,480
I'm off.

610
00:28:59,480 --> 00:28:59,920
Okay.

611
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,240
Obey the traffic rules.

612
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,319
Bye-bye.

613
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,319
Kid.

614
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,359
Uncle Tong.

615
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:34,319
So busy he can't even hear.

616
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,359
How do you say 'busy'? Let me see.

617
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,279
So good.

618
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,559
Time flies like a shuttle.

619
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,799
When your aunt and I moved to Baofang Hutong,

620
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,000
that was already forty years ago.

621
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,079
Yeah.

622
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:00,839
A person's lifetime,

623
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,880
can seem very long, yet also very short.

624
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,039
Look,

625
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,599
look at Qiu'er, he's almost forty now.

626
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,160
Look at this little face.

627
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,160
In my mind, it's just like yesterday.

628
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,079
Uncle Tong,

629
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,079
you and Aunt Tong are in better health now,

630
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,480
so Qiu'er can rest easy.

631
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,519
As for you,

632
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,240
don't always do so much for him.

633
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,599
The more you do,

634
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,680
the less he does.

635
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,839
The less he does,

636
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,160
the less he progresses in his work.

637
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,559
That way, it backfires, right?

638
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,319
Yes, yes, yes.

639
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,599
The reasoning is sound.

640
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,759
But tell me, as parents,

641
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:43,279
who doesn't worry about their own children?

642
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,279
Even those without children,

643
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,319
surely have someone they care about in their hearts.

644
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,079
Isn't that right?

645
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,440
Great, let me see.

646
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,799
Has a name been chosen for this exhibition?

647
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,680
Thought of a few, but haven't decided.

648
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,160
Perfect!

649
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,039
I'll come up with one.

650
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,440
Let me think.

651
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,519
"With bamboo staff and straw sandals, lighter than a horse."

652
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,759
"Speaking of a bountiful year amidst the fragrance of rice blossoms."

653
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,880
Write it, write this down.

654
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,799
Let's see.

655
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,640
Youth

656
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:50,960
What do you think?

657
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,039
Take a look.

658
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,039
It's quite good.

659
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,599
It has that relaxed lightness,

660
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,240
and the bounty of a fruitful year.

661
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,680
One line is by Su Dongpo,

662
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,599
the other by Xin Qiji.

663
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,799
Both are poets of the heroic, unrestrained school.

664
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,680
It's very fitting.

665
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Uncle Tong, it really takes you.

666
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,720
Kid,

667
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,599
all those thoughts in your heart,

668
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,519
I understand them completely.

669
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,720
You think you're all prepared,

670
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,319
but kid,

671
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,599
you're not at that stage yet.

672
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,960
Death

673
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,960
is truly terrifying.

674
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,400
It's better to be alive.

675
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,000
Right?

676
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,079
These two lines

677
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,359
are our mutual encouragement, you and I.

678
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,920
Alright then.

679
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,000
Bye now.

680
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,759
It's fine. I was just finishing up that script.

681
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,000
I was actually planning

682
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,599
to tidy up and then come find you.

683
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,199
What's up?

684
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,519
I was thinking,

685
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,760
this time, maybe fate

686
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,079
will be on my side.

687
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,360
I've decided.

688
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,440
I've thought it through clearly.

689
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,760
I'm going to have the surgery.

690
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,039
Okay?

691
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,400
Okay.

692
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,320
Old Tong, out for a stroll?

693
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,119
Uncle Tong, out for a walk?

694
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,599
Hello, hello, hello.

695
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,119
Uncle Tong.

696
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,440
Old Tong's out!

697
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,000
Hello.

698
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,920
Uncle Tong.

699
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,440
Hello.

700
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:46,960
Uncle Tong.

701
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,639
Uncle Tong.

702
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,119
Uncle Tong, going for a walk?

703
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:53,679
Just a little stroll.

704
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,559
Take it easy now.

705
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,679
Just wandering around.

706
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,679
Out for a walk?

707
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,559
Alright, alright, I got it. Okay.

708
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,360
What's with Uncle Tong? Something's off.

709
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,440
Let's go check on him.

710
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,119
Uncle Tong! Uncle Tong!

711
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,480
Why is he sleeping here?

712
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,480
Uncle Tong?

713
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,079
Grandpa Tong!

714
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,039
Old Tong!

715
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,079
Uncle Tong!

716
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,800
What happened?

717
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,119
Call 120, quick!

718
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,480
Press his philtrum! Press his philtrum!

719
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,159
Don't crowd around! Don't crowd around!

720
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,840
Once your wife gets pregnant,

721
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,880
the financial pressure will be huge, right?

722
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,639
Those two medicines are insanely expensive.

723
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,039
I told the doctor to stop them.

724
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,760
Don't think I don't know.

725
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:03,320
When Qiu'er hadn't quit her job,

726
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,320
you weren't writing like this,

727
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,199
day and night.

728
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,280
You know how hard it is to find a job now.

729
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,599
And our Qiu'er is too picky for some jobs, overqualified for others.

730
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,239
Plus, they're about to have a baby soon.

731
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,960
It's just too difficult.

732
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,639
Come eat first, alright?

733
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:22,639
I know my own illness.

734
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:24,559
Let me tell you,

735
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,719
I just want to finish the first few episodes.

736
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,320
That's still not okay.

737
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,840
No, no.

738
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,239
Alright, promise me one thing.

739
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,239
Don't you dare tell our son about this.

740
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:36,280
He's having such a hard time, the pressure is too much for him.

741
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,679
Qiu'er! Qiu'er!

742
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,840
What's going on here?

743
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,480
You look all wilted,

744
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,000
like you've lost your soul.

745
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,119
It's nothing, nothing.

746
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:48,119
Nothing? That can't be right.

747
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,480
It's fine, really fine.

748
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,239
