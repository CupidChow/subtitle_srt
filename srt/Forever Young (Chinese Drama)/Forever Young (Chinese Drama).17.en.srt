1
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,159
Director Dong, he's still waiting.

2
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,799
Then let him wait.

3
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,040
Okay, understood.

4
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,840
Jing'er.

5
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,560
Coming.

6
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,879
It's a delivery.

7
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,240
Uncle Tong.

8
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,879
Tongtong.

9
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,680
Auntie.

10
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,400
Quick, you haven't been to our new place yet.

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,199
You startled me.

12
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,400
Quick, quick, come in, come in.

13
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,039
Uncle Tong.

14
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,120
Your new home is really nice.

15
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,759
Bought some fruit.

16
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,319
Thank you, thank you.

17
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Come here, give me a hug.

18
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,919
A hug, a hug.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,759
You're too polite.

20
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,240
Uncle Wang.

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,960
Hurry, hurry.

22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,159
Make tea, hurry and make tea.

23
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:35,879
Sit, sit.

24
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,000
You sit, you sit.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
Please sit further in.

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,919
Alright, then I'll sit here.

27
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,479
You rascal, you.

28
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,080
Since you moved,

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,560
how long has it been

30
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,280
without coming by the shop?

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,960
What are you doing at home?

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,719
I'm just, you know, keeping busy.

33
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,360
As for me, I don't visit without a reason.

34
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,560
Uncle came this time to say

35
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,199
that my script

36
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,960
has reached

37
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,400
the part where Peng Le Xuan opens.

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,759
So now,

39
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,080
it involves the roast duck technique.

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,319
How should I write it in the script?

41
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,000
No.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,439
Well, Uncle Tong,

43
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,400
right now, I...

44
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,080
I can't even mention

45
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,360
those two words.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,080
It makes me nauseous.

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,159
Here we go again.

48
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,400
I know you

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,120
get sick at the smell.

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,680
Yes.

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,080
But this craft,

52
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,759
you can't have forgotten it all, right?

53
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,879
Right?

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,159
Come on, come on, tell Uncle.

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,879
I don't even dare think about it.

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,719
Tell me.

57
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,759
I know.

58
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,520
Come on, tell me.

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
Uncle Wang.

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,520
This plaque.

61
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,120
Looking at it up close like this

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
is a completely different feeling

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,800
than seeing it hanging overhead.

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,439
Here, let me show you.

65
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,280
This is a real antique.

66
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,520
On the first day Peng Le Xuan opened

67
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,120
in Baofang Hutong,

68
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
this was the plaque they hung.

69
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,159
Right, Big Brother?

70
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,840
Yes.

71
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,879
Here.

72
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,879
Girl, sit here.

73
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,159
Listen to me.

74
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,360
This plaque has been through a lot.

75
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,560
Times were very hard back then.

76
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,240
Always lacking this and that.

77
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,680
It was almost burned as firewood.

78
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,680
His grandfather used to talk about this.

79
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,079
Not his grandfather.

80
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,800
It was his great-grandfather.

81
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,680
Here, Uncle Tong, have some tea.

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
Thank you, thank you.

83
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,360
Thank you, Auntie.

84
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,160
Speaking of his great-grandfather,

85
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,959
he was incredibly clever.

86
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,519
He thought it over

87
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,040
and that very night called his grandfather.

88
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,879
The two of them, in the dead of night

89
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,439
when it was quiet and no one was around,

90
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,360
went to the kitchen where the firewood was piled.

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,839
They stole this plaque out,

92
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,439
carried it together,

93
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,879
all the way to their own home,

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,319
went up to the roof,

95
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,560
and tied it to a roof beam.

96
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,439
Roof beams are sturdy, right?

97
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,560
Later, they sealed the ceiling with paper.

98
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,120
How safe!

99
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,279
It stayed sealed for twenty years.

100
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,040
Until the early eighties,

101
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,800
did it see the light of day again.

102
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,439
The older generation really had it tough.

103
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,040
Of course it wasn't easy.

104
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,560
Therefore,

105
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,319
we must not let down the Ma family's

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,000
generations of hard work and effort.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,879
Understand?

108
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,560
Here.

109
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,000
No, no, it's not that...

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,839
Um, Uncle Tong,

111
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,439
um, um...

112
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,439
Right when you were coming in,

113
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,920
I was just about to go out.

114
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,040
I, I have an appointment.

115
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,040
If I don't go now,

116
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,720
it'll be a bit rude.

117
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,360
No, no.

118
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,879
Let's talk.

119
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,720
Hey, Jing'er.

120
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,000
You, you entertain Uncle Tong and them.

121
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Big Brother, I need to tell you...

122
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,480
What should I say to them?

123
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,680
The fairy is back

124
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,439
Oh, come on

125
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,759
You're always so nice after a fight

126
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,800
Can you change your routine next time?

127
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,000
Your humble servant washed some cherry tomatoes for the fairy

128
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,839
Alright, alright

129
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,439
Fairy

130
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
Your humble servant wants to discuss something with you

131
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,600
What is it?

132
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,240
Come back after one year in Xi'an, okay?

133
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,759
This long-distance life

134
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,240
is unbearable for your humble servant

135
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,959
Actually, I

136
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,519
was just about to discuss this with you

137
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,959
Look

138
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,920
The competition for the director position

139
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,800
is extremely fierce right now

140
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,519
And the head office's opinion is that

141
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,360
if I stay in Xi'an for one more year

142
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,079
it would be more secure

143
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,120
One more year?

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,079
Then this... this director position

145
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,920
I feel like it's not even worth having

146
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,360
No

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
The director position is important

148
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,639
but it shouldn't affect us having a baby

149
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,199
How could it?

150
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,759
Modern women

151
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,240
Who says you have to choose between kids and a career?

152
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,680
And my company guarantees

153
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,360
during pregnancy and maternity leave

154
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,319
your position and salary will be retained

155
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,399
Don't you dare discriminate against women

156
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
I wouldn't dare, how could I, I don't dare

157
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,680
That's not what I meant at all

158
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,040
That's more like it

159
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,120
I've also calculated

160
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,519
if I stay in Xi'an one more year

161
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
the salary is already higher

162
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,200
add in the bonuses and subsidies

163
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,080
and the promotion benefits

164
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,519
that's a whole new level

165
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,840
Why does it feel like your

166
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,240
reasons are all about money?

167
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,799
What's wrong with money?

168
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,360
Who has a problem with money?

169
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,039
Today is the last day to sign up

170
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,080
I know

171
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,879
I'll go think of something

172
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,159
Qiu'er, I was just looking for you

173
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,600
Qiu'er

174
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,080
What?

175
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,480
Come with me to see Big Brother

176
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,600
and persuade him to join the competition

177
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,480
Persuade him again?

178
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,399
How?

179
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,519
Things have gotten a bit out of hand

180
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
What happened?

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I didn't realize Big Brother was hurt so deeply

182
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,720
Of course he was

183
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,519
I told you

184
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,320
don't use your corporate tactics on us

185
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,519
That's all cold machinery

186
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,600
We are people

187
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,639
Listen to me

188
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,080
The situation is a bit tricky now

189
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,600
Li Lianbao might be in trouble

190
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,639
Don't scare me

191
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,360
What kind of trouble?

192
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
He got that funding with conditions

193
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,120
If Big Brother doesn't win the competition

194
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,000
Li Lianbao might have to pay a huge penalty

195
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,720
Why didn't you say so earlier?

196
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,000
Big Brother already has psychological issues

197
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,879
If he hears about something this big

198
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,879
he definitely won't be able to handle it

199
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,000
Then his condition won't improve

200
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,000
How do you not understand Big Brother?

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,720
If it were me, I might crack under this pressure

202
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,519
But for Big Brother

203
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,120
a brother in trouble is his motivation

204
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,840
Alright, stop beating around the bush, let's find Big Brother

205
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,919
You should've said so earlier

206
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,000
Putting on a sob story here

207
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,159
It's heartbreaking to watch

208
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,720
But you really know how to pick a spot

209
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,360
You stay wherever the smell is

210
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,600
Why are you putting yourself through this?

211
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,879
You think waiting here will corner Master Sun?

212
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,879
I'm just doing this to show

213
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,879
my sincerity and attitude

214
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,600
Li Lianbao

215
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,720
Today is the deadline

216
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,879
Should I give you one last

217
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,360
Alright, alright, stop talking

218
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,720
The deadline isn't until tonight, right?

219
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,480
I still have a chance

220
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,240
Right, it's until tonight

221
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,159
Fine, you wait slowly then

222
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,600
Peng Le Xuan is a century-old brand

223
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,480
It must produce the ancestral flavor

224
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,240
Your duty is to be a chef

225
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,360
If Chunsheng doesn't roast ducks anymore

226
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,559
can Peng Le Xuan still be called Peng Le Xuan?

227
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,639
All these good old Beijing traditions

228
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,399
are slowly disappearing

229
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,639
The things our ancestors left behind

230
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,120
are being lost now

231
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,000
We must not let down the old Ma family

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,759
the lifelong efforts of several generations

233
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Looks like there's some wiggle room here

234
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,759
Master Sun

235
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,559
You finally decided to show yourself

236
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,519
Manager Li, I'm impressed

237
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,639
A scholar dies for his confidant

238
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,000
Your every move these past two days

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,679
I've seen it all

240
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,120
It's an honor you still value me so highly

241
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,360
If I didn't show up

242
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,000
it would be rather ungrateful

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,360
I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't, I wouldn't

244
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,879
So, Master Sun, you...

245
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:40,879
To be honest

246
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,360
I actually have some history with Peng Le Xuan

247
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,639
What a coincidence

248
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,000
My family also has a generations-old roast duck business

249
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,360
My old man

250
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,519
even knew the manager of Peng Le Xuan

251
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,639
One year he went to Peng Le Xuan to visit Old Man Ma

252
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,360
and had a taste of Wang Chunsheng's roast duck

253
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,120
He couldn't stop praising it when he came back

254
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,519
He went on and on about it to me

255
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,360
Coincidentally

256
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,240
that same day I ruined a duck I was roasting

257
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,399
My old man

258
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,919
insisted I was no match for Wang Chunsheng

259
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,399
and even hit my hand with a ruler until it swelled

260
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,559
There's such a story?

261
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,000
I still remember that beating to this day

262
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,559
Ever since then

263
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,120
I resolved to master the craft

264
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,360
and that's how I got to where I am today

265
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,159
Who would have thought that Wang Chunsheng

266
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,919
would end up in such a sorry state today

267
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,200
Director Li, I'm willing to help you.

268
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,120
You just have to agree to one thing.

269
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Please, tell me.

270
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,480
For this competition,

271
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
have Wang Chunsheng be my assistant.

272
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,240
However I order him around, he has to take it.

273
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,120
No, wait...

274
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:56,759
Master Sun.

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,360
Please, don't hold a grudge against my Big Brother.

276
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,480
Besides,

277
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,120
my Big Brother doesn't even know about this.

278
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,360
Look,

279
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,879
I'll apologize to you on my Big Brother's behalf.

280
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,480
No, Director Li.

281
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This has nothing to do with you.

282
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm targeting Wang Chunsheng.

283
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,000
No, but that was so many years ago.

284
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,240
Why bother?

285
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,519
Director Li,

286
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,519
if you're really in a difficult position,

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,519
then just find someone else.

288
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,759
No, no, no, Master Sun.

289
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,519
Listen,

290
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,360
do me a favor, will you?

291
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,799
I just can't swallow my anger towards Wang Chunsheng.

292
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,480
I have to completely humiliate him.

293
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,360
Dream on.

294
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,120
I'll slap you.

295
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,759
You dare? Look,

296
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,240
th-there are security cameras here.

297
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,120
Go ahead, try it.

298
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,759
Get lost.

299
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,960
Just you wait, just you wait.

300
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,279
So what if it's death?

301
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,759
I'll face it head-on.

302
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,879
Second Uncle, you're a real man.

303
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,720
Uncle.

304
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,519
Enough already.

305
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,639
He's a tough guy.

306
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,080
I've really messed up Peng Le Xuan this time.

307
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,759
Second Brother.

308
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:26,480
Big Brother.

309
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,519
What do you mean by this?

310
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,720
Such a big issue, and you don't discuss it with me?

311
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,600
What's wrong, Big Brother?

312
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,399
What kind of person do you think I am?

313
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,000
No.

314
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,080
Why did you call Big Brother here?

315
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,080
I brought this photo.

316
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,480
Go sign me up right now.

317
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:40,840
I'll make roast duck

318
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,639
and represent Peng Le Xuan in the Duck King Competition.

319
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,600
Big Brother.

320
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,120
You're not angry anymore?

321
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Listen, things are a bit tricky now.

322
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,399
Li Lianbao might be in trouble.

323
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,159
Why didn't you say so earlier?

324
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,840
This really is a bit troublesome.

325
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,519
If we don't win the championship,

326
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,639
Lianbao will lose all his money.

327
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,000
Really, Weiguo?

328
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,359
You're something else.

329
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,279
What time is it now?

330
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,400
And you're still hiding things from me?

331
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,359
Let's go.

332
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,119
Even if I'm angry with you,

333
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,640
when you're in trouble,

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,599
I have to go all out for you.

335
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,599
Listen up, you little brats.

336
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,880
I don't care what you think of me.

337
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,759
I always believe I'm your Big Brother.

338
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,720
If the sky falls,

339
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,160
even if Big Brother gets a skull smashed to pieces,

340
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,240
Big Brother will still hold it up for you.

341
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:47,599
Big Brother, you'll always be my Big Brother.

342
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,599
Don't give me that.

343
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,960
Shouldn't we take a photo at a moment like this?

344
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,079
Look at me, quick.

345
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:54,480
Come on.

346
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,519
Yes, yes, come on, come on.

347
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,000
Dad, smile, Dad.

348
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,119
Put your hand on there.

349
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Quick, one, two, three.

350
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,960
One more.

351
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,079
One, two, three.

352
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
Dad, smile, smile.

353
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,960
Alright, let's go sign up.

354
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,079
Go, go.

355
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,720
Don't you have anything to say to me?

356
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,200
Say what?

357
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,920
The four of you are reconciled.

358
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,680
I should get some credit, right?

359
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,400
Aren't you just gathering material

360
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,680
for your photography exhibition?

361
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
You... I gather material?

362
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,119
Thank you.

363
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,559
Really.

364
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,359
Thank you.

365
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,079
I was joking.

366
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,079
I was using a tactic.

367
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,119
It's a tactic.

368
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,359
You're not street-smart enough.

369
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,119
You...

370
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,079
I'm leaving first.

371
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:30,799
Thanks.

372
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,599
Brother Wang, so early.

373
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,359
Our roast duck shop is being renovated.

374
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,279
I'd like to borrow your kitchen.

375
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,400
No problem, no problem.

376
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,519
Come on, come on in, come in.

377
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,519
Alright, alright.

378
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,519
Master Wang.

379
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,039
Dad, here, have some water.

380
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,480
Here, here.

381
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,079
Water, water.

382
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,680
Dad, tell me,

383
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,319
we've been eating it for days now.

384
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:38,160
Why do you still vomit as soon as you eat?

385
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,839
This is already much better.

386
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,200
You know, before,

387
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,839
I couldn't even bear to hear the word "duck."

388
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,519
I couldn't stand the smell either.

389
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,680
At least now I can put it in my mouth.

390
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,759
But to restore the ancestral skill,

391
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,079
can I manage without tasting it?

392
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,119
Let's do it.

393
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,839
If you keep vomiting like this,

394
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,200
you'll damage your stomach lining.

395
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,680
Right, right.

396
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,599
How about we call it a day today?

397
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,440
Yes, Dad, let's stop for today.

398
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,759
Let's rest a bit.

399
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,960
Let's stop today, okay?

400
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,880
No, the competition is in just a few days.

401
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,680
Even if I vomit up my gallbladder today,

402
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,920
I have to keep tasting.

403
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,359
You're seeing the doctor and getting medicine,

404
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,680
and you won't even let me go with you.

405
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,759
I'm afraid you'll worry.

406
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,119
Let me get you some water.

407
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,960
It's fine, I'll have a banana.

408
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,400
Why would Big Brother suddenly decide to enter the competition?

409
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,640
I didn't expect it either.

410
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,480
But it should be fine.

411
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,200
He's entering at the last minute.

412
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,079
He shouldn't pose a threat.

413
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,640
No.

414
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,799
We can't give Peng Le Xuan any chance.

415
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,880
Weiguo.

416
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,680
You need to constantly assess the risks for me.

417
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,440
Tell me immediately if anything changes.

418
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,359
Don't worry.

419
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,440
I'll give you a satisfactory result.

420
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,920
Hey.

421
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,960
It's already one o'clock.

422
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,480
Maybe you should finish this summary tomorrow?

423
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,279
Don't interrupt my train of thought.

424
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Have some water. Here.

425
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,640
You know what?

426
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,319
Scouting those shops...

427
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,640
...was actually quite fruitful.

428
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,680
Here.

429
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,240
Hey.

430
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,720
How did you...

431
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,200
...get more and more handsome?

432
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,920
What? What fell?

433
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,279
Go on, write.

434
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,640
It's fine. It's okay.

435
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,559
Chinese people...

436
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,759
...come on!

437
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
If I hadn't put in so many good words for you,

438
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,640
would Feifei trust you so quickly?

439
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:58,720
Fine.

440
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Go ahead, say it.

441
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,599
What exactly do you want?

442
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,039
It's really nothing much.

443
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
Where are you taking Feifei tomorrow to broaden his horizons?

444
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,200
Count me in.

445
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,920
I won't bother you two.

446
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,119
I won't interfere either.

447
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,640
I'll just be responsible for taking photos.

448
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,200
Just think of me as a human-shaped camera.

449
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,319
I have other plans tomorrow.

450
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,640
Didn't I say? I'm very busy.

451
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,119
What about the day after?

452
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,799
Or the day after that.

453
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,559
In short, you have to take me with you.

454
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,160
And if I don't agree?

455
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,720
Well, if you don't agree...

456
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,680
...then I'll have to agree to my uncle's request.

457
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,160
To take Feifei away from you.

458
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,680
Glioma targeted medication.

459
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:41,799
It's coming up.

460
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,400
What's wrong?

461
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,480
Do you still remember my grandfather?

462
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,039
I remember.

463
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:56,880
Of course I remember.

464
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,960
I even remember when you were one year old,

465
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,200
your father brought you back.

466
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,799
And then?

467
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,400
Your grandfather went with you...

468
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,000
...abroad.

469
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,960
He didn't want to go originally.

470
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
But after seeing me,

471
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,279
he still went.

472
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,359
Time really flies.

473
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,759
In the blink of an eye,

474
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,519
you've become a young lady.

475
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,799
My grandfather stayed with me abroad for over ten years.

476
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
The first phrase I learned was,

477
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,880
"Have you eaten?"

478
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
He also showed me...

479
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,920
...a lot of...

480
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,400
...old Beijing photos.

481
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,440
No wonder...

482
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,960
...you're so interested in old Beijing things.

483
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,000
He died of cancer.

484
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,599
Really?

485
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,279
Kidney cancer.

486
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,880
After the surgery to remove it,

487
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,279
three months later,

488
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,119
it was found to have spread to his brain.

489
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,680
Before he passed away,

490
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,960
he always wanted to return to Beijing for a visit.

491
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,920
He wanted to go back to Baofang Hutong.

492
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,079
He finally booked a plane ticket later.

493
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,720
But he never made it to that moment.

494
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,640
I think...

495
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,519
...this must have been his biggest regret in life.

496
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,680
Do you know something?

497
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,279
Can I give you a hug?

498
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,559
About this matter...

499
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,119
You must keep it a secret for me.

500
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,079
I don't want anyone to know.

501
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,319
I don't want anyone's pity either.

502
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,039
Understand?

503
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,640
I understand.

504
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,119
I get it.

505
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,519
Hello? Sister Tongtong?

506
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,640
Hello? Feifei.

507
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,119
I suddenly have an urgent matter tomorrow.

508
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,720
I can't make it to that Duck King Competition.

509
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,279
Can you help me shoot some footage?

510
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,159
Use my camera.

511
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,280
You know how to use it, right?

512
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,480
No problem, I can use it.

513
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,360
Okay, thank you.

514
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,199
Sorry to trouble you.

515
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,559
It's fine. Get some rest early.

516
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,440
Cognitive decline.

517
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,119
I don't know why,

518
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,400
but the burden I carry now feels exceptionally heavy.

519
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,000
The pill feels like a shot put ball,

520
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,079
impossible to swallow even with lots of water.

521
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,599
This feeling isn't from my condition worsening.

522
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,559
It comes from an abyss.

523
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,639
A vortex, though filled with goodwill,

524
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,119
that makes it hard to stand up straight.

525
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:41,920
But it's laughable.

526
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,559
At a time like this,

527
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,440
I'm actually asking myself:

528
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,280
What's more important?

529
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,960
Living, or the meaning of living?

530
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,760
You guys, help me taste this.

531
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:02,280
Tell me your thoughts, quick.

532
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,199
Come on.

533
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:04,280
Come on, come on.

534
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,039
Come on, come on.

535
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,440
Try a plain piece.

536
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,719
Not bad.

537
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,079
Good.

538
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:21,639
H-how is it?

539
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,239
Well? Any feedback?

540
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,599
It's the old flavor.

541
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,280
It's the taste from our childhood.

542
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,119
So fragrant.

543
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,920
Don't forget anything.

544
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,239
Come on, let me take a couple photos of you two.

545
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,880
Can you not create a tense atmosphere?

546
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,960
Come on, come on.

547
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,360
Alright, count me in too.

548
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,679
What else?

549
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:01,000
All good.

550
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,800
Okay, okay, okay.

551
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,039
Take a look.

552
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:03,519
Look.

553
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,559
Hat, apron, and water.

554
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,440
Do you have them all?

555
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,119
Got them.

556
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:09,599
Let's go.

557
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,320
Let's go.

558
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,320
Distinguished judges,

559
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,000
fellow contestants,

560
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,119
and all friends in the audience,

561
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,159
hello, everyone.

562
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,199
It's an honor to participate in

563
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:46,840
Beijing's 8th Folk Duck King Culinary Competition.

564
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,719
I'm your host, Qihang.

565
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,679
Here and now,

566
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,079
I'd like to share some of the rules

567
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,400
for this competition.

568
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,360
The competition spans two days.

569
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:58,920
On the first day,

570
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,320
we hold the individual duck slicing contest

571
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,960
and the comprehensive roast duck skills contest.

572
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,159
Based on the combined scores from both events,

573
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,239
we will select three outstanding contestants

574
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:17,840
to compete in the second day's full duck banquet showdown,

575
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,840
to determine this year's Duck King.

576
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,679
Let's wait and see.

577
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,679
The master chef beside me

578
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,320
is very famous.

579
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,199
He is from Spring River Warms,

00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:34,039
Master Chef Sun Yanhui.

581
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,199
Let's give him a round of applause.

582
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,320
I must specially emphasize here

583
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,280
that Master Chef Sun was last year's Duck King Competition

584
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,000
runner-up.

585
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,679
Great.

586
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
Here,

587
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,239
I also wish you even better results

588
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,679
in this year's Duck King Competition.

589
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,320
Thank you.

590
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,840

00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
is also very famous.

00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,840
Peng Le Xuan's Master Chef Wang Chunsheng.

593
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,559
His culinary skills are equally superb.

594
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,639

are all very famous.

599
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:21,239
"A heart like thunder, a face like a calm lake"

600
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,559
"can be named a great general."

601
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:25,599
Let us look forward to all contestants

602
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,280
achieving excellent results.

603
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,719
Alright.

It's okay.
