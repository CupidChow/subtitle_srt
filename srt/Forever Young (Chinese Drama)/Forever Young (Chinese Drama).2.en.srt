1
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,280
The Trastuzumab and Ramucirumab are both gone.

2
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,120
If I tell you, don't get upset.

3
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,640
Huh?

4
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,959
Think about it, once your wife gets pregnant,

5
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,840
the financial pressure will be huge, right?

6
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,799
Those two medications are insanely expensive.

7
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,159
I told the doctor to stop them.

8
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,760
The pregnancy thing isn't even on the horizon yet.

9
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
And besides, your illness is almost cured.

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,799
You can't stop this medication.

11
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,759
Your dad is just being hard on himself.

12
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,759
He feels he can't earn enough money

13
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,280
and that he's burdening you.

14
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,919
Actually, I...

15
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,240
have some good news I haven't told you.

16
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,800
What good news?

17
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,919
I got promoted to Assistant Branch Manager.

18
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,879
Really?

19
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,360
It's true, I got the promotion.

20
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,439
So,

21
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,840
from now on, you focus on your job at the bank,

22
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,719
and I...

23
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,840
will focus on writing my script.

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,680
This is the concept for a new script.

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,560
Okay, okay, stop, stop.

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,479
Come here, let me talk to you.

27
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,240
Stop.

28
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
You're not tired, but darn it, I am.

29
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,560
Alright, alright.

30
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
You're always cutting me off.

31
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,039
Enough.

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,680
When is Xiaoshi coming back?

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,199
She probably can't stand it there either, soon.

34
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,599
That's great.

35
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,560
Here, I...

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,639
got some new medicine from Dr. Wu.

37
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,599
Specifically to nourish your health.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,840
Remember to take it.

39
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,360
Try to give us a big, healthy grandson next year.

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,479
I'm not some baby-making machine.

41
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,599
Mom, about that...

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,039
And Dad, listen to me.

43
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,680
I'm earning a lot more now than before.

44
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,199
We can use this medication however we want.

45
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Promise me.

46
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,560
You rascal.

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,360
Listen to your mom about what we just discussed.

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,039
I know, I know.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
You've been an employee for so many years.

50
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,719
Always letting the younger ones get ahead of you.

51
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,759
Let me tell you,

52
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,560
figure out a way to secure Director Qiu's business, fast.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,680
Otherwise, don't bother coming to work.

54
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,120
The promotion opportunity this time

55
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,879
will be given to Xiao Jia.

56
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,919
Manager Tong.

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,720
Get in the car.

58
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,600
You should at least introduce your products to me.

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,399
Get in and we'll talk.

60
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,639
L-Let's just g-get

61
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,680
straight to the p-p-point.

62
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,519
Why are you so naive?

63
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,879
Um, the driver, h-he...

64
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,800
He's not d-down

65
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
n-not, not hot.

66
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,839
He can c-come up.

67
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,879
So, l-let me, let me

68
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,279
briefly introduce a

69
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,120
financial product to you.

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,040
Although the short-term return rate isn't high,

71
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,439
if held long-term,

72
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,040
the returns are still considerable.

73
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,360
Weren't you looking for a deposit?

74
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,319
Is this enough?

75
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,240
Y-You...

76
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,160
Wh-what, what do you mean?

77
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,720
I... I...

78
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,720
I... I have a wife.

79
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,519
That's okay.

80
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,279
I have a husband too.

81
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,279
Um, um, sis... sis...

82
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,160
Sis is here, sis is here.

83
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,120
S-say hello to your brother-in-law for me.

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,360
This, I'm really just

85
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,319
simply

86
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,600
selling this financial product, so...

87
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
I get it, I get it.

88
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,439
Just an opening line, sis understands.

89
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,279
Right?

90
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,680
Director Qiu, I...

91
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
love my wife very much.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,639
And I d-don't want to be the other man.

93
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,720
You're so adorable.

94
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,439
What 'other man' nonsense.

95
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,160
Look, Director Qiu,

96
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,279
I think that...

97
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,279
if y-you have b-business,

98
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,920
y-you, c-come to our bank to talk.

99
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,439
Sorry.

100
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,759
Listen, Tongtong,

101
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,439
you're wandering around every day

102
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,759
with no real job.

103
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,439
I did say I supported you coming back to develop here,

104
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,639
but I didn't say I'd support you mooching off your parents.

105
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,199
This *is* my real job.

106
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,000
What did you think?

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
This is my job.

108
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,519
This?

109
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,040
A crappy camera?

110
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,399
How is that any different from those

111
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,040
influencers who just travel and take photos?

112
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,160
What's the difference?

113
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,120
No wonder your mom keeps urging you to go back.

114
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,000
If you keep this up,

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,480
I'll take your mom's side.

116
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,560
You don't understand.

117
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,240
You don't understand anything.

118
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,600
Fine, fine, stop filming me.

119
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,439
Alright, after this drink, that's it.

120
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,519
Don't drink anymore.

121
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,240
No matter how pathetic you are, can you be more pathetic than me?

122
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,600
Big brother.

123
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,160
Have you eaten?

124
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,920
I have.

125
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,199
Qiu'er.

126
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:46,839
Perfect timing, have some ribbonfish.

127
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,240
Are you moving?

128
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,480
Let me tell you guys.

129
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,279
As soon as Ma Weiguo moved back in,

130
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,720
he's trying to force me and my parents out.

131
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,720
Isn't he going too far?

132
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,199
How does he have the nerve to do this?

133
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,839
See, even Jin Tong can't stand it.

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,959
I say, on the pillar of historical shame,

135
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,560
there's a tiny little section,

136
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,639
that's all reserved for him.

137
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,199
Stop with the wisecracks.

138
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,639
Do you have any ideas to help Qiu'er out?

139
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,360
I actually do have an idea.

140
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
I can chase him away.

141
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,680
Alright, alright, don't make things worse.

142
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,600
You should head back now.

143
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,439
How am I making things worse?

144
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,519
Go back and fiddle with your camera. Go on, get out.

145
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,519
I just sat down.

146
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,560
Go back, hurry up.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,879
Have some tea.

148
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:35,960
Qiu'er.

149
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,200
Don't worry, Big Brother and I will think of something.

150
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,919
I refuse to believe he can get the better of us.

151
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,720
But look, this house belongs to him.

152
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
What can I say?

153
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,799
There's nothing to be done.

154
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,240
No, wait.

155
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,759
I'm telling you, don't worry about this.

156
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,279
You have work tomorrow, right?

157
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
Finish this drink and get back home.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I still have to deal with that brat Feifei.

159
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,679
Drink less.

160
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,559
Right.

161
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,759
I think life is full of surprises.

162
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,240
Surprises are everywhere.

163
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,919
Take me, for example, back in the day.

164
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,720
Back then,

165
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,879
just so my parents could live more spaciously,

166
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,600
I moved out of the hutong.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,600
Took on a loan, gritted my teeth, and bought a relocation apartment.

168
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,720
That was for my parents.

169
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,759
Make it bigger.

170
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,679
My wife and I rented a smaller one.

171
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,840
Then one day, my dad got sick.

172
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,240
He said he wanted to live back in the hutong.

173
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:35,039
Said he wanted to die in the hutong too.

174
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:35,919
Alright then.

175
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,559
Let's move then, let you go back to the hutong.

176
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,519
And from then on,

177
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,159
I've been running back and forth.

178
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,120
Back and forth.

179
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,639
Back and forth.

180
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,320
Second Brother.

181
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,240
Big Brother.

182
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,120
Have you come up with that new plan yet?

183
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,080
Is he asleep?

184
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,799
He's asleep, keep your voice down.

185
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,559
The new plan?

186
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,200
I think it's still not quite mature.

187
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,759
No, tell me about it first.

188
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,440
Let me hear it.

189
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,120
Anyway, no matter what,

190
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,039
I'm getting him into university.

191
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,279
If you ask me,

192
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,159
you should stop giving our son such a hard time.

193
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,200
With your junior high school education level,

194
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,879
can you really manage him?

195
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,120
I've been learning a lot lately,

196
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,519
about communicating with kids

197
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,799
and education-related

198
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,919
new theories.

199
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,159
I have to say, they're quite interesting.

200
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,679
I'll try putting them into practice later.

201
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,720
What's the use of just theoretical knowledge?

202
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
The kid's grown up now, right?

203
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,559
Maybe we should just go along with him a bit.

204
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,840
No, look, you're doing it again.

205
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,679
How many times have I said it?

206
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,039
We can go along with him on other things,

207
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,440
but going to university, he must listen to me.

208
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,039
We have to be a united front, you know?

209
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,399
I'm putting this out there.

210
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,320
About going to university,

211
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,279
someday both of you will thank me.

212
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,600
Fine, fine, you're the expert.

213
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,679
Just as long as in the future,

214
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,639
you stop always threatening and yelling at our son.

215
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,759
I know.

216
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,039
Haven't I already started this

217
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,799
carrot-and-stick approach?

218
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,759
Right?

219
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,840
All these shoes of his.

220
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,120
Buys so many.

221
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,480
Spends all day not focusing on proper work.

222
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,320
Look at these pairs.

223
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,360
I take care of these better than I do my own face.

224
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,200
Uh, I'm going to go wash my hands.

225
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,039
What are you doing? It's the middle of the night.

226
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,279
You reek of alcohol.

227
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,879
I need to discuss something with you.

228
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,679
I disagree.

229
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,759
I haven't even said it yet.

230
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,919
I won't agree to anything you say.

231
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,000
Here's the thing.

232
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,840
I'm just exhausted today.

233
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,960
A designated driver back to the Fifth Ring Road is too expensive.

234
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,960
Can I just crash here for the night?

235
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,279
No.

236
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,039
You're so heartless.

237
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,639
How dare you...

238
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,480
Who said you could come in?

239
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,200
What are you doing?

240
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,000
Who said you could just lie on my bed?

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,919
Have you even showered?

242
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:26,759
Yes, I have.

243
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,600
Why are you so germophobic now?

244
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,480
Get down.

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,639
Get down!

246
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,840
What are you doing?

247
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,679
It's not like we didn't sleep together as kids.

248
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,879
Why are you being so distant?

249
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:35,759
That was then.

250
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,399
This is now.

251
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,240
How old are you this year?

252
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
I'm younger than you, anyway.

253
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,919
Don't worry.

254
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,799
When I sleep, I'm all about being quiet.

255
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,279
Just go to sleep.

256
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,399
Relax. Just relax.

257
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,600
Your pillow is pretty comfortable.

258
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,919
We've received word.

259
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,840
Key trading partners may impose additional tariffs in the future.

260
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,879
The company needs to prepare for both scenarios.

261
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,039
While attracting foreign capital back,

262
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,440
the board has tentatively decided

263
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,600
to shift the strategic focus to overseas markets next quarter.

264
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,559
China and India

265
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,639
are the priority targets.

266
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,440
Chris, over to you.

267
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,039
Okay.

268
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,639
Everyone,

269
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,879
our department's investigation into the Asian market is as follows.

270
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,879
As of 6 PM yesterday,

271
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,399
our domestic revenue in China this month

272
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,960
continues to show a downward trend.

273
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,519
Our revenue in India is also declining.

274
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,679
It's decreased year-on-year by...

275
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,879
Chris, please continue.

276
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,440
Sorry.

277
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Currently,

278
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,840
these two countries'

279
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,559
domestic high-tech industries are developing rapidly.

280
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,399
Excuse me, Martin.

281
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,720
Your microphone seems to have a problem.

282
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,799
If you don't mind,

283
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,720
you can reply to us in text.

284
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,679
Okay.

285
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,320
We recommend

286
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,080
expanding the scale of the two branch offices

287
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,720
to four companies.

288
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,519
Establish new subsidiaries

289
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,440
in Guangzhou, China, and Chennai, India.

290
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,399
Sis Li, watering the flowers?

291
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,879
Want to play a game?

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,039
Come on, come on.

293
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,279
Weiguo.

294
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,759
Weiguo, wait, wait, wait.

295
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,360
Uncle Tong.

296
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,360
So,

297
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,080
did you sleep comfortably last night?

298
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,679
It was okay.

299
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,080
You have to admit, living in this courtyard house is more comfortable.

300
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,679
Right?

301
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes.

302
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,360
See?

303
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,600
Wait, wait, wait.

304
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,960
My son, Qiu'er,

305
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,919
wanted me to move into their apartment building a couple years ago.

306
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,960
I felt so cooped up there.

307
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,200
Come back for lunch at noon.

308
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,639
Alright.

309
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,639
I'm waiting to have a drink with you.

310
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,080
Sure.

311
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,159
You...

312
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,360
This... this is Jianguo, right?

313
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,200
Wei... Weiguo.

314
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,639
Yes, yes, yes. Weiguo.

315
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,360
Uncle Sun, right?

316
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,679
You're back from abroad.

317
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,240
Yes, yes, yes.

318
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,720
It's been over twenty years in the blink of an eye.

319
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,799
Good, we'll chat later.

320
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,679
Chat later.

321
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,120
Darn it, I really need to go.

322
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,839
To help our middle-aged and elderly friends avoid hemorrhoid troubles...

323
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,640
Mister, hurry up!

324
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,119
Someone's in there!

325
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,039
I've made a decision that goes against my ancestors...

326
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:18,960
Thanks.

327
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,480
Here I go again.

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You...

329
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,559
Don't you have a toilet in your shop?

330
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,720
I can't do number two there.

331
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,559
Then hurry up!

332
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,160
Mister, please hurry up! Thank you.

333
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,359
Mister, hurry up!

334
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,519
Are you done yet?

335
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,359
Wait, wait.

336
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,119
I'll tell you in a bit.

337
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,039
I was here first.

338
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,799
Done now?

339
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,759
Not yet, I have diarrhea.

340
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,039
Here it comes again, again!

341
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,680
Weren't you done?

342
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,319
Close the door for me!

343
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,640
I'm taking my pants off!

344
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,920
I'm begging you, can you hurry up?

345
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,359
Get down! That's disgusting!

346
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,720
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

347
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,440
My leg's asleep!

348
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,720
It's asleep!

349
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,279
Calling for your grandma won't help.

350
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,640
Look at you. Harming others without benefiting yourself.

351
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,839
Even if it means mutual destruction.

352
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,279
If I'm not comfortable,

353
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,720
I won't let him be comfortable either.

354
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,359
Let me interview you.

355
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,799
You're hiding in the bathroom.

356
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,319
Why are you squatting instead of standing?

357
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,279
I just wanted to make it look more realistic.

358
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,480
Just get up already!

359
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,279
My leg's asleep!

360
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,279
Get up. No more talking. Hurry up.

361
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:30,920
I'm begging you, okay?

362
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,680
Get up, get up.

363
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
I'm begging you, my leg's asleep.

364
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:27,960
Who's there?

365
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,119
Did I disturb you?

366
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,480
What are you doing?

367
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,559
Sorry, so sorry.

368
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,880
Isn't it a coincidence?

369
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,839
My niece lives in this room, right next to you.

370
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,279
She just got back from abroad.

371
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,640
Her...

372
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,440
She insists on using a sun umbrella for her flowers.

373
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,960
I need to secure it.

374
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,880
Keep it down, I'm trying to sleep.

375
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,079
Apologies, apologies.

376
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,880
I promise I won't make another sound.

377
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,480
Absolutely no noise, rest assured.

378
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
What are you doing here too?

379
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,880
Wasn't the earlier commotion enough?

380
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,279
What commotion? What's wrong?

381
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,039
What do you mean, 'what's wrong'?

382
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:52,720
What are you doing?

383
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,759
Working.

384
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:54,480
What kind of work?

385
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,720
I'm going to build a flower trellis here for Tongtong.

386
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,400
How can you build a trellis here?

387
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,240
Why can't I?

388
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,480
I've brought all the materials.

389
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,200
There are trees here.

390
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,680
Lianbao can just saw off a few branches later, darn it.

391
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,799
Fine.

392
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:08,960
You're doing this on purpose, right?

393
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,799
Uncle.

394
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,680
Uncle Wang.

395
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,960
Tongtong, you're back just in time.

396
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,680
Say hello to Uncle Ma.

397
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,440
My niece, Jin Tong.

398
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,440
She'll be staying at No. 36 Courtyard long-term.

399
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,640
There might be some disturbances.

400
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,880
Please bear with us.

401
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,200
Well, you two chat.

402
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,880
I'll... I'll go get a camera battery.

403
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,000
Alright, go ahead with it.

404
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,799
My God, life is so much more dramatic than TV shows.

405
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,799
Never thought that in my final days...

406
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,319
I'd meet her again.

407
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
Even more unexpected...

408
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,920
She's actually Li Lianbao's niece.

409
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,640
Heaven is really playing a huge joke on me.

410
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,640
It seems wanting to leave with dignity...

411
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,000
Isn't so easy after all.

412
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,759
We're here.

413
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,720
H-how did it get dark so suddenly?

414
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,400
You're wearing my sunglasses, aren't you?

415
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,440
Here.

416
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,440
No, you keep them.

417
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,319
It'll be glaring when you go downstairs later.

418
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,200
Just wear them.

419
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,119
Alrighty.

420
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,319
Please take your feet down.

421
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,319
I got it, I got it. I got it, I got it.

422
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,400
Cover up a little.

423
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,119
I'm fine, I want to be discharged.

424
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,319
Let's listen to the doctor.

425
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,880
We'll leave whenever the doctor says we can.

426
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,000
That's when we'll be discharged.

427
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,400
Don't rush.

428
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,680
The doctor already said...

429
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,799
We can be discharged anytime.

430
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,079
Then if the doctor said anytime...

431
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,640
Go and get it done for me right now.

432
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,599
I said, don't rush, don't rush.

433
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,160
What, are you afraid he'll run off?

434
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,119
Don't you rush.

435
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,599
I want to be discharged.

436
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,400
I want to go back to my Baofang Hutong.

437
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,960
Back to my old house.

438
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,720
Even if I die...

439
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,359
I'd rather die in my own bed.

440
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,440
Why do you say things like that? You always say that.

441
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,680
But I really understand how you feel.

442
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,160
Because my dad said the same thing.

443
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,200
The old man just knows...

444
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,960
What our generation thinks.

445
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,559
Your dad...

446
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,480
But Auntie, you don't know, we...

447
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,640
Auntie needs to rest now.

448
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,640
No, I don't... don't want water.

449
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,200
Lie down and rest for a bit.

450
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,039
Rest for a bit, rest.

451
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,440
Third Brother.

452
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,039
I heard you're over in the US,

453
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,680
at a pretty big company,

454
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,880
managing quite a few people, right?

455
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,920
I have a lot of resources on my end.

456
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,319
I think later we could

457
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,599
have a good discussion.

458
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,480
Have some water.

459
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Time really can't take everything away.

460
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,480
Take Wang Chunsheng at this moment.

461
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,920
He's old, he's greasy,

462
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,799
but he's still that

463
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,039
"Guardian of Baofang" who steps up first.

464
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,759
Ready?

465
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,920
Next, let's welcome student Tong Qiu to perform

466
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,799
a recitation of a play excerpt.

467
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,200
To be, or not to be,

468
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,000
that is the question.

469
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,720
Lianbao's back.

470
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,720
So? What did Teacher Shi say?

471
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,000
Are you on the guaranteed admission list?

472
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,559
Yes, of course I am.

473
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:04,519
That's fantastic!

474
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,799
Knew you could do it.

475
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,559
Great, that's wonderful.

476
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,079
We have to celebrate this properly.

477
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,240
Let's go, my treat.

478
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,200
Auntie, come with us.

479
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,720
Alright.

480
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,839
Alright.

481
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,119
You kids go ahead.

482
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,160
I still have to take Xiao Liangzi to the youth center.

483
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,880
Auntie, it's fine.

484
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,200
Then let's go today first,

485
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,720
Auntie,

486
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,960
later I'll get everyone together,

487
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,079
and we'll have a proper feast.

488
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:22,480
Alright.

489
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,559
Go, go, go, let's hurry now.

490
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,599
Go, go, go.

491
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,039
Go on.

492
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,000
Cheers.

493
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,680
Lianbao,

494
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,680
which school was it you got into?

495
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,599
Beihang University.

496
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:40,079
Heard of it. Good school.

497
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,200
Come on.

498
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,559
The three of us,

499
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,359
each give Lianbao a word of blessing

500
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,880
to celebrate his admission. Come on.

501
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,359
Wish Second Brother goes to the best university

502
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,920
and earns the most money later.

503
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,559
Of course.

504
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,599
Third Brother,

505
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,079
you're still planning to take the exam for that Foreign Affairs University, right?

506
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,319
It's the only one for me.

507
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,079
For my dad and mom, I have to get in.

508
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,319
With Third Brother's grades, it's in the bag.

509
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,119
Later, when you become a diplomat

510
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,759
and travel all over the world,

511
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,759
don't forget to broaden our horizons with you.

512
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:12,400
Absolutely.

513
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,079
You're supposed to give a blessing.

514
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,160
First, I congratulate Second Brother.

515
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,559
Then I want to say,

516
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,799
when we're old men in the future,

517
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,240
when we've become four old men,

518
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,640
we can still hang out together every day.

519
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,000
Isn't that obvious?

520
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,720
Where else would the four of us be

521
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,640
if not together every day?

522
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:27,119
Exactly.

523
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah, right.

524
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:29,960
Alright now,

525
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,480
your big brother, me, will also say a few words.

526
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:43,039
Lianbao, Weiguo, Qiu'er,

527
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,720
you three

528
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,279
are all kids I watched grow up.

529
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,079
You're all promising.

530
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,799
Your big brother, me,

531
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,319
doesn't have any other skills,

532
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,039
just started in society a bit earlier

533
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,319
and can earn a bit of money.

534
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,759
When you're all successful later,

535
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,079
just come find your big brother.

536
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,359
Big brother will take you to make big money.

537
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,119
Good, good, good.

538
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:05,799
To Big Brother.

539
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:06,359
To Big Brother.

540
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:06,799
Come on.

541
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,000
Four brothers.

542
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,839
Four brothers.

543
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,359
Cheers.

544
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,559
Looking back now,

545
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,480
he really did keep his word.

546
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,440
Nailed to Peng Le Xuan, never moving.

547
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,039
He didn't break his promises to Li Lianbao and Tong Qiu either.

548
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,359
But upon closer thought,

549
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,000
his keeping his word

550
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,400
seems more like, aside from guarding this little bit,

551
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,119
he hasn't shown any new side of himself.

552
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,799
Zhang, Zhang!

553
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,359
Old Wang!

554
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,680
Have you seen Feifei? Has he been here?

555
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,000
No, I haven't seen him.

556
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,799
What's wrong? Can't find Feifei?

557
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,839
Should I close the shop and help you look?

558
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,680
No, no need for that.

559
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,039
You tend to your business.

560
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,839
Alright then, don't worry.

561
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Why must we warm it up?

562
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,960
Because our palms have warmth.

563
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,079
Then, like this, we

564
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,039
gently press it onto the face.

565
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,680
Like this, one, two, one, two.

566
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,319
Darn it.

567
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,039
Rub to warm it.

568
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:16,480
Like this.

569
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,079
Gently pat, gently press.

570
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,039
Wang Fei!

571
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,359
Just like this.

572
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,599
Hold on.

573
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,400
Look at the pinned post on this homepage.

574
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,359
It's very, very gentle.

575
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,359
After applying it,

576
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,799
Darn it.

577
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
Like this.

578
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,920
Here, look.

579
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,000
You little jerk.

580
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,640
A thin layer and a thick layer have different effects.

581
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,720
Alright, alright, alright. Here's the thing.

582
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,799
Transfer some money to my phone.

583
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,039
What for?

584
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,000
Important business.

585
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,079
What important business?

586
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,599
To find a cram school for that little jerk.

587
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,799
Getting a cram school is fine.

588
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,160
When Feifei comes back later,

589
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,400
you have to talk to the child properly.

590
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,759
Alright, alright, I know.

591
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,240
You said it yourself last night,

592
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,440
use both carrot and stick.

593
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,880
We'll see how well you've learned.

594
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,200
Got it. Alright, let's do this.

595
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,319
Feifei

596
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,039
You, stand there.

597
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,519
Where have you been?

598
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,759
I went to someone's house to do homework.

599
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,559
Is that not allowed?

600
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,839
Do you think we can believe that from now on?

601
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,559
You, doing homework again?

602
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,400
Either your mom watches you,

603
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,160
or I watch you.

604
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,839
I really just went to do homework.

605
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:32,759
Is that wrong?

606
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,079
No, it's not about what's allowed or not.

607
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,079
What are you doing?

608
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,079
Talk properly.

609
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,319
Why do you two start arguing the moment you see each other?

610
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,519
Fei, talk to your dad properly. You...

611
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,119
Talk properly.

612
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,359
What are you yelling about?

613
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,720
No, is *he* talking properly?

614
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,920
I just don't get it.

615
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,559
Why is he so dead set on me going to that university?

616
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,640
Your dad is right.

617
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,839
For your generation,

618
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,359
a university degree is the standard.

619
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,400
Otherwise, how can you

620
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,519
contribute to society?

621
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,000
No, let's not talk about that first.

622
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
About contributing to society...

623
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,440
First, you have to support yourself. You have to be able to...

624
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,240
You know?

625
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,839
I can.

626
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,359
The money I earned,

627
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,039
twenty thousand yuan,

628
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,599
this is from me doing livestreams

629
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,319
over the last couple of weeks.

630
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,319
And this is just using my spare time,

631
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,319
doing it for fun.

632
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,119
If I did it full-time,

633
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,519
I could earn way more.

634
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,480
It would scare you to death.

635
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,480
No, what are you so smug about?

636
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,799
Livestreaming, livestreaming...

637
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,160
What's there to be smug about?

638
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,200
Let me tell you,

639
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,680
that's all just a trend,

640
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,119
here today, gone tomorrow.

641
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,240
No matter what you do in the future,

642
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,680
you need a university diploma.

643
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,160
Besides,

644
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,880
you're a student right now, you know?

645
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,960
You're a year older than others,

646
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,720
you're nineteen,

647
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,440
but you're still a student, you know?

648
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,640
If you enter society now,

649
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,960
you'll have problems in the future.

650
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,039
I know.

651
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,559
You just want me to get into a good university,

652
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,359
and then find a well-paying job, right?

653
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,880
I can earn money right now.

654
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,440
You... you, say less... say less.

655
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,079
I won't. I don't want to talk to him.

656
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,279
You come back here!

657
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,240
Keep that money.

658
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,599
Buy yourself some new clothes.

659
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,519
Buy some new shoes.

660
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,799
Get Mom a better set of skincare products.

661
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:18,880
Alright. The PIN is my birthday.

662
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,720
You get back here!

663
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,599
Feifei, Feifei, we're eating.

664
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,359
Who wants your money?

665
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,519
You two are cut from the same cloth.

666
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,240
Where did all your studying go?

667
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,559
You... this...

668
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,519
Isn't this child quite filial?

669
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,400
Filial?

670
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,640
Even if he's filial, he still has to get into university.

671
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,640
Your dad is right.

672
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,279
But I think...

673
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,920
Feifei... Feifei's point is also valid.

674
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,480
Why must he go to university?

675
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,559
We're leaving this shop to him later anyway.

676
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,559
No, are you really that clueless,

677
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,000
or are you just pretending?

678
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,119
What?

679
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:12,160
Can you reveal this bottom line to him now?

680
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,759
If you tell him now,

681
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,519
for the rest of his life,

682
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,000
will he have any drive left?

683
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,640
It's just you...

684
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,039
You care so much for your son in your heart,

685
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,640
but you never say the nice things properly.

686
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,519
No, if he talked properly...

687
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:24,720
Look at how he flails around with me.

688
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,759
Eat.

689
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,319
He was fine when he was little.

690
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,319
How did he become such a liar now?

691
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,000
You used to be quite good too.

692
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,880
This... this money...

693
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,519
Put it together with his New Year's money savings.

694
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,119
Honey.

695
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,200
Let me confess a mistake to you first.

696
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,440
The promotion didn't work out again, did it?

697
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:00,880
So smart.

698
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,519
But this time, I really was just that close.

699
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,559
Next time for sure.

700
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,599
But talking about promotions now

701
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,239
isn't important anymore.

702
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:11,800
Let me tell you,

703
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,920
there's a huge surprise.

704
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,320
You might not even believe it when I say it.

705
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,719
Do you want to...

706
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,519
I don't want to know.

707
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:22,960
Let me tell you.

708
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,880
It's uncomfortable keeping it in.

709
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,239
Then beg me.

710
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,000
Please.

711
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,079
Then tell me.

712
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:34,960
Come closer.

713
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,679
Closer, closer.

714
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,400
I knew it.

715
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,199
Watch the road.

716
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,960
Honey.

717
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,039
Honey.

718
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,760
Honey.

719
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,280
Splash, splash, splash.

720
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,039
Splash, splash, splash.

721
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,119
What's that sound?

722
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,159
What are you doing standing there?

723
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,199
This is

724
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,159
What does this mean?

725
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,559
Ms. Zhang, welcome to

726
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:22,079
the pink sands of Dunmore Town, Harbour Island.

727
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,199
Wow, Tong Qiu.

728
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,199
Ms. Zhang, please have a seat.

729
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,679
Really?

730
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,519
Okay, okay.

731
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,599
Okay.

732
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:35,960
Given that today

733
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,639
the UV rays and sunlight are too intense,

734
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,639
it is recommended that Ms. Zhang wear sunglasses.

735
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:44,480
You've really gone all out.

736
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:47,840
Alright.

737
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
Ms. Zhang's outfit

738
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,559
is already very beachy.

739
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:51,360
Now then,

740
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,239
what's the meaning?

741
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,800
Beach shorts.

742
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,519
Ms. Zhang, please have some coconut water.

743
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,800
Honey.

744
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,280
Since the mood is set like this,

745
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,519
why don't we do something serious?

746
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,559
Wait a minute, I bought all this stuff.

747
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,119
I've been preparing for ages.

748
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:10,960
Let's eat first.

749
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,159
Be romantic for a bit.

750
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,079
Ms. Zhang,

751
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,039
Blue lobster from France,

752
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,079
and king crab from Australia,

753
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,559
bluefin tuna,

754
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,360
and geoduck from Canada,

755
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,840
and your Beijing little puppy dog.

756
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,800
I prefer a little wolf dog.

757
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,920
Fine, Beijing little wolf dog.

758
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,599
Come, let's celebrate our

759
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,239
twenty-ninth "absence makes the heart grow fonder."

760
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,039
Honey, you're so romantic.

761
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,480
Let's just do the serious thing now.

762
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,000
Hold on.

763
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,920
The wine's already open, it's open!

764
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,840
Have a couple sips first.

765
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,400
Ms. Zhang,

766
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:42,559
this is specially prepared for you:

767
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,280
a 1996 Lafite.

768
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,960
Come, Ms. Zhang,

769
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,119
let us drink a glass of 1996 Lafite.

770
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,079
Now is the optimal conception time.

771
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,559
Let's not waste time.

772
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:56,639
Wait, wait, the wine's open!

773
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,440
Listen, I think...

774
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,519
I think right now is just fine.

775
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,320
Alright, alright, alright.

776
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,239
Who is it, so late?

777
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,159
What's wrong?

778
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,280
Son.

779
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,679
Isn't Xiaoshi back today?

780
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,280
We made you some soup.

781
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,199
One is for you,

782
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,320
one is for Xiaoshi.

783
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,119
Very nourishing!

784
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:19,880
Okay, okay.

785
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,880
Hurry up.

786
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,079
Go, go, go.

787
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,360
Don't just focus on romance.

788
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,000
Do something serious!

789
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,360
Hurry.

790
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,199
Do it.

791
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,800
Then let's hurry.

792
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,960
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

793
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,239
This smell is too strong.

794
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,760
No, I need to... hold it in for a bit, take a breather.

795
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,440
Hold it, hold it.

796
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,000
Hold it.

797
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,039
Who is it in the middle of the night?

798
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,079
Who is it?

799
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,119
It's nothing, it's... Second Brother.

800
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,920
That picture Second Brother sent.

801
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,039
A funny picture.

802
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,719
That's not right.

803
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,679
You're hiding something.

804
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,960
It really is Second Brother.

805
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:09,880
Give it here.

806
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,639
What's so interesting about Second Brother's picture?

807
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,440
Well, I'm not interested either.

808
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,679
Alright, go back to bed.

809
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,880
You...

810
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,039
It's a picture not suitable for children.

811
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,039
Don't look, really.

812
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,000
Fine.

813
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,239
I doubt you'd dare do anything behind my back.

814
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,679
I definitely wouldn't dare.

815
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,599
You could give me a hundred guts, I still wouldn't dare.

816
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,079
Honey, I have something serious to tell you.

817
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,159
Quick, come up.

818
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,239
Let me put something on.

819
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,440
It's a bit... a bit chilly.

820
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,639
Chilly? Then cover up a bit.

821
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,400
So, my company

822
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,119
has a relocation opportunity.

823
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,400
To Xi'an.

824
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,719
The salary would increase by fifty percent.

825
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,119
To Xi'an?

826
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,199
Increase by fifty percent?

827
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:20,760
That's a lot.

828
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,599
Yeah.

829
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:23,960
It is a lot.

830
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,480
For how long?

831
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,440
For a year.

832
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,360
A year?

833
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,000
Not coming back for a year?

834
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,800
That... wouldn't work, right?

835
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,519
You... we've been together since...

836
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:35,679
It's been almost a year since we last saw each other.

837
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,000
I know.

838
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,199
But this time is different.

839
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,239
It's not just a pay raise.

840
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,719
There's also a chance to become a director.

841
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,480
Didn't we agree?

842
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,800
To have two children.

843
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,079
We'll definitely need my parents to help.

844
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,480
And your father isn't in good health either.

845
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,000
So he'd have to live with us too.

846
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:56,400
This current place...

847
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,159
...really isn't big enough.

848
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,280
Your parents, my parents,

849
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,880
us two, plus the kids...

850
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,000
This apartment is a bit small.

851
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,000
But look, how about...

852
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,079
...we put this apartment

853
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,199
on the market and sell it first?

854
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:16,480
Then we can find a bigger place.

855
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,800
We'll pay the down payment,

856
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,440
and figure out the rest of the money later.

857
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,320
But you're saying because of this,

858
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,360
you... you're going to Xi'an?

859
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,480
I... I think that's too hard on you.

860
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,199
It's fine, really, it's fine.

861
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,239
If I become a director,

862
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,280
a little hardship won't matter.

863
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,679
That way, you won't have to worry about promotions.

864
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:36,199
The extra time...

865
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,199
...could be used to take care of our dad, right?

866
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,000
Do I have to spell it out for you?

867
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,360
I can't bear to be apart from you.

868
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,199
I can't bear to be apart from you either.

869
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,039
So what you're saying is,

870
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,840
if we had a big house right now,

871
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,960
you wouldn't go to Xi'an, right?

872
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,320
Where would such a good thing come from?

873
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,559
You're dreaming.

874
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,119
Not bad, huh? This idea.
