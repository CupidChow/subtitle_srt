1
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,919
What about you?

2
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,360
And don't try to talk me out of it.

3
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,120
Anyway, regarding Master Sun,

4
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,280
I'm definitely hiring him.

5
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,240
Wait, let's put the Master Sun matter aside for now.

6
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,840
I went back and thought it over carefully.

7
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
Actually, our voting mechanism

8
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
has a bit of a problem.

9
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,240
It always ends in a two-to-two tie, right?

10
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,759
So I was thinking,

11
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,960
we could bring in a new shareholder.

12
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,439
I agree too.

13
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,080
Who are you guys thinking of?

14
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,199
Big Brother.

15
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,199
You can't just add a shareholder casually.

16
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,000
Of course not casually.

17
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,560
If you disagree with the new candidate,

18
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,159
then we can put it to a vote.

19
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,759
Wait.

20
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,759
You're not bringing *him* back, are you?

21
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,360
See?

22
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,000
I told you Second Brother is sharp as a tack.

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,879
I think so too.

24
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,360
Second Brother really is sharp.

25
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,560
I think if we vote again,

26
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,039
we should also hear Sister-in-law's opinion.

27
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,159
Who are you talking about?

28
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,000
Weiguo. Come on in.

29
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,439
Then this time, my vote goes to Weiguo.

30
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,439
Well, well.

31
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,560
You've learned to stage a coup.

32
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,840
Big Brother and Qiu'er both came to beg me.

33
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
I couldn't just refuse them, could I?

34
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,560
Come on, come on.

35
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,840
Sit, sit, sit.

36
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
Come on.

37
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,039
Second Brother, Second Brother, you sit here.

38
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,879
Sit with your Big Brother.

39
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,560
Right next to your Big Brother.

40
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,319
Sit down, sit down.

41
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,560
Yes, yes, come over here.

42
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,759
Sit next to your Big Brother.

43
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,719
Sister-in-law, you sit.

44
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,000
How can I do that?

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,759
I've already bought my ticket.

46
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,839
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow.

47
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,319
Just return the ticket.

48
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,720
I'll cover the service fee.

49
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,439
Alright?

50
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,480
That doesn't seem right.

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,759
What do you mean, doesn't seem right?

52
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,720
Having a home and not returning to it, *that's* not right.

53
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,160
Weiguo.

54
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,720
I want you to stay.

55
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,879
No other meaning behind it.

56
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,319
I just feel

57
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,319
the four of us brothers started this business together.

58
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,279
Let's build Peng Le Xuan back up again.

59
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,879
Let's not have anyone missing.

60
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,720
Right, no one missing, no one.

61
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,120
Big Brother, Qiu'er.

62
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,040
Think about it.

63
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,439
Before, I was the one putting up money to invest.

64
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,600
I still had a say.

65
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,720
But look at me now...

66
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,519
Right? I...

67
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,160
Weiguo, here's the deal.

68
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,319
As long as you're willing to stay,

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
the veto power is still yours.

70
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,399
Right.

71
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,319
We'll follow your lead, Ma Weiguo.

72
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,079
Alright then.

73
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,199
Since Big Brother and Qiu'er have gone this far,

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,639
I'll reluctantly agree.

75
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,199
So exhausting.

76
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,639
Oh, now you're getting carried away.

77
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,199
I propose,

78
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,040
formally propose,

79
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,279
that this Ma Weiguo

80
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,720
joins our Peng Le Xuan Catering Co., Ltd.

81
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,519
as the Operations Director,

82
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,839
and enjoys veto power.

83
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,120
If anyone disagrees,

84
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,639
we'll take a vote.

85
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
We'll... we'll vote.

86
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,959
What's the point of voting now?

87
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,680
Didn't Sister-in-law just state her position?

88
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,399
Look, Second Brother, the way you talk.

89
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,839
We need Weiguo back, don't we?

90
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,839
Since you've all already decided,

91
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,000
my opposition is meaningless.

92
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,959
But you'd better all think clearly.

93
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,560
You all know what kind of person Ma Weiguo is.

94
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,759
When he turns around and bites you hard later,

95
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,399
don't come crying about the pain.

96
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,839
No way, no way.

97
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,160
It won't come to that.

98
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,279
Fine. Since everyone agrees,

99
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,959
let's put what we just discussed

100
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,279
into a contract.

101
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,839
Black and white.

102
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,279
To avoid any disputes later.

103
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:09,920
Right.

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,959
Is that really necessary?

105
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,920
We're running a serious business, right?

106
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,120
There should always be a formal procedure.

107
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,519
Right.

108
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,920
Look.

109
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,279
Here.

110
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,279
Come on, Second Brother.

111
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,480
Sign it. Come on.

112
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,839
Fine, I'll sign.

113
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,720
The smell of conspiracy now

114
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,279
is getting stronger and stronger.

115
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,160
Weiguo.

116
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,600
In the future, if there's anything,

117
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,040
you can also say it in the group chat.

118
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,920
Alright, that Weiguo

119
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,079
Then you'll have a tough road ahead.

120
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,120
Here.

121
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,839
Don't worry, Big Brother.

122
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,040
I'm here to solve problems.

123
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,240
Don't worry.

124
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,680
Let's take it step by step.

125
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,639
They say even brothers should keep clear accounts.

126
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,079
Qiu'er drafted something earlier.

127
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,399
A shareholder agreement.

128
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,720
I've revised and improved a few points.

129
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,040
Let's sign this first.

130
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,439
As for me, I just...

131
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,519
drafted a...

132
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,519
agreement. Take a look first.

133
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,519
You...

134
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,279
After all, I can't just take the profits for free.

135
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,319
In the shareholder rights section,

136
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,000
I've also written my due obligations.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,279
I just think before our investor arrives,

138
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,839
we should get this settled first.

139
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,120
You all look too, see if anything needs adding.

140
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,560
No one said you were taking it for free.

141
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,959
Are you worried

142
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,680
you won't get that five percent stake?

143
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,519
No way.

144
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,759
I just think it's more standard to put it on paper.

145
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,800
For the sake of our operational standards.

146
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,519
What do you think?

147
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,199
Qiu'er.

148
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,120
You said for the four of us brothers to do this together,

149
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,519
I didn't hesitate at all.

150
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,399
I even brought out the shop.

151
00:07:59,399 --> 00:07:59,680
Right.

152
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,199
Why would I sign this with you?

153
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,959
Bro, don't be so casual about it.

154
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,839
Here's the thing.

155
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,399
I've seen how bank accounts with hundreds of millions

156
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,800
are handled.

157
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,079
I'm really doing this for everyone's good.

158
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,839
Let's just operate

159
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,279
properly and formally, okay?

160
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,120
Be a bit more standard.

161
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,519
Look, look.

162
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,480
Last signature.

163
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,519
Weiguo, have some water.

164
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,279
Thanks, Sister-in-law.

165
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,279
All signed, Qiu'er.

166
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:24,680
Good.

167
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,839
Now that everyone's signed,

168
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,519
let me say a few things.

169
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,399
Go ahead.

170
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,879
Let's start with the simple questions.

171
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,720
Alright.

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,639
Qiu'er.

173
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,000
You're getting five percent for free.

174
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,720
You take dividends but still work for the bank.

175
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,039
What tangible contribution do you make to the company?

176
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,960
Why should you get PR funds?

177
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,120
Why should you get reimbursements?

178
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,639
Why should you draw a salary?

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
Weiguo, what are you talking about?

180
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,840
Since Peng Le Xuan opened,

181
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,320
you haven't accomplished anything.

182
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,639
Told to bring in clients, you failed.

183
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,000
Li Lianbao told you to quit your bank job

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,120
and focus on the venture.

185
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,159
You didn't listen, made endless excuses.

186
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,360
You kept telling me you'd work hard.

187
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,840
Are you really trying?

188
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,519
You're just acting like you're trying.

189
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,279
I never said I wouldn't quit.

190
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,399
Doesn't it need a process?

191
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,120
Fine.

192
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,679
Then I'll respect your process.

193
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
First proposal.

194
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,399
Cancel all of Tong Qiu's benefits in this company

195
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,120
until he quits his bank job.

196
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,399
Hold on, Weiguo, look...

197
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,639
Let's let Qiu'er

198
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,759
earn some money there first,

199
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,279
and then talk about it, okay?

200
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,000
Whose side are you on?

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,120
Your big brother is right.

202
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,679
Why stab me in the back first?

203
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,720
I'm on Peng Le Xuan's side.

204
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,879
I support anything good for Peng Le Xuan.

205
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,759
I back it.

206
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,120
I oppose anything bad for Peng Le Xuan.

207
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Am I wrong?

208
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,120
No, Qiu'er, later...

209
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,519
Big Brother.

210
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,399
I and that...

211
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,960
Next is your problem.

212
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,200
Wha... it's my turn already?

213
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,120
What... what's my problem?

214
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,759
Do you think

215
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,159
you have what it takes to be Chairman?

216
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,639
You...

217
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,639
Just because you're the eldest brother?

218
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,759
Right?

219
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,120
Is business a place for seniority

220
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,600
and sentiment?

221
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,960
Let me ask you.

222
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,399
The company has over ten million in the account now.

223
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,679
How will you use it?

224
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,159
Can you tell me clearly?

225
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:22,879
Here's the thing.

226
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,840
A person

227
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,759
needs to know their place.

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,759
Peng Le Xuan is a century-old brand.

229
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,679
It must produce the ancestral flavor.

230
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,960
Your primary duty

231
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,480
is to be the chef.

232
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,120
Proposal two.

233
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,000
Remove Big Brother from the Chairman position.

234
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,519
He remains a shareholder.

235
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,399
Focus on honing his craft from now on.

236
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,879
Apart from roast duck matters,

237
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,320
he can do nothing else.

238
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,200
Ma Weiguo, you're amazing.

239
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,720
I'll toast you.

240
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,879
Chunsheng.

241
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,879
Weiguo, this isn't right, I'm telling you.

242
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,639
How did you come back like this?

243
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,600
Chunsheng, you... stop, stop.

244
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,000
What are you doing? You're crazy.

245
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,679
So, is it my turn next?

246
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,559
You.

247
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,279
You are just too soft-hearted

248
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,519
towards Big Brother and Qiu'er.

249
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,519
Other than that,

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,200
I think you've done alright.

251
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,399
Thank you.

252
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,519
That's my highest praise for you.

253
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,919
However,

254
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,639
the way you sidelined Big Brother,

255
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,120
cutting off all family ties,

256
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,679
makes me quite respect you.

257
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,639
Funny.

258
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,519
The way you used Big Brother and Qiu'er

259
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,399
and then slit their carotid artery in return,

260
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,440
that move also makes me respect you.

261
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,279
Impressive.

262
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,039
You're the impressive one.

263
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,759
Honey, slow down.

264
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:55,000
What are you so angry about?

265
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,159
Big Brother, Big Brother.

266
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,120
I don't think that's right.

267
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,519
We need to have a word with him.

268
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,000
What's there to talk about?

269
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,759
Qiu'er, let me tell you something.

270
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,879
From now on,

271
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,120
don't call me Big Brother anymore.

272
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,639
I'm not worthy.

273
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm an embarrassment.

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,279
What are you talking about?

275
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,639
Honey, look at you getting so worked up

276
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,759
over him.

277
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,320
It's just not worth it.

278
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,279
No, but listen to him.

279
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,000
Did you hear what he just said?

280
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,399
What does he mean, "I need to know my place"?

281
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,639
Let me tell you all something.

282
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,879
I never wanted to be this Chairman in the first place.

283
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:22,519
Right?

284
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,759
But you can't just push me around like that.

285
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,120
Yes, yes, yes.

286
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,879
Right? I mean,

287
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,879
he said he was leaving.

288
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,639
I rushed over to deliver money to him.

289
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,120
Right?

290
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
I even pulled him in

291
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,879
to work on Peng Le Xuan with us.

292
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm just a big fool.

293
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,840
Slow down, mind your back.

294
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,679
You know me,

295
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,799
I don't give up that easily.

296
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,120
The three months aren't up yet.

297
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,879
Right now, there's a perfect opportunity.

298
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,720
If we seize it,

299
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,279
Peng Le Xuan can take off quickly.

300
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,519
The Duck King competition.

301
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,399
Exactly.

302
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,559
I've looked into it.

303
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,279
This competition is different from others.

304
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,919
It's not all flashy.

305
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,679
It's simple.

306
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,919
But also professional.

307
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,639
Within the industry,

308
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,120
it carries some authority.

309
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,399
If Big Brother wants to stand out

310
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,759
in this competition,

311
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
he must regain his old skills.

312
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,360
Rediscover Peng Le Xuan's unique flavor.

313
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,759
There are only a few days left until the competition.

314
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,480
By the time Big Brother recovers his skills,

315
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,039
it'll be too late.

316
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,440
Think it through carefully.

317
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,240
This competition

318
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,559
cannot be lost.

319
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,159
By the way,

320
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,200
do you know who Li Lianbao got the money from?

321
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,159
Kevin.

322
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,240
He really knows how to adapt.

323
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,519
And Kevin's

324
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,639
investment terms are very harsh.

325
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,919
Within six months,

326
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,039
Peng Le Xuan must be pushed

327
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,279
into the top ten rankings on all platforms.

328
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,639
Otherwise, not only will future investments stop,

329
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,159
but even the initial investment funds

330
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,639
must all be returned.

331
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,519
As far as I know,

332
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Big Brother and Qiu'er don't know about this condition.

333
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,159
He hasn't told anyone about this.

334
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,440
He's bearing it all himself.

335
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,279
So, using this point,

336
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,279
as long as we severely hinder Peng Le Xuan's development,

337
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,720
very soon,

338
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,679
Li Lianbao himself won't be able to hold on.

339
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,799
This is also his fatal weakness.

340
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,799
We are definitely going to the competition.

341
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,840
But as for who goes...

342
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,159
that's a secret for now.

343
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,840
I strongly suggest

344
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,559
that Big Brother competes.

345
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,080
Steady and sure.

346
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,679
Don't rush for quick success.

347
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,240
I firmly disagree.

348
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:54,080
Speed is our top priority right now.

349
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,759
Only speed can break through.

350
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,720
Let's agree to disagree.

351
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,639
The wind is about to pick up.

352
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,200
This time is different from before.

353
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,320
Get ready to grow wings.

354
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,200
What nonsense.

355
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,919
Are you crazy?

356
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,320
Old Liu,

357
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,159
I have something big to tell you.

358
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:37,919
Just now,

359
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,399
Ma Weiguo said I'm going to grow wings.

360
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,519
I'm preparing to go against the wind.

361
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,120
We're about to take off.

362
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,519
Yes, yes, yes.

363
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,840
So,

364
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,200
this Duck King competition,

365
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,919
we must place.

366
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,279
And it must be the championship.

367
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,799
After winning, our Peng Le Xuan will take off.

368
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,600
We must be number one in the capital.

369
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,399
You've been lying here all day.

370
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,320
It's time to eat, you need to eat.

371
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,679
Come on, let me see.

372
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,799
What's wrong?

373
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:24,919
Let me feel.

374
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,559
No fever either.

375
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,639
Get up and have a bite.

376
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,399
Listen,

377
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,919
you love chives, right?

378
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,399
Look, I made chives with shrimp for you today.

379
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:41,799
No, I mean...

380
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:42,480
It's super fragrant.

381
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,039
I'm... I'm not hungry.

382
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,519
If you don't want to be in the living room,

383
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,039
you can eat in the room, okay?

384
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,200
Dad, you've been lying down all day.

385
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,320
Get up and move around.

386
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,600
How about I go for a run downstairs,

387
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,399
and you ride your bike to keep me company?

388
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,279
Yes, come on, go for a walk with your son.

389
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,880
You, you need to move.

390
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,799
You've been cooped up all day.

391
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,119
Even your own farts would stink you out.

392
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,759
Go on.

393
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,799
What did you promise Third Uncle back then?

394
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,920
Didn't you agree

395
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,039
to set a good example for me?

396
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,519
Don't mention Ma Weiguo to me.

397
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,920
No, I'm just not hungry.

398
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,200
You two go ahead and eat.

399
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,359
Go on, go.

400
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,799
Close the door.

401
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,440
Mom

402
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,880
I just looked it up online.

403
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,519
Given Dad's current condition,

404
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,599
look what it says online.

405
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,720
A conflict of psychic functions

406
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,240
caused his psychological defense mechanisms

407
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,359
to activate, stirring up the

408
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,440
irreconcilable conflict between his id and superego.

409
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,240
So you're saying...

410
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,680
Son, explain it in plain language.

411
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,279
In plain terms, it means

412
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,279
he's had a shock.

413
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,559
No, you kid, you...

414
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,440
Mom, let me tell you.

415
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,839
Third Uncle did this on purpose.

416
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,279
He told me a couple days ago

417
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,720
he wants to shake Dad out of it,

418
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,880
to get back his old "Baofang Boss" spirit.

419
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,119
What you did,

420
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,519
your intention was good.

421
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,240
But your methods were

422
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,440
a bit too extreme.

423
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
No choice.

424
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,039
A severe illness needs strong medicine.

425
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,799
But Uncle Wang isn't your subordinate.

426
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,880
He's the leader of the Baofang Brothers.

427
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,200
And Wang Fei's father.

428
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
He has his own pride and dignity.

429
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,759
You're so young,

430
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,960
talking like you've seen it all.

431
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,200
I'm just an objective observer.

432
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,680
You're finally here!

433
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,720
Come in, quick.

434
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,480
I'll get it.

435
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:29,279
Sister-in-law, how's Big Brother doing?

436
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,680
Weiguo,

437
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,680
I don't care what your plan is,

438
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,880
but what you said yesterday was too hurtful.

439
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
You always hit right where it hurts.

440
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
That's not right, is it?

441
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,400
He hasn't said a single decent word since he got back.

442
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,079
I really didn't expect

443
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,039
him to be so tactless.

444
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
You really hurt your Big Brother.

445
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,279
Go in and see him.

446
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,200
Alright.

447
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,440
Over there.

448
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,240
Big Brother.

449
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:31,799
Big Brother.

450
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,319
I know I was wrong.

451
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,920
I actually meant well,

452
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,279
I just went too far.

453
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,359
I'm sorry.

454
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,480
Big Brother, look,

455
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,079
he knows he was wrong.

456
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,680
Just calm down, okay?

457
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:50,920
No.

458
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:54,359
No, if you're really that angry,

459
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,519
just give him a beating.

460
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,960
This kid can take a punch anyway.

461
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
Don't worry about my feelings.

462
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,599
Okay?

463
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,680
So?

464
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,240
What's the situation?

465
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,160
I see the food on Big Brother's table is untouched.

466
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,279
Has he not eaten at all?

467
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,680
Exactly! I'm worried sick.

468
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,200
I remember Big Brother loves chive pockets.

469
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,000
How about this:

470
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,960
Sister-in-law, go downstairs and buy a few.

471
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Fresh out of the pan.

472
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,160
Why didn't I think of that?

473
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,079
No, what do you mean?

474
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
Big Brother is in this state,

475
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,279
and you want to buy chive pockets?

476
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,400
Who are you celebrating for?

477
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,559
I have an idea, but don't say it's mean.

478
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,559
I don't care how mean it is.

479
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,960
As long as it cures him.

480
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,680
I'll go get them now.

481
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,519
Thanks, Sister-in-law.

482
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,319
Later on,

483
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,799
let's work together.

484
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,559
Smells amazing. So good.

485
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
You know,

486
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,519
if a person could go without eating or drinking,

487
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,200
wouldn't they become an immortal?

488
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,079
Even if he were an immortal,

489
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,720
he'd know how delicious these chive pockets are.

490
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,359
Yeah.

491
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:38,559
Look at this.

492
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,440
The golden crust, the green filling.

493
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,759
So fragrant.

494
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,519
Bite into it, and the juices flow.

495
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,079
Even Lü Dongbin himself,

496
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,160
would have to open wide

497
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
and eat five or six of them.

498
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,799
Yeah, smells so good, really good.

499
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,039
So good, so good, so good.

500
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,680
So good, so good.

501
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,920
Lianbao, do you smell that?

502
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,839
What smell?

503
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,240
I smell it. What is that?

504
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,720
Seriously.

505
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,279
I know.

506
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,920
See why Big Brother is under the covers?

507
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,519
Yeah.

508
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,200
Big Brother must have wet the bed.

509
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,680
Big Brother wet the bed!

510
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,720
And he's covering it with the blanket

511
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,839
so he doesn't stink up the place for us.

512
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:38,680
See?

513
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Why did he bury his head in there?

514
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,160
He wants

515
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,119
to inhale all the smell himself

516
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,519
to avoid polluting the environment.

517
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,119
How noble of him!

518
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,000
Big Brother still cares about us.

519
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:52,039
You little brat, how mean can you be?

520
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,440
So I'm in bed,

521
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,319
eating and relieving myself in bed,

522
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,000
and popping popcorn in bed too?

523
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,160
Get out!

524
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,079
Out, out, out!

525
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,319
Get out! Out!

526
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,119
Out!

527
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,400
You know what,

528
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,519
if we had some vinegar

529
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,240
and a clove of garlic, it'd be perfect.

530
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,480
Big Brother, smells good, right?

531
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,920
It really does smell good.

532
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,440
Get out! Scram!

533
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,279
Get out!

534
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,519
You saw how Big Brother was just now?

535
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
I was afraid if I said more,

536
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,359
he'd start swinging.

537
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,079
Your trick was really mean.

538
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,440
At least he's willing to get out of bed now.

539
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:46,559
No.

540
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,240
What's wrong?

541
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,279
It's nothing. My blood sugar's a bit low.

542
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,559
Should we go to the hospital?

543
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,680
What hospital?

544
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,759
I think if Big Brother practices his skills now,

545
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,279
there's still enough time.

546
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,720
Don't worry about this.

547
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,960
Trust me, I'm right.

548
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,519
Are you really okay or not?

549
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,279
I'm fine.

550
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,160
Just need something sweet.

551
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,519
No.

552
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,200
Can you not block the TV?

553
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:33,799
No.

554
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,640
I'm saying, how did you mop the floor like this?

555
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:40,559
Can't you see how dirty it is here?

556
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,200
No, I cleaned every nook and cranny.

557
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Look over there, how dirty it is. Look.

558
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,200
No, what are you doing here?

559
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,680
If you're going to eat, eat properly.

560
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,599
Put your phone down.

561
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,599
Finish your meal and go do your homework.

562
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,160
Already finished it.

563
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,400
Finished, so you think you're in the right?

564
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,480
Don't you know exams are coming up?

565
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,200
Go over all the key points again.

566
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,920
Fine.

567
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,720
How did you wipe this table?

568
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,480
Can't you see all these fingerprints?

569
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,039
Look. Come here and look.

570
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:15,799
Look.

571
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,119
No, you need to stop now.

572
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,160
Are you eating or not?

573
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Not hungry.

574
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,720
If you're not hungry, then go back to your room and lie down.

575
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,759
No, I told you to sharpen this knife for me.

576
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,039
Didn't you hear me?

577
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,359
Wang Chunsheng, let me tell you.

578
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,559
If I sharpen this knife,

579
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,079
I'll slaughter you with it.

580
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,680
No, this kitchen floor...

581
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,440
We just finished cooking.

582
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,079
Can you clean it up first?

583
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,359
Is this how responsible people live?

584
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,599
What, are we giving up on this life?

585
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,160
Hurry up!

586
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,000
Dad sees this and thinks,

587
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,200
His illness isn't better yet.

588
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,359
Before it was stillness,

589
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,079
now it's turned into mania.

590
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:28,920
Yeah.

591
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,839
He's gone from one extreme

592
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,200
to the other.

593
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:35,599
Martin.

594
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:38,480
Based on the symptoms you described,

595
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,000
it should be the glioma lesion

596
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,440
compressing the optic nerve.

597
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,440
Martin, this is very dangerous if it continues.

598
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,799
Please come back as soon as possible for a full examination.

599
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,279
Only then can I understand the lesion's progression.

600
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,599
I can't return in the short term.

601
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,240
Martin.

602
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,480
What could be more important than life?

603
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,200
Are you still not considering the surgical option?

604
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,920
No.

605
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:10,759
Thank you.

606
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,400
Goodbye.

607
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,480
Martin?

608
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,079
What's up?

609
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:37,200
Are you busy?

610
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,799
Should I come back later?

611
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,920
No, you finally came.

612
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,160
It must be something important.

613
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,759
Speak.

614
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,319
Forget it, I won't tease you.

615
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,000
What is it?

616
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,799
I know.

617
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,359
It's about Uncle Wang, right?

618
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:54,720
Yes.

619
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,920
I just wanted to...

620
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,920
Your emotional intelligence is pretty high, right?

621
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,240
What should I do now

622
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,680
to make up for the hurt I caused Big Brother?

623
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,000
Doesn't he have a motorcycle?

624
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,920
I think you could surprise him.

625
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,279
Give him a gift related to motorcycles.

626
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,480
Two grown men giving each other gifts...

627
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,440
Wouldn't that be a bit corny?

628
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,960
How could it be?

629
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,599
Do what you want to do.

630
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,000
What does being a man or woman have to do with it?

631
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,680
Just express your sincerity.

632
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,880
But every time I want to do something,

633
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,359
it ends up hurting people.

634
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,799
You know it too.

635
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,000
I've heard.

636
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,559
Give it a try.

637
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:42,680
Alright.

638
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,359
Thanks.

639
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,200
You're welcome.

640
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,599
As for Wang Xiaoai's side,

641
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,599
the situation looks quite threatening.

642
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,920
This might require us to

643
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,039
pay more attention then.

644
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,480
And then, that Master Cao from the duck shop,

645
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,759
his skills are also very strong.

646
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,799
We can observe him more closely then.

647
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,119
Anyway, that's basically the situation.

648
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,039
Nothing else.

649
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:20,079
Okay.

650
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,720
You rushed here in such a hurry to see me,

651
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,039
and now you're not saying anything.

652
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,920
As for me,

653
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,960
I just wanted to explain something.

654
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,119
I must sign Master Sun.

655
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,759
I really need him.

656
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,599
We each rely on our own abilities.

657
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,400
You won this round.

658
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,759
I have nothing to say.

659
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,720
Qianqian.

660
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,839
Are you angry?

661
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,039
You're overthinking it.

662
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,039
Is there anything else?

663
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,240
If not, you can leave.

664
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,599
How about we cooperate?

665
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,880
Think about it.

666
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,640
This isn't just good for the two of us.

667
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,119
It's good for Big Brother, for Qiu'er, for everyone.

668
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:32,920
Furthermore,

669
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:35,680
all of us grew up together.

670
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,279
Don't you care about them at all?

671
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,000
I care about them in other ways.

672
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,200
What?

673
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,480
Do I have to drag them into a partnership together

674
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,839
for it to count as caring?

675
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,240
It's you.

676
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,359
You always mix business with personal feelings.

677
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,000
Because of that,

678
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,279
I don't want to cooperate with you.

679
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,839
No, I can tell the difference when it matters.

680
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,279
If you don't believe me,

681
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,279
there's nothing I can do.

682
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,359
But I must succeed in this.

683
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,480
You'll see.

684
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,279
Lianbao.

685
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,759
There are many ways

686
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,039
to achieve success.

687
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,160
I don't think you need to put

688
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,359
such a heavy burden on yourself.

689
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,599
You're not their brother,

690
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,839
so of course you don't understand.

691
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,440
When that incident happened,

692
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,799
Ma Weiguo just up and left.

693
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,200
He only came back after all these years.

694
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,839
When Big Brother got out of prison,

695
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,160
he lost all his authority.

696
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,240
And Qiu'er? He never shoulders any responsibility.

697
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,759
So what could I do?

698
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,599
I had to step up and be the leader.

699
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,799
I'm the second brother.

700
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,160
I shouldn't have to deal with any of this.

701
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,119
But if I don't,

702
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,839
the brothers will truly fall apart.

703
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
You could do this:

704
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,799
hand Peng Le Xuan over to me.

705
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,160
I'll make proper arrangements for each of you.

706
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,039
Impossible.

707
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,160
Then I'd really be letting Big Brother down for life.

708
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,039
Fine.

709
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,839
Is there anything else?

710
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,359
You really should leave now.

711
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,200
Qianqian.

712
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,240
Please reconsider.

713
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,599
I won't see you out.

714
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,640
I'm sorry.

715
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,720
I can't lose.

716
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,519
What are you doing?

717
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,840
Don't you touch my motorcycle!

718
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:35,000
No, I, I...

719
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,119
I... I was trying to...

720
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,199
What were you trying to do?

721
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,440
I know what you're thinking.

722
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,480
You think I can't even raise my own son properly.

723
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,239
Right?

724
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,360
My roast duck isn't that great either.

725
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,000
Right?

726
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,519
And I'm no good at being

727
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,800
some lousy Chairman, right?

728
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,679
And now you dare touch my motorcycle?

729
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,800
What's wrong with you?

730
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,199
You're not happy when I work.

731
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,840
You're not happy when I do nothing.

732
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,119
You come to my house to disgust me.

733
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,239
Are you unhappy even when I breathe?

734
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,119
Uncle Wang.

735
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,280
Uncle Wang, you've misunderstood.

736
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,719
Uncle Ma got new parts for you.

737
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,320
He wanted to upgrade your bike.

738
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:08,840
Careful, careful!

739
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,239
Don't give me that routine!

740
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,679
You think I'm a three-year-old?

741
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,639
Hit me, then rub it better?

742
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,920
Offer me a couple of sweet dates?

743
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:19,880
Uncle Wang, Uncle Ma's hand is covered in blood.

744
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,679
Don't say anymore.

745
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,400
Let's go.

746
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,639
Sometimes I really don't understand

747
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,039
what you men are thinking.

748
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,320
If you have something to say,

749
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,239
why not just say it directly?

750
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:12,440
Gently.

751
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:12,840
Bear with it.

752
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,199
Be gentle.

753
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:14,760
Okay.

754
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,000
Does it hurt?

755
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,760
I just wanted to help him get back on his feet.

756
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,800
I didn't mean to put on a sob story.

757
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,840
It just proves your trick didn't work.

758
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,880
Stubborn.

759
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,679
Gently, slowly.

760
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,360
So you *do* know it hurts?

761
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,400
Of course.

762
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,320
It looks painful.

763
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:55,360
Done?

764
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,800
Okay, wait a second.

765
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,599
Don't shake it.

766
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,400
There.

767
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,280
Thanks.

768
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,000
You're welcome.

769
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,440
Excuse me.

770
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,599
Could you help me return this, please?

771
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,559
Thank you.

772
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,679
I just bought it the day before yesterday, never used it.

773
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,239
I'm sorry, sir.

774
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,880
This bag is not from our store.

775
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,199
But the receipt says your store.

776
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:13,639
How is it not? This...

777
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,880
How is this bag I bought myself not from here?

778
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,360
Take another look.

779
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,920
It's definitely from your store.

780
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,599
When did you come to buy it?

781
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,480
Did you come buy this bag yourself?

782
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
A friend of mine came to buy it.

783
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,199
Please look again.

784
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,639
The receipt is genuine,

785
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,719
but this is absolutely not our store's bag.

786
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,719
Honey, I'm catching an early flight, leaving now.

787
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,079
Text me when you get to the airport.

788
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:53,840
The bag...

789
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,480
I...

790
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,880
This... I'm so sorry.

791
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,400
I took the wrong one.

792
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,280
You can mix up a bag worth tens of thousands?

793
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,239
If you're going to lie, make it believable.

794
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,159
Manager!

795
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:19,880
Xiaofeng, what's going on?

796
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,039
This person brought a fake bag to return.

797
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:22,880
No, no, no!

798
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,039
There's a bit of a misunderstanding.

799
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:25,000
Yes, how do I explain...

800
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,840
My bag...

801
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,039
I... I left it at home.

802
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,639
No, I left...

803
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:31,599
Okay, okay, um, I...

804
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,519
No, like this.

805
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:33,519
I'll leave this bag here as collateral.

806
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:35,159
I'll bring you the real bag, okay?

807
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:35,920
Don't you leave.

808
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
No, this, this... really, there's...

809
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,920
If you... if you don't believe me, then I'll have to...

810
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,039
Otherwise... otherwise I'll call... call the police.

811
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:45,360
Let the... police officers clear... clear my name.

812
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,440
How about this?

813
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,480
I'll call them myself.
