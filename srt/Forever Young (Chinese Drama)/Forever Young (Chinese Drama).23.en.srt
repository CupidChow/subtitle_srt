1
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,120
What are you doing here?

2
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,120
Your friend came to the company looking for me.

3
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,319
Said they wanted to hold a funeral for you.

4
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,519
Scared the hell out of me.

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,599
The equity matter is non-negotiable.

6
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,319
Wait a second.

7
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,799
I'm not here to talk about that.

8
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,319
The equity is yours to begin with.

9
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,360
You can do whatever you want with it.

10
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,280
All the investigations have been dropped.

11
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,599
No one will bother you anymore.

12
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,319
Old Ma.

13
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,560
We've known each other for over a decade now.

14
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,879
I don't know.

15
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,199
All these years...

16
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,240
...if we ever were real friends or brothers.

17
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,680
I don't know that either.

18
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,240
How did we end up like this?

19
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,680
I always thought before...

20
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,360
...you were too rational.

21
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,360
Too cold.

22
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,800
That you didn't even have friends.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,319
But this time...

24
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,240
...someone actually jumped in.

25
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,800
To take that hit for you.

26
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,560
All these years...

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,280
I was the one who misjudged you.

28
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
The one who truly has no friends...

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,639
...is me.

30
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
I won't go in.

32
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,840
Live well.

33
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,759
Don't let your friends down.

34
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:43,759
I'm off.

35
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,080
After this meal, you can get ready to go back.

36
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,319
I'm not leaving.

37
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,560
My injury isn't healed yet.

38
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,280
My head hurts.

39
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,000
Fine then.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,280
You stay here and recuperate.

41
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,039
I'll go back first.

42
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,199
Where are you going?

43
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,319
I'll wait for you in the hutong.

44
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,079
Stop teasing me all the time.

45
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,519
Piss me off and I'll really hit you.

46
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,519
Who's scared of you?

47
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,040
You think just 'cause I'm sick I can't beat you?

48
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,639
I've... I've figured it out.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,759
When are you leaving?

50
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:32,800
Not telling you.

51
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,600
You're impossible.

52
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,959
Big Brother and Qiu'er are waiting.

53
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,399
Hurry up.

54
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,600
Alright, just eat. You're so naggy.

55
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,279
Good morning, Manager Jia.

56
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,319
What? What is it?

57
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,639
If you have something to say, say it. Stop being so secretive.

58
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,959
Good morning, Manager Tong.

59
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,839
What's your problem?

60
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,040
What did I do to you?

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,319
What do you mean?

62
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,759
About that Xi'an client...

63
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,480
Why did you set me up?

64
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,040
What are you talking about?

65
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,839
I was kind enough to refer a client to you.

66
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,959
And now I'm the bad guy?

67
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,800
Director Qiu says I've been spreading rumors about her.

68
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,639
You're the one who told her that, right?

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,720
Brother Tong.

70
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,639
You can't just throw accusations around.

71
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,439
Do you have proof?

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,279
Fine. I don't know how to play these mind games.

73
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,680
All these twists and turns, I don't get it.

74
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,720
I just have one thing to say.

75
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,040
If you have a problem with me...

76
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,639
...have the decency to tell me to my face, okay?

77
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,160
Tong Qiu.

78
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,319
Why are you playing dumb with me?

79
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,480
Everyone in the bank knows...

80
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,839
...you've been eyeing the Assistant Manager position.

81
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,000
Now that I've snatched it...

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
...you can't possibly be okay with that.

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,839
If I don't deal with you...

84
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,439
...I'll be waiting for you to deal with me.

85
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,839
Is it that in your eyes...

86
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,720
...if you're not scheming against others...

87
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,279
...it means they're scheming against you?

88
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,279
Exactly.

89
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,360
Weiguo is back.

90
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,160
Uncle Dong.

91
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,839
Don't move.

92
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,279
Don't just stand there. Get inside.

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,120
Big Brother. Qiu'er.

94
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,600
Weiguo... you're back.

95
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,600
Big Brother.

96
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,439
Big Brother.

97
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,360
I just want you to remember this.

98
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,519
This is your home.

99
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Even if you die...

100
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,920
...you die in China and get buried in Beijing.

101
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,279
Brother.

102
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,519
Yes, you, you, you...

103
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,720
You're back. Coming back is what matters.

104
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,519
Just being back is enough.

105
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,279
Get out of the way.

106
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,519
What now?

107
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,879
I'm a grown man, and you're still hitting me?

108
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,439
Okay, okay.

109
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,439
Calm down, calm down.

110
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,360
Yes, yes, yes.

111
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,279
Are you okay?

112
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Quick, sit down.

113
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,680
Have some water.

114
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,600
Well...

115
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,240
Let me just say, Big Brother really...

116
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,160
...shouldn't have hit you.

117
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,240
The words are rough, but the meaning is right.

118
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,360
Medical standards in China are very, very good now.

119
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,279
Just come back to Beijing.

120
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,199
They'll definitely be able to cure your illness.

121
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,639
Don't... don't leave again, okay?

122
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,879
Don't worry, I won't leave.

123
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,519
I'll stay.

124
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,439
I'll see Peng Le Xuan open for business.

125
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,439
And I'll see this plaque hung back up.

126
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,879
That's all I needed to hear.

127
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,759
Right, yeah.

128
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,080
I'll pick a date.

129
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,200
Alright, I'll head back first.

130
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,759
Go back and rest for now.

131
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,120
I'm sorry, Big Brother.

132
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,480
Let me help you carry it back then.

133
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,240
No, no, it's fine, Big Brother.

134
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,200
Let me help you.

135
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,080
No, really.

136
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Heading out?

137
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
I was just looking for you.

138
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,159
What's up?

139
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,240
Nothing.

140
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,559
I'm back.

141
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,279
So you're back. Big deal.

142
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,039
Since you didn't bother telling anyone when you left,

143
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,360
you don't need to announce your return to me either.

144
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,039
Besides,

145
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,240
you're back. So what?

146
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,840
Should I roll out the red carpet?

147
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,799
Where are you going?

148
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,039
You've worked hard.

149
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,799
That trip must've been exhausting.

150
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,360
Getting him back this time

151
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,000
was a real pain in the neck.

152
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,519
Being gentle didn't work.

153
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,679
Being harsh was tricky to get right.

154
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,159
Yeah, I totally get you.

155
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,200
I didn't dare bring up his illness either.

156
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,679
I was afraid one wrong word

157
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,399
and he'd just vanish again.

158
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,039
Let's gather up all the stuff

159
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,159
like the diagnosis from the doctors

160
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,480
and the treatment plans

161
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
from this whole period.

162
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,080
Alright.

163
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,639
Then I'll talk to him.

164
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,600
No matter what, I'm the Big Brother.

165
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,039
He might actually listen to a word or two from me.

166
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,039
Yes, definitely.

167
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,960
As for nutrition,

168
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,360
I'll make him more

169
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,679
of those nourishing soups and stuff.

170
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,799
Okay, no problem.

171
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,679
On my end, I'll

172
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,840
just be responsible for keeping an eye on him.

173
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,279
Luckily, things at the bank aren't too busy lately.

174
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,639
Plus, I'm back to see my parents anyway.

175
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,840
I'll watch him closely.

176
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,639
I'll handle all the trivial stuff at Peng Le Xuan.

177
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,480
You guys focus on taking good care of him.

178
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,200
I'll also try to figure something out with the hospital.

179
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,360
I still think he should have the surgery as soon as possible.

180
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,600
Then it's settled.

181
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,039
Okay.

182
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,240
Right, and about your side,

183
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,960
all those plans and things from the doctors,

184
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,679
give them to me.

185
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,519
I'll compile everything together later.

186
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,240
Alright, I'm heading back too.

187
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,039
Gotta adjust to the time difference.

188
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,960
Right, right.

189
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,279
Thanks for your hard work, Second Brother.

190
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,279
It's nothing.

191
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
How are you getting back?

192
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,039
How? I'll grab a cab, I guess.

193
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,679
Wait, should I give you a ride on my bike?

194
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,559
No, no need. You guys go on back.

195
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,559
Take it easy.

196
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,120
Don't drive yourself. Call a designated driver.

197
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,799
I know.

198
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,639
Hey, do you think I went a bit too hard on him just now?

199
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,320
Where are you going?

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,840
Weiguo.

201
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:39,840
Big Brother.

202
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,320
What is it?

203
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,000
Uh, nothing.

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,399
I... I want to talk to you.

205
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,279
You still want to fight?

206
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,879
No, let's go inside and talk.

207
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,080
Well...

208
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,559
About earlier...

209
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,159
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,080
You know, people...

211
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,399
Sometimes, it's pretty amazing, isn't it?

212
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,399
Take me, for example.

213
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,639
For no reason at all,

214
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,279
my blood sugar went haywire.

215
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,759
I said, I'll go see a doctor.

216
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,279
The doctor gave me a diagnosis.

217
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,000
Then prescribed me medicine.

218
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,039
And gave me guidance,

219
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,759
telling me how to manage myself.

220
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,799
I was super serious about it.

221
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,759
I followed the regimen strictly.

222
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,120
But I just didn't get better.

223
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,200
Then suddenly,

224
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,279
I don't know, with all these

225
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,840
changes in life from all sides,

226
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,759
I suddenly got better.

227
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,159
Maybe it's just that

228
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,440
all those years of

229
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,320
conflict between us got resolved.

230
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,399
I went back to the doctor for a check-up,

231
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,879
and guess what?

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,399
I'm fine now.

233
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,799
Isn't that something?

234
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,360
That's great.

235
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,399
There are also people who...

236
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,399
You know, when a doctor gives someone a death sentence...

237
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,200
But then...

238
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,399
Heaven just won't take them.

239
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,759
Take, for example, Grandpa Du from our backyard.

240
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,519
They said he had a growth in his belly.

241
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,120
That was, what, two years ago.

242
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
The doctor said he only had a few days left.

243
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,879
And then what happened?

244
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,799
This morning, I saw Grandpa Du...

245
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,559
holding a huge bowl of zhajiang noodles...

246
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,639
and he polished off the whole bowl himself.

247
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
Tell me, isn't that just miraculous?

248
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:38,919
Pretty miraculous.

249
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,159
It's just too amazing.

250
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,519
Big Brother, just say what you mean.

251
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,200
It's just that I wanted to tell you this.

252
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,639
When a person is alive...

253
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,279
they gotta have, you know, that belief.

254
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,960
We can't give up when we shouldn't.

255
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,120
I understand.

256
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,799
But let's skip the roundabout talk.

257
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,000
Let's not talk about it, okay?

258
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,120
No, I know, I know.

259
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,000
I know, Weiguo.

260
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,919
I know you definitely don't like hearing this stuff.

261
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,120
But Big Brother, I have to say...

262
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,639
If you're sick, you can't hide from it, right?

263
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,480
You should get treatment if you need it, right?

264
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,279
If you need surgery, then get surgery.

265
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,279
Isn't that right?

266
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,840
We... we can't let this illness off the hook.

267
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,639
Let me tell you...

268
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,360
While you were gone this time...

269
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
I searched online.

270
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,480
Feifei helped search too.

271
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,799
Your sister-in-law helped make calls.

272
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,000
Asking around everywhere.

273
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,120
And then...

274
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,279
All the major hospitals in Beijing...

275
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,000
the ones related to your condition...

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,440
I've been to every single one.

277
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,360
It's just like when you had me go with you...

278
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,799
to investigate all the major roast duck restaurants.

279
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,000
I wrote a summary.

280
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,399
You... you should take a look when you have time.

281
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,000
Big Brother, I just got back.

282
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,759
My butt hasn't even warmed the seat yet.

283
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,399
Not only hasn't it warmed up...

284
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,159
I even got hit by you a few times.

285
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,799
And now you're trying to kick me out?

286
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,919
No, what do you mean?

287
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,240
No.

288
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,279
Haven't I sought medical help myself, Big Brother?

289
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,879
These doctors you found...

290
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,080
haven't I looked for them myself?

291
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,480
Is it that I don't want to treat an illness that should be treated?

292
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,159
If I need surgery, wouldn't I get it?

293
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,799
Besides surgery...

294
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,320
the medicine I should take, the treatments I should do...

295
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,039
the check-ups I should get, I haven't missed a single one.

296
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,159
But I'm begging you, don't...

297
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,480
don't always focus all your attention on me.

298
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,039
Let's just be like before.

299
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,360
Interact the way we used to.

300
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,519
Do what we should do.

301
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,080
Stop treating me like a patient all the time, okay?

302
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,799
Do you agree or not?

303
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,639
Aren't we dealing with an illness right now?

304
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,399
Yes, yes, I'm sick.

305
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,360
But do you agree?

306
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,320
If you don't agree, I... I'll leave again.

307
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,159
No, don't, don't, let's, let's...

308
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,399
Calm down, will you?

309
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,240
Let's both take a step back.

310
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,879
I won't try to persuade you anymore.

311
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:30,759
I... I won't say another word, okay?

312
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,799
And you...

313
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,240
you absolutely have to take responsibility...

314
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,480
for your own health.

315
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,919
Big Brother.

316
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,240
My body is my own.

317
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,960
How could I...

318
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,360
not be responsible for my own body?

319
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,960
Alright.

320
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,759
Don't see me as a patient.

321
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,159
If you have things to do, go do them.

322
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,320
Okay, okay, okay.

323
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,080
Then please, don't treat me like a patient.

324
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,480
Rest assured.

325
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,240
I'm not a child either, okay?

326
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,159
Yes, I know, I know.

327
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,879
Big Brother won't say another word.

328
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,639
You said it.

329
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,639
Not a single word more.

330
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,919
I won't say another word.

331
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:56,639
Good.

332
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,279
Anything else?

333
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,799
You rest, okay?

334
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,039
No more talking. I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

335
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,640
You said you wouldn't say another word, right?

336
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,839
Don't misunderstand.

337
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,319
I'm not leaving without saying goodbye.

338
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,720
I hope you...

339
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,279
really don't misunderstand me.

340
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,440
Okay?

341
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,640
Oh, right.

342
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,680
Tomorrow, I want to go hunt for some old items.

343
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,640
Come with me.

344
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,279
Thanks.

345
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,160
If you're not resting...

346
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,240
just reply to me.

347
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
How did you get in?

348
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,400
My door was locked.

349
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,920
The code is your birthday.

350
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,640
Can't remember any other numbers.

351
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,039
Yeah, my memory's shot.

352
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,200
*Your* memory's shot?

353
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,720
There aren't many people with a worse memory than yours.

354
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,519
What do you want?

355
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,279
I've been swamped at the bank lately.

356
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,720
Commuting from the bank back to the Fifth Ring Road...

357
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,400
It's too much hassle.

358
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,079
So I came here to crash for a few days.

359
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:30,920
Alright then.

360
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,319
You... you go stay at a hotel.

361
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,279
No, no, no.

362
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:33,720
I'll pay for it.

363
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,640
Don't bother, don't bother.

364
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,279
What a waste of money, seriously.

365
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,079
I know.

366
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,079
Big Brother and Lianbao sent you to keep an eye on me, right?

367
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,519
No.

368
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,079
That was my own idea.

369
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,720
You're overthinking it.

370
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,160
Really.

371
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,720
I get it.

372
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,960
You're worried I'll snore in my sleep.

373
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,039
And disturb you, right?

374
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:58,839
Not this time.

375
00:18:58,839 --> 00:18:59,920
Brought a magic weapon.

376
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:02,839
This thing.

377
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,599
As long as I tighten it like this...

378
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,720
I definitely won't snore.

379
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,839
Also...

380
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
If that really doesn't work...

381
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
You can try this.

382
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,960
You put this on...

383
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,400
You won't even hear thunder.

384
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,640
That powerful?

385
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,519
Try it.

386
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,400
You think I'm an idiot?

387
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,960
What are you doing? You're really...

388
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,640
Can't find that one. Move aside.

389
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,720
Fine.

390
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,200
Forget it. Here, here, here.

391
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,400
What?

392
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,400
Alright, alright. You... just get out.

393
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,839
Don't... don't interrupt my drinking.

394
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,640
What are you doing?

395
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:44,920
This is really good liquor.

396
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
What kind is it?

397
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,160
Eighteenth Generation.

398
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,519
You usually keep such good liquor...

399
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,200
And don't share it with your brother?

400
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,759
That's a bit disloyal.

401
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,599
You crash here, and then you...

402
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,720
You even steal my liquor?

403
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Too strong.

404
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,200
Good stuff.

405
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,079
Tastes good, huh?

406
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:12,640
Good, good.

407
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,400
Fine, I'll have some.

408
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,079
Wait, wait.

409
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,200
Why are you so stingy?

410
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,400
Over a little liquor?

411
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,920
Darn it.

412
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,400
Big Brother and Lianbao sent you to keep an eye on me...

413
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,839
They didn't tell you to finish my liquor.

414
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:26,839
No, really, they didn't.

415
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,400
Why do you overthink everything? Seriously.

416
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
You're too suspicious.

417
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,640
You think I'm stupid?

418
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,079
Starting to feel a buzz.

419
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,839
Order some takeout for me.

420
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,319
Smashed cucumber, peanuts.

421
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,960
Not fried peanuts.

422
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Those make you gain weight.

423
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,319
Alright.

424
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,839
Get some boiled peanuts.

425
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,319
Fine.

426
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,400
Or maybe I'll help you set up...

427
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
...a copper hot pot, okay?

428
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,000
That's great! We'll eat together.

429
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,359
I'm buzzed.

430
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,039
Walk, walk, walk in a straight line.

431
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,920
The campaign's not done, the hero's life is gone.

432
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,359
Leaving heroes' tears to stain their robes forever.

433
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,240
What's the next line?

434
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,920
Not important.

435
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:43,720
A thousand cups of wine, but few true friends.

436
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,839
Drink the wine dry.

437
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,000
Tonight, we won't return until we're drunk.

438
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,160
Morning.

439
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,799
Morning.

440
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,799
Why are you always running out lately?

441
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,000
Aren't you planning a photography exhibition?

442
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,000
Should I make a few more frames for you?

443
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,680
I've been looking for a venue recently.

444
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,079
Venues are really hard to find lately.

445
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,960
I hear you need to book them months in advance.

446
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,599
And there's all this material to submit.

447
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,440
How about this...

448
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,440
Let me handle it for you.

449
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,720
You don't owe me anything.

450
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,839
There's no need for you to help me.

451
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,279
You're still angry with me?

452
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,640
Angry with you?

453
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,519
Being angry with you would mean I'm throwing a tantrum.

454
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,640
But I'm not doing that now.

455
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,279
I'm telling you very calmly and objectively.

456
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,839
What's past is past.

457
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,480
Don't take it to heart either.

458
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,359
I have a lot of things to take care of.

459
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,640
I won't chat with you here anymore.

460
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,039
Then can't I, as an elder, just show some concern for you?

461
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:26,960
Uncle Ma.

462
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,359
This arrogant habit of yours...

463
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,640
...you really can't change it, can you?

464
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,160
Weiguo.

465
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,279
No, he... he... he's inside.

466
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,319
Don't get the wrong idea, I...

467
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,680
He refused to leave my place yesterday.

468
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,000
Weirdo.

469
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,960
Feifei? What are you doing here?

470
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,039
Where's Jin Tong?

471
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,319
Sister Tongtong went out to take care of some business.

472
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,680
My dad sent me to find Sister Tongtong.

473
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,559
To coordinate the opening publicity for Peng Le Xuan.

474
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,799
I'm working on the proposal.

475
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,200
It's pretty complicated.

476
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,519
Don't you have homework?

477
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,559
I finished it.

478
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,920
By the way, Feifei.

479
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,640
This publicity thing is quite complex.

480
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,559
Maybe I should help.

481
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,400
It's fine, Uncle.

482
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,960
That self-media account of my dad's...

483
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,480
...I'm running it really well now.

484
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,799
This bit of publicity...

485
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,400
...I can definitely handle it beautifully.

486
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,319
Don't you worry.

487
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,799
You and your dad get along so well now?

488
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,599
Yeah.

489
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,160
My relationship with him...

490
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,440
...is none of your concern, Uncle.

491
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,319
Are you sure you don't need help?

492
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:01,839
No.

493
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,960
See? I'll be done in no time.

494
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,559
Uncle, maybe you should go home and rest.

495
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,319
Alright then.

496
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,319
You go ahead.

497
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,279
Okay, bye.

498
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:47,920
Morning.

499
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,759
Morning, Manager Tong.

500
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,079
The ones below are all from this side.

501
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:16,839
Yes, yes, yes.

502
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:17,599
Right.

503
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,839
When we interact like this...

504
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,079
It's fine.

505
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,559
Feifei and I...

506
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,960
We're just discussing this...

507
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,720
...thing about the self-media account.

508
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,480
In the group chat.

509
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,200
Come on, come on.

510
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,079
Let's take a photo for him then.

511
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,480
To put his mind at ease.

512
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,839
Did Third Uncle need you for something?

513
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
It's nothing.

514
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,920
He's just been thinking about...

515
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,839
...helping out with the work.

516
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,079
Let him rest for a bit.

517
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,759
So, let's continue with this.

518
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,960
Anyway, Jin Tong and I think...

519
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,559
...we should not only do a live stream for the opening...

520
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,559
...but also make a promotional video about you.

521
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,920
The main theme is your comeback story...

522
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,160
...starting with you bravely winning the Duck King title.

523
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,440
Then gradually transition into...

524
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
...the entire century-long history of Peng Le Xuan.

525
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,279
Then we'll need to gather more footage, right?

526
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,960
We'll need a lot of material.

527
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,599
Right?

528
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,680
Jin Tong said she's writing the shot list.

529
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,400
Then she'll film you properly when she gets back.

530
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,480
So I'll need to tidy myself up properly then, huh?

531
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,319
Absolutely.

532
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,480
Lift your foot.

533
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,279
When people see that video later...

534
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,559
...tons of people will like and comment.

535
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,720
You'll see then.

536
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,319
We'll attract a wave, a huge wave of fans.

537
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,480
Look at you two.

538
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,559
When things were bad, you were like enemies.

539
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,559
Now you're as close as brothers.

540
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,519
What do you mean 'brothers'?

541
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,920
This is my son, okay?

542
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,799
Here, son, have some water.

543
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:18,319
Alright.

544
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:23,160
You, drink more, drink more.

545
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,559
We definitely need to increase...

546
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,599
...the foot traffic to our Peng Le Xuan store.

547
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,200
Don't think I don't know...

548
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,640
...you were just secretly taking ugly photos of me.

549
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,559
I wouldn't dare!

550
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,000
It was Weiguo.

551
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
He can't sit still and insisted on coming to help.

552
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,720
I told him you're here...

553
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,279
...so there's no place for him to be useful.

554
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:08,079
You all need to urge him to get the surgery soon.

555
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,599
He can't keep putting it off like this.

556
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,519
Him...

557
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,039
...he's as stubborn as you are.

558
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,359
Once he decides something, no one can change his mind.

559
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:16,359
Alright, alright.

560
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,759
Don't drag me into this.

561
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,079
You get back to work.

562
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,519
There's a ton to do for the opening.

563
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,319
I'm really not used to working in a place like this.

564
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,079
You have to watch your manners even for a burp or a fart.

565
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,559
How about...

566
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,599
...going to my place?

567
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,359
I don't mean anything by it.

568
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,240
I just think...

569
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,880
...it's more comfortable at home.

570
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,160
You don't have to lower your voice when talking.

571
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,279
I've already sent you the media invite list.

572
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,079
Take a look.

573
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,680
See if there's anything else to add.

574
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,880
As for the specific promotion plan...

575
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,319
...let's wait until Jin Tong's footage is ready...

576
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,839
...and see how it looks before deciding.

577
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,000
Also...

578
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,799
...the opening day customer appreciation activities...

579
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,000
...I've already drafted them.

580
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,559
The discount level...

581
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,680
...see if you need to discuss it with Big Brother again.

582
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,559
I just had an idea.

583
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,799
For the first month after opening...

584
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:27,039
...we could reach out to some niche...

585
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,359
...but well-reviewed drinks and beverages...

586
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,680
...and do a collaboration.

587
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,880
That could work, but...

588
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,240
...can we negotiate it in such a short time?

589
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,920
Did you forget what I used to do?

590
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,000
Big data is at my fingertips.

591
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,480
We'll screen...

592
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,599
...the ones who are interested.

593
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,920
We'll schedule meetings with them ASAP.

594
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:47,920
Okay.

595
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Maybe we should change locations after all.

596
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:54,480
What we're discussing is business secrets.

597
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,880
Li Lianbao!

598
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,559
Use that cleverness of yours...

599
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,240
...on proper work, okay?

600
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:00,720
I...

601
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,319
If you don't get to work soon...

602
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,240
...then I'll take this stuff home to work on it.

603
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,960
What did I say?

604
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,119
You're the one with the dirty mind.

605
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,839
Fine, I have a dirty mind.

606
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,240
No, no, no.

607
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,599
I won't say anymore, okay?

608
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,039
Work, work, work.

609
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,839
Look at the invite list, hurry up.

610
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:29,519
Okay, okay, okay.

611
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,680
You have to give me a ride.

612
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,920
Why?

613
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,799
My car is restricted today.

614
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,000
Restricted?

615
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,640
How come I remember your car isn't restricted?

616
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:52,920
You must be remembering wrong.

617
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,599
What are you doing?

618
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,079
Let's not beat around the bush.

619
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,280
I don't believe you don't have feelings for me.

620
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,559
Aren't you just afraid...

621
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,639
...that people will gossip behind our backs?

622
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,719
We can just date each other.

623
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,400
We just won't tell them, okay?

624
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,519
No, let go of me first.

625
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,440
Can we talk properly? You're...

626
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,199
I won't let go.

627
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,760
I didn't hold on before.

628
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,840
This time, I'm not letting go no matter what.

629
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:37,079
Why are you acting like a child?

630
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,000
Li Lianbao.

631
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,760
Our relationship...

632
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,000
...isn't that simple.

633
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,840
Think about it.

634
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,880
I have to take care of my kid and focus on work.

635
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,599
Right now, I just...

636
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,239
...have no mind for a relationship at all.

637
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,039
Besides...

638
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,039
I think for us in the future...

639
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,320
...there won't be a happy ending either.

640
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,559
You're just overthinking it.

641
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,280
I just feel...

642
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,719
...comfortable being with you.

643
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,559
I just like being with you.

644
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:09,360
Fine, then let go of my hand first.

645
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,760
No, you're...

646
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,400
Let go!

647
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,480
Let's both go back and think it over properly.

648
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Okay?

649
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,239
You... hurry up, let me go!

650
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,760
No, I won't. I just won't.

651
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,079
What more is there to consider?

652
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,519
Stop hesitating, okay?

653
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,559
Let go!

654
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,239
No!

655
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:31,760
Let go!

656
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,320
No!

657
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,280
Are you stupid?

658
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,480
I am too stupid.

659
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,559
Otherwise, all these years...

660
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,599
...we wouldn't always fight whenever we meet.

661
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
No, does it hurt?

662
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,599
It's fine.

663
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,119
All these years, I've just been annoying you.

664
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,000
Letting you vent a little is okay.

665
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,039
Me...

666
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,199
...I'll never stop getting annoyed with you in this lifetime.

667
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,360
So, you're saying yes?

668
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,599
I didn't say yes.

669
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,639
Alright then.

670
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,039
I'm leaving.

671
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:29,480
You... so annoying, so mean! You're...

672
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,320
You actually did say yes.

673
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,800
I didn't.

674
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:33,880
Still pretending.

675
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,159
You're so annoying!

676
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,840
Hey... there are so many people here.

677
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,480
Getting shy now?

678
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,000
Shut up!

679
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,760
So annoying!

680
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,000
Seatbelt.

681
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,800
This crappy car.

682
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,480
The seatbelt is so hard to buckle.

683
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,840
You're back.

684
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
How did you get in?

685
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,920
I already changed the passcode.

686
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,320
I figured you'd change the passcode.

687
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,679
So I registered my fingerprint.

688
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:20,360
You have some nerve!

689
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,679
You even cleared out all my liquor?

690
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,360
Just storing it at my mom's place for now.

691
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,159
Don't worry about it.

692
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,440
Who told you to do this?

693
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,719
Get out! Get out!

694
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,960
Out!

695
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,079
You can't drink right now.

696
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,400
Don't you know your own limits?

697
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:41,800
Don't you think it hurts us to see you drink like this?

698
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,960
Acting like a child.

699
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,760
Not listening to anyone.

700
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,840
When you get better...

701
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,239
...we'll drink with you however you want.

702
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,559
Life is long.

703
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,400
Life is long.

704
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,559
No, but...

705
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,360
That liquor of mine is very expensive, you know?

706
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:23,079
You're not short on money.

707
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:27,079
Besides, if I drink it, it's keeping it in the family.

708
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
Sister Tongtong.

709
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:40,800
"Leopard Tamer": A Man in the Jianghu.

710
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,239
Legend of the Duck King: The Storm Rises Again.

711
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,239
The Birth of a Duck King.

712
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:47,920
So, what do you think?

713
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,480
This of yours...

714
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,880
What's wrong, Sis? You don't like it?

715
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,559
No, it's not that.

716
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,639
Yours looks obviously made-up.

717
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,880
Netizens love this kind of stuff nowadays.

718
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,239
It grabs attention.

719
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,719
No, listen to me.

720
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,199
The most genuine things are the most touching.

721
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,239
I happen to be sorting through these photos.

722
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,480
They're all developed.

723
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,159
This one's good!

724
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,320
This one was just a candid shot.

725
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:10,960
Candid shots are always more touching than posed ones.

726
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:11,800
Look.

727
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,119
This one.

728
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:13,719
Look at my aunt.

729
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,960
How happily she's smiling.

730
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:15,880
Isn't it great?

731
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:16,920
Look at this one.

732
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,159
Look at this little head.

733
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,000
This is you, right?

734
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,039
Laughing so awkwardly?

735
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,400
Laughing so happily.

736
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,960
So, you see...

737
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,239
Aren't these moments...

738
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,719
...more like the real thing?

739
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,239
Right.

740
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,400
Sister Tongtong.

741
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,280
You said in these photos...

742
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,519
...there aren't any of you.

743
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,159
Let me take a candid shot of you.

744
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,159
Sure.

745
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,280
Come on, look at me.

746
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,119
Look at you?

747
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,280
Wouldn't looking at you make it a posed shot?

748
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,159
Right.

749
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:50,719
Candid shot.

750
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,800
Then don't look at me.

751
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,239
Okay, this...

752
00:40:59,239 --> 00:40:59,719
This, this, this angle.

753
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,159
This angle is good. Don't move.

754
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,920
Not moving.

755
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
Looks good!

756
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,079
So beautiful, so pretty.

757
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,039
Are you talking about me?
