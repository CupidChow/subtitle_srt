1
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,040
Okay, this...

2
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,519
This, this, this...

3
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,959
This angle is good. Don't move.

4
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,760
Not moving.

5
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,319
Looks good.

6
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,519
So beautiful. Really pretty.

7
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,480
Are you talking about me?

8
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,159
No, I'm talking about this camera.

9
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,159
So beautiful. Really pretty.

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,039
The oranges look good too.

11
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,400
The oranges are pretty.

12
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,039
What is this?

13
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,319
Is it fun?

14
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,280
Is this a camera?

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,120
It's a toy. Fake.

16
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,280
Forget it. There are no photos anyway.

17
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
What are you doing?

18
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,759
Just recording a moment.

19
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,360
Let me see.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
Alright, alright, don't look.

21
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,159
What are you laughing at?

22
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,280
Let's get down to business.

23
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,360
I don't think you should write it like this.

24
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,479
Is something wrong?

25
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,960
Saw your light was still on, door was open.

26
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,840
Wanted to come chat with you for a bit.

27
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,159
Chat with me?

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,520
What do we have to talk about?

29
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,280
I want to talk to you.

30
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,800
About the two of us.

31
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,599
What is there between us?

32
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,879
About what happened before.

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,280
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,439
I was only thinking of myself.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,479
I didn't consider your feelings.

36
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,680
I accept your apology.

37
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,719
Okay.

38
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,280
Is there anything else?

39
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,719
And also...

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,280
If you're talking about the confession...

41
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,120
You can rest assured.

42
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,520
Because young people's feelings...

43
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,000
Come quickly and fade just as fast.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,599
Once that moment passes, it loses its meaning.

45
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,479
It's late. You should get some rest too.

46
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,439
Please close the door on your way out. Thanks.

47
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Okay.

48
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,519
Good night.

49
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Good night.

50
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,519
Weiguo.

51
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,600
Weiguo.

52
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,040
Weiguo.

53
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,279
Weiguo.

54
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,399
He has something growing in his brain.

55
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Brain cancer.

56
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,120
How come you just got back not long ago...

57
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,360
And you're leaving again?

58
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,600
I don't have any reason to stay anymore.

59
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,439
Here's your card back. I didn't touch it.

60
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,279
Don't be like that. This was meant for you.

61
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,279
I'm not short on money.

62
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,600
This is for you.

63
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,600
What is it?

64
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,800
You're trying to appease your wife.

65
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,600
What's the point of buying her a fake bag?

66
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,399
Give her this bag. It's genuine.

67
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,639
When you get better...

68
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,079
We'll drink with you however you want.

69
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,360
Life is long.

70
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,720
Life is long.

71
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,839
Think

72
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,600
When the time comes,

73
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,319
Dinner's ready, you two ancestors!

74
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,079
During the live-streamed opening,

75
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,040
there will be some comments from netizens.

76
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,319
So just face me then,

77
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,399
try to give my live stream the shot.

78
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,560
So I should face you a bit, right?

79
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,759
From time to time, I'll

80
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,600
cue you.

81
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,519
You'll need to come over and look.

82
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,759
Because there will be some

83
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,560
like passersby, for instance,

84
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,000
entering our live stream room.

85
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,319
I'm talking to you two!

86
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,800
Telling you to come eat!

87
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
No, hold on a second.

88
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,519
We're discussing something here.

89
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,399
Right away, right away.

90
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,079
Honestly.

91
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,959
Go on.

92
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,759
Right, but there might also be some people

93
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,600
posting comments that aren't very pleasant to read.

94
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,399
Just ignore them.

95
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,920
So just be polite, right?

96
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,480
What are you discussing?

98
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,560
Can't we eat?

99
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,759
Sit here and talk?

100
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,759
You have to wait until the food's cold? I cooked for ages.

101
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,160
No, just sit down and eat.

102
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,040
You're really...

103
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,480
I'll listen too, right?

104
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,240
What are you listening for?

105
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
You don't understand, what are you listening for?

106
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What should I wear?

107
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,159
No, come sit here and talk.

108
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,000
If I listen, then I'll understand, won't I?

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
A suit. A suit is good.

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,399
Don't you wear suits for ribbon-cuttings?

111
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,080
So handsome.

112
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,679
Shouldn't I wear my chef's uniform?

113
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,399
Chef's uniform?

114
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,039
Well...

115
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,360
Yeah.

116
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,200
No, look, my profile picture is like this.

117
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,480
If I change into different clothes,

118
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,840
people won't recognize me.

119
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,120
Dad, since when do you understand this stuff?

120
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,480
It's called a signature look.

121
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,120
Right?

122
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,600
Yeah.

123
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
What doesn't your dad understand?

124
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,799
Honestly.

125
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,480
He knows the heavens above and the earth below.

126
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,399
Past, present, Chinese, foreign—nothing he doesn't get.

127
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,200
Jing'er, tomorrow, take that

128
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,039
new chef's uniform of mine and iron it.

129
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,279
Looking for a maid or a wife?

130
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,399
Thanks, buddy, for the helicopter!

131
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,000
Ferrari! Six six six!

132
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,120
After all this time renovating, we finally get to unveil it!

133
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,080
Alright!

134
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,240
The auspicious time has arrived!

135
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,360
Come on, come on, Qiu'er, Qiu'er!

136
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,080
Don't you shy away now!

137
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,360
Yes, yes, yes, come here, come here.

138
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,240
All four of you have a part.

139
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,919
Over here, I'll do it, I'll do it.

140
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,279
Okay, I'll count to three,

141
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,240
and everyone shouts "Grand Opening Fortune," okay?

142
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,759
Okay!

143
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,799
One, two, three!

144
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,799
Grand Opening Fortune!

145
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,759
So, our Peng Le Xuan

146
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,720
is officially reopened today.

147
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,799
Starting today,

148
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,440
all our old neighbors

149
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,759
in Baofang Hutong,

150
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,200
when you eat at Peng Le Xuan,

151
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,360
get a 20% discount!

152
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,039
Great!

153
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,360
And it's lifelong—valid for life!

154
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,159
And all our delivery riders,

155
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,200
and these courier folks,

156
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,759
all you brothers and sisters,

157
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,279
eat zhajiangmian here for free!

158
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,440
Awesome!

159
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,919
Duck bone soup, all you can drink!

160
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,799
That's righteous!

161
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,279
Alright, everyone, please come inside!

162
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,759
Come on, let's go, come on in.

163
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,240
Come on, come on.

164
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,519
In you go, in you go.

165
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,080
Go sit over there.

166
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,799
Don't worry, Dong Qian and I are here.

167
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,600
Exactly.

168
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,080
What are you doing here?

169
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,519
Go on, go on.

170
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,799
Listen to me.

171
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,360
Your main task now

172
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,639
is just to help me taste the dishes, okay?

173
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,519
Come on, sit down.

174
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,200
This is a new dish I developed.

175
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,080
Help me taste it, see if there are any issues.

176
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,799
And go easy on the spicy dishes.

177
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,720
Did you hear me?

178
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,080
Qiu'er, keep an eye on him.

179
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,320
Don't let him drink.

180
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,159
Come on, Weiguo, for the reopening!

181
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,919
May business prosper far and wide.

182
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,799
May wealth flow abundantly.

183
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,440
No, no, no.

184
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,360
No, no, don't, don't.

185
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,919
I... I...

186
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,720
What's going on?

187
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,639
I'll drink for him! I'll drink for him!

188
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,759
Good lord, someone's blocking the drink.

189
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,639
He's not drinking anymore, he's not.

190
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,240
Come on, come on.

191
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
Come on, come on.

192
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,840
Here.

193
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,639
You, keep coming by often, you hear?

194
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,080
I definitely will.

195
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,799
And I won't hold back with you guys.

196
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,080
Lao Wang.

197
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,279
Where did you hire these waiters from?

198
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,879
They all look like big celebrities.

199
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,440
Right? You're still talking nonsense.

200
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,240
Weiguo, Weiguo, come here, Weiguo.

201
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,759
Come on, come on.

202
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,679
Pour it, pour it, pour it.

203
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,799
Sister Zhao, Sister Zhao.

204
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,919
We... we'd like to toast you.

205
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,519
We're not letting Weiguo drink.

206
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,240
Alright, alright.

207
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,519
Here.

208
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,039
Alright.

209
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,919
Okay, it's almost lined up, come on.

210
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Have some water, have some water.

211
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
Old neighbors, come by often!

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,639
This one's still good, no problem.

213
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,440
Here.

214
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,679
Okay, ready, go, go!

215
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,039
Folks, Peng Le Xuan is reopening today!

216
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,919
If there's anything about the food

217
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,519
that doesn't sit right, tell me.

218
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,080
Like a star.

219
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,919
I just think she's pretty.

220
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,200
Don't talk nonsense.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,559
Come on, let's look again, look again.

222
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,399
Look, look.

223
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,679
Why is it upside down?

224
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,399
Here, let me.

225
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,519
Turn it around, turn it around.

226
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,159
Why did you come back alone?

227
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
Uncle Tong, why are you back too?

228
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,080
It's time, I have to take my medicine.

229
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,519
Okay, then it's my time too.

230
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,159
Wait, I have something to tell you later.

231
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,759
Why are you standing? Sit.

232
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,720
Kid.

233
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,799
I've figured it out.

234
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,600
These past few days,

235
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,200
your buddy hasn't let you do any work, right?

236
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,799
You're bored to death.

237
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,080
Restless and fidgety, huh?

238
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,279
What are you doing?

239
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,519
This wine is really good.

240
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,519
What wine is this?

241
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,720
Eighteenth Generation.

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,120
You usually keep such good wine

243
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,799
and don't share it with your buddy?

244
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,320
That's a bit disloyal.

245
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,200
You sleep if you want, but you...

246
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,320
you even steal my wine?

247
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,600
Really don't need any help?

248
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,120
No.

249
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
See, I'll be done soon.

250
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Uncle, maybe you should go back and rest.

251
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,639
Alright.

252
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,600
You go ahead.

253
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,559
Okay, bye.

254
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,440
I know, they mean well.

255
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,480
Yes, yes, yes.

256
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,320
When I first got sick, I was the same.

257
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
My heart felt unsettled, adrift.

258
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,320
Always wanted to find something to do.

259
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,000
To keep myself moving.

260
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,039
Back then, I even asked someone

261
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:26,399
to get me a fake medical report.

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,679
That was to fool your aunt and Qiu'er.

263
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,679
To save them from worrying and being sad for me every day.

264
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,519
Really.

265
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,080
You know,

266
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,759
once you've had this illness for a while,

267
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,759
your perspective shifts.

268
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,799
Tell me, why would God

269
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,039
let the two of us get this illness?

270
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,240
I don't know.

271
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,200
Just bad luck.

272
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,879
No.

273
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,200
God is giving us a reminder.

274
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,600
Saying our past lifestyle

275
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,799
had problems.

276
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,679
You are excellent in every aspect,

277
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,639
but in terms of experience with illness,

278
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
you are far behind me.

279
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,120
So you have to listen to me.

280
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,279
Do you hear me?

281
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:18,759
Okay.

282
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,879
From now on,

283
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:24,639
you need to slow down

284
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,720
your pace of life.

285
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,200
Let it go.

286
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,039
Adopt a more relaxed mindset.

287
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,679
Live a different way.

288
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,759
Rather than saying the two of us got this illness,

289
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,720
it's more like God

290
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,320
has given the two of us

291
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,360
a chance for rebirth.

292
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,720
You must seize this opportunity.

293
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Absolutely.

294
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,000
Thank you, Uncle Tong. I understand.

295
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,639
Excellent, good, good.

296
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,679
I'm going to take my medicine.

297
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,720
Take your medicine on time.

298
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,480
It's time.

299
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,519
This kid.

300
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:08,720
How much?

301
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,120
Eighteen thousand eight hundred.

302
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,159
E-Eighteen thousand?

303
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,879
Yeah.

304
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,360
Exceeding similar creators

305
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,240
by eighty-four point seven percent.

306
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,639
Engagement rate, sixty-six point five percent.

307
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,720
What does that mean?

308
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,759
It means

309
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,879
among those who watched it,

310
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,639
sixty-six percent will stop

311
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,000
to like and interact with you.

312
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,679
It shows our video is good,

313
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,559
attractive, right?

314
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,159
Isn't it?

315
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,039
Absolutely.

316
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,639
Jing'er, is there any zhajiang sauce left in the fridge?

317
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,159
Make us a couple bowls of noodles.

318
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,759
Mom, I want a bowl too.

319
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,399
Darn it, add a poached egg.

320
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,240
Hey, you two didn't eat dinner properly,

321
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,320
I finally get a break,

322
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,039
I want to watch some TV.

323
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,360
We were busy, didn't have time.

324
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,159
Fifty thousand people? Oh my God.

325
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,399
If... if it were really sixty thousand,

326
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,159
standing right in front of you,

327
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,720
you wouldn't see the end of them.

328
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,559
A huge, swarming crowd.

329
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:55,200
All chanting "Duck King, Duck King, Duck King" below.

330
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,519
What have you two been muttering about?

331
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,639
Tell me.

332
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,159
We opened today, right?

333
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,039
And it brought Dad a huge wave of traffic.

334
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,639
Look at these, one by one.

335
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,320
Just from posting this one video,

336
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,679
he gained ten thousand followers.

337
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,360
Then... then post more!

338
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,000
Then people will come swarming

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,039
to find your dad, right?

340
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,039
Listen to your mom.

341
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,320
You're so out of touch.

342
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,519
You're an amateur, Mom.

343
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,399
Posting videos, it's...

344
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,200
not about the more you post, the better.

345
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
It depends on timing.

346
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Morning, afternoon, or evening?

347
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,759
The specific hour matters.

348
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,600
Don't explain to your mom, she won't get it.

349
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,679
Let's you and I discuss

350
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,759
when to do the paid promotion,

351
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,399
and how much is appropriate.

352
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,919
Hey, son,

353
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,240
you... explain it to Mom.

354
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,519
Let Mom learn too, right? I, I...

355
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:32,919
I'm telling you,

356
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:35,039
can't you go do something within your abilities?

357
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,240
Go make the noodles.

358
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,600
Make that poached egg soft.

359
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,519
Hey, you... search

360
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,399
roughly what time we should promote

361
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,639
to get the most viewers.

362
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,240
One, two, three!

363
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,720
Grand opening, great fortune!

364
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,000
Alright! So our Peng Le Xuan

365
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
is officially reopened!

366
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Let me say a few words.

367
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,960
Six PM... I see six PM.

368
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,240
Seven PM, I see...

369
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,920
Eight PM, look.

370
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,319
This line, at eight o'clock,

371
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,000
the view count and engagement

372
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,319
both hit their peak highest.

373
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,240
Wasn't that when we

374
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,559
posted it, that exact time?

375
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,359
Yeah.

376
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,519
Then...

377
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,440
We can't post one today then.

378
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,000
Post another one tomorrow.

379
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,640
Okay.

380
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,279
Someone else is adding you.

381
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,880
Lots of people are adding me.

382
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,640
Xia Tian's assistant.

383
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,519
Who?

384
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,160
This feels like...

385
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,640
Xia Tian?

386
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah, I always hear you mention her.

387
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,359
Hello.

388
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,440
I'm the little assistant of streamer Teacher Xia Tian.

389
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,720
Recently watched your...

390
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,799
Who is it now? Who? Who?

391
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,799
Teacher Xia Tian.

392
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,359
Xia Tian.

393
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,359
wants to collaborate with you.

394
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,440
Is it possible to give us a chance?

395
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,720
Oh my God.

396
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,359
Let me see.

397
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,519
Xia Tian! Xia Tian is that huge internet celebrity.

398
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,079
Let me see!

399
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,519
Let me see what this big celebrity looks like.

400
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,880
Hey, aren't you making noodles?

401
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,519
No, I'm boiling water.

402
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,720
Go make the noodles, go, go, go!

403
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,640
Let me see.

404
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,440
Within your abilities.

405
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,240
Shoes.

406
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,359
It really is Teacher Xia Tian.

407
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,359
Hey, you... you... reply to her.

408
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
This is a side account.

409
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
It's her assistant.

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,519
Who knows if it's real or fake.

411
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,000
Hey, you first...

412
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,440
You chat with them first.

413
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,680
Hello, I'm the Duck King's son.

414
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,640
Wait a minute.

415
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,720
Could this be a scammer?

416
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,519
Possibly.

417
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,000
You chat with them, chat with them.

418
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,880
See what's going on.

419
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,160
If she really is Xia Tian,

420
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,680
that would be amazing.

421
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,720
Absolutely.

422
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,240
We must establish a connection with her.

423
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,720
Boss Dong.

424
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,079
A busy person like you still picks up the kid yourself?

425
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,240
Weren't you laid off by your company?

426
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,640
Not rushing to find a job,

427
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,160
yet you have the mind to criticize me here?

428
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,119
Go, go, go!

429
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,920
Go, go, go!

430
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,519
Wang Esq.

431
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,839
I've emailed you the profiles of several experts.

432
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,880
Take a look.

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
See if there's anyone

434
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,119
who looks like the person in this photo.

435
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,119
I want to hire them to act in a play for me.

436
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,839
Sorry for the trouble. Thank you.

437
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,119
And now, outside,

438
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,880
people are lining up every day.

439
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,640
You know?

440
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,880
It's true.

441
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
The numbers look really good too.

442
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,000
I'll tell Dong Qian in a bit,

443
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
have her report to the investors.

444
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,119
Got it, got it.

445
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,240
We have to change suppliers again.

446
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,000
You know?

447
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,559
Big bro.

448
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,880
What brings you here?

449
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Shouldn't you be resting at home?

450
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,359
Couldn't sit still, came out for a walk.

451
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,319
Alright, have a seat then.

452
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,039
Come on, come on.

453
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Here, have some water.

454
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,359
How did your talk with Qianqian go?

455
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,440
Don't you worry about that.

456
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,559
How are you feeling now?

457
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,440
Pretty good. No more dizziness.

458
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,440
That's good.

459
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,119
That's good.

460
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,000
Let's get back to our topic.

461
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,119
But now that the customer flow is up,

462
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,079
however...

463
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,799
Hello, Lawyer Wang?

464
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,119
Martin, Professor Zhou Michael

465
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,319
from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,

466
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,000
affiliated with Harvard Medical Center, replied.

467
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,559
What did he say?

468
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,119
He reviewed your medical records

469
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,359
and says there's hope.

470
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,880
It happens to match

471
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,359
a new technology at their institute.

472
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:16,880
Really?

473
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,920
Hold on, I'll connect you with him.

474
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,000
Let him tell you himself.

475
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,559
Okay, okay, I'm adding him now.

476
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,559
Hello, Professor Zhou, right?

477
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,640
Hello, Mr. Ma.

478
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,079
I've reviewed your medical history.

479
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:38,480
Lawyer Wang also briefed me on your specifics.

480
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,000
Let's get straight to the point.

481
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,799
Currently,

482
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,640
your condition is relatively stable.

483
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,799
You must maintain this state.

484
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,319
Now, we have a new technology here

485
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,519
that has passed relevant US trials

486
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,359
and will be available in a few months.

487
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:54,160
You'll need to come to the US for treatment then.

488
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,880
But I must remind you,

489
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,279
during this period,

490
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,200
do not undergo any other treatments.

491
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,559
Understood, understood.

492
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,799
What if I take some Chinese medicine

493
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,799
or use some dietary supplements?

494
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,720
Absolutely not.

495
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,079
I dislike it most when people don't listen to experts

496
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,880
and believe in folk remedies or food therapy.

497
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,599
If you disrupt your current stable condition,

498
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,119
no one can save you.

499
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,920
Don't worry, I won't take any.

500
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,839
We absolutely won't, never again.

501
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,559
Right, right.

502
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,000
So afterwards,

503
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,559
can I work normally?

504
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,720
Yes, appropriate work,

505
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,680
as long as it's not excessive,

506
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,400
can help regulate your mood.

507
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,079
It is beneficial.

508
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,640
Good, good, understood.

509
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,759
Thank you, Professor. Thank you, thank you.

510
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:37,319
You're welcome. Alright, that's it then.

511
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,880
Let's stay in touch on any developments.

512
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,440
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

513
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,359
Thanks.

514
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,200
My cousin...

515
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,640
Thank you, Professor. Thank you, goodbye.

516
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,240
Goodbye.

517
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,920
Weiguo.

518
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,079
Weiguo! We have hope, Weiguo! Weiguo!

519
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,480
Weiguo, look, is that him?

520
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,920
Yes, it's him.

521
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,640
Who am I looking at?

522
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:56,799
It's definitely him.

523
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,359
It took me a long time to get in touch.

524
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,440
Here's what, I'll have my friends abroad

525
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,359
also keep an eye on his new tech for me.

526
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:04,880
That's right.

527
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,240
We should check

528
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,440
all the hospitals.

529
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,559
Let's not just focus on Oxford

530
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,359
or Cambridge, let's search them all.

531
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,279
Don't put all our eggs in the Harvard basket.

532
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,680
Big bro, watch your words!

533
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,440
Darn it, my big mouth.

534
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,200
Don't worry, big bro.

535
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,880
Lianbao.

536
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,359
Now we see a glimmer of hope.

537
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,799
I value my life more than you guys do.

538
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,920
Don't worry.

539
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,079
Weiguo.

540
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,880
Our heads can be saved!

541
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,960
Good, good, good.

542
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:36,000
Big bro, this is too sticky, big bro!

543
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,839
You can't park here!

544
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,319
Feifei.

545
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,160
Uncle.

546
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,319
Going out?

547
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,799
My friend's here, I gotta go.

548
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,079
Your... your friend?

549
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,319
Who is this guy?

550
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,160
What kind of friend?

551
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,279
He looks so frivolous.

552
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:08,880
Yeah.

553
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,559
How are you, my darling?

554
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,680
Long time no see.

555
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,839
When did she meet someone like that?

556
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,039
I don't know.

557
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,839
You're close with her.

558
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,559
You should talk to her.

559
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,839
Tell her not to associate with just anyone.

560
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,799
Uncle, you're the elder.

561
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,079
You should criticize her more.

562
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,160
You really need to have a good talk with her.

563
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,559
And about her gallery project,

564
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,440
you need to help her handle it properly.

565
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,640
So she doesn't get scammed.

566
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,039
Sister Tongtong.

567
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,160
Why do I feel like Sister Tongtong is in an online romance?

568
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,960
Let's go.

569
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,559
Come in

570
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,880
President, you asked for me?

571
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,519
A client is coming over later. Let's meet him together.

572
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:05,799
Okay

573
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,440
An old acquaintance

574
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,119
Yes

575
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,039
He specifically asked for you to join.

576
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,720
Just keep that in mind.

577
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,640
President Liu

578
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,160
Mr. Qiu

579
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,920
It's settled then.

580
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,039
The money will go through your bank.

581
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,640
Great

582
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,799
I'll arrange it tomorrow then.

583
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,519
I'll have Xiao Jia handle it for you personally.

584
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,440
Great

585
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:37,000
Let Manager Tong handle it.

586
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,039
From now on, he handles all my business.

587
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,480
Mr. Qiu

588
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,480
Did I do something wrong?

589
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,640
You know me.

590
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,799
I may seem like I play hard,

591
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,160
but I can tell good people from bad.

592
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,279
Some people speak sweetly to your face,

593
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,920
but stir up trouble behind your back.

594
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,039
President Liu

595
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,559
I advise you to be careful using such people.

596
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,559
Mr. Qiu

597
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,200
Is there some misunderstanding between us?

598
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,920
Did I say I was talking about you?

599
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,960
What are you nervous about?

600
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,920
Manager Tong has been here a long time, right?

601
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,079
Yes

602
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,880
He works conscientiously.

603
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,400
And he's honest.

604
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,359
He deserves an important role.

605
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,599
Of course

606
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,920
I've always appreciated Old Tong.

607
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,319
Old Tong is sharp and doesn't fish for credit.

608
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,759
He gets things done quietly.

609
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,920
Right?

610
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,039
Right? Yes.

611
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,839
What dish is this?

612
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:22,240
Scrambled eggs

613
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,000
Chopped chili peppers

614
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,880
Wait, why are there beans in it?

615
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:25,720
Small soybeans

616
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,440
Small soybeans

617
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,680
Pickled lees

618
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:30,839
You're still eating?

619
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,480
Is it good?

620
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,400
No, I'm not. I'm eating cucumber.

621
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,119
No, he's basically vegetarian now.

622
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,559
He doesn't dare eat meat anymore.

623
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,319
You know, during this time...

624
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,880
I didn't even dare mention this.

625
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,119
Finally

626
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,640
Today we know Weiguo's illness can be treated.

627
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,079
My mind is finally at ease.

628
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,160
Yes, yes

629
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,559
Then let's make an exception. Come on.

630
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,240
No, no, no

631
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,200
No, Weiguo, you...

632
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,519
You can't drink.

633
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,000
Just drink a little.

634
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,599
If you want to drink, a little is fine.

635
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,720
But you can't either.

636
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,319
You can't drink too much either. Your foot...

637
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,359
I'm fine.

638
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,839
You just drink this one can.

639
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,240
You stick to Sprite.

640
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,240
Okay, okay, just this one can.

641
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,839
Happy now?

642
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,839
Come on then.

643
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,359
Come on, come on.

644
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,759
Don't treat us so differently.

645
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,720
It's fine

646
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,240
Come on

647
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,599
Just bear with it.

648
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,400
It's fine, it's fine.

649
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,200
They're both fizzy.

650
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,519
Big Brother is doing it for your own good.

651
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,400
Seeing Peng Le Xuan like this now...

652
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,839
Buddy, I'm truly happy from the bottom of my heart.

653
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,200
Regret it now?

654
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:36,359
How about this?

655
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,240
You buy your shares back.

656
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,000
We'll give you the original price.

657
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,319
Don't even start.

658
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,240
I finally managed...

659
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,839
to make a name for myself at the bank.

660
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,000
Don't tempt me.

661
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,240
Then the three of us must tempt him.

662
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,160
Lure him back.

663
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,240
Qiu'er, honestly.

664
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,519
When you wanted to withdraw your shares back then...

665
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,720
I really hoped that you...

666
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,319
could achieve something on your own.

667
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm happy for you. Come, a toast to you.

668
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,519
Alright

669
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,359
By the way, once my assets are unfrozen...

670
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,519
there will be a sum of cash for you.

671
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,359
That's some dumb luck.

672
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,720
Hurry up and thank your Third Brother.

673
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,839
Right. I think it comes down to one sentence.

674
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,279
Good people have safe lives.

675
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:14,599
Chug one!

676
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,839
Come on. I'll try.

677
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,599
Let me tell you.

678
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
My condition is stable now.

679
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,759
You, don't squeeze into the same room with me.

680
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:26,720
I really can't stand it.

681
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,599
What? You're despising me now, huh?

682
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,759
I'm not sleeping in the same bed as you.

683
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:30,960
What's wrong with me sleeping on the sofa?

684
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,839
I still can't stand it.

685
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,759
As if I want to sleep in the same room as you.

686
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,119
I'll go home and sleep.

687
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,519
I'd sleep so soundly. Disgusting.

688
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,799
Cuddling my wife to sleep.

689
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,599
Xiaoshi isn't there anyway.

690
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,000
What's wrong?

691
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,480
It's this jerk again.

692
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,039
Who?

693
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
This guy says...

694
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,119
He says he's Teacher Xia Tian's assistant.

695
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,400
He called me just now.

696
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,240
And then?

697
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,480
I said if you're really her assistant...

698
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,480
I'll ask a question in her livestream.

699
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,359
You have Teacher Xia Tian answer my question.

700
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,000
Then I'll believe you.

701
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,480
Then this guy tells me...

702
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,359
that Teacher Xia Tian wants to meet me.

703
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,359
This must be a scammer.

704
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,559
Unreliable

705
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,359
But what if it's real?

706
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:14,319
What if Teacher Xia Tian really wants to meet me?

707
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,240
Big Brother, how about this?

708
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Answer it. Play along with him.

709
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,720
Ask him out.

710
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,319
If he really is a scammer...

711
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,400
We brothers will drag him to the police station.

712
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,319
The four of us can stretch our legs a bit.

713
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,359
Alright, alright

714
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,240
Ask him out then.

715
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,240
Okay

716
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,319
Hello?

717
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,400
Scammer.

718
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,599
Definitely a scammer.

719
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,000
No, it's...

720
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,359
I think it's a scammer too.

721
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,720
Later on,

722
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,599
I'll sound him out first.

723
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,480
You guys, be ready.

724
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:05,359
The signal will be when I raise my glass.

725
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
The moment I lift my glass,

726
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,279
you surround him.

727
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,599
We'll take him to the police station.

728
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,839
Let the police handle it, okay?

729
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,319
Alright.

730
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,960
Look at this.

731
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,599
It's almost time.

732
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,480
Maybe you should just...

733
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,000
Okay, okay, okay.

734
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:42,279
Feifei, keep an eye on your sister Tongtong.

735
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,359
Don't let her run off with that kid.

736
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,079
Got it?

737
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,400
Okay, I'll be quick.

738
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,359
Master Wang?

739
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,000
Why is it a guy?

740
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,200
Master Wang, hello.

741
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,599
Master Wang?

742
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Did you see him?

743
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,079
I saw him.

744
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,799
Let me tell you, I've really seen it all today.

745
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,839
What are you doing?

746
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,000
Don't, don't!

747
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,839
Stop!

748
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,359
You scared...

749
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,279
Don't scare Teacher Xia!

750
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,039
Bro, look closer.

751
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,960
Those videos online all use filters.

752
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,880
No filter, absolutely no filter.

753
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,679
Xia Tian is more "summer" than summer itself.

754
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,280
Then why did you smash the glass?

755
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,039
Yeah!

756
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:16,840
Did I smash a glass?

757
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,559
You did.

758
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,119
Teacher Xia, please...

759
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,639
Don't be scared.

760
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,400
Please, sit, sit, sit.

761
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,800
Okay.

762
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,280
It's really her.

763
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,519
What's going on here?

764
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,119
Doesn't seem much like a scammer.

765
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:34,960
Teacher Xia.

766
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,079
Teacher Xia.

767
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,360
No, it's fine, I...

768
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,920
Seeing you, I...

769
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,000
Bro, what are you doing?

770
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,639
I feel a bit dizzy.

771
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:47,440
It's okay.

772
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,360
Um...

773
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:50,800
So awkward. Sorry for scaring you.

774
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,039
You, you, please sit. Sorry for the disturbance.

775
00:34:58,519 --> 00:34:59,199
No, it's...

776
00:34:59,199 --> 00:34:59,599
Are you okay?

777
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,559
Back up, back up.

778
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,840
You guys, get back.

779
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,599
Don't bother Teacher Xia.

780
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,679
Go back.

781
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:07,679
I need to be dizzy for a bit.

782
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,119
I'll sit farther away.

783
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,119
You sit farther away.

784
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,199
Why is he so embarrassing?

785
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,440
I'm still dizzy.

786
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,639
No, you guys...

787
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,079
Stay away from Teacher Xia.

788
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,239
Don't bother her.

789
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,119
She's real.

790
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,760
Teacher Xia, in the flesh.

791
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,039
Look at you, no backbone.

792
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,960
No, that's Teacher Xia Tian!

793
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,679
She's my idol.

794
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,039
And my idol even told me

795
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,800
that she wants to collaborate with me.

796
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,559
Do a crossover.

797
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,599
We'll even do a live stream together in the future.

798
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,039
Uncle, that guy's here again.

799
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:20,960
I see him.

800
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,400
He comes around a lot.

801
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:32,159
Is she dressed up like that for a date?

802
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,599
I really don't get it.

803
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,960
Dressing up deliberately to see some punk with dyed hair.

804
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,039
Is that necessary?

805
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,199
Have you eaten?

806
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,360
Of course. I had Luzhu Huoshao.

807
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,599
Luzhu Huoshao.

808
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,559
Forget it. Let her be.

809
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:46,960
No, Uncle, what if...

810
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,039
she gets taken advantage of?

811
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,400
She won't listen to me even if I talk to her.

812
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,800
Young people are just stubborn.

813
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,639
Pretty cool. Let me see your glasses.

814
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,679
So intimate, huh?

815
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,320
I need to go talk to her.

816
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,360
Will she listen to you?

817
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,280
Even if she doesn't listen, I still have to say it.

818
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,039
Go on, go.

819
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,639
Very good, very good.

820
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,400
Sister Tongtong.

821
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Is this your friend?

822
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,840
Yes, let me introduce you.

823
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,800
This is my friend from the photography association abroad.

824
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,519
His name is Xiao Qi.

825
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,199
He's visiting Beijing.

826
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,840
And helping me look into venues on the side.

827
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,519
Hello.

828
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:36,079
Your hair is pretty cool.

829
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,519
Like a little blond puppy.

830
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:41,079
Nice.

831
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,079
Kid, you sure know how to talk.

832
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,840
No, you don't want it?

833
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:51,559
Sis.

834
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,039
Is that photography association of yours legitimate?

835
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:54,599
Well, it...

836
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,039
Of course it's legitimate!

837
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,119
What is all this nonsense?

838
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,079
What do you know, you little brat?

839
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,760
Uncle Ma, stop hiding.

840
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,840
I saw you a long time ago.

841
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
If you have something to say, come down and say it to my face.

842
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,559
You're here.

843
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,360
Just arrived in Beijing?

844
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,760
Less than a week.

845
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,599
You don't know your way around yet, right?

846
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,760
Not really.

847
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,840
It's the internet age.

848
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,920
I can go anywhere with my phone.

849
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,559
Venue rental, contract signing,

850
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,880
document submission,

851
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,000
and later-stage promotion, etc.

852
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,079
All require very reliable connections

853
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,079
to get done.

854
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,800
It must be tough being new here.

855
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,599
That's thanks to Tongtong.

856
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,000
These past couple days,

857
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,239
she introduced me to many good friends in the industry.

858
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,079
Wait.

859
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,639
So, who's helping who exactly?

860
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,599
Don't worry about that.

861
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,280
I definitely won't treat her unfairly.

862
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,599
I plan to, after her exhibition,

863
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,079
Sis Tongtong,

864
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,239
I'll just go with you to check venues later.

865
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:31,039
He's not familiar with things, doesn't know anything.

866
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:31,719
*I'm* familiar!

867
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,880
What are *you* familiar with?

868
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,760
Is your homework done?

869
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,039
Stop butting in where you don't belong.

870
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,119
I... did it, did it.

871
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,079
J-just... just math left.

872
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,840
Feifei is just concerned about you, okay?

873
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,079
We haven't even met this 'friend' of yours.

874
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:44,559
Yeah.

875
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,519
You running around with him,

876
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,559
what if something happens?

877
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,079
Right.

878
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,639
Mister.

879
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,039
Do I look like a bad guy?

880
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,440
What 'mister'? Call me 'bro'.

881
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:55,880
Okay, okay.

882
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:57,360
Bro.

883
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,519
Don't mind him.

884
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,119
This 'mister' here,

885
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,199
lately, I don't know why,

886
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,599
seems to be especially idle.

887
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,760
Doesn't have any real business either.

888
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,599
What do you mean I have no real business?

889
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,800
The time we agreed with Miss Chen,

890
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,400
is it about time?

891
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,280
We should get going, right?

892
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:11,599
Let's go.

893
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,199
Let's go.

894
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,360
Well, you all enjoy your meal, take your time chatting.

895
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:17,519
Bye.

896
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,679
Bye, bro.

897
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,440
Third Uncle, should we follow them?

898
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,360
Forget it.

899
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,559
Then I'll dig in.

900
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,760
Do I look very old?

901
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:48,639
No.

902
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,880
You're still the best.

903
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Wants to buy over thirty million in financial products right away.

904
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:05,360
You have such a wealthy relative,

905
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,960
why didn't you say so earlier?

906
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,000
Thanks.

907
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:12,599
I also just reconnected with them not long ago.

908
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,719
Old Tong, I really didn't see it.

909
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,800
You've got some skills.

910
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,320
You've got Manager Qiu handled.

911
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,239
And there's a big shot backing you.

912
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,280
A true master doesn't show his hand.

913
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,039
Manager Liu, I really don't.

914
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:29,239
I know.

915
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,079
You and Xiao Jia have never quite gotten along.

916
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,000
I've already arranged things for you.

917
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:35,639
No, no, I really don't mean anything else by it.

918
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:37,079
Understood, understood.

919
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,079
It has nothing to do with you, rest assured.

920
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,400
I really didn't mean that.
