1
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,840
Uncle, so...

2
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,120
Based on your experience,

3
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,000
how should a guy confess to a girl to make her like it?

4
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,480
You're asking the wrong person.

5
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,439
Know why?

6
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,280
Why?

7
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,599
Your third uncle never needed to confess.

8
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,239
I see.

9
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,760
That was back in the day.

10
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,879
Then I'll go ask my dad.

11
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,519
Don't bother asking him.

12
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,480
He's useless at this.

13
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,959
Honestly.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,240
Careful, don't cut your hand.

15
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,120
Uncle Tong, what's wrong?

16
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,080
Grandpa Tong?

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,360
What happened?

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,840
It's been with me for over twenty years.

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,840
My fine Jingdezhen porcelain teapot is shattered.

20
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,560
It breaks my heart.

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,879
Don't you...

22
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,159
Be careful, you'll get cut.

23
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:23,879
Easy, easy.

24
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,960
I'll go get a broom.

25
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,439
Alright.

26
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:26,759
Take it easy.

27
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,759
Nobody move, okay?

28
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,439
Okay.

29
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,280
Don't move.

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,120
Uncle Tong, you don't look so good.

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,960
Should we take you to the hospital?

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,439
No need, no need.

33
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,960
My hand just trembled,

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,400
and it slipped.

35
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,000
I've been rushing the script too hard.

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,840
That's all it is.

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,960
Grandpa Tong?

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's just, it's just...

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,919
My head... head feels a bit dizzy.

40
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,560
I'll be fine after a short rest.

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,000
Just need to rest a bit.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,680
Take a rest.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,919
Grandpa Tong,

44
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,479
how many words do you write in a day?

45
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,960
Almost ten thousand words.

46
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:00,960
That many?

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,719
Uncle Tong,

48
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,000
No matter how inspired you are,

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,319
you have to take care of your health.

50
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,400
I just want to finish those first few episodes.

51
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,360
Once the contract is signed,

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,159
the payment will come through.

53
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,120
No need to be in such a hurry, right?

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,439
Qiu'er got a promotion.

55
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,560
Her income is up.

56
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,840
The family isn't short on money, is it?

57
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,159
Right, right, right.

58
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,639
Qiu'er's promoted, we're not short on money.

59
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,919
I just want...

60
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,240
to get this script finished quickly.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,159
It's getting late.

62
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,719
You all should get some rest.

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,879
I'm fine here.

64
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,560
Alright, you get some good rest then.

65
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,159
Don't worry.

66
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,960
Call us if you need anything.

67
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,719
Okay, okay, okay.

68
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,919
Thanks, thank you.

69
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,759
Uncle, I feel like Grandpa Tong is acting strange.

70
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,240
I also feel something's a bit off.

71
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,080
It's late, you should head back first.

72
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,840
Alright.

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,039
Good luck with your confession.

74
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,240
Thanks.

75
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,719
Get some rest early.

76
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,040
Hello? What's up?

77
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,879
Qiu'er?

78
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,680
My money is ready.

79
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,959
How's the financial product thing going?

80
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,920
Hurry up and get it done.

81
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,600
Okay, okay, okay.

82
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,399
I can't do it these few days.

83
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm a bit busy.

84
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,480
Can we talk about it again in a few days?

85
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,480
Don't wait a few days.

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,240
Just do it today.

87
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,639
I'm heading to the bank now.

88
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,199
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

89
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,959
I'm not at the bank right now.

90
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,480
I'm meeting a client outside.

91
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,120
That's fine, I'll go wait for you.

92
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,199
Don't wait for me.

93
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,040
I won't be back for a while.

94
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,079
It's fine, I don't have anything else to do anyway.

95
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,759
I think maybe we should hold off a bit.

96
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,759
Don't buy it for now.

97
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,199
What's wrong?

98
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,720
Weren't you in a hurry before?

99
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,040
Yes, before... I was in a hurry before.

100
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,360
Yes, it's like this, our bank...

101
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,160
is going to release a new financial product soon.

102
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,639
The return rate will be higher than the current one.

103
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,199
It'll be more cost-effective for you to buy that one.

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Just wait a little longer.

105
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,160
It doesn't matter.

106
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,439
A little more or less doesn't matter.

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,160
It doesn't matter to *you*.

108
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
But, but for me, this money...

109
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,959
Why not earn money if you can?

110
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,600
Is there something wrong?

111
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,199
What inconvenience could I possibly have?

112
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,240
Everything's fine.

113
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,759
Fine, I get it. That's it then.

114
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,839
Mom?

115
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,839
Fei, Mom's going to mop your floor.

116
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,639
Doing homework?

117
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:47,839
Yeah.

118
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,360
Fei, you keep writing, I'm going out.

119
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,600
What a tiring day.

120
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,120
I'm... I'm going to have a beer.

121
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,039
What is this?

122
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,120
I was just mopping Feifei's room,

123
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
and I found this on the floor.

124
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,600
You know what?

125
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,679
The four most beautiful words in the world

126
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,840
are "I like you."

127
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,279
The kid's in love.

128
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,279
Keep your voice down.

129
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,440
What... what do we do about this?

130
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,960
What do you mean, 'what do we do'?

131
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,960
Just pretend we don't know.

132
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,120
No, I mean, dating itself isn't really a big deal.

133
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,840
If he didn't date at his age,

134
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,440
we'd be worried, right?

135
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,039
But he's about to start his final year of high school.

136
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,639
We can't let it affect his studies.

137
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,960
Can we even stop something like this?

138
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,879
When you were his age,

139
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,399
didn't you date several girls?

140
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,679
I... I... Wasn't it just you before I...

141
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,159
Put that away first.

142
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Wasn't it just one before?

143
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,799
What about that Xiao Zhang from the department store?

144
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,399
I said it was her, just her!

145
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,879
And what about that whole bunch of others?

146
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,039
See, there you go again.

147
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,399
All of those were just...

148
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,960
...younger sisters I had business dealings with.

149
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,679
No, why do you have so many 'younger sisters'?

150
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,799
We're talking about our son here.

151
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,559
Can we not keep talking about this?

152
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,879
You... you go talk to him.

153
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,639
You talk to him.

154
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,799
You're the father.

155
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,200
You have to go in and talk to him.

156
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,879
How am I supposed to bring it up?

157
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,840
Aren't you two getting along so well lately,

158
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,639
like real brothers?

159
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,120
No, a son is always closer to his mom.

160
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,600
You... you go in first and talk, test the waters.

161
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,679
If it doesn't work, then I'll go.

162
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,240
Fine. Come with me.

163
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,759
Alright, alright.

164
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,840
Just watch your attitude.

165
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,840
About this...

166
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,000
Feifei.

167
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,639
Not asleep?

168
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,279
Not yet.

169
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Um...

170
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,879
Your mom wants to talk to you about something.

171
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,879
I'm... doing homework.

172
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,120
I'm memorizing vocabulary.

173
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,039
It's really hard.

174
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:26,639
Mom.

175
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,200
Why did you take my stuff?

176
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,600
No.

177
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,279
I... let me explain first.

178
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,600
I didn't take it.

179
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,799
I was mopping your floor and found it on the ground.

180
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,200
Mom.

181
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,919
Just say what you want to say.

182
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,759
I just came in to chat with you.

183
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
Your dad and I...

184
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,120
both think that at your age,

185
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,159
having a girl you like in your heart

186
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
is perfectly normal.

187
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,480
But right now, the most important thing

188
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,799
is the college entrance exam, right?

189
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,600
Yeah.

190
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,039
Don't let it affect your studies.

191
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,360
Your dad always says,

192
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,879
"College, college."

193
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,200
Today, Mom wants to talk to you too.

194
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,039
For your life, college

195
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,399
is just a stepping stone.

196
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:30,320
We just hope that in the future,

197
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,440
you'll have a broader world and more experience.

198
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,639
Don't end up like the two of us,

199
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,399
just look.

200
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,799
For decades,

201
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,639
it's just been these folks in the hutong

202
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,879
and the goings-on at Penglexuan.

203
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,639
Right?

204
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,279
True.

205
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,279
When you're truly mature,

206
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,639
you'll naturally know

207
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,080
how to choose

208
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,399
and what you need.

209
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,559
I understand all that.

210
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,320
It's just...

211
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,480
Does Dad really think that way too?

212
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,919
He's not angry, is he?

213
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,039
Your dad asked me to come talk to you.

214
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,039
But he told me to tell you,

215
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,720
"Don't you dare hurt that girl."

216
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,279
I won't.

217
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,039
Well, there you go.

218
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,399
Mom,

219
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,559
what were you and Dad like back then?

220
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,879
Why are you asking that?

221
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,399
Tell me about it.

222
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,120
Well, uh...

223
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Uh...

224
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,919
When your dad was young,

225
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,120
he didn't have much money either.

226
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,639
Just a motorcycle.

227
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,159
He loved, loved taking me for rides.

228
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,279
I know, like this.

229
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,159
Always rode super fast.

230
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:41,720
Right.

231
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,720
And then he'd brake hard,

232
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,039
and I'd just, *thump*, have to...

233
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,159
That little trick of his.

234
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,320
Hold onto your dad's back.

235
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,399
Your dad's back

236
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,639
was really broad.

237
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,279
Once I held on, I felt

238
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,799
so safe.

239
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,639
I remember

240
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,399
another time,

241
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,879
your dad

242
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,799
got your second and third uncles

243
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,120
to buy me

244
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,720
ninety-nine candles!

245
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,639
Arranged them in a heart shape.

246
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,879
Let me tell you,

247
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,480
your dad was so romantic

248
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,960
when he was young.

249
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,440
That is pretty romantic.

250
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,519
Ninety-nine candles,

251
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,759
a heart, a little heart.

252
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,879
Don't neglect your studies, okay?

253
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,799
I know.

254
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,879
I even wrote the character wrong.

255
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,320
Can we practice our handwriting?

256
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,080
Okay.

257
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,159
Heart shape.

258
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,879
Heart shape.

259
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,240
Little heart.

260
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,840
Little heart.

261
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,720
Qiu'er got fired.

262
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,679
I asked around.

263
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,919
He was maliciously reported.

264
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,879
Who, which bastard did it?

265
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,759
How could he be so cowardly?

266
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,600
Got screwed over and didn't even tell us.

267
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,679
He's just too scared to say anything.

268
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,360
When he withdrew his shares, he swore

269
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,679
he'd do well at the bank.

270
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,080
No, if he knows it was a malicious report,

271
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
he should report it to his supervisor!

272
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,840
Do you think he has the guts?

273
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,559
He doesn't have the guts.

274
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,480
*I* have the guts.

275
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,240
Who?

276
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
Me, I'll talk to his supervisor... No, wait.

277
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,840
Big brother, don't get worked up.

278
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,559
We should help him report it, that's true.

279
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,559
But think about it.

280
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,759
Qiu'er is a grown man.

281
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,360
He has to face things himself.

282
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,240
We can't always clean up his messes.

283
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,799
Right?

284
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,840
That's also true.

285
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,879
Such a big thing,

286
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,360
and even Uncle Tong doesn't know.

287
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,480
Uncle Tong has been worried lately too.

288
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,279
If nothing else, how about...

289
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,960
we let Qiu'er come back here?

290
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,120
We can afford to feed him, right?

291
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,600
Big brother, that's not the same thing.

292
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,879
He's not telling the family

293
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,080
because he's afraid we'll worry.

294
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
But letting himself be bullied like this

295
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,960
and not daring to speak up...

296
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,840
He'll get pushed around wherever he goes.

297
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,279
I think

298
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,960
we need to give him a push.

299
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,240
Help him stand up straight.

300
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,080
Right.

301
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,879
He has to be the one to say it himself.

302
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,480
No more sweeping it under the rug.

303
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,600
Who's he trying to fool?

304
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,279
No, but, then... how...

305
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,759
How do we get him to say it himself?

306
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,399
Let me think of a way.

307
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,879
Qiu'er, what a coincidence.

308
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,759
I was just looking for you.

309
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,639
What's up?

310
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,919
Didn't you get promoted?

311
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,200
Shouldn't we throw a celebration party?

312
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,399
A celebration party? No need.

313
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,399
Why not?

314
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,799
You've been hoping for this promotion for so long.

315
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,799
Now you've finally got it.

316
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,559
Shouldn't we mark the occasion?

317
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,399
Alright, alright. When we have time.

318
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,159
I've already discussed it with Big Brother and Lianbao.

319
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,399
This Saturday, okay?

320
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,559
Why the rush?

321
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,399
Is there a problem?

322
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,759
No problem.

323
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,919
Good, no problem then.

324
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,679
Let's invite your colleagues too.

325
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,279
Why invite colleagues?

326
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,360
It's just us brothers getting together.

327
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,799
No.

328
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,279
You see, now...

329
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,759
You're kind of a small-time leader now.

330
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,279
You gotta build rapport with your colleagues, right?

331
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,160
Also,

332
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,400
there are three VIPs

333
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,319
we must invite.

334
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,680
Who?

335
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,160
Your deputy bank manager.

336
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,359
Wasn't she the one who promoted you this time?

337
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,480
And that Director Qiu.

338
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,799
She's your big client.

339
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,759
And that guy you mentioned before, Xiao Jia.

340
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,880
Hasn't he always been difficult for you to deal with?

341
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,039
This is the perfect chance

342
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:24,759
for me to talk to him for you.

343
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,480
No, no.

344
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,880
They definitely won't have the time.

345
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,559
You haven't even asked.

346
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,000
How do you know they're busy?

347
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,759
If you're busy, I'll go invite them for you.

348
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:33,799
No, no, no. Don't.

349
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,039
No need for you to go invite them for such a small thing.

350
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,640
It's unnecessary.

351
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,200
I'll just send them a message later, alright?

352
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,680
Fine.

353
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:38,480
Don't worry.

354
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:38,880
Okay.

355
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,680
Qiu'er.

356
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,880
No difficulties, right?

357
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,759
Do I look like I have any difficulties?

358
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,279
Really.

359
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:47,759
You sure?

360
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,279
Sure.

361
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,039
Good. We'll be waiting for you.

362
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,000
Alright, rest assured.

363
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,480
Hello? Feifei.

364
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,359
Sister Tongtong.

365
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,519
Are you free this Saturday?

366
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,319
I'll be running around during the day.

367
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,440
I should be back before dinner.

368
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,960
What's up?

369
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,240
Alright then, I'll come find you then.

370
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,960
It's about the video materials for my dad.

371
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,039
I want to go over them with you, okay?

372
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,160
Sure, see you then.

373
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,440
Okay, great.

374
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,839
Bye then, Sister Tongtong.

375
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Guys.

376
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,039
Xiaoshi has a prenatal check-up.

377
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,920
I need to go to Xi'an to be with her.

378
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,319
After the check-up is all done,

379
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,839
we'll get together when I'm back.

380
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:35,680
Hello?

381
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,920
Honey, I'm almost at the West Station.

382
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,839
I'll get there tomorrow morning around eight.

383
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,559
Don't trouble yourself.

384
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,680
It's no trouble.

385
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,880
I miss you. What trouble is that?

386
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,039
I'm really busy right now.

387
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,079
Why are you coming?

388
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,559
To spend the weekend together.

389
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,440
Alright then. Be careful.

390
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,160
Okay, see you tomorrow.

391
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,640
Driver, is it okay to eat something in the car?

392
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,599
If it doesn't smell much, go ahead.

393
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,799
Okay, thanks. The smell isn't strong.

394
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,920
I should be content.

395
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,839
My parents care for me.

396
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,279
My spouse is tolerant of me.

397
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,680
My brothers dote on me.

398
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,960
I once thought life could go on like this forever.

399
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,599
But I don't know when it started...

400
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,720
The one who can't stand me the most

401
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,160
has actually become myself.

402
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,240
Hello.

403
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,519
If we detail each of these four steps

404
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,079
and refine them into this...

405
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,240
I think it might be a lot better.

406
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,759
Definitely.

407
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,440
I think this mainly targets

408
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,720
the problem to be solved.

409
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,400
But regarding this risk...

410
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,640
I feel there might be a bit of a problem.

411
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,119
Xiaoshi.

412
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,039
I'm here!

413
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,680
Hey, what's wrong?

414
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,960
Who made my wife unhappy?

415
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,200
You look so grim.

416
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,119
What happened?

417
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,599
Dad just called me.

418
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,880
He said that Auntie Ma, who introduced you to buy that financial product last time,

419
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,279
she received a text saying

420
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,960
the contact person has changed.

421
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,200
Upon further asking,

422
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,519
they said you've been fired.

423
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,839
Mom and Dad knew you were coming to see me.

424
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,319
They told me over and over

425
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,640
to ask you properly.

426
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,440
What happened?

427
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,599
Is it a money problem?

428
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,759
If it is,

429
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,279
we'll find a way to pay it back.

430
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,880
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

431
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,920
Don't worry, don't worry.

432
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,240
Then tell me!

433
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,960
Okay, okay, okay.

434
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,039
That Jia Zhilong said there's something between me and Director Qiu.

435
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,240
What did you say? I didn't hear you.

436
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,920
Jia Zhilong.

437
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,039
Said my relationship with Director Qiu is improper.

438
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,759
Speak up!

439
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:35,599
Jia Zhilong!

440
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,880
Xiao Jia.

441
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,880
He falsely accused me and Director Qiu

442
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,440
of having an improper relationship.

443
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,960
That's why I got promoted.

444
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,480
It's absolutely not true!

445
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,000
Didn't you defend yourself?

446
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,319
Yes.

447
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,920
You know about that photo, right?

448
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,960
It's been spreading in other company chat groups.

449
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:20,880
I want to defend myself.

450
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,920
But can I possibly defend against it all?

451
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,160
I tell people there's nothing between us.

452
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,079
No one believes me.

453
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:28,200
And people's mouths are their own.

454
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,559
Nothing I say makes a difference.

455
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,640
Even if I escalate this,

456
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,759
in the end, headquarters and the branch

457
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,079
will think I'm going against them.

458
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,240
Even if I do go back,

459
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,799
I won't have an easy time, right?

460
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,160
Don't be angry.

461
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,920
Don't worry either, honey. Listen.

462
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,640
We shouldn't upset the pregnancy.

463
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,599
It's not worth it.

464
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,079
It's really fine.

465
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,599
And there's good news now.

466
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,319
Penglexuan got a big investment.

467
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,920
Third Brother has some money for me to invest.

468
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,359
If I want to change jobs,

469
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,880
it'll be easy.

470
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,880
Why do you take everything so lightly?

471
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,359
This matter of yours is murky.

472
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,759
Would another bank dare hire you?

473
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,920
Right, right, right.

474
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,640
Don't, don't, don't get worked up.

475
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,599
Besides,

476
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,160
those two clients of yours,

477
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,799
did you get them on your own merit?

478
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,559
What's wrong with my ability?

479
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,880
You have no idea

480
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,480
how much pressure I'm under every day.

481
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,039
Who doesn't have pressure?

482
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
How did you become like this?

483
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,079
What have I become?

484
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,519
What have I become?

485
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,799
Haven't I always been this way?

486
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,480
I feel like you're the one who's changed.

487
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,119
Yeah, I have changed.

488
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,640
We're not the same as before.

489
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,720
I had to change.

490
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,359
Bro, have some water.

491
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,119
Yeah, thanks.

492
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,599
Xiao Li, watering the flowers?

493
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,720
These two pots are doing well.

494
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,279
Blow it higher.

495
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:02,960
The higher you blow it,

496
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,000
the taller it'll grow later.

497
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,720
Xiao Yang.

498
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,400
Uncle.

499
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Be careful on the road.

500
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,960
Don't fall.

501
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,880
Hello, Uncle Yang.

502
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,319
Penglexuan's doing good business today.

503
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,279
Quite a crowd again.

504
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:17,839
Tables are turning over pretty fast.

505
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,359
Yeah.

506
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,400
I'm saying, you two,

507
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
even combined,

508
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,240
can't beat Uncle Dong at chess.

509
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,160
Watch your step.

510
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,720
I'm not playing.

511
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,839
I'm a terrible player.

512
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,480
Easy now, don't fall.

513
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,920
What are you doing?

514
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,359
Looking for my sister Tongtong again?

515
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:48,839
What a coincidence, she's not here today.

516
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,839
I'm not looking for her.

517
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,160
I'm looking for my big brother.

518
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,720
Who's your big brother?

519
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,480
Didn't you tell me to call him big brother?

520
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,920
I forgot.

521
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,799
What could you possibly have to talk about with my third uncle?

522
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,519
Is your homework done?

523
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,400
Call him out for me.

524
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,359
Fine, I can call him out for you.

525
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,039
As long as you're not afraid of being tortured by him.

526
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,079
What does he want with me?

527
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:22,960
No idea.

528
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,839
He's just standing there at the door, looking cocky.

529
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,599
Uncle, you gotta teach him a lesson later.

530
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,720
Really put him in his place.

531
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:35,599
Big Brother.

532
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,799
Let me talk to my big brother alone.

533
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,839
It's fine.

534
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,039
Go back inside.

535
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,200
Go back.

536
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,079
What is it?

537
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,839
I'm here for Jin Tong.

538
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:01,880
We're very good friends.

539
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:03,839
I know.

540
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,079
Is something wrong with her?

541
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,640
You seem quite concerned about her.

542
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:10,880
She's my niece.

543
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,079
Of course I'm concerned.

544
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,119
Do you really see her as just your niece?

545
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,319
What do you mean?

546
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,799
Careful, easy, easy, easy.

547
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,640
What are you listening to?

548
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,839
None of your business.

549
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,839
None of my business?

550
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,359
Then I definitely need to listen.

551
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,599
Two people who like each other,

552
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,960
why can't they try to be together?

553
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,759
Who... who told you that?

554
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,680
Jin Tong and I are close friends who tell each other everything.

555
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,079
Since I came back this time,

556
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,920
she's told me a lot of things, out of the blue.

557
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,960
She's your good friend.

558
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,599
She tells you her business.

559
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,559
That's not a problem.

560
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,839
But you coming to me so rashly

561
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:01,720
will put her in an awkward position.

562
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,359
I came to you

563
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:04,079
because seeing her current state,

564
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,839
I'm really worried for her, you know?

565
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,359
What kind of person is Jin Tong?

566
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,440
Since she was little, about everything,

567
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,599
she's been someone who can pick things up and let them go.

568
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,240
You know that?

569
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,119
Uncle, uncle.

570
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,599
Let's not listen anymore, let's go, okay?

571
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,720
You can't just listen to half a story.

572
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,000
A story needs a beginning and an end.

573
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,799
What if there's something even juicier later?

574
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,440
No, uncle.

575
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,680
What are you doing here?

576
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,799
I'm looking for your Grandpa Tong.

577
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,720
He wants to buy a lottery ticket.

578
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,599
Darn it, I forgot the main thing.

579
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,440
Uncle.

580
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Can you promise me something?

581
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,799
Not a single word you heard today

582
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,079
can be spoken of.

583
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,640
Can't speak of it.

584
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,079
Won't speak of it.

585
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,119
My lips are sealed.

586
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,359
Don't worry, I swear on my lottery shop.

587
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,599
If I do speak of it,

588
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,240
I'll never win five million in my life.

589
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,079
But I don't seem destined to win five million anyway.

590
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,119
Might as well enjoy the show first.

591
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,359
Enough.

592
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,559
My affairs are none of your concern.

593
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,279
Go back.

594
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,359
You're always here avoiding the problem.

595
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,839
You always make her pretend to be carefree.

596
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,119
Don't you think you're being despicable?

597
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,559
Alright, young man.

598
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,599
Go do whatever you need to do.

599
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,799
My business is none of your concern.

600
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:20,359
Go back.

601
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:20,960
Let me ask you.

602
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,839
What should I do?

603
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:22,839
Thank you. Go back.

604
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,599
Thank you.

605
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,240
What are you looking at?

606
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,599
Looking isn't against the law.

607
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:55,720
This, this, this...

608
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,160
This angle is good. Don't move.

609
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,400
It looks good.

610
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,079
Two people who like each other...

611
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,400
Why can't they try to be together?

612
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:16,880
Enough.

613
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,079
You don't need to worry about my business.

614
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:19,759
Go back.

615
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,960
You're always here avoiding the problem.

616
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,440
You always make her pretend to be carefree.

617
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,680
Don't you think you're despicable?

618
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,000
Let's go, let's go.

619
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,599
What now?

620
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,839
Weren't we supposed to see a doctor?

621
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,480
I'm not going.

622
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,960
Student Ma Weiguo.

623
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,559
Being afraid won't solve the problem.

624
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,880
Keeping a calm mindset is important.

625
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,200
Besides, I'm here with you.

626
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,960
What are you afraid of?

627
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:01,200
Dinosaurs went extinct.

628
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,960
But the Chinese ginkgo tree survived.

629
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,440
As a Chinese person,

630
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,720
shouldn't you learn from

631
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,440
the ginkgo's tenacious will to live?

632
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,400
I've told the story.

633
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,440
Any other methods?

634
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,559
What do you want to tell me?

635
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,679
I just want to tell you

636
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,400
that I like you.

637
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,880
And,

638
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,719
I've liked you since the first time I saw you.

639
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,000
But in my view,

640
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,679
you've always been a coward.

641
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,119
Over twenty years ago,

642
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,519
you had a falling out with your brother,

643
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,000
and you fled abroad.

644
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,280
Over twenty years later,

645
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,079
you got sick and fled back here.

646
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,920
Pretending

647
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,000
you're above fighting the illness.

648
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,400
And right now,

649
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:30,119
you still want to run away.

650
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,320
Jing'er, the fifty new duck carcasses that arrived,

651
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,440
I put them in the fridge.

652
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,239
I'm going to change.

653
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,000
This big ring is really something.

654
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,199
Don't be ridiculous.

655
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:55,840
Let me tell you something else.

656
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,440
What is it?

657
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,000
Tongtong and that Weiguo are together.

658
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,280
Together how?

659
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,519
What else could 'together' mean?

660
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,800
Impossible.

661
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,000
They're from different generations.

662
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,679
Who told you?

663
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,840
That Big Fool Yang heard it himself.

664
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,880
Can you believe anything Big Fool Yang says?

665
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,360
He's all talk.

666
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,079
Nonsense.

667
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,559
I'll twist his head off.

668
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:15,599
Listen,

669
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,079
this might actually be true.

670
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,440
Just from him saying it,

671
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,599
I started thinking Tongtong and Weiguo

672
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,360
usually act a bit strange.

673
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,079
What do you mean 'true'?

674
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,800
If Second Brother finds out about this,

675
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,480
wouldn't he be furious?

676
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:28,960
Let me tell you,

677
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,480
if Big Fool Yang keeps spouting nonsense,

678
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,599
and Second Brother finds out,

679
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,880
he really will twist his head off.

680
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,599
Uncle, Auntie, hello.

681
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,599
Yuanyuan's here.

682
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,400
You look so pretty today.

683
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,079
Has that Dong Qian arrived?

684
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,840
Not yet. Come on, let's go.

685
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,679
Go, go upstairs.

686
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,960
Right, right. You go upstairs with Dad first.

687
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,360
Auntie will come up to play with you later.

688
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,599
Get her some drinks, snacks, things like that.

689
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,119
It's so nice to have a daughter.

690
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,159
Look how quiet she is,

691
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,519
reading here by herself.

692
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,039
Here, Yuanyuan, have some water.

693
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:00,880
Big Brother.

694
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,760
Xuanxuan's here.

695
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,239
Say hello.

696
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,079
Uncle, hello Uncle Lianbao.

697
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,079
Come here, come here. Have some water.

698
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:12,719
Big Brother, there happens to be a supplementary agreement here

699
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,480
that needs our signatures as shareholders.

700
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,360
Give it to Lianbao.

701
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,719
Give it to Lianbao?

702
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,119
What's going on with you two?

703
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,599
It's nothing.

704
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,039
Dad.

705
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,199
Did you break up with Auntie Qianqian?

706
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,360
Why don't you talk to her?

707
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,119
Yuanyuan, you're still young.

708
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,719
'Break up' isn't the right word here.

709
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,000
Just read your book.

710
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,960
Isn't it called a breakup when you stop dating?

711
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,199
Xuanxuan, don't talk nonsense.

712
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,360
A few days ago,

713
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,920
Dad and you were still dating often.

714
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:06,239
Yuanyuan.

715
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,079
My mom has been to Uncle Lianbao's house.

716
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,199
Xuanxuan, stop talking nonsense.

717
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,440
No, let the kid speak.

718
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,719
What, what else is there?

719
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,719
And Dad smiles

720
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,039
as soon as he hears Auntie Qianqian's voice.

721
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,199
When Mom calls Uncle Lianbao,

722
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,840
she's really gentle, right?

723
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,199
Xuanxuan, that's enough.

724
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:30,679
Big Brother, it's about time.

725
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,360
I need to take him home to do his homework.

726
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,440
No, why the rush to leave?

727
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,079
Uh, well...

728
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,599
Weiguo hasn't signed yet, right?

729
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,840
After he signs it,

730
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,960
just mail it to me.

731
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,599
No, wait, Lianbao hasn't signed either.

732
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,440
Let's all walk you out.

733
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,800
Let's go, let's go. We're heading back now.

734
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,079
Wait, we should see them off.

735
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:43,840
No need, no need, no need.

736
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,360
Bye, bye, bye.

737
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,079
See them off.

738
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,000
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.

739
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,719
What nonsense are you talking about?

740
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,079
Xuanxuan, you forgot your water bottle.

741
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,920
Mom is bullying me.

742
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,559
Yuanyuan, you're reading?

743
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,199
You should head back now.

744
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:02,920
Don't bother seeing us off.

745
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,840
Please, come inside.

746
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,199
No, he needs to go back and finish his homework.

747
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,079
We'll be heading back now.

748
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,039
Bye, Auntie.

749
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:08,800
Bye.

750
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,440
Bye, Xuanxuan.

751
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,079
We're off, Big Brother.

752
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,239
Alright then, sounds good.

753
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:11,599
Alright.

754
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,800
Take care.

755
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,079
Listen to this.

756
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,239
Qianqian and our Lianbao are together.

757
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,920
Finally got together.

758
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,119
Who told you that?

759
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,559
Just now, those two kids were upstairs.

760
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,320
Talking back and forth.

761
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,679
And they spilled the beans.

762
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:29,519
Really?

763
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:30,679
That's great.

764
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,840
Big Brother, Sister-in-law.

765
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:33,559
Where's Dong Qian?

766
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,599
She just left.

767
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,039
Right, the contract for you to sign is upstairs.

768
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:37,920
Okay, I'll go up and wait then.

769
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,519
Let's go, let's go.

770
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,239
Go, go.

771
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,119
How serious is it?

772
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,159
How would I know that?

773
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,880
You didn't ask for more details?

774
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,039
You didn't say more?

775
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,239
You...

776
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:49,920
I'm going up first.

777
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:50,880
Go ahead.

778
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,599
Do you have any conscience?

779
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
You and Tongtong, isn't this just fooling around?

780
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,199
No, Second Brother...

781
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,159
You... you heard this from Big Fool Yang, right?

782
00:39:59,159 --> 00:39:59,559
Right?

783
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:01,760
Big Fool Yang said he and Tongtong are together.

784
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,000
How is that possible?

785
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,400
Big Fool Yang's words are completely unreliable.

786
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,519
You can't believe what he says.

787
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,400
What?

788
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,400
I'm talking about the day before yesterday, when Sister-in-law got lost.

789
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,559
He and Tongtong were in cahoots.

790
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,719
Th-there was such a thing?

791
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,760
Not exactly.

792
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,679
You... what were you just saying?

793
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,960
I... I... what did I say?

794
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:25,679
No, you and Tongtong are really together, right?

795
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:29,440
I know our Tongtong has feelings for you.

796
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,719
Give me an honest answer.

797
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:32,920
What are your feelings for her?

798
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:33,960
No, what?

799
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,199
What do you mean you know what's in Tongtong's heart?

800
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,400
You knew about this all along?

801
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,239
Fine.

802
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,599
Big Brother isn't an outsider.

803
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,800
Yes, I do have feelings for Tongtong.

804
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,440
But given my current situation...

805
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,880
It's simply impossible for me and her.

806
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:49,960
You have feelings for Tongtong?

807
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,159
Second Brother...

808
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,400
That foreigner is here, downstairs.

809
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,760
Says he's here to pick up Yuanyuan.

810
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,199
What a nuisance.

811
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,159
I'll go deal with it.

812
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,800
Yuanyuan, come downstairs with Dad.

813
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,079
Big Brother, my feelings for Tongtong are...

814
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,039
Yes... I do have feelings.

815
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,239
But about Sister-in-law's incident...

816
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:09,760
It wasn't exactly collusion, just...

817
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,079
Just offering a little suggestion.

818
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:14,280
Your suggestion to your sister-in-law was not to come back, right?

819
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,320
No, it was Tongtong, Tongtong...

820
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,079
Right, it was Tongtong, not me.

821
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:16,960
There's a lot going on downstairs.

822
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,679
Hurry up, go down.

823
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,519
No, no, what's going on? Back then...

824
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,639
After she left, she wouldn't come back.

825
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,559
That was your idea, right?

826
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,480
No, there was no idea.
