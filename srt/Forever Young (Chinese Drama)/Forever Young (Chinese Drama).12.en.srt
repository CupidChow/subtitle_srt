1
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,359
That's as much as three months of my salary.

2
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,079
I work my butt off.

3
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,760
But it still can't keep up with how much you spend.

4
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,799
Look at this trip of yours.

5
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,239
A bag, flowers...

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,159
About this bag...

7
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,959
Hold on, I have another meeting.

8
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,000
We'll talk more when I get back.

9
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,400
When will it end?

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,359
Not sure.

11
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,680
When will you be back?

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Hard to say.

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,400
"Not sure," "hard to say."

14
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,480
Then what am I supposed to do?

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,359
This section here...

16
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,079
is the overall plan prepared

17
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,079
by our colleagues in the operations department.

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,319
Next, regarding new media...

19
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,520
There are a total of twenty-six short videos.

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,639
Thirteen of them require scripted content.

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,840
What the heck did you write?

22
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,520
Yes, it's my fault.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,199
It really is my fault.

24
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,080
You have no idea...

25
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,080
The dirty stuff behind that promotion...

26
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,360
I can't even be bothered to talk about it.

27
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,319
You talk as if I've never had a job.

28
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,919
So my promotion and raise in Xi'an...

29
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,159
were also through dirty means, right?

30
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,280
No, no, no.

31
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,520
When I was a kid, I was quite popular in the alley.

32
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,960
The adults said I was delicate, like a girl.

33
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,159
And because of this...

34
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,360
my old man was actually quite smug. He said...

35
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,960
"A man with feminine features is blessed."

36
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
When he grows up, he'll definitely...

37
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,480
Getting some sun?

38
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,879
Yes.

39
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,480
Nice weather today.

40
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

41
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,720
Hello?

42
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,399
Hello, Third Uncle.

43
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,079
So, I did what you said.

44
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,160
I provoked him quite a bit.

45
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,519
I saw his expression getting worse and worse.

46
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,160
And he was baring his teeth, looking furious.

47
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,720
I reckon...

48
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,480
he's about to go after you for real now.

49
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,480
Be careful.

50
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,160
As long as he's willing to go all out...

51
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,079
I'll keep him company.

52
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,360
Gotta go for now.

53
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,279
What's wrong?

54
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,600
When exactly is that money supposed to arrive?

55
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,879
You went to see Xiaoshi?

56
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,079
That thing you said...

57
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,399
about making Peng Le Xuan big within three months...

58
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,079
and going public within two years... is it reliable or not?

59
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,519
What did Xiaoshi do to you?

60
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,160
I...

61
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,399
Look at me, a Beijinger...

62
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,720
born and raised here...

63
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,279
and I've achieved nothing so far.

64
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,959
This time when I went to see my wife...

65
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,959
She's now...

66
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,800
valued by her leaders...

67
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,279
with obedient staff.

68
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,279
When she runs a meeting...

69
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,519
the way she lays out grand plans...

70
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,040
that spirited, confident look... I...

71
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,720
I even feel...

72
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,399
if this continues...

73
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,360
I won't be good enough for her anymore.

74
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,959
I must get my career on track.

75
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,600
You're jealous of Xiaoshi.

76
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,040
How could I be?

77
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
That's a good thing too.

78
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,399
As long as you're willing to come back and work steadily...

79
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,959
That's good.

80
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
So about this work of ours...

81
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,600
when can we make progress?

82
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,360
That depends on Big Brother.

83
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,160
Depends on Big Brother.

84
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,839
He's here.

85
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,480
Big Brother, we were just talking about you.

86
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
Perfect, you're both here.

87
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,319
I came over just to say...

88
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,720
I'm not doing the taste test.

89
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,160
I'm not roasting duck anymore.

90
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm not getting involved with the chef stuff either.

91
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,360
I'm going to focus on studying our Feifei.

92
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,399
What's going on now?

93
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,120
Go check it out.

94
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,759
Bro, what's this about?

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,480
Second Brother's here, perfect.

96
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,600
Let me repeat what I just said.

97
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
From now on...

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,120
I'm just not making roast duck anymore.

99
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,000
You...

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,199
Don't do that.

101
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
I disagree.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,560
Agree or not, I don't care.

103
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,879
Second Brother.

104
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,000
We'll do it your way.

105
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,360
Find a ready-made chef.

106
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,920
I'll act as his consultant then.

107
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,480
Big Brother...

108
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,920
No, isn't that what you wanted all along?

109
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,600
Right?

110
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,920
We'll do as you say.

111
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,759
I've figured it out too.

112
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,759
Me...

113
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,920
Don't try to fool me anymore.

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,560
I'm not doing this.

115
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,560
Alright then.

116
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,920
I'll handle the arrangements.

117
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,560
What are you arranging?

118
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,279
He's talking nonsense.

119
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:17,920
I object.

120
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,759
The reason I provoked you like that...

121
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,399
was to make you focus on roasting duck properly.

122
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,240
Now you just decide to quit?

123
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,480
If you can't recreate...

124
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,000
the old Peng Le Xuan flavor...

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,759
then I won't invest the money.

126
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,920
Invest or not, suit yourself.

127
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,000
Hey...

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,120
Can you not talk to Big Brother like that?

129
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,879
You two, stop bickering like this.

130
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,040
It's easy to create a deadlock.

131
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,879
Bro, listen to me for a second.

132
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,279
I think you should practice a bit more.

133
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,040
Let's not let this whole thing fall apart, okay?

134
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't waste your breath on me.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,160
Hand me the tea.

136
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,240
The freshly brewed tea.

137
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,480
Big Brother, Second Brother, listen to me.

138
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,920
Let's listen to Ma Weiguo on this.

139
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,279
Right now, we're counting on him.

140
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,839
We finally have a chance to turn things around.

141
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,279
Let's not miss it, okay?

142
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,120
Qiu'er, don't you worry.

143
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,879
I actually have some good news to tell you.

144
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,759
What good news?

145
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,879
What's wrong, Weiguo?

146
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
What's going on with you?

147
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,399
There's just a small issue.

148
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,399
My funds have been frozen.

149
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
No, no, sit, sit down and have some water.

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,639
How did they suddenly... suddenly get frozen?

151
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,799
What about Laise?

152
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,519
They say they want to investigate a few of my past M&A cases.

153
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,639
So...

154
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,279
Inves... investigation...

155
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,440
How long will that take?

156
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,519
How long is the investigation?

157
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,240
Over three months.

158
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,519
Over three months?!

159
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,519
Well, that's it then.

160
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,679
Our project is dead in the water again.

161
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,519
He's bailing on us again.

162
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,519
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

163
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,159
We'll proceed with the original plan.

164
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,120
Big Brother.

165
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,000
For these three months, you just keep practicing your skills.

166
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,159
No need.

167
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,679
I've already secured the money.

168
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,279
The reason I came today...

169
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,639
...is to announce this.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,279
Ten million in cash.

171
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,519
No due diligence required.

172
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,240
And we don't have to put up with any more nonsense.

173
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,399
And Big Brother doesn't need to practice his skills.

174
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,919
The money can be transferred anytime.

175
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,919
Why didn't you say so earlier?

176
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,399
Should we open that bottle of wine now?

177
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,120
Who would invest in you at a time like this?

178
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,679
That's none of your concern.

179
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,120
It has absolutely nothing to do with you.

180
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,639
Since you can't come up with the money now...

181
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,799
...you're already out of the game.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,799
Wait.

183
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,080
I remember we had a previous agreement, right?

184
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,480
How did it go again?

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,879
I said...

186
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,759
...I would personally invest in Peng Le Xuan.

187
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,159
Who believes that?

188
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,000
Three months.

189
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,399
Within three months...

190
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,279
...I'll double Peng Le Xuan's valuation to one hundred sixty million.

191
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,279
You're a smart man too, right?

192
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,559
You also know that under these circumstances...

193
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,399
...Peng Le Xuan can go public very soon.

194
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:23,039
Fine. If you manage it in three months...

195
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,919
...I'll apologize to you.

196
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,559
Deal.

197
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,120
And if you can't do it?

198
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,399
If I can't do it...

199
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,879
...I'll apologize to the three of you.

200
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,759
Within three months...

201
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,600
...if you fail to make Peng Le Xuan a success...

202
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,200
...you'll kowtow and admit your mistake to the three of us...

203
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,600
...and then get the hell out of the country.

204
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,519
That was the deal, wasn't it?

205
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,240
Second Brother.

206
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,000
That was all just joking around at the time.

207
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,600
Don't worry.

208
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,759
I always keep my promises.

209
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,519
Besides, the three months aren't up yet.

210
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,480
Fine. I'll be waiting to settle the score.

211
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,519
You don't have much time left.

212
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,720
Second Brother.

213
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,960
What's going on here?

214
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Another conversation blew up.

215
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,320
It's nothing.

216
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,720
Just the game leveling up.

217
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,799
Didn't you say you'd take me...

218
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,360
...to Panjiayuan to browse for props? Let's go.

219
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,879
I'm pretty busy today. Next time.

220
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,559
Again?

221
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,679
With an attitude like that, you'll never win this game.

222
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,960
Do you believe in the light?

223
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,159
Are you crazy?

224
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,679
You... you think...

225
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,320
He, he, he... he couldn't be...

226
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,799
...involved in some serious trouble, could he?

227
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
Whatever trouble he's in...

228
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,960
...is also because of that mouth of his.

229
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,799
Just think how many people he must have offended with that mouth.

230
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,080
He definitely offended plenty of people abroad too.

231
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,799
Alright, alright.

232
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,799
Let's not talk about him for now.

233
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,559
Our investment funds are arriving soon.

234
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,080
Shouldn't we celebrate?

235
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,559
What do you guys want to eat later?

236
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,559
Hold on, where did this money come from?

237
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,679
Yeah.

238
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,720
Before, it was so hard to borrow money.

239
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,799
Now it just appears out of nowhere.

240
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,200
And the terms are so good.

241
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,799
A friend.

242
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,600
What kind of friend?

243
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,480
What friend is that generous?

244
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,799
It came through legitimate means, anyway.

245
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,120
I guarantee it's clean.

246
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,480
How many years have we been building Laise together?

247
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,519
Ten years.

248
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,879
And how long have I been gone?

249
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,279
One month.

250
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,879
I thought it had been several years.

251
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,759
While it's true that when a man leaves, the tea grows cold...

252
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,759
...you didn't need to move against me so hastily.

253
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,360
What do you mean by that?

254
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,759
I genuinely don't understand.

255
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,480
Those M&A cases...

256
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,360
...were completely clean, without any issues.

257
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,120
Accusing me of privately taking shares, accepting bribes...

258
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,600
...backroom deals, and so on.

259
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,960
That was all on your orders, wasn't it?

260
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,480
This is a misunderstanding.

261
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
We've been partners for so many years.

262
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,360
How could I not trust you?

263
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,559
But someone really did report and expose this.

264
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,600
The procedures have to be followed.

265
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,000
This is also the management regulation...

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,480
...that we both established back then, right?

267
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,480
You've been waiting for this opportunity for a long time, haven't you?

268
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,679
Old Ma, let me put it to you this way.

269
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,720
I can assure you...

270
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,960
...this matter has absolutely nothing to do with me.

271
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,000
You can rest assured.

272
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,000
It's just a procedural matter.

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,759
Okay?

274
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,000
Also, if you're having cash flow problems on your end...

275
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,600
...please don't hesitate to ask me.

276
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,000
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

277
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,000
Hello, Martin.

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
Wang Esq.

279
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,000
How's it going over there?

280
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,720
The situation is very tricky now.

281
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,639
We need to call in some favors now.

282
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,559
And,

283
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,080
we also need to halt some business collaborations.

284
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,960
This matter is a bit complicated at the moment.

285
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm currently trying to solve it with various plans.

286
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:12,840
So,

287
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,679
please give me a little more time.

288
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,799
I'll handle it.

289
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,200
Sorry for the trouble.

290
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,120
As soon as possible.

291
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,240
How are things on your end?

292
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,240
Is there anything we can help with?

293
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,000
Say something.

294
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,639
What's it to you?

295
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,000
Still angry?

296
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,919
It's not that I'm not on your side.

297
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,759
I really need a career right now.

298
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,879
Anything else?

299
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,720
What you guys did wasn't very decent.

300
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,759
Weiguo is, after all, one of our own brothers.

301
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,879
What brother?

302
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
He scolded us like we were his grandsons.

303
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,480
It's so hot.

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,440
Let it cool for a bit.

305
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,720
Didn't you see him going off on me?

306
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,000
He went off on me so hard I was gasping.

307
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,919
Besides,

308
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,000
it wasn't me who drove him away, right?

309
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,320
Anyway, it's what you wanted now.

310
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,799
How is it what I wanted?

311
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,159
We have the money.

312
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,879
You don't have to practice roasting ducks anymore.

313
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,639
Right?

314
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,240
No, I mean, Peng Le Xuan can't just

315
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,399
sit idle all day long, right?

316
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,399
Now that we have money,

317
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,159
we can get it on track, can't we?

318
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,639
But why don't you seem happy?

319
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,039
Still worried about Weiguo, huh?

320
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,600
Me, worry about him?

321
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,240
I'm overjoyed.

322
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,840
Let him taste what it's like to have no money.

323
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,840
Yeah, you're right.

324
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,120
Happy.

325
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,879
Soaking? How long do we wait for it to cool?

326
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,599
Stop spraying! Stop!

327
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,960
It's me! It hurts so much!

328
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,359
Li Lianbao?

329
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,400
It's me!

330
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,960
What are you doing here?

331
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,640
I was waiting for you.

332
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,920
What did you spray on me?

333
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,720
Waiting for me?

334
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,359
You scared me to death!

335
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,559
Are you okay?

336
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,759
Don't move, don't move.

337
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:39,960
Over here.

338
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,359
Relax, relax.

339
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:45,960
Here.

340
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,599
Feeling better?

341
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,119
You're still laughing?

342
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,400
You were way too rough.

343
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,799
You didn't even see who it was.

344
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,960
You just started spraying.

345
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,599
No, but you, in the middle of the night,

346
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,119
hiding in our building's stairwell...

347
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,119
How was I supposed to know you weren't a creep?

348
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,079
It's good I didn't call the police on you.

349
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,720
I called you, you didn't answer.

350
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,440
I texted you on WeChat, you didn't reply.

351
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,799
So I had to come see

352
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,200
what was going on.

353
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
But when I got here,

354
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,519
I rang the bell, no one answered.

355
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,480
No, where's your housekeeper?

356
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,359
Where did she go?

357
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,359
We had meetings at the company all afternoon.

358
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,839
My phone was on silent.

359
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,039
My housekeeper took the day off today.

360
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
I sent Xuanxuan to my parents' place.

361
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,960
But you,

362
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,880
what are you doing at my place so late?

363
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,240
I'm in a bad mood.

364
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,359
I want to pick a fight.

365
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,480
Are you crazy, Li Lianbao?

366
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,960
Anyway, I just wanted to find someone

367
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,079
I really can't stand and have a huge fight.

368
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,240
And face-to-face.

369
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,279
Someone I can out-argue.

370
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,240
You're nuts.

371
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,880
You're insane.

372
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,119
I kicked Ma Weiguo out.

373
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,640
So you came to my place

374
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,880
to set your sights on me?

375
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,000
What are you thinking?

376
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,200
I found someone to take over.

377
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,319
Who?

378
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,519
Kevin.

379
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,720
Haven't you always wanted

380
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,440
shares in Hive Tech?

381
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,400
Okay.

382
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,880
Tom, you've finally come around.

383
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:31,960
Name your price.

384
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,480
The price is negotiable.

385
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,160
But I have one condition.

386
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,720
Go ahead.

387
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,359
You must invest in Peng Le Xuan.

388
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,359
Tom,

389
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,960
you know I never invest in food service projects.

390
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,319
That's not my field.

391
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,960
But,

392
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
for you, I'm willing.

393
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,480
Don't be so mushy, okay?

394
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,119
But I have to make it clear,

395
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,680
I'm not begging you.

396
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,480
This is just a form of cooperation.

397
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:58,839
Fine.

398
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,759
But my investment also has requirements.

399
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,079
I knew you weren't a good guy either.

400
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,200
Alright, then let's talk.

401
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,039
Do you think I'm utterly shameless?

402
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,240
Actually going to ask Lao Kai for money.

403
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,640
If you want to laugh at me,

404
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
go ahead and do it.

405
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:34,799
Alright, I'm leaving.

406
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,279
Apply it.

407
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,400
I just think you men...

408
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,240
are childish.

409
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,440
Things like "stealing my wife"...

410
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,799
or "snatching your daughter"...

411
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,359
What era is this?

412
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,000
He even fired me.

413
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,160
Now you know why I don't think much of you.

414
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,200
You, as a person...

415
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,359
are usually quite shameless...

416
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,880
but I've found you do have a bottom line.

417
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,160
Let me put it this way.

418
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,240
If Weiguo were in your place...

419
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,799
do you think he'd hesitate...

420
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,279
about taking Kevin's money?

421
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,440
Probably not.

422
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,799
Definitely not.

423
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,440
As long as he can secure investment...

424
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,400
as long as he can achieve his goal...

425
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,720
he'd charge ahead without a second thought.

426
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,960
But you wouldn't.

427
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,960
In daily life...

428
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,640
having principles is a virtue.

429
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,359
But in business...

430
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,079
that's your biggest flaw.

431
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,440
Fine, I'll take that as a compliment.

432
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,519
How rare.

433
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,200
To hear such words...

434
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
from someone as ungrateful as you.

435
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,880
Are you asking for another spray?

436
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,880
No.

437
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,079
Couldn't you tell it was me earlier?

438
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,720
It was so dark, and I was scared.

439
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
How was I supposed to recognize you?

440
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,799
See? That's exactly what being ungrateful is.

441
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,359
Don't you forget...

442
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,480
back in eighth grade...

443
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,960
during P.E., you sprained your ankle.

444
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Who carried you to the infirmary?

445
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,640
You were on my back...

446
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,240
snot and tears all over my neck.

447
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,640
You have the nerve to bring that up?

448
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,960
You didn't even make it to the infirmary.

449
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,640
You took a huge tumble.

450
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,480
I only had a sprained ankle...

451
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,160
but then my hand got fractured.

452
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,720
It's because you were so heavy!

453
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:16,960
It's all your fault.

454
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:19,119
I had to rest at home for half a month.

455
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,200
Missed two weeks of classes.

456
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,039
I didn't even get first place in the midterms.

457
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,480
You know what?

458
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,559
That was the only time I ever came in second.

459
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:28,759
Wait...

460
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,960
I brought you the class notes.

461
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,799
I just didn't dare go inside.

462
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,359
I was afraid your dad would beat me up.

463
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,119
I left them by the door.

464
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,400
Didn't you get them?

465
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,920
Later, I even brought you a soda when I came back.

466
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,559
I never got to drink it.

467
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
I drank it.

468
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,920
What kind of person does that?

469
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,799
But didn't Lili buy you a popsicle back then?

470
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,960
You were so happy you had snot bubbles.

471
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
I was afraid you'd choke on the soda.

472
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,359
No, Lili liked Ma Weiguo.

473
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,759
She asked me to pass a message for her.

474
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,480
Where did you get that idea?

475
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:03,880
Really.

476
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,839
It sounds to me like you were jealous.

477
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,279
Me? Jealous?

478
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,799
What a joke.

479
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,200
Back then, the people chasing me...

480
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,799
couldn't even fit in Tiananmen Square.

481
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,720
And you think *I* was jealous?

482
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,960
Yes, yes, yes.

483
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,759
You were the hot commodity.

484
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,400
*I* was the one who ate a lot of vinegar.

485
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,279
You were jealous?

486
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,240
You were jealous?

487
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,039
Why did you never tell me...

488
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,440
I was afraid of holding back your studies.

489
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,559
You were so competitive.

490
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,440
Coming in second...

491
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,759
was like the sky falling for you.

492
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,599
I originally planned...

493
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,079
to tell you after the college entrance exams...

494
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,960
But who would've thought...

495
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,599
that fight happened.

496
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,000
My guaranteed admission to Beihang University fell through.

497
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,880
I felt too ashamed.

498
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,440
It's all Ma Weiguo's fault.

499
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
My eye is starting to hurt again.

500
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
What did you spray on me?

501
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,799
Don't use your hands.

502
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,720
Lie down.

503
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,319
Lie down.

504
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,359
So direct?

505
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,000
Okay, okay.

506
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,759
If my eyes are ruined...

507
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
you'll have to take care of me for the rest of my life.

508
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,039
I'll see you off to your grave, that's how I'll take care of you.

509
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,200
Forget it then.

510
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,920
I'm afraid you'd scatter my ashes to the wind.

511
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Are you going to put the drops in or not?

512
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,960
Yes, yes, yes.

513
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
So much talk.

514
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,960
What are you doing?

515
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,240
Nothing.

516
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,519
If it's nothing, why are you holding me?

517
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,079
You didn't refuse either.

518
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm refusing now.

519
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,759
Too late.

520
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,160
Hurry up.

521
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,440
What's wrong with you?

522
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,799
I'm a patient now.

523
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,160
What?

524
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,480
Shouldn't you take good care of me?

525
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,319
No.

526
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:18,960
Let go of me.

527
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,000
Be gentle.

528
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,400
Don't bite me.

529
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,319
Are you letting go or not?

530
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,200
Stop pretending.

531
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:02,920
Awake?

532
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,480
I'm busy.

533
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:51,400
So...

534
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,160
Later, when Peng Le Xuan officially opens...

535
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
I'll invite you to visit.

536
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,279
I don't think that day will ever come.

537
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,480
What do you mean?

538
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,640
Obviously, I don't have high hopes for you.

539
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,079
No, you...

540
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,519
I'm leaving.

541
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,599
Take that bag of stuff down with you.

542
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,200
I'll buy you a new set later.

543
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
No need.

544
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,799
Goodbye.

545
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,400
Martin

546
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,720
Regarding your illness,

547
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,480
I have already disclosed it to the investigators.

548
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
I'm also applying to unfreeze some assets

549
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
for medical expenses.

550
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,240
Don't rush back yet.

551
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,720
We need them to accept

552
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,000
that you selling your house

553
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,960
to get cash and return is for treatment,

554
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,279
not to transfer assets.

555
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,720
Okay, I understand.

556
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,519
What's the next step?

557
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,000
I'll wait for your further instructions.

558
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,200
You must try to show

559
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,720
that you are currently in a critical phase of treatment

560
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,200
and cannot travel easily.

561
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,359
Do you understand?

562
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,240
Okay.

563
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:36,720
Second Brother.

564
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,160
You went to so much trouble, even prepared a fruit platter.

565
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,720
I'm just balancing a relaxed and serious atmosphere.

566
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,920
S-Second Brother is very, very thorough.

567
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,200
It's just that eating watermelon first thing in the morning

568
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,240
can easily upset your stomach.

569
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,279
You're always the one with issues.

570
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:47,960
How annoying.

571
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,759
Don't talk nonsense.

572
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:49,960
Let me make an announcement.

573
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,200
Our future Peng Le Xuan account

574
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,799
will be set up at Qiu'er's bank.

575
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,000
See?

576
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,720
Look at that.

577
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
The investment funds are also arriving in batches.

578
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,400
Qiu'er, you're responsible for this.

579
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,480
Count it as your performance.

580
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,240
So fast?

581
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,880
Your Second Brother is looking out for you.

582
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,759
Yes, yes, yes.

583
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,599
Grateful to Second Brother.

584
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,440
A heart full of gratitude.

585
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Starting today,

586
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
we will proceed according to plan

587
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,759
to truly build up Peng Le Xuan.

588
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:12,400
Great.

589
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,480
Today

590
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,039
marks the first shareholders' meeting

591
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,799
of our Peng Le Xuan

592
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,279
Catering Co., Ltd.

593
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,240
Wow, and we're even applauding.

594
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,400
Big Brother.

595
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,759
Sister-in-law.

596
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,119
Shareholders' meeting charter.

597
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,000
This is set up quite formally.

598
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,240
We are now seriously running a business.

599
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,000
It's not the small-time stuff from before.

600
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,880
So, legal procedures,

601
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,119
financial procedures, management procedures,

602
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:38,960
and so on...

603
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,119
All of this must have strict rules and regulations.

604
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,160
And we must all comply.

605
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,640
No one gets special privileges.

606
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,640
No problem, we must comply.

607
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,440
Now, I will announce

608
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,920
the company's official appointments.

609
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,440
I, Li Lianbao,

610
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:57,400
will serve as the General Manager

611
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,440
of Peng Le Xuan Catering Co., Ltd.

612
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:00,519
I'm responsible for the restaurant's overall operations.

613
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,640
All the worrying matters are mine.

614
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,480
Hard work, hard work.

615
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,240
Manager Li, you're working hard.

616
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,920
It's my duty.

617
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,440
Manager Li, thank you for your hard work.

618
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,200
Tong Qiu,

619
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,680
you will serve as Vice General Manager.

620
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,680
You're responsible for business expansion

621
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,440
and customer relations.

622
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,279
No problem, right?

623
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,440
Thank you for the company's trust in me.

624
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,000
I will definitely fulfill my duties diligently.

625
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,119
Work hard.

626
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,759
Li Jing.

627
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,160
Sister-in-law.

628
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:25,799
You will serve as the restaurant's Lobby Manager.

629
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,960
Wh-What about me?

630
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,160
Of course.

631
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,119
Sister-in-law,

632
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,880
for so many years, Peng Le Xuan

633
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,680
has relied on you managing everything inside and out.

634
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,920
You know Peng Le Xuan best and have the most experience.

635
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,720
This position is perfect for you.

636
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,119
Second Brother, I will definitely work hard.

637
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,200
Sister-in-law,

638
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
I, I suggest

639
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,240
that from now on during meetings, we be more formal.

640
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,319
Call me Manager Li.

641
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,839
Alright, Manager Li, I will definitely work hard.

642
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,839
Look at you.

643
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,640
Wang Chunsheng.

644
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,440
No, no.

645
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
Second Brother, I know.

646
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,440
I'll just be the head chef.

647
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,680
I'll mainly act as an advisor for everyone.

648
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,200
No, no, no.

649
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,440
Big Brother.

650
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,440
You will serve as the Chairman

651
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,240
of Peng Le Xuan Catering Co., Ltd.

652
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,680
You're an official now.

653
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,920
No, what does this Chair... Chairman

654
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,200
even do?

655
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,480
Big Brother, don't worry.

656
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,200
As for the Chairman,

657
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,640
just be... be sensible.

658
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,240
No, seriously.

659
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,720
Big Brother.

660
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,920
You truly are the perfect candidate for Chairman.

661
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,039
I'd like to be it, but I'm not qualified, right?

662
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:26,079
I can't be any Chairman.

663
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,839
Big Brother.

664
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,839
You've managed Peng Le Xuan for so many years.

665
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,119
The Chairman position

666
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,119
is perfect for you.

667
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,039
That's right.

668
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,160
Isn't it?

669
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,319
Th-th-then I'll just

670
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,279
be this "Sensible" Chairman.

671
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,319
Don't worry, I'll definitely be sensible, okay?

672
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,319
Yes, yes, yes.

673
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,920
"Sensible" Chairman.

674
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,759
Big Brother, here's yours.

675
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,319
Even business cards?

676
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,119
Sister-in-law,

677
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,799
See how Second Brother does things? So proper.

678
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,400
I had these business cards

679
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,880
specially printed for everyone.

680
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,920
Since we're running a business,

681
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,359
we all have to be professional.

682
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,119
Right.

683
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,559
Let's meet up.

684
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,279
Haven't you always wanted Peng Le Xuan?

685
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,519
I can help you.

686
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:23,400
I think...

687
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,839
Our Peng Le Xuan must be renovated.

688
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,880
So, big brother, sister-in-law,

689
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,519
the room you're living in now

690
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,759
must be vacated.

691
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,400
Then where will our family of three live?

692
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,160
No, think about it.

693
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,720
The Chairman's family living in the restaurant

694
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,640
is completely inconsistent with our company's image.

695
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,319
That's true.

696
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,319
But don't worry.

697
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,839
The apartment...

698
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,319
I've already rented one for you.

699
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,480
Two bedrooms.

700
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,599
The rent will be covered by the company.

701
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,759
It's not far from here.

702
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:54,599
After the meeting,

703
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,519
I'll take you to see it.

704
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,279
No, listen...

705
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,359
Moving is a huge hassle.

706
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:00,160
All our old stuff from decades,

707
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,960
it may not be valuable,

708
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,160
but it's a pain to pack up.

709
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,799
Just look at our place...

710
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,799
I'll help you pack.

711
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:07,880
Think about it.

712
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,960
How inconvenient was our old place?

713
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,160
We lived in the outer room,

714
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
and just pulled a curtain when the kid came in or out.

715
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,119
I'm telling you,

716
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,160
when life needs to change, we change.

717
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,839
Sis, don't worry about it.

718
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,799
If it's too much, we'll just buy new stuff.

719
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,920
Alright, listen to Second Brother.

720
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,640
No, no.

721
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,480
Listen to General Manager Li.

722
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:32,680
What's up?

723
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,640
I'll buy you a soda.

724
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,079
So nice of you.

725
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,279
To soothe your wounded heart.

726
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:41,039
Open it yourself.

727
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:46,319
By the way,

728
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,440
has my money trouble

729
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,880
already spread around?

730
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,240
Yeah.

731
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,960
Haven't you heard the saying?

732
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
Good news stays home, bad news travels far.

733
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,279
Some say you're bankrupt.

734
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,599
Some say you're suspected of money laundering.

735
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,440
And some say you ran off with the money.

736
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Is that the image I have in your minds?

737
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,079
You think you're some great guy?

738
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,159
They really aren't including you anymore.

739
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,440
I'm the one not playing with them.

740
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,679
Even the ducks in Uncle Wang's kitchen aren't as stubborn as you.

741
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,079
They're okay for small-time stuff,

742
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,079
but for real big things,

743
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:24,960
they can't handle it.

744
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,320
You just love being sarcastic.

745
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,599
Now you're just waiting to see them fail?

746
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,559
Trust me, you won't have to wait long.

747
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm saying, you...

748
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,280
You clearly care about them a lot.

749
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,760
Why can't you just get along?

750
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,480
Go ask them.

751
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,760
Always, constantly,

752
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,079
secretly keeping tabs on them.

753
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,079
Don't think I don't know.

754
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,280
When are you taking me antiquing?

755
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,360
You've said it many times.

756
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
In a few more days.

757
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,039
Things have been busy lately.

758
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,960
No integrity.

759
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,239
Unreliable.

760
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,519
No wonder they don't include you.

761
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,960
Qiu'er, and you too.

762
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,760
Since we're running a business,

763
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,679
I hope you'll take it seriously and do it well.

764
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,079
Yes.

765
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,760
Don't be greedy and keep looking for more.

766
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
The restaurant's future supply channels,

767
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,719
including promotion,

768
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,719
you'll need to oversee.

769
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,280
Yes.

770
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,840
So I think...

771
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,760
you should quit your bank job.

772
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,719
Quit? Why quit?

773
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:36,400
Such a big deal just came in.

774
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
If I quit now, this...

775
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,159
this thing...

776
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,039
It's fine, Qiu'er.

777
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,880
Once this money reaches you,

778
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
won't that count as your performance?

779
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,480
Yes.

780
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,760
Right? The bank can't just ignore you.

781
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,039
Yes.

782
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:46,079
They'll give you the bonus you deserve, won't they?

783
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,159
Yes, yes, yes.

784
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:47,840
Right?

785
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,840
Even though you say that,

786
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,480
but... quitting... this...

787
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,760
It won't be a problem.

788
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,559
But for me, it's just...

789
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,199
My daily expenses, I...

790
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:58,079
Your salary won't be less.

791
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,679
There's also a monthly entertainment budget.

792
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,719
Treat clients when needed.

793
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,960
Have meals when needed.

794
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,159
It'll all be reimbursed.

795
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,000
Isn't that enough?

796
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,480
Fine, then I'll quit, I'll quit.

797
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,519
Hurry up and thank your Second Brother.

798
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,039
See? See? See? Enough, right?

799
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,320
My Second Brother is indeed rich and powerful.

800
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,119
Your little brother is deeply impressed.

801
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,159
Just work hard.

802
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:17,840
Alright, I... I'll do this.

803
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,679
Then I'll think it over properly.

804
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,840
Otherwise, I'll just quit.

805
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,880
Running back and forth so many kilometers every day,

806
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,559
only a fool would do that, right?

807
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:43,280
Old Tong.

808
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,000
The documents are all verified.

809
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,840
No problem.

810
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,639
Thanks, Ranran.

811
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,519
Old Tong, oh Old Tong.

812
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,719
You really amazed us all with this one.

813
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,039
This deal...

814
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,519
...is really huge.

815
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,559
It's alright.

816
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,480
Old Tong, you've hit the jackpot.

817
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,199
You snatched the corporate manager's work.

818
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,239
Thanks, Ranran.

819
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,039
Which big shot did you hook up with?

820
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,000
Really? They've got some serious clout.

821
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,280
We underestimated you before.

822
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,320
Congratulations.

823
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,320
This isn't much.

824
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,800
It's just our roast duck restaurant.

825
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,159
We got some investment.

826
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,039
There will be more later.

827
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:25,960
But, um...

828
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,800
Wait... wait until the roast duck restaurant opens.

829
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,599
I'll treat everyone to roast duck there.

830
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,480
For real?

831
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,039
For real, for real.

832
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,079
That's some serious strength.

833
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,159
But let's be honest.

834
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,800
When the time comes, you have to bring your friends...

835
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,320
...and your clients over to our place.

836
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,599
We have private rooms and everything.

837
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,880
Brought... brought some souvenirs.

838
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,000
No problem, no problem.

839
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,719
Brother Tong, you've got style.

840
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:42,800
It's nothing, it's nothing.

841
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,559
Help yourselves.

842
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,199
Thanks, brother.

843
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,559
Put it away, put it away.

844
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,880
There are only five, only five.

845
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,440
We're waiting for your roast duck!

846
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,199
President Liu.

847
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,480
Just a moment.

848
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,880
Why are you closing the door?

849
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,679
I have something to tell you, it's just...

850
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,480
It's just that...

851
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,480
I'm very grateful for your trust all these years...

852
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,360
...and for your care and guidance.

853
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,320
After some consideration...

854
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,199
I want to...

855
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,800
I know.

856
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,920
Old Tong.

857
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,039
I know.

858
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,119
About transferring you to Mentougou...

859
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,360
...you have some thoughts on that.

860
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,079
It just so happens...

861
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,679
I spoke with President Chen on the phone.

862
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:10,519
Regarding your recent performance...

863
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,719
...we exchanged some views.

864
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,079
We feel you're not quite adapting over there.

865
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:17,360
So after thinking about it, I decided...

866
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,000
...to transfer you back early.

867
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,679
To transfer you back early.

868
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,079
I heard from Xiao Jia.

869
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,880
You just brought in a big deal for our bank.

870
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,239
This is what an old employee...

871
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,599
...should be achieving.

872
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,320
I heard there will be more income from this deal.

873
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,800
Good, good job.

874
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,639
Old Tong.

875
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,880
You see?

876
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,639
Sending you to the grassroots for training...

877
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,079
...it's only been a few days...

878
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,800
...and the results are remarkable.

879
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,079
This, this, this...

880
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,800
What does this show?

881
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,320
It shows you have potential.

882
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,599
But you have to be hard on yourself.

883
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,880
You have to diligently tap into your potential.

884
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,360
Right, right, yes, yes.

885
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,239
No, no, no.

886
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:04,880
That's not...

887
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,039
I still appreciate your mentoring, it's just...

888
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,920
However...

889
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,079
I... I feel I... I...

890
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,440
Our bank has always been clear about rewards and punishments.

891
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,159
Your previous performance had shortcomings.

892
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,599
So we sent you down for training.

893
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,920
To improve your professional level.

894
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,000
Now that your ability has improved...

895
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,079
...and your performance is outstanding...

896
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,119
...naturally, the rewards must keep up.

897
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,239
The five percent commission I promised you before...

898
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:30,880
...will be added next month.

899
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,840
But Old Tong.

900
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,679
As a veteran employee...

901
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,039
...besides having outstanding performance yourself...

902
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,920
...you must also for other employees...

903
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,719
...act as a role model.

904
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:46,079
I hope that after you transfer back this time...

905
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,760
...you will stay humble and keep up the good work.

906
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,400
Is there anything else?

907
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,840
Look how this turned out.

908
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,760
This is really...

909
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,480
It's nothing, nothing.

910
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,639
Nothing, nothing.

911
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,320
You're busy, thank you.

912
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,159
You're busy, you're busy.

913
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,280
No need to close the door.

914
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,480
Okay, okay.

915
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,559
Don't close it, don't close it.

916
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:27,920
You're busy, you're busy.
