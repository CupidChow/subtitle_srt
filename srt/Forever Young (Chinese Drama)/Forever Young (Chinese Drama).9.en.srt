1
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,200
Normally,

2
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,319
I really wish I could step on you a couple of times.

3
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,799
But when I see you at the end of your rope,

4
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,359
I hope you can get back on your feet.

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,319
Just look at society today.

6
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,599
People who can truly let their guard down and be honest

7
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,120
seem to be just the few of us.

8
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,599
The ones who grew up together.

9
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,319
So, you have feelings for me?

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,439
No, no, no.

11
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,000
We're really not a good match.

12
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,159
Ugh, please.

13
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,960
Don't flatter yourself.

14
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,319
I'm doing it out of

15
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,759
our three-generation-old neighborhood ties.

16
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,039
Most importantly, I want to help Big Brother.

17
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
What do you mean?

18
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,080
What I mean is,

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,439
if you're really in trouble,

20
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,080
just say the word, and I'll do what I can.

21
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,599
Third Uncle, I'm starting to realize

22
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,240
you're really not an ordinary person.

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
To be honest before,

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,280
I thought some of your actions

25
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,919
were pretty strange.

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,080
But now,

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,319
it's made me understand a principle.

28
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,319
Wise people,

29
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,919
are often misunderstood.

30
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,639
So, for our second treatment session,

31
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,840
are you still willing to trust me?

32
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,639
Of course.

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,520
Third Uncle.

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,759
How do you plan to treat me?

35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,240
You can't possibly get me expelled from school, right?

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,400
I'll teach you to think independently.

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,599
Teach you how to get along with your dad.

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Instead of arguing all day

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,400
and talking at cross-purposes.

40
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,080
He needs to see you've matured,

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,120
not acting willful and throwing tantrums.

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
Then he'll naturally trust your choices.

43
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,159
So when do we start?

44
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,479
Don't rush.

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,240
Chunsheng, dinner's ready!

46
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,840
I've been calling you for dinner.

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
All this time,

48
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,439
couldn't you answer?

49
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,879
I just heard you now.

50
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,039
Almost done wiping this.

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,479
Hey, Second Brother hasn't been around for a few days.

52
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,159
He's not holding a grudge, is he?

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,159
Over such a small thing? He wouldn't, right?

54
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,240
Why wouldn't he?

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,960
Second Brother wanted to go into business with you.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,840
Wasn't that a good thing?

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,120
You had to shut him down.

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,520
What good thing?

59
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,159
Isn't it better to live a steady life?

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,919
Starting a business isn't that easy.

61
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,840
Let me tell you,

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,680
this Second Brother,

63
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,599
he's just been provoked.

64
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,919
His wife ran off with someone.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,479
He just wants to prove himself.

66
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,599
No, shouldn't you help him even more then?

67
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,759
You brothers should prove yourselves together.

68
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,840
Stand up for him.

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,599
But is that really standing up for him?

70
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,240
Wouldn't that be harming him?

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,919
Second Brother has been competitive since he was a kid.

72
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,120
If I don't hold him back a bit,

73
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,960
he'd put his entire life savings into it.

74
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,479
Big Brother, Sister-in-law.

75
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,120
Weiguo.

76
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,719
Weiguo.

77
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,360
Have you eaten? Join us.

78
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,120
I've eaten.

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,319
I wanted to talk to you about

80
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,879
Feifei's next phase.

81
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,959
Let me tell you,

82
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,240
Feifei has been

83
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,000
much more stable lately.

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,920
But you haven't made a move.

85
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,759
I just spent some time preparing.

86
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,600
So there's going to be a big move?

87
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
But I need your cooperation, Big Brother.

88
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,959
Cooperate, cooperate. How?

89
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,720
I need you to ask for a few days off for Feifei.

90
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,000
A few days off?

91
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,639
To do what?

92
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,079
You'll know when the time comes.

93
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,199
Are you setting me up?

94
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,000
Look, just think of it as us doing a deal.

95
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,720
Doing business always involves some risk.

96
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,680
Just say the word.

97
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,519
Alright, I'll go all in.

98
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
I... I am indeed in trouble.

99
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,319
If you can lend a hand,

100
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,360
then I really must thank you properly.

101
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,279
Lianbao.

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,319
We've been rivals for half our lives.

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,959
This time, we finally laugh and let bygones be bygones.

104
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,120
Actually, I just wanted to hear you say one thing.

105
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,079
I went too far before.

106
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,319
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,279
Actually, all these years,

108
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,079
towards you,

109
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,360
I haven't been without feelings.

110
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,319
It's just, I could never say it out loud.

111
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,160
You might not even know,

112
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,360
ever since I was in third grade,

113
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,360
I wanted to be with you...

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,240
No, what are you laughing at?

115
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,839
You said it yourself.

116
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,920
"I went too far before."

117
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,160
"I'm sorry."

118
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,879
Well?

119
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,439
I recorded everything you just said.

120
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,240
"I cherish this bond."

121
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,959
You're so treacherous!

122
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,879
Let me tell you,

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,120
if I don't crush you completely,

124
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,680
I'd be letting myself down.

125
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,480
Li Lianbao, listen up.

126
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,720
I'll give you one chance now.

127
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,439
Go back and persuade Big Brother properly

128
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,759
to cooperate with me.

129
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,160
If he agrees,

130
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,279
maybe I'll delete this recording.

131
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,560
So you're still scheming.

132
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,480
Still coveting Peng Le Xuan.

133
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,240
Well? Think it over carefully.

134
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Listen carefully.

135
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,439
I'll throw away my pride.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,360
If I can't fight you to the death,

137
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll fight until I die trying.

138
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,759
I refuse to believe

139
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,319
that I can't accomplish what I set out to do.

140
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,199
I wish you immediate success.

141
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,319
Director Li, the talk didn't go well, huh?

142
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,000
Just so-so.

143
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,839
What's wrong?

144
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,759
You didn't... with her?

145
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,720
I... with her?

146
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,000
She... with me.

147
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Alright, let's not talk about it.

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
So what do we do next?

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's already come to this.

150
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,279
I'm going all in.

151
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,920
Let's go, we're heading to Old Xie's place.

152
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,159
Uncle, where exactly are we going?

153
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,840
To the countryside, deep into the mountains.

154
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,759
To remember past hardships and appreciate present sweetness?

155
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,600
You'll find out in a moment.

156
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,799
This is the place?

157
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
They're all waiting up there. Everything's arranged.

158
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,360
Come up with me.

159
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,720
The village conditions now...

160
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,879
are much better than before.

161
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,039
There's running water, electricity, and even internet.

162
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,360
From here to the town bus station...

163
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,600
it's only one kilometer.

164
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,440
Our village can even order takeout now.

165
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,960
The child definitely won't suffer here.

166
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,000
Next year, there'll even be a park in the east end of the village.

167
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,000
The environment is really nice.

168
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,960
Look, look, it's this house.

169
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,399
Right here, right here.

170
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,519
Let's go.

171
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,039
Granny, he doesn't need to do farm work.

172
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,360
Remember, don't let him eat meat.

173
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,000
Keep a close eye on the chickens at home.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,360
Count them every single night.

175
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,039
Okay, okay, okay.

176
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,320
Uncle, I...

177
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,600
You're really going to leave me here alone?

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,759
Weiguo.

179
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Maybe we should try a different approach.

180
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,879
Big Brother, you promised me.

181
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,480
You said you'd listen to whatever I say.

182
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,840
Fine.

183
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
A gentleman's word is his bond, right?

184
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,480
Then I'll wait for you outside.

185
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,840
Have some water.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,600
No, thank you.

187
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,279
Dad.

188
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,559
Dad.

189
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,120
There's something in my car I forgot to get.

190
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,600
Feifei, don't even think about sneaking away.

191
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,120
You promised me too.

192
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,240
You'd listen to whatever I say.

193
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,799
Our second treatment phase is about to begin.

194
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,279
Hand over your phone.

195
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,120
My phone?

196
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,639
No, Uncle...

197
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,240
I can't live without my phone, Uncle!

198
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,159
What's that got to do with me?

199
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:13,879
Hand it over.

200
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,720
Good boy.

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,759
Granny, sorry to trouble you.

202
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,320
Hang in there.

203
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,799
Hello, Granny.

204
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Don't worry.

205
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,919
When my dad was Feifei's age...

206
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,080
he was already sent down to the countryside.

207
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,799
The conditions were even worse than this.

208
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,240
He stayed there for over ten years.

209
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,879
Kids of Feifei's generation...

210
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,960
how can they compare to our parents' generation?

211
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,360
They can't even compare...

212
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,600
to our generation.

213
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,919
Weren't you the one who always wanted Feifei to suffer a bit?

214
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,200
No, I... that...

215
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,080
But you...

216
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,879
Back then, I...

217
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,639
let Feifei spend money recklessly.

218
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,759
Weren't you angry about that?

219
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,799
Of course!

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,679
Letting a kid spend money like that...

221
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,120
anyone would be angry.

222
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,799
Let me tell you something.

223
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,440
Feifei, this kid...

224
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,159
has lots of ideas, but he's young and inexperienced.

225
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,000
I want him to...

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,279
quickly experience this kind of extreme environment.

227
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,639
To make him mature quickly.

228
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,879
I believe with his intelligence...

229
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,519
he'll figure it out soon enough.

230
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,879
Let's just wait and see the results.

231
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,480
It's not just that.

232
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,120
There's also your part in this.

233
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,320
Me?

234
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,480
Bro.

235
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,440
Qiu'er.

236
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,879
Lianbao called and told me to come here.

237
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,200
He was in a huge rush but wouldn't say why.

238
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
Don't worry about it. You'll know when you get here.

239
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,080
Have some water.

240
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,159
It hurts.

241
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,120
What's wrong?

242
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,600
Just the usual aches.

243
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,279
Big Brother.

244
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,039
Qiu'er's here too.

245
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,240
You got here fast.

246
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,320
So, you said the money's settled?

247
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,080
Yeah.

248
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
Really?

249
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,080
The money's settled?

250
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,480
Look at that smug face. Must be a lot of money.

251
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,399
Not bad. This might actually work out.

252
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,320
Of course.

253
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,039
What kind of money is this?

254
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,679
Investor money.

255
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,559
Weren't you always worried about me...

256
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,720
...losing money on this?

257
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,799
This time, there's no gamble.

258
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,399
You don't need to worry about a thing.

259
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,759
Who gave you the money?

260
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,679
Don't you worry about that. I have my ways.

261
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,759
Things have already come to this.

262
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,120
I'm going all in.

263
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,720
Let's go see Old Xie.

264
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,960
Sworn brothers.

265
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,600
This guy knows Martin.

266
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,799
No mistake, Mr. Xie.

267
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,679
Their proposal...

268
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,559
...was done by Director Dong's team at Xinxin.

269
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,240
I've already asked around at Xinxin.

270
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,679
Everyone, sorry, sorry.

271
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,559
I'm late, I'm late.

272
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,240
Come on, come on.

273
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:02,919
Lianbao.

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,080
I didn't expect our little matter...

275
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,200
...to go so smoothly.

276
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,080
Of course.

277
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,240
Alright. I didn't befriend you for nothing.

278
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,960
As long as Mr. Ma is in this project...

279
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,080
...everything's fine.

280
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,840
Don't worry, all four of us brothers are in.

281
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,840
Deal.

282
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,200
We'll see you later then.

283
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,759
Okay.

284
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,120
Hold on, Second Brother.

285
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,279
I never said before...

286
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,120
...that I'd work for you just because you have money.

287
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,279
What are you talking about?

288
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,679
I'm the one following *you*.

289
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,080
Besides...

290
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,679
...it's not just the two of us.

291
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,080
Qiu'er's here too, right?

292
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,159
I also promised...

293
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,240
...him five percent of the shares.

294
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,399
Look how tough things are for Qiu'er right now.

295
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,279
Shouldn't we think about helping him out?

296
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,080
Yeah, my situation right now is really...

297
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,919
...indescribable.

298
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,919
I've been pushed all the way to the Arctic Circle.

299
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,279
Who knows how long...

300
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,559
...I'll have to hold on like this.

301
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,840
I don't even dare tell my parents or my wife.

302
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,679
So I really have to rely on you two.

303
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,240
Hey, let's not play the pity card, okay?

304
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,519
I'm not playing a card, I'm just telling the truth, Bro.

305
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,320
Look, we need to talk about this properly.

306
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,639
Big Brother, let me say a couple more things.

307
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,759
No, can *you* listen to me for a second?

308
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,120
Let me say something first.

309
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,879
I'm not doing this for anything else...

310
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,320
...I'm just doing it for our Yuanyuan.

311
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,720
Look.

312
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,919
This Lao Kai...

313
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,600
...is always giving her this and that.

314
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,240
I can't do anything for her.

315
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,879
Don't you think in Yuanyuan's heart...

316
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,480
...she won't treat us differently?

317
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,440
But I have to let her know...

318
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,279
...what others can give...

319
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,759
...her real father can give too.

320
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,799
No, no, the kid wouldn't think like that.

321
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,519
No, Big Brother, listen to me.

322
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,639
Stop! Can you all listen to *me*?

323
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,519
Fine, you talk.

324
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,279
The moment you two walked in just now...

325
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:45,879
...I wanted to say...

326
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,399
...let's do this together, us brothers.

327
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,240
Well...

328
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,279
Bro, you should've said that earlier!

329
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,480
You had me all worked up and rushing around.

330
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,200
I was even trying to persuade you to join in.

331
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,600
Seriously.

332
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,360
Exactly.

333
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,600
But... I have one condition.

334
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Even if you had a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand...

335
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,759
...I'd agree to them all.

336
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:07,399
Don't...

337
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,279
Just one condition.

338
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:09,960
Go on.

339
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,240
The condition is...

340
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,639
...Weiguo works with the three of us.

341
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
Hold on, Big Brother.

342
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,480
Why is he involved in this?

343
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,120
Do you remember your old nickname?

344
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
"The Baofang Protector."

345
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,159
Do you still deserve that title now?

346
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,159
That was all when we were kids.

347
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,600
Why bring that up?

348
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,759
Feifei told me...

349
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,919
...that you two used to be really close.

350
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,360
He'd tell you everything.

351
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,120
And he really looked up to you.

352
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,080
But at some point...

353
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,559
...you two had nothing to say to each other.

354
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,120
And you didn't understand each other anymore.

355
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,159
I guess...

356
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,440
...it's because that idol dad disappeared.

357
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,840
Hey, wait, why am I getting dragged into this?

358
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,200
I want to ask you...

359
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,960
...what have you been doing all these years?

360
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,399
I just take care of the shop...

361
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,000
...take care of things at home...

362
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,079
...supervise Feifei's studies...

363
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,039
...manage his life and all that.

364
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,400
Really?

365
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,599
I see you playing with cars, playing with sneakers...

366
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,359
...watching Douyin, watching livestreams...

367
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,920
...and in your free time, you're with your old buddies...

368
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
...jamming music together.

369
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,559
That's not doing anything serious.

370
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,960
Weiguo, come here.

371
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,240
And at the shop...

372
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
...it's all Sister-in-law, Xiao Gui...

373
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,599
...and Xiao Li who are running things.

374
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,279
And I also heard...

375
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,400
...that for over a decade now...

376
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,359
...you haven't roasted a single duck from start to finish.

377
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,039
Am I right?

378
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,119
No, the hardships I was meant to endure...

379
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,160
I've already endured them all, right?

380
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,839
The life I'm living now...

381
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,480
This is the life of a winner, you know?

382
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,519
A winner in life.

383
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,799
And another thing...

384
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,480
I just don't feel that right now...

385
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,720
There's any so-called serious business worth my doing.

386
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,640
Hasn't Li Lianbao been trying to rope you in...

387
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,079
To start a business with Peng Le Xuan?

388
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,599
I think it's a great opportunity.

389
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,720
Come on, sit here.

390
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,519
I have conditions too.

391
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,160
What gives you the right to set conditions?

392
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,519
Big Brother agreed!

393
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,039
Then I have to say this upfront.

394
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,480
If it's about me apologizing to you again...

395
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
I absolutely refuse.

396
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,720
You want to apologize to me?

397
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,200
It won't be that easy.

398
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,839
Unless you're sincerely convinced...

399
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:49,839
Otherwise, I won't accept it.

400
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:50,319
Alright, alright.

401
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,559
Keep dreaming your foolish dreams.

402
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,720
Even if you begged on your knees, that day will never come.

403
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,799
Enough, enough, enough.

404
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,920
Alright, Brother, alright, alright.

405
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,039
Hey, hey, you two, stop fighting the moment you meet.

406
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,559
Let's, let's talk business first, okay?

407
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,480
What conditions? Tell us.

408
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,039
I want one percent of Peng Le Xuan's shares.

409
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,640
And the operational management of Peng Le Xuan.

410
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,039
Along with a one-vote veto power.

411
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:09,880
On what grounds?

412
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,559
On the grounds that Big Brother agreed! That's what!

413
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,440
Look, here's the thing.

414
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The four of us brothers...

415
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,519
For Peng Le Xuan...

416
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,960
Coming together...

417
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,359
How wonderful is that?

418
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:23,920
Come on, come on.

419
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,759
I think so too.

420
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:25,960
Let's use tea instead of wine.

421
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,039
Bottoms up.

422
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,480
Come on, come on.

423
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,920
I think I can accept it, really.

424
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,519
Second Brother.

425
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,720
Come on.

426
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,440
Hurry up.

427
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,559
Hurry, hurry, Brother.

428
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,839
Big Brother agreed too.

429
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,920
Just do it for Peng Le Xuan.

430
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,680
Come on, cheers.

431
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,400
Bottoms up, four brothers.

432
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,160
Four brothers.

433
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,000
Brothers.

434
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,599
Everyone.

435
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,000
Later, eat as heartily as you can.

436
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,559
If there's no room inside...

437
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,079
Everyone waits outside for a table.

438
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,839
Hey, did you all hear me or not?

439
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,759
We hired you as extras.

440
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,720
Extras are actors too.

441
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,240
You have to do justice to this job.

442
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,480
If anyone messes up their performance later...

443
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,799
Don't blame me for not paying you.

444
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,880
Uncle Tong, Uncle Tong, here, here.

445
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
This table is reserved for you.

446
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,799
Yes, yes, quick, quick, please sit here.

447
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,480
Not bad.

448
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,440
Lively, huh?

449
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,839
Yangzi, this table, this table.

450
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,759
Okay, okay, okay.

451
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,400
Well, thank you all for your support.

452
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,079
Old Wang said...

453
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,240
Today's meal is on him.

454
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,480
Great! Okay, okay.

455
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,400
I say...

456
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,720
Our alley hasn't been this lively in a long time.

457
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,759
Isn't that the truth?

458
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,279
President Wang, President Wang.

459
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,640
Come on, Qiu'er, get up.

460
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,759
Old Wang.

461
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,839
The big show is about to begin, right?

462
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,079
That's why they say...

463
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,920
Fortune shifts like the river's flow.

464
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,400
You brothers are really...

465
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,680
About to turn things around this time.

466
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,000
What 'Old Wang'?

467
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,200
He's President Wang now, call him President Wang.

468
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,119
Thank you.

469
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,200
President Wang.

470
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,480
I say, President Wang...

471
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,079
With your multi-million dollar business...

472
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:46,839
When I come back in the future...

473
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,079
Will it be free of charge?

474
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,880
From now on, when you come, there's a minimum spend.

475
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:50,839
Starting at three hundred yuan.

476
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,960
Otherwise, don't even come in.

477
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,200
That won't do.

478
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,119
It should be at least eight hundred.

479
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,319
In the future, if you haven't won five million...

480
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,480
You won't even be allowed through Peng Le Xuan's door.

481
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,519
Listen up, everyone.

482
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,519
Later, be quick about it.

483
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:06,160
Come to my place to win five million!

484
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,519
Coming, coming!

485
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,119
Coming!

486
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:36,759
Coming, coming!

487
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,240
Let's be lively, everyone!

488
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,599
More enthusiasm, more enthusiasm!

489
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,680
Let's eat, let's eat!

490
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,799
They're all waiting for a table.

491
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:44,799
It's so popular.

492
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,559
Yeah.

493
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,559
The taste is pretty good, right?

494
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:50,880
Authentic, authentic, authentic!

495
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,759
Sister-in-law, let me introduce you.

496
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:53,279
Hello.

497
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,960
This is Mr. Xie, who's planning to invest in our Peng Le Xuan.

498
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,920
This is Mr. Xie.

499
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,279
Hello, hello! Welcome!

500
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,400
I'm telling you, the roast duck at Peng Le Xuan...

501
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,680
...this flavor has been the same for decades. Truly authentic.

502
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,839
Yeah, if I don't eat it for two days, I start craving it.

503
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,079
I'd even want to live here.

504
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,079
Eat it for every meal.

505
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,000
Old Xie, take a look.

506
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,799
Our place here, although not very big...

507
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,079
...is really bustling with customers.

508
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:11,799
You saw it at the entrance.

509
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,880
It's all people waiting for tables.

510
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,680
Not bad.

511
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,480
Judging by this...

512
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,319
...the annual turnover must be substantial.

513
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,640
This business is profitable.

514
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,359
Right?

515
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,440
Come on, let's talk upstairs.

516
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,920
Alright.

517
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,880
Yes, please go upstairs.

518
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,119
You two, enjoy your meal, take your time.

519
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,559
Old Xie, quick, quick, inside.

520
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,680
Really great.

521
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,640
You're the guest of honor today. Sit here.

522
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:34,839
Sit, sit, sit.

523
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,400
Come on, sit, sit, sit.

524
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:35,839
Okay.

525
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,000
Thank you.

526
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,720
Have some tea.

527
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,640
I'm Tong Qiu, also a shareholder of Peng Le Xuan.

528
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,240
Just looking at your face...

529
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,559
...you're a premium customer.

530
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,799
Here's the thing.

531
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,000
Our bank has a...

532
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,759
...consumer loan with a limit of five hundred thousand.

533
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:52,519
The annual interest rate is only three point one percent.

534
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,799
What are you talking about?

535
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,240
Wrong topic, sorry about that.

536
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,000
You're something else.

537
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Old Xie, regarding Peng Le Xuan's situation...

538
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,160
...you have a general understanding now.

539
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,039
So, regarding our future cooperation...

540
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,359
...do you see any other issues?

541
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,680
Why isn't Ma Weiguo here?

542
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,000
He... he had a sudden emergency.

543
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,119
He's been notified.

544
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,079
He'll be here soon.

545
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:21,119
The roast duck will be served right away.

546
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,599
Let's talk while we eat.

547
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:24,839
Alright.

548
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,359
From last year to the first half of this year...

549
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,519
...this boss surnamed Xie...

550
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,759
...has expressed interest in cooperating with us several times.

551
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,200
But it was always halted.

552
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,119
We found that...

553
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,720
...his company's core technology...

554
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,960
...has patent disputes.

555
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,480
There have been multiple court lawsuits in the past three months...

556
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,960
...and records of debt evasion at multiple banks.

557
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,519
Okay, thank you.

558
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,279
How is it?

559
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,039
Delicious.

560
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,440
Of course.

561
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,359
Let me tell you...

562
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,119
Don't look down on my small shop...

563
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,640
...but when it comes to roast duck...

564
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,039
...in all of Beijing...

565
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,160
...I've never acknowledged anyone as better.

566
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,720
Yes.

567
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,680
Just the way Brother Wang wheeled the duck in earlier...

568
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,559
...was so refined.

569
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,680
Truly worthy of a century-old establishment.

570
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,160
And that technique for slicing the duck...

571
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,839
...is absolutely a unique skill.

572
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,240
You have a good eye, you have a good eye.

573
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,400
Come on, come on, let me toast you.

574
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,079
Come on, come on.

575
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:38,920
Brother Wang, I toast you, I toast you.

576
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,759
Come on, come on, Mr. Xie, here.

577
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,839
Pleased to meet you, pleased to meet you.

578
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,480
To you.

579
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,160
To you.

580
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,319
So, about this due diligence...

581
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,160
...let's talk about it later.

582
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,799
Good.

583
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:54,640
Peng Le Xuan, and Brother Wang's capabilities...

584
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,599
...I've already researched thoroughly.

585
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,240
To be honest...

586
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,839
...the main reason I came today...

587
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,240
...was mainly to meet this Ma Weiguo.

588
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,079
Hold on, Old Xie...

589
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:08,960
...with all this talk...

590
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,079
...you still don't trust me?

591
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,000
That's not it.

592
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,839
Lianbao, we've been friends for over ten years.

593
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,000
For you to say that...

594
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,200
On the other hand...

595
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,640
All these years...

596
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,440
...how come I've never heard you...

597
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,680
...mention anything about Ma Weiguo?

598
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,079
Confess honestly.

599
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:27,319
Fine, I must produce ironclad proof.

600
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,839
Qiu'er, pull up that photo.

601
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,039
What photo?

602
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:32,519
Take a look.

603
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:33,240
Qiu'er, Qiu'er, Qiu'er!

604
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,680
You come, come here and show Mr. Xie.

605
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,640
You, you sit here.

606
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,559
You sit here, you sit here.

607
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,440
You show Mr. Xie.

608
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,000
Alright.

609
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,720
Qiu'er, come over here, come on, sit.

610
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,200
Look at this.

611
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,440
This is my Big Brother.

612
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,160
It's especially delicious.

613
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,079
It's the best on our street.

614
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,559
Come on, come on.

615
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,400
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up.

616
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,200
Weiguo, sit here and eat.

617
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,039
Sis, it wasn't me. Who called them over?

618
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,480
Second Brother found them.

619
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,039
They haven't even paid yet.

620
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:11,920
Weiguo!

621
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,559
Here to inspect again?

622
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,240
See that?

623
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,279
They're all upstairs.

624
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,720
Discussing a multi-million dollar deal.

625
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,000
Why aren't you going up?

626
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,400
Alright, stop acting. Who hired you?

627
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,640
Come to me for payment. Get out, now.

628
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,319
What's the big idea?

629
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:25,480
Stop acting. It's too fake.

630
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,640
This is a multi-million dollar deal.

631
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,119
You can't hire extras for this.

632
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,039
Mr. Ma, sorry about that.

633
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,039
I'll handle it.

634
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,279
Lianbao found them, right?

635
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,799
Get them out of here, quick.

636
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,319
Come on, come on.

637
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,079
Wrap it up, wrap it up.

638
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,240
Come with me outside.

639
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,160
Payment's outside.

640
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,480
Come on, let's go, go.

641
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,359
So fake. I'm going up first.

642
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,079
Wait.

643
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:45,720
Hold on.

644
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,279
Is that it?

645
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,599
I was just getting into the groove of eating.

646
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,680
But you know what?

647
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,920
No "buts."

648
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,480
He's right in the courtyard next door.

649
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,240
He'll be here any second.

650
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,640
He's in the yard right next to us.

651
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,880
He's literally next door.

652
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,519
Why didn't you say so earlier?

653
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,359
Alright then. I value Peng Le Xuan at thirty million.

654
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,680
I'll invest three million first.

655
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:11,720
Deal?

656
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:16,880
A toast, a toast.

657
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Come on, come on.

658
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,079
Wait, wait, wait.

659
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:21,799
Quick, invite Mr. Ma over.

660
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,079
Hurry up.

661
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,319
Mr. Ma, it really is you.

662
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,680
Here, take the seat of honor.

663
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,079
Please.

664
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:28,720
Let's sit and talk.

665
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,400
After you.

666
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,640
Alright, alright.

667
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:33,920
Why are you sitting in my seat?

668
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,000
Mr. Ma.

669
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,359
Those extras of yours...

670
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,440
I kicked them out.

671
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,599
What do you mean?

672
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,599
What do *you* mean?

673
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,519
Too fake.

674
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,680
Mr. Ma.

675
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,559
Let me introduce myself.

676
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,400
My surname is Xie, as in "thank you."

677
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,920
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure.

678
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,440
Pleasure.

679
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,039
Mr. Xie has already agreed to invest in us.

680
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,000
To be able to work with you, Mr. Ma...

681
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,279
...is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

682
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,160
We have to thank my buddy, Manager Li.

683
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,279
For making the connection.

684
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,640
Mr. Xie.

685
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,680
What do you think of Peng Le Xuan's food?

686
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,559
How is it?

687
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,799
Extremely satisfied.

688
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,079
Brother Wang truly lives up to his family's secret recipe.

689
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,359
To be honest with you, Mr. Ma...

690
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,839
...I've eaten at roast duck restaurants in Beijing...

691
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,880
...if not a hundred, then at least several dozen.

692
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,440
Brother Wang is definitely not inferior to any of them.

693
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
As I said earlier...

694
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,000
...I value Peng Le Xuan at thirty million.

695
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,400
We'll sign the contract tomorrow.

696
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Mr. Ma, I must propose a toast to you.

697
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,160
Today, I...

698
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,720
...am truly honored to meet you.

699
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,039
I've long heard of your great reputation.

700
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,720
From now on...

701
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,000
...we'll be like family.

702
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,519
Mr. Ma, I toast to you.

703
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,960
With you here...

704
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,319
...I believe we can definitely carve out...

705
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,680
...a vast territory.

706
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,480
Bottoms up.

707
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:48,960
Sorry, I don't drink.

708
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,279
No problem.

709
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,079
Peng Le Xuan...

710
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,640
...was passed down from my ancestors.

711
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,440
First my grandfather, then passed to him.

712
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,720
He's my older cousin.

713
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,640
I see.

714
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,440
In that case, Mr. Ma...

715
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,599
...I value it at fifty million.

716
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,240
I'll take ten percent.

717
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,599
Cash, paid in full upfront.

718
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,480
No buyback clause. What do you say?

719
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,960
Mr. Xie, for our Peng Le Xuan, really...

720
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
...I'm at a loss for words.

721
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,759
Eighty million.

722
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,079
Deal.

723
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,440
Mr. Ma, it's happily decided then.

724
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,200
Mr. Ma.

725
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,799
I'm sorry.

726
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,880
I don't want to raise capital anymore.

727
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,559
How about this...

728
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,480
If there's a chance next time...

729
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,720
...we can cooperate then, okay?

730
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,359
It's not that I...

731
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:03,759
Don't be like that.

732
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:04,160
I...

733
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,920
Maybe you should reconsider.

734
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:10,880
Actually...

735
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,319
...we could cooperate in many areas.

736
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,920
I said, next time.

737
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,759
It's hopeless.

738
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,440
He's coming.

739
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,960
He's here, quick, quick.

740
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,920
You know, this Peng Le Xuan is an old, established brand.

741
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,039
I've been eating their roast duck for decades.

742
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,200
Uncle Tong, Uncle Tong, stop talking.

743
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,799
What's wrong?

744
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,400
If I don't eat it for two days, I crave it.

745
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,599
These two are still acting here.

746
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,000
Don't try to fool an old hand.

747
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:32,799
Who are you performing for?

748
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,960
This is purely to liven up the atmosphere.

749
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,799
What are you trying to do?

750
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,480
Uncle, you two went a bit overboard.

751
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,000
There's no one left, and you're doing it again?

752
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,640
I came here with sincerity.

753
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:44,000
This Mr. Ma is totally unreasonable.

754
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,880
That's just his temper.

755
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,160
I'll talk to him properly later.

756
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,000
He's impressive, sure.

757
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,799
But he's not so impressive...

758
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,039
...that the Earth stops turning without him.

759
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:49,400
Yes, yes, yes.

760
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,920
Putting on airs. Let's go.

761
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,359
Old Xie.

762
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,720
What is this all about?

763
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,000
Ma Weiguo, are you insane?

764
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
You don't want fifty million?

765
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,279
You don't want eighty million either?

766
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,440
And you even drove the guy away!

767
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,000
Alright, alright.

768
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,599
So that's why you've been sticking around.

769
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,880
Insisting on joining us.

770
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,200
What's your scheme? Spit it out.

771
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,240
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

772
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,960
But seriously.

773
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,759
This eighty million...

774
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:23,319
Ten percent is eight million.

775
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,319
That could buy a three-bedroom inside the Fourth Ring Road.

776
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,720
You could even buy a villa out by the Sixth Ring.

777
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,039
Weiguo, you...

778
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:28,839
You...

779
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,359
No, no, listen.

780
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,119
Weiguo said that...

781
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,240
I think he has his reasons.

782
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,319
Let's not jump to conclusions.

783
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,359
Weiguo, tell us what you're thinking.

784
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,720
Hold on, Big Brother. I see it now.

785
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:42,599
Ever since Ma Weiguo said he'd get Feifei into university,

786
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,880
you've been covering for him.

787
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,240
No matter what he says or does,

788
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,200
he's always right.

789
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,640
You'd better watch out.

790
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,160
When he messes things up for Feifei,

791
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,480
you'll be the one crying.

792
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,279
No, look at what you're saying.

793
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,960
I'm putting my foot down today.

794
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,319
Weiguo is the one I brought in

795
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,880
to work on Peng Le Xuan with us.

796
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,960
All four of us, not one can be missing.

797
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,640
Let's not create conflict among ourselves first.

798
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,880
Let's first hear what Weiguo

799
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,359
actually thinks, okay?

800
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,720
Go on, what do you mean?

801
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,880
I think it's like this.

802
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,599
Let's not look for outside money.

803
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,400
I'll invest in Peng Le Xuan myself.

804
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,359
Great!

805
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,000
So that eighty million just now...

806
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,119
was just a smokescreen?

807
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,480
Those investors aren't fools.

808
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,519
He agreed to invest eighty million

809
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,640
in Peng Le Xuan in just twenty seconds.

810
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,400
That means Peng Le Xuan has great commercial potential.

811
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,599
I don't know much about the restaurant business.

812
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:38,680
So I used that guy

813
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,759
as a test run, that's all.

814
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,759
See? What did I tell you?

815
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,599
The reason Weiguo could build

816
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,160
such a big business in the US...

817
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,519
Every single step...

818
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,079
was carefully thought out.

819
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,240
Strategizing, you understand?

820
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,559
Go on.

821
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,559
So now,

822
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,720
let's properly discuss

823
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,599
how to make Peng Le Xuan successful.

824
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:07,359
Big Brother, the fundamental problem lies with you.

825
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,559
Me? Me?

826
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:10,639
I have a problem?

827
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,880
If the problem is with me,

828
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,599
I'll definitely change, okay?

829
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,960
What's the problem?

830
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,039
I'll be blunt.

831
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,119
Your roast duck is subpar.

832
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,159
Are you out of your mind?

833
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,960
If you want to talk about other things,

834
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,320
we can discuss them.

835
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,519
But if you say my roast duck has problems,

836
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:32,840
I won't stand for it.

837
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,719
Lianbao, Qiu'er.

838
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,119
You've eaten it for so many years.

839
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,519
Haven't you noticed?

840
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,239
The duck's flavor has changed.

841
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,199
I... I don't think it's changed.

842
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,079
It's the same.

843
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,519
Big Brother,

844
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,280
what did I tell you?

845
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,280
This is nitpicking.

846
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,480
Looking for trouble.

847
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,320
Hold on, Weiguo.

848
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,559
I was just defending you earlier.

849
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,679
Let's not be like a pancake rolling a meatball...

850
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,079
and then firing a cannon at it, okay?

851
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:05,400
Fine, then.

852
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,280
Big Brother.

853
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,840
Let's hear other people's opinions.

854
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,800
I don't believe it.

855
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,320
I'll go roast two more ducks.

856
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,320
We'll all taste them together.

857
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,639
I want to see

858
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,400
what he's really trying to pull.

859
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,639
Big Brother,

860
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,400
what did that riddle you just said mean?

861
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,639
I didn't quite get it.

862
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,920
Try it, try it.

863
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:41,719
Try this palate cleanser.

864
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,760
This flavor is so authentic.

865
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,679
For decades,

866
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,280
it's always been this taste. Remarkable.

867
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,719
Truly worthy of being an old, established brand.

868
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,360
The duck is sliced well too.

869
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,519
Willow-leaf slices.

870
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,679
Every cut has both skin and meat.

871
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,920
No flaws, absolutely none.

872
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,079
Our Lao Wang was extra serious today.

873
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:11,679
He hasn't put in this much effort in years.

874
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:14,639
Uncle Tong, Brother Dayang.

875
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,480
I'd like to ask you the first question.

876
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,440
Go ahead, go ahead.

877
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,239
You've both eaten roast duck from other places.

878
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,079
How do you think their taste compares

879
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:25,960
to Big Brother's?

880
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,880
Well...

881
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,960
I went to Bianyifang the other day.

882
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,679
And I thought to myself,

883
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,639
their duck...

884
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,519
isn't really any different from Lao Wang's.

885
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,840
Why do they charge so much more?

886
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,039
That's exactly the point.

887
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:37,599
Right?

888
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,480
I can't taste any difference at all.

889
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,639
That *is* the problem.

890
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,760
A century-old, established brand...

891
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,679
having the exact same flavor

892
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,719
as other roast duck shops...

893
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,440
can that be called a century-old brand?

894
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,719
Can it be called Peng Le Xuan?

895
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,000
No, you're just picking a fight on purpose.

896
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,440
Bianyifang's flavor...

897
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,239
is something many people can't even imitate.

898
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,719
That doesn't sound like you.

899
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,519
You worked in a big corporation for years.

900
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,480
You should know what differentiation is.

901
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,159
Second question.

902
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,519
Today's roast duck was all made by Big Brother.

903
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,119
For over a decade now,

904
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,159
Big Brother has rarely made roast duck himself.

905
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
So let me ask Uncle Tong and Brother Dayang.

906
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,239
What's the difference in flavor between

907
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,440
Xiao Zhang's roast duck and Big Brother's?

908
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,800
If you put it that way,

909
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,760
it's nothing much.

910
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,320
My apprentice learned it from me.

911
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,519
Isn't it the same?

912
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,239
My pronunciation isn't very accurate.

913
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,480
So, since Little Zhang's skill and Big Brother's skill

914
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,719
are exactly the same,

915
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,400
then Big Brother lacks irreplaceability.

916
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,840
In your business understanding,

917
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,000
if a product can be replaced at any time,

918
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,480
can it still have value?

919
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,519
Third question.

920
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:54,800
Why do you have so many questions?

921
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,000
Last question.

922
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,039
I've been gone for twenty years.

923
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,920
This time I came back,

924
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,159
and tasted Peng Le Xuan's roast duck.

925
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,320
It's completely different from twenty years ago.

926
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,599
You're all old neighbors.

927
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,719
Uncle Tong, Brother Dayang,

928
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,360
think about it carefully.

929
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,559
Twenty years, thirty years,

930
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,880
even forty years.

931
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:17,119
Is the taste back then and now

932
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,360
exactly the same?

933
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,039
Don't mention it,

934
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:23,719
I remember when Grandpa Ma was still alive,

935
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,800
the duck he roasted seemed...

936
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,840
it... it was a bit... not quite the same.

937
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,679
Hold on.

938
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,119
It's not 'seemed'.

939
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,360
It *is* different.

940
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,440
Uh... don't take offense.

941
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,920
No, no, please, go on.

942
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,599
Me, forty years ago,

943
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,239
I came to Peng Le Xuan for the first time to eat roast duck.

944
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,840
Back then,

945
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,079
it was Old Master Ma who roasted it himself.

946
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,320
He even served it.

947
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,360
That first bite I took,

948
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,519
that flavor...

949
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,400
Don't even say it.

950
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,880
I'll never forget it for the rest of my life.

951
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,159
It was so incredibly fragrant.

952
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,719
That flavor, unforgettable for a lifetime.

953
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,280
Weiguo,

954
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,920
what you're saying isn't right.

955
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,119
The feed the ducks eat now

956
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,360
is different from what the ducks ate in the past.

957
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,400
The meat is different,

958
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,000
so the taste is definitely different.

959
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,239
Right, honey?

960
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,840
Let me tell you,

961
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,400
the breed of ducks nowadays

962
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,039
is different from back in the day.

963
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,599
Are you trying to pick a fight?

964
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:18,719
Old... Old Wang, don't be angry.

965
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,239
The world is changing, you're changing too.

966
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,199
That's normal.

967
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,559
You...

968
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,519
Yuanyuan.

969
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,920
Dad!

970
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,079
Xuanxuan, quick, quick, come here!

971
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,079
Auntie Liang!

972
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,480
Hello, Auntie Liang.

973
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,440
Hello, Yuanyuan.

974
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,039
Let's go.

975
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,360
Mr. Li, hello.

976
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,400
I'm Xuanxuan's aunt.

977
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,960
Um, Mr. Li,

978
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,599
our family suddenly has an emergency.

979
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,800
I have to go back right away.

980
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,440
But,

981
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,000
Miss Dong is at the company.

982
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,559
I can't reach her right now.

983
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,280
Do you think... could you help look after Xuanxuan for me?

984
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,880
No problem, leave it to me.

985
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,599
Thank you, thank you so much.

986
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,119
Go take care of your business.

987
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,519
Xuanxuan, listen to Uncle, okay?

988
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,400
Alright then, thanks, goodbye.

989
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,239
No problem, no problem.

990
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,639
So, Xuanxuan, Yuanyuan,

991
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,440
do you want to eat first,

992
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,320
or play first?

993
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,360
Mom assigned me homework.

994
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,880
Math Olympiad, programming, and English.

995
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,000
What's wrong with your mom?

996
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,039
The hardships she suffered as a child,

997
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,400
she's now piling them all on you.

998
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,920
Mom is doing it for my own good.

999
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,760
Mom assigned me homework too.

1000
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,119
Piano, drawing, and English.

1001
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,119
My head is spinning.

1002
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,119
Today, listen to me.

1003
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,119
Forget about all that.

1004
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,320
Let's play first. Let's go!

1005
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,960
Let's go!

1006
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,519
Careful!

1007
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,800
Listen up, Boss Dong.

1008
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,880
Your son is currently in my custody.

1009
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:50,280
I advise you to drop your work immediately

1010
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,880
and come to the small square in front of the Drum Tower.

1011
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,000
Pick up your son at the second bench.

1012
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:56,119
If you're late, you'll bear the consequences.

1013
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,559
That's all.

1014
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,920
Hello, sir.

1015
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,599
How can I help you today?

1016
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm looking at bags.

1017
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:06,639
Alright.

1018
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,360
It just so happens we got a new shipment in.

1019
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,519
Shall I introduce them to you?

1020
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:10,440
Thanks.

1021
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:13,320
You know our store doesn't offer discounts, right?

1022
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:14,960
Sir,

1023
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,440
may I ask,

1024
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,519
what do you do for a living?

1025
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,639
I work at a bank.

1026
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,239
And who are you looking to buy this bag for?

1027
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,400
My wife.

1028
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,400
Let me introduce this one to you.

1029
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:33,239
This model is our store's versatile bag.

1030
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:35,320
It suits your demeanor perfectly.

1031
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,679
And it would also be very fitting for your wife.

1032
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:37,320
How about this:

1033
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,719
Let me take it out for you to see.

1034
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,280
No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine, no need.

1035
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,280
I'll... I'll just look around first. Thank you.

1036
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,559
Okay.
