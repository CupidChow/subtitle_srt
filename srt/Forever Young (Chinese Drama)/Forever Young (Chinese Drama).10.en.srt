1
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,280
Let me introduce this to you.

2
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,040
This one is our store's versatile bag.

3
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,239
It suits your temperament perfectly.

4
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,599
And it's also very fitting for your wife.

5
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,239
How about this?

6
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,599
Let me take it out for you to see.

7
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,120
No, no, it's fine, it's fine. No need.

8
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,200
I'll... I'll just look around first. Thank you.

9
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,439
Okay.

10
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,240
Swing it.

11
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes, yes, swing it, swing it!

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
Xuanxuan!

13
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,199
Coming!

14
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,360
Why did you bring them here?

15
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
No, school's out.

16
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,479
Just taking them out to play for a bit.

17
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,240
What's wrong?

18
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,680
Xuanxuan, is your homework finished?

19
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,159
What did Mom say?

20
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,120
After school, you do your homework first, right?

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,680
Only after finishing homework can you play.

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,479
What do you call it when you don't keep a promise?

23
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,159
Breaking your word.

24
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,439
Mom, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

25
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,879
Hey, Boss Dong.

26
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,759
The kids are having fun.

27
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,560
Is that really necessary?

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,520
What do you know?

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,199
This is a matter of principle.

30
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,479
Good habits are hard to form.

31
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,120
Bad habits are learned in an instant.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
Unlike some people.

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Who act all high and mighty on the surface.

34
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,680
But turn around and kneel without a second thought.

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,199
I...

36
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,800
Come here.

37
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,759
Not in front of the kids.

38
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,960
Business is business.

39
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,520
Mixing personal and professional, *that's* a principle problem.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,039
Don't say I didn't warn you.

41
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,840
Brothers in business, bound to fail.

42
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,840
What nonsense are you spouting?

43
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,400
If you have free time,

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,719
spend more time with Xuanxuan.

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
When your son resents you,

46
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,159
then you'll know regret.

47
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,400
Our child is none of your business.

48
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,680
Xuanxuan, let's go.

49
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,199
Mom...

50
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,840
Let's go.

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,560
Bye, Uncle.

52
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,879
Bye, Xuanxuan.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
Goodbye.

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,639
Son.

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,400
Are you mad at Mom?

56
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,199
I'm mad at myself for not resisting temptation.

57
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,800
I just wanted to play a little longer with Yuanyuan.

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,000
Mom never said you couldn't play.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,800
But the condition is,

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,120
you have to finish your homework first.

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,399
But today is also Mom's fault.

62
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,439
I was late.

63
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,000
It delayed your homework time.

64
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,079
Mom will also say sorry to you, okay?

65
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,439
I promise that from now on,

66
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,560
this won't happen again.

67
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,000
Good boy. I believe in you.

68
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,000
What do you want for dinner?

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,439
Mom will make you something delicious.

70
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,639
Steak.

71
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,879
Steak? Okay.

72
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,519
How much longer are you going to polish those shoes?

73
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,920
Hurry up and wash up for bed.

74
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,279
I was just thinking,

75
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,800
when Feifei comes back and sees all his shoes

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
nice and clean.

77
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,560
You scared me.

78
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,480
What are you so absent-minded about?

79
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,639
I wonder how Feifei is doing now.

80
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,759
Why did you have to confiscate the kid's phone?

81
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,560
I want to call the kid,

82
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,199
ask how he is, but I can't even do that.

83
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,920
Tell me about it.

84
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,519
No, I mean,

85
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,879
That Ma Weiguo jerk,

86
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,680
is he messing with me again?

87
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,800
You're something else.

88
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,920
When things are good,

89
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,560
Ma Weiguo is your sworn brother.

90
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
When things are bad,

91
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,279
Ma Weiguo becomes your grandson.

92
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,600
That place is so poor,

93
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,240
Feifei's bound to lose weight from hunger.

94
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,160
Wasn't it you who insisted

95
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
on sending the kid there to toughen up?

96
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,759
I'm tired. Going to sleep.

97
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,839
Hold on a second.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,519
Your hands, you just finished polishing shoes.

99
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,800
Go wash them before getting into bed.

100
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,720
Aren't they dirty?

101
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,360
I'm exhausted.

102
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,680
No, no, forget it, forget it.

103
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
I'll sleep in Feifei's room.

104
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,639
You stay right there.

105
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,519
No, the kid's not home.

106
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,720
What, are you going to sleep in separate rooms now?

107
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560
Is it just because I said your roast isn't as good as Grandpa's?

108
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,920
Is it worth getting this angry?

109
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,680
What does Grandpa have to do with this?

110
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,439
Don't take your anger out on me.

111
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,399
Just hurry up and wash up for bed.

112
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,519
What are you standing there for?

113
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,680
Don't know where to sleep?

114
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,639
Then sleep standing up.

115
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,519
Let's play a game.

116
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,000
Tell about a stupid thing you've done.

117
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,600
The really, really stupid kind.

118
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,639
The loser drinks.

119
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,639
Cleaning a toilet in a suit.

120
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,519
Does that count?

121
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,639
What?

122
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,759
Martin.

123
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,279
The company isn't doing well now.

124
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,839
So we had to let all the janitors go.

125
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,399
It's really hard for me to ask this,

126
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,199
but could you please, after finishing work each day,

127
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,120
also clean the toilets?

128
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,680
Even though there's no extra pay,

129
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,399
we all really like you.

130
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,079
You're very good at this job.

131
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,639
You actually believed that?

132
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,639
You're really stupid.

133
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,560
That year was 2008.

134
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,800
I told myself,

135
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,360
to accept it.

136
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,879
They really did have their difficulties.

137
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,800
But a month later,

138
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,399
people started complaining

139
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,240
about why there were water stains on the sink.

140
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,519
A month and a half later,

141
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,920
these people told me

142
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,759
today's trash bag wasn't tied.

143
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,399
Take your things and get out.

144
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,560
Afterwards, I was understandably depressed for a long time.

145
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,680
For the longest time, I couldn't figure out

146
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,360
whether fake kindness or unkindness

147
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,279
is ultimately more deadly.

148
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,159
Jing.

149
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,799
Give it to me.

150
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,600
There's nothing wrong with this duck.

151
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,080
No problem.

152
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,080
Weiguo.

153
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
So, are you still investing?

154
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,440
Yes, of course I am.

155
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,519
But the three issues I raised

156
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,559
must all be resolved.

157
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,360
Then I'll invest.

158
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,679
That's no problem.

159
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,759
Actually, I just think Big Brother is out of practice.

160
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,120
Right.

161
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,720
He just needs to practice.

162
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,559
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,360
I think so too.

164
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,240
Here's what we'll do.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,519
Since Weiguo yesterday

166
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,120
pointed out flaws with the duck,

167
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,279
I'll make another one later, okay?

168
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,519
Big Brother, you don't need to.

169
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,240
It'll be the same even if you make another.

170
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,799
I think we should do this.

171
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,240
Starting tomorrow,

172
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,919
we'll find the twenty most popular,

173
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,559
most distinctive roast duck restaurants in Beijing online.

174
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,879
We'll visit each one.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,039
To learn their strengths.

176
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,639
How about it?

177
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,639
Weiguo,

178
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,679
can those trendy spots compare to our Peng Le Xuan?

179
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,559
Can they compare to your Big Brother's skill?

180
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,279
No, Weiguo,

181
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,679
you're kind of embarrassing me here.

182
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:24,039
Big Brother, you said

183
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,399
no matter what request I make,

184
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,679
you'd do your best to cooperate.

185
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,039
Yes, but I think

186
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,679
the practical issue now is

187
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,639
this process will take

188
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,720
at least eight to ten days.

189
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,000
And those places listed online aren't reliable.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,399
Right.

191
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,039
Isn't Lianbao familiar with the restaurant business?

192
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,200
These twenty duck restaurants

193
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,399
will be compiled by him.

194
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,320
Big Brother will go taste-test them one by one.

195
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,879
After each one, write a review.

196
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,679
Strengths and weaknesses must be included.

197
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,559
Aren't we trying to improve?

198
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,440
We must learn from others' strengths, right?

199
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,399
Are you okay?

200
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,440
Big Brother, Big Brother.

201
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,320
No, I mean, Ma Weiguo,

202
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,360
what grand scheme are you planning?

203
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,480
Not just Big Brother,

204
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,080
the three of us have to go too.

205
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm going to Xi'an.

206
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,559
Whoever wants to go can go.

207
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,559
I'm not playing along.

208
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,320
Don't forget, I have veto power.

209
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,519
If you want to do this, listen to me.

210
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,480
Unless you don't want to.

211
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,360
Weiguo,

212
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,720
can I make a small suggestion?

213
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,279
Speak.

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,159
In the future, when you talk to us brothers,

215
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,960
try to watch your tone a bit.

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,759
Brother Qiu'er,

217
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,080
I'd like to trouble you.

218
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,759
Tomorrow at noon, twelve o'clock,

219
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,039
we'll gather on time at Peng Le Xuan's entrance.

220
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:34,759
Is that okay?

221
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,240
Thank you, Brother Qiu'er.

222
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,960
I'll take my leave now.

223
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,759
See you tomorrow at noon.

224
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,399
Why do I feel a chill down my spine?

225
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,399
Isn't this just asking for humiliation?

226
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,799
Weaving my own cocoon.

227
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,679
Bringing trouble on myself.

228
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,879
Inviting a wolf into the house.

229
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,440
What kind of nonsense is this?

230
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,000
Using all the idioms I learned here.

231
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,279
And here I was, speaking up for him all day.

232
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,399
And what does the old gentleman do?

233
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,159
Turns around and punches me in the chest.

234
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,519
Tomorrow morning,

235
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,840
I'm going out first thing.

236
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,279
Tell them I have an emergency.

237
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,200
You're not going?

238
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,840
Why should I go?

239
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,840
You're quick with your hands.

240
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,320
This is alcohol.

241
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,360
Fine, feeling down, have a drink.

242
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,759
But if you ask me,

243
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,000
you should go.

244
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,080
No.

245
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,840
What did you tell Feifei?

246
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,759
Aren't you supposed to set an example for Feifei?

247
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,080
You said it yourself,

248
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,039
Feifei is in that place,

249
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,480
how much hardship he must endure.

250
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,879
You've barely started,

251
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,320
and you're already backing down?

252
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,320
What will Feifei think of you?

253
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,120
What do you mean, think of me?

254
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,600
How dare he think anything of me?

255
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,519
He's young.

256
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,879
He should endure some hardship.

257
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,799
But me now,

258
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,799
I, I'm going looking for hardship?

259
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,759
Am I sick? Am I stupid?

260
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,639
I'm not going.

261
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,720
Alright.

262
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,039
If you won't go, you won't go.

263
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,559
No, no, you drink, you drink.

264
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,200
I just won't go.

265
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,080
Even if you beat me to death, I won't go.

266
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,960
Right, even if I beat you to death, you won't go.

267
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,279
Eat.

268
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:38,919
Don't want to.

269
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,720
You know what,

270
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,600
this little room of yours,

271
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,360
with all your fussing,

272
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,799
is actually quite nice.

273
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,879
I know what you want to say.

274
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,559
I've said all I needed to say.

275
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,759
See, you've misunderstood me.

276
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,799
Really, Weiguo,

277
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,279
yesterday I was deeply impressed by your presence.

278
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,360
Your image in my mind

279
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,879
has become tall and mighty again.

280
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,279
Look at President Xie, such a big boss,

281
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,600
acting like a grandson in front of you.

282
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,480
With you here,

283
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,200
this duck restaurant venture is sure to succeed.

284
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,240
You, having Big Brother do the taste-testing,

285
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,840
I think is absolutely right.

286
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,200
If he doesn't try other food,

287
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,840
how can he know

288
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,360
where his own problems lie?

289
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,519
The only thing is a small, small suggestion.

290
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,679
Could we skip writing those taste-test summaries?

291
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,639
Do you think with Big Brother's temper he'll write them?

292
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,879
Big Brother isn't your employee.

293
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,039
Tomorrow at noon, twelve o'clock,

294
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,000
don't be late.

295
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,399
So it was all for nothing.

296
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,039
Still awake?

297
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,360
Me? I'll sleep in a bit.

298
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,559
Just a little while.

299
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,039
Sleep, sleep. Come on, you sleep.

300
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,600
You sleep. Go to sleep.

301
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,639
I'll sleep too. Sleep.

302
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,519
Auntie Tong, what's wrong?

303
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,440
Weiguo.

304
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,639
Your uncle has been restless all night.

305
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,360
Not good. Maybe...

306
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,440
Don't worry. I'll take him to the hospital.

307
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,799
Okay.

308
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,000
Wait a moment. Let me grab a coat.

309
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,879
Why didn't you say anything?

310
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,039
Why didn't you tell me?

311
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,720
It's already been two years!

312
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,559
I knew nothing about it.

313
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,320
It's not a serious illness. Don't panic.

314
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,600
How sick do you have to be for it to be serious?

315
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,159
Only when you're stone dead, is that it?

316
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,200
Stop wailing!

317
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
See how annoying you are?

318
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,120
*I'm* annoying?

319
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,559
You're the one driving me crazy!

320
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,559
Alright, alright, this is a hospital.

321
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,720
Let's keep our voices down. We can talk at home, okay?

322
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,600
See if you'll stay up late again.

323
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,240
Kid.

324
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,279
What's on your mind?

325
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,200
Nothing.

326
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,320
I was thinking about you being sick and not telling Tong Qiu.

327
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,480
What would he think?

328
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,639
Kid, you mustn't tell him.

329
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,799
Some things...

330
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,319
...are better if he doesn't know.

331
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,680
Not everyone needs to know the truth.

332
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,200
It's like...

333
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,799
...standing on top of the China World Tower.

334
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,759
You look around.

335
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:19,680
Everywhere you see are skyscrapers.

336
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,680
A sea of glass walls, digital screens, ads.

337
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,920
A beautiful view of the world at your feet.

338
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,519
But then you look again.

339
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,799
At the very bottom, on the ground.

340
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,079
There's still a little bit...

341
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,519
...of those shabby little bungalows.

342
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,079
Sometimes, when your perspective is high,

343
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,400
you can look down.

344
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,279
But if you're standing at the bottom,

345
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,599
you don't necessarily need to know

346
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,759
what it looks like up top.

347
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,599
Don't talk nonsense.

348
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,799
I know you've had some schooling.

349
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,559
Know how to write a script.

350
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,480
Weiguo.

351
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,599
What you said to me the other day was spot on.

352
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:03,160
This is my last chance to focus on writing.

353
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,240
I have to cherish it.

354
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,559
I'm sorry, Uncle Tong.

355
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,680
I spoke too offensively.

356
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,440
No, no, no.

357
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,359
You were absolutely right.

358
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,079
Your words woke me from my dream.

359
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,559
All that "CEO falls in love" stuff...

360
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,079
...should be left to those who are good at it.

361
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:21,799
As for me...

362
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:24,519
...I should go back and visit these old neighbors,

363
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,640
these old pals.

364
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,480
You're really not as good as those kids.

365
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,920
You always talk about how great the hutong stories are.

366
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,440
No chance to write them.

367
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,079
Just wasting time for nothing.

368
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,119
Right, right, right.

369
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,200
The last script of my life...

370
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:43,039
...should be written for myself.

371
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,839
What time is it now?

372
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,440
Where is everyone?

373
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,000
No sense of time?

374
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,480
Didn't you two say you weren't going?

375
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,480
Why are you so...

376
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,519
Why do you have so much to say?

377
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,880
You're the one who talks too much.

378
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,839
They said since you were little,

379
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,880
you loved this brand of soda.

380
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,920
Bought you some.

381
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Actually...

382
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,960
...I came to apologize to you.

383
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,440
Last time, I spoke a bit harshly.

384
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,440
Actually, after observing you this past while,

385
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,359
I think you have a good heart,

386
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,880
and very sharp opinions.

387
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
For example,

388
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,960
with Grandpa Tong's script,

389
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,920
you pointed out a better direction.

390
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Or, with Uncle Wang's declining skills,

391
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,319
you'd tell him clearly.

392
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,480
You didn't come just for this, did you?

393
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,359
There you go again.

394
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,440
You're both proud and tsundere.

395
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,119
Always saying one thing and meaning another.

396
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,839
Just secretly enjoy the praise.

397
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,880
But you always act like you don't need it.

398
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,960
And also...

399
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,680
I know you came back this time

400
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,359
actually wanting to make up with them.

401
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,000
But...

402
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,960
You wait for others to give you an out.

403
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,319
What if they don't give you one?

404
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,519
You still have to make one yourself.

405
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,279
Ma Weiguo!

406
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Ma Weiguo!

407
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,039
Don't speak.

408
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,160
What are you dawdling for?

409
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,920
You set the time yourself.

410
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,200
Need an invitation?

411
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,440
No, I have an upset stomach.

412
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,400
It'll be better soon.

413
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,960
A lazy donkey has many excuses.

414
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,680
Hurry up!

415
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,759
Very soon!

416
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,400
Who would've thought...

417
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,039
...you're quite scared of my uncle.

418
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,720
Actually, besides apologizing, I came

419
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,200
to discuss a collaboration with you.

420
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,640
We can exchange benefits.

421
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,440
You, see...

422
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,839
...you offend people as soon as you open your mouth.

423
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,960
But I'm not like you.

424
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,880
I'm well-liked.

425
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,039
And clever as ice and snow.

426
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,079
So I think I can help you with that.

427
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,160
I can let you keep your tsundere side

428
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,079
while also keeping the uncles happy.

429
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,359
But if you want my help, there's a condition.

430
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,640
I'm holding a photo exhibition and need to go on location.

431
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,759
So I need an assistant who knows Beijing

432
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,359
and has nothing better to do.

433
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,480
I think you're quite suitable.

434
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,480
You want me to be your assistant?

435
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,440
Are you out of your mind?

436
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,440
Do you really think I'm that idle?

437
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,079
I think you really are quite idle.

438
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,200
Don't rush to refuse.

439
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,319
Think it over and tell me.

440
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,720
When you come around, look for me.

441
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,640
No salary. Room and board on your own.

442
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,119
No need to see me out.

443
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,079
If you drink my soda, you have to agree.

444
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,000
Promise me!

445
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,079
I can't hear you!

446
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,960
By the way,

447
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,319
this is the roast duck shop

448
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,000
that's been truly popular in Beijing these years.

449
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,759
You can't just look at online rankings.

450
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,599
I've personally handled many of those rankings.

451
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,160
These here

452
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,920
are the real backend data.

453
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,079
Greetings to the four Lords.

454
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,559
Before we dine,

455
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,680
there is a changing service.

456
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,400
Please come inside.

457
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,200
Can't we just go straight in and be done with it?

458
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,799
Just try it, see what it's like.

459
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,839
Big Brother, look at Qiu'er.

460
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,319
Doesn't he look like a noble young lord?

461
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,559
I don't see the prince or noble lord look.

462
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,000
He looks a bit like a grandson.

463
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,799
Let's go.

464
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,920
From the decor style to the operation model,

465
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
including this tableware,

466
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,160
it's all custom-made.

467
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
It focuses on an immersive time-travel experience.

468
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,519
Don't talk to me about immersive time-travel experiences.

469
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:58,440
A restaurant is a place for eating.

470
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,480
Eating is just eating.

471
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,359
Smells pretty good.

472
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,200
You don't say,

473
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,559
the taste is actually quite good.

474
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,920
What's so special about this?

475
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,599
The vegetable market in our alley

476
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,920
sells exactly the same thing.

477
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,200
Anyway, I'm not eating it.

478
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,119
Big Brother.

479
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,559
Seeing is deceiving, tasting is believing.

480
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:17,160
Since we are here to taste test,

481
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,880
how will you know if it's good if you don't eat?

482
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,119
This sauce isn't from Liubiju.

483
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,440
And speaking of these scallions,

484
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,400
they definitely aren't Shandong lamb's horn scallions.

485
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,160
And this too.

486
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
They even served popping candy.

487
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,400
What?

488
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,880
Right.

489
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,480
And their pancakes.

490
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,440
Look.

491
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,359
You have to ball it up,

492
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,839
and it should open up with a snap.

493
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,359
That's a proper pancake.

494
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,359
Look at this duck again.

495
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,559
The caramel color on this duck is a bit too dark.

496
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,920
The meat's fat and lean ratio is uneven.

497
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,759
And the knife work.

498
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,480
Would you call this willow leaf style,

499
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,880
or dough strip style?

500
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,920
This... this is neither here nor there.

501
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,079
Hello.

502
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,640
Your roast duck is ready.

503
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,400
I am Chef Number 27.

504
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,680
I'm happy to serve you.

505
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,880
We select

506
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
ducklings that are about 22 days old.

507
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,359
After air-drying and roasting,

508
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,680
the skin is thick and the meat is tender.

509
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:19,160
Sliced vertically into thin pieces, skin with meat.

510
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,000
During the slicing process,

511
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,039
we remove the fat between the skin and the meat.

512
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:27,039
This allows diners to eat with health and peace of mind.

513
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,799
So now they even remove the fat.

514
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,920
In the past, when eating duck,

515
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,200
people specifically picked the fatty parts.

516
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,759
Of course,

517
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,839
nowadays everything is low oil and low salt.

518
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,319
Chef.

519
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,240
How old are you this year?

520
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,079
Thirty-two.

521
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,440
But this skill in your hands

522
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,240
is really no worse than many old masters.

523
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,319
The chefs here are all about my age.

524
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,079
Really?

525
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,559
Chef,

526
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,880
how did you all practice your craft?

527
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,079
Is there any secret?

528
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,880
Just practice.

529
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,839
So, in this shop of yours,

530
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,440
how many chefs are there like you?

531
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,119
There are about thirty or so.

532
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,559
But, but to be honest with you,

533
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,119
my skill is considered average here.

534
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,839
After we graduated from

535
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:12,599
culinary school,

536
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:15,240
every day is just roasting ducks and slicing ducks.

537
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,960
We haven't stopped for over ten years.

538
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,640
Especially after coming to our unit,

539
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,920
we follow standardized service.

540
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,400
We have to practice every day.

541
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,480
Big Brother, what do you think?

542
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,599
No, haven't we not eaten yet?

543
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:37,960
I say, President Ma,

544
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,000
shouldn't we speed things up?

545
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,039
If you have trouble with that investment,

546
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,359
ask for Big Brother's opinion.

547
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,279
Big Brother is a professional, right?

548
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:48,559
I think,

549
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,000
generally speaking,

550
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,079
it's alright.

551
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,480
But look at this duck.

552
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,880
Big Brother.

553
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,559
Let me finish.

554
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:54,960
Big Brother.

555
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,720
It's a bit thin.

556
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,440
We have to respect the facts.

557
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,920
I think their duck is actually quite good.

558
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,079
No, is it what you think,

559
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,480
or what I think?

560
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,119
Is it that delicious?

561
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:14,200
I'll grab a bite and hurry to work.

562
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,319
Honey

563
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,440
This investment thing with Weiguo

564
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,240
insists on doing this tasting event.

565
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,559
You said you were coming,

566
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:29,480
so I arranged all my work here.

567
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,079
Now you can't make it, fine.

568
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,400
But I can't even go back now.

569
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,160
Can you be more reliable in the future?

570
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,279
Yes, yes, yes.

571
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,799
I... I... I couldn't help it.

572
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,559
It was a complete accident.

573
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:41,680
Your biggest strength is being easygoing.

574
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,720
Your biggest flaw is being *too* easygoing.

575
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,480
Could you, just once,

576
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,160
plan things out properly?

577
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,559
Even if something comes up last minute,

578
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,240
you should have a backup plan.

579
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
Yes, yes, my fault, my fault.

580
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,960
When you get back, I'll make it up to you.

581
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,359
And about having a baby...

582
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,440
Am I talking about having a baby right now?

583
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,400
Xiaoshi.

584
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,559
Fine, I can't be bothered talking to you.

585
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The client is waiting for you.

586
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:04,839
Let's go.

587
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,000
I didn't eat much of their duck.

588
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,359
Those pancakes filled me up.

589
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,480
Looking at it this way,

590
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,160
getting to this level isn't that hard.

591
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,680
Our Peng Le Xuan is a genuine century-old brand.

592
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,799
If we pick the right model,

593
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,319
we could achieve this within a year.

594
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,200
No problem.

595
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,799
Right, right.

596
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,559
Their duck is actually pretty average.

597
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,079
You guys only see that

598
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,519
their duck isn't authentic.

599
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,519
But you don't see

600
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,319
their strategy of playing to their strengths?

601
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,680
Those flaky pancakes

602
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,279
are from a family-run workshop in Suzhou.

603
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,160
They only source from that one shop nationwide.

604
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,279
The rice wine is from Wuxi.

605
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,680
I think their attention to detail is very thoughtful.

606
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,440
We're just getting started.

607
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,200
Weiguo has rich business experience.

608
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:53,160
Listening to him is... not wrong.

609
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,640
We continue tomorrow.

610
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:00,680
Hold on.

611
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
I have to continue too.

612
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,640
You continue.

613
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,440
Lao Tong, come here, come here.

614
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,079
I need to talk to you.

615
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,960
I see you running around outside every day.

616
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,319
Must have talked to a lot of clients.

617
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,880
Not bad, not bad.

618
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,480
"Not bad" means a lot of deposits.

619
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,720
When will they be secured?

620
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:31,000
I haven't had any big clients recently.

621
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,480
Should be soon.

622
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,160
This one's not small either.

623
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,160
Perfect timing.

624
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,279
I'm putting the new recruit's task on you.

625
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,240
Don't forget.

626
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,079
If we really land this big client,

627
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:43,720
they might refer some other friends.

628
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,079
See?

629
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,640
People transferred from the city bureau

630
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,400
really are capable.

631
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,319
No, no, no.

632
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,880
But don't just talk the talk.

633
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,279
Before the end of the month,

634
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,839
make sure it gets done, ASAP.

635
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,319
Yes, of course, of course. ASAP.

636
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,880
Lao Tong.

637
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,640
I'm having a tough time lately.

638
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,279
New branch, new rules.

639
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,039
Rank-and-yank.

640
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,000
You were transferred from the city, right?

641
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,200
Don't expect special treatment.

642
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,079
All the colleagues are watching.

643
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,920
Understood, understood.

644
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,240
If it comes to it,

645
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,680
I'll have to follow protocol.

646
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,039
Look,

647
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:24,240
I'm a straightforward person.

648
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,880
I say what's on my mind.

649
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,720
Don't take it personally.

650
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,039
I don't, I don't.

651
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,640
What can I help you with?

652
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,640
I need to withdraw some money.

653
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,279
When can our roast duck restaurant start up?

654
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,359
I'm anxious.

655
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,440
You have to ask the investor about that.

656
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,799
Weiguo is always so vague.

657
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:48,559
Never gives a straight answer.

658
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,960
Can you hurry him along?

659
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,599
Do you think I can rush him?

660
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,119
Even if I could rush the investor,

661
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,200
we still don't have a chef lined up.

662
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,279
Why don't you give it a try?

663
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,359
Big Brother.

664
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:12,720
We've eaten at more than half these places.

665
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,160
Any insights?

666
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
This is it?

667
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,480
And they call this top twenty?

668
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,480
Nothing really impresses me.

669
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,440
Of course.

670
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,039
They can't compare to you.

671
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,839
But they do have their own merits.

672
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,240
We could learn from them.

673
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,359
Learn what?

674
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,920
When Peng Le Xuan was around,

675
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,759
they were still playing in the mud.

676
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,559
If we can't get the dishes right,

677
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,640
when will our business ever get off the ground?

678
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,079
Then we just won't start it.

679
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,359
Big Brother, not this again.

680
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,839
Big Brother.

681
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,680
I see no matter how much we try, you won't be convinced.

682
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,000
How about this:

683
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,359
You make a few of your signature dishes.

684
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,200
We'll compare them with those trendy online celebrity shops.

685
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,599
for a comparison. How about it?

686
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,400
Is there even a need to compare?

687
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,839
I'll make you all

688
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,240
admit defeat wholeheartedly.

689
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,000
Look.

690
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,720
This isn't fair.

691
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,319
Mine is hot, theirs is cold.

692
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,759
We can't bully people.

693
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:58,880
Because with Chinese cuisine,

694
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,839
temperature is paramount.

695
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:01,759
Here's what we'll do.

696
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,720
Let all my dishes cool down.

697
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,799
Then compare them with these.

698
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,599
If you still think that's unfair,

699
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,079
then how about this.

700
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,440
Let's learn from this red wine.

701
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,640
Don't they do blind tastings for wine?

702
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,279
I'll go prepare for a blind tasting.

703
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,319
Brother, you're really something.

704
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:15,799
Classy.

705
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,720
Are we really doing this?

706
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:30,359
Aren't we being a bit too mean?

707
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,079
Big Brother's mouth is harder than iron pliers.

708
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,400
If we don't use some tactics,

709
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,039
when will our business ever get off the ground?

710
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,319
That's a fair point.

711
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,279
But judging by Big Brother's temper,

712
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,680
he might blow up later.

713
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,279
It's fine.

714
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,680
If he turns on us over something like this,

715
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,519
even if this restaurant opens,

716
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,559
it won't last long.

717
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,759
That's true.

718
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,519
Alright, let's do it.

719
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,480
Yeah, let's go for it. All or nothing.

720
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,240
Let's do it.

721
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,960
Swap them. Switch them out.

722
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,119
Is that good?

723
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:15,960
Good.

724
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,880
That should be enough, right?

725
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,160
I'll go get Big Brother now.

726
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,039
Okay, okay, okay.

727
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,440
Big Brother, it's ready.

728
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:24,839
Coming, coming!

729
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,559
Coming, coming, coming!

730
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,359
I went and found this.

731
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,799
Pretty cute.

732
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,319
So?

733
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,559
Is it cold?

734
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,480
It's cold, it's cold.

735
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,160
Cold.

736
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,519
Then I'll taste it first.

737
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,079
Alright.

738
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,480
Qiu'er, feed me a meatball.

739
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,920
Here, Brother, open up.

740
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:02,519
Here, the second one.

741
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,319
Here, open up.

742
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:07,839
Good.

743
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,320
The one I just ate,

744
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,199
the first one was the one I made, right?

745
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,880
It really is.

746
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,039
Authentic.

747
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,519
Authentic, authentic.

748
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,039
Au-au-authentic.

749
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,880
Au-authentic, au-authentic.

750
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,000
Hey, you guys try it too.

751
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,760
You try it too.

752
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,400
Okay, okay, sure, sure.

753
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,079
Try it, try it.

754
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:49,840
Okay, okay.

755
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,199
Here, try it, try it, try it.

756
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,880
No, for this one, just eat a little less.

757
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,199
Just have a small bite is enough.

758
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,679
Who knows what kind of oil they used.

759
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,400
Do you know?

760
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,800
Which one tastes better?

761
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,800
Which one is better?

762
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,719
I vote for this one.

763
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,199
Big Brother's is tastier.

764
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,400
I think this one has its merits too.

765
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,000
Yeah, that one's good.

766
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,320
Is there something wrong with your tongue?

767
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,119
Spit it out and I'll straighten it for you.

768
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:33,039
But this one is even better.

769
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,639
Fine, this, this, this vote is for...

770
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:40,199
Next up, let's try the duck.

771
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,360
Just look at this pancake.

772
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,880
The texture, the chewiness.

773
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,320
Now look at the duck.

774
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,679
This caramelized color.

775
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,360
That, that one's not even worth looking at.

776
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,880
And look at this knife work.

777
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,960
Small willow-leaf slices.

778
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,480
Cut so evenly.

779
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,480
Isn't our dish still the clear winner?

780
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,800
Right?

781
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,039
Wait.

782
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,519
Big Brother.

783
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:03,000
I think you're being a bit biased.

784
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:05,000
All your votes are for your own dishes.

785
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,079
Well, the other ones should have...

786
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,519
some good points too, right?

787
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:12,360
I'm just stating facts, okay?

788
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,199
Hey, didn't you all vote for mine too?

789
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:14,760
Right?

790
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,280
Yes.

791
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,960
Brother.

792
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,920
Do you, do you feel...

793
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,079
that the dishes you made today...

794
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,559
are a little different from usual?

795
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,679
No, today's meatballs were fried...

796
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:25,840
they really were a bit...

797
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,639
a bit above your usual standard.

798
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,079
What does that mean?

799
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,280
It means my skills...

800
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,440
I'm back!

801
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,719
I'll just reveal the truth.

802
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,719
Reveal what?

803
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,519
The ones you thought were delicious...

804
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,199
were all, all takeout.

805
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,239
We switched them. Sorry.

806
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,159
You're messing with me.

807
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:02,719
No, no, no.

808
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,400
Big Brother, Big Brother.

809
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:03,960
We agreed you wouldn't get mad.

810
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,119
We agreed you wouldn't get mad.

811
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,679
I tried to stop them, but I couldn't.

812
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,159
Big Brother, look.

813
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,119
I voted for you with all my votes.

814
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,320
I have always had

815
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,719
complete confidence in your skills.

816
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:16,320
I'm not like Ma Weiguo,

817
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,800
who has to nitpick everything.

818
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,760
I think it's unnecessary.

819
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,679
No, no, no, no.

820
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,960
Enough of your nonsense.

821
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,400
All three of you, get out.

822
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,480
Big Brother.

823
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,639
I'm closing the door. Out.

824
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,000
We agreed you wouldn't get mad.

825
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,719
Yeah, don't you...

826
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,639
No more talk. Out.

827
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,760
Out! Out! Out!

828
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,920
Big Brother, listen to me.

829
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,719
Here's what I think.

830
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,079
Today's little competition

831
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,639
has made me even more confident

832
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,079
in your skills, Big Brother.

833
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,639
I think from now on,

834
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,280
you don't need to do any more tastings.

835
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,480
Just maintain your current standard.

836
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,760
Right.

837
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
But there's just one thing.

838
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:48,199
I feel like you're always so busy,

839
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,119
it's too hard on you.

840
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,039
Too hard.

841
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,559
In the future, when the business takes off,

842
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:53,840
if you're the only one cooking,

843
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,920
it's just not realistic.

844
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Not feasible.

845
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,719
Wait, what do you mean?

846
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,559
I've been contacting

847
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,840
a few chefs these past few days.

848
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,920
Their skill levels are quite high.

849
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,360
And their salary requirements

850
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,480
are also very reasonable.

851
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,559
In the future,

852
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:12,199
you'll be promoted to Head Chef Consultant.

853
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,760
You'll order them around,

854
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,000
it's dignified and proper.

855
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:17,119
Your skills can also be passed down.

856
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,480
Big Brother, do you understand what he means?

857
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,559
He wants you to have an empty title.

858
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:24,559
In reality, you won't enter the kitchen.

859
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:25,360
Lianbao.

860
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,840
You're so unreliable.

861
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,480
You use my name for financing,

862
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,079
use Big Brother's name to open the shop.

863
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,159
Is that what you mean?

864
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,199
Big Brother, don't listen to him.

865
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,440
That's not what I meant.

866
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,639
I just think our project

867
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,320
can't just sit idle forever.

868
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,039
We need to get moving, right?

869
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,000
All of you...

870
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,239
Don't play these tricks with me.

871
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,960
I'm putting my foot down today.

872
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,760
If you want to do it, fine.

873
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,039
If not, we disband.

874
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,960
Big Brother, no, Big Brother.

875
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,119
What are you doing?

876
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,719
Just documenting life.

877
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,559
It's my habit.

878
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,599
Weiguo.

879
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,199
I guess I can't finish writing this script.

880
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,719
Your aunt insists I go buy groceries for her.

881
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,280
So,

882
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,800
keep me company for a stroll?

883
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,440
I'd rather not go.

884
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,760
Grandpa Tong, I'll go with you.

885
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,480
I need to shoot some footage at the market anyway.

886
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,719
Great, you two go.

887
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,320
I have other things to do.

888
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,679
What's with your hot and cold attitude?

889
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,719
Do I have to drag you?

890
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,480
No, no, no. I'll go, I'll go.

891
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Let's go.

892
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,559
Grandpa Tong sure knows how to handle you.

893
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Let's go. Hurry up.

894
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,960
Also buy two jin of pork.

895
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,079
How much per jin?

896
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,559
Okay, okay, okay.

897
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,840
Two... two jin of pork.

898
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,960
Got it, ma'am.

899
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,760
The old lady wants me to buy two jin of pork.

900
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,679
You two have fun here.

901
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,239
Will do.

902
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:32,599
Have fun.

903
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:33,079
Will do.

904
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:33,920
Come over for dinner later.

905
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,519
Okay.

906
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,599
Some apples, please.

907
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:44,400
Are they sweet?

908
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,000
Very sweet. Here.

909
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,559
Pretty sweet. I'll take five jin.

910
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,000
I never expected, Uncle Ma,

911
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,599
you had such a down-to-earth side.

912
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,760
When I was a kid, I often went to the market.

913
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:59,039
I remember an auntie at an apple stall

914
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,360
who often peeled apples for me.

915
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,440
Just this taste.

916
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,480
Five jin.

917
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,159
Thank you.

918
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:04,800
Here.

919
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,559
These have handmade cloth soles.

920
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,239
The quality is very good.

921
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,360
You can try them on.

922
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,239
Old Beijing style.

923
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,559
Something else I saw as a kid.

924
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,880
My mom bought them for me to wear when I was little.

925
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:22,719
Thanks.

926
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,599
