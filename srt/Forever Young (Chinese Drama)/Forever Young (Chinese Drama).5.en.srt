1
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,680
I think the person you found

2
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,079
is pretty reliable.

3
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,319
Of course he is.

4
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,879
Feifei's studies are important.

5
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:43,920
Right.

6
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,239
Great, a Mercedes-Benz, even a Maybach. Look.

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,879
Wang Fei.

8
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,959
I'm leaving again in a bit.

9
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,560
Okay.

10
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,680
Second Uncle.

11
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,760
Silly Uncle.

12
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,280
Morning.

13
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,520
What are you so smug about?

14
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,680
Where did you go?

15
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,400
I went to study.

16
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,639
I even found the top student in our grade

17
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,479
to tutor me.

18
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,759
In math and English.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,599
Yeah.

20
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,560
Third Uncle also signed me up for a fencing class there,

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,919
and a free combat class.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,240
After studying, I'll get some exercise.

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,479
Consider it a recess break.

24
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,879
Mainly because my dad keeps saying

25
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,319
I don't exercise, right?

26
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,919
Anyway, if you don't need me for anything,

27
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,759
you guys chat first.

28
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm going back to get my physics book.

29
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,199
I booked a screening room tonight,

30
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,159
invited a few classmates,

31
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,280
to watch *Oppenheimer*.

32
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,039
Alright.

33
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,680
Study.

34
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:36,680
I'm off.

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,400
He's studying.

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,080
You're busy.

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,680
Fei.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,680
So, are you hungry?

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,400
If you're hungry, tell me what you want to eat.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,039
No need.

41
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,000
I ordered Japanese food.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
I'll eat it with my classmates tonight.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,719
Feifei.

44
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,879
Tell your Uncle Weiguo,

45
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,800
I want Japanese food too.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,240
No, no.

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,560
I... I want to go to college too.

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,199
Go on, stop causing trouble.

49
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,479
Big Brother.

50
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,439
Haven't you always advocated for kids to endure hardship?

51
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,599
This... this

52
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,039
isn't this going against that?

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Hardship or not,

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,599
at least he's motivated to study now.

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,159
No.

56
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,840
Feifei has fooled you more than once or twice.

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
And you believe this?

58
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,879
Lianbao.

59
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,919
About that study abroad person,

60
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,800
keep helping me contact them.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,960
You're covering all your bases now.

62
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,719
No, I mean, this kid...

63
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,319
Who knows which option will work out?

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,319
Hello?

65
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,919
Where are you going?

66
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,520
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

67
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,599
To Xi'an.

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,719
Didn't we say we'd discuss it more?

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
Discuss, discuss.

70
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,280
If you don't want me to go,

71
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,960
give me a reasonable reason.

72
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,519
Convince me to give up this

73
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,519
great opportunity for a raise and career growth.

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,399
You keep saying "let's discuss,"

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,199
when will we actually reach a conclusion?

76
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,759
Yes, yes, yes. Don't get upset yet.

77
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,680
You... don't leave yet.

78
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,800
No, no, don't go, don't go.

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,199
A reason... let me think of one.

80
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,360
You're thinking of one now?

81
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,120
Thanks a lot.

82
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:34,839
Hello?

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,360
When did you book the flight?

84
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,920
What? I already called a car.

85
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,879
Cancel the car first.

86
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,040
Let's talk this through properly.

87
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,879
My dear, please stop making a scene.

88
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,120
Let's go home first and discuss it properly.

89
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,639
How many days have I been discussing this with you?

90
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,800
Have you been listening seriously?

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes, it's my fault.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,040
This time I'll definitely give you a satisfactory answer.

93
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's go home first.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,120
Don't make a fuss here.

95
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,079
Branch Manager.

96
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,079
I need to take this, I need to take this.

97
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,600
It's fine, take it.

98
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,160
Hello, Branch Manager?

99
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,959
What's up?

100
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,120
An important client?

101
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,680
Right now?

102
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,319
Right now might be a bit difficult for me.

103
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,399
I'll hurry over.

104
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,000
Wait for me.

105
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,000
Honey.

106
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,319
Honey, honey.

107
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,920
Honey.

108
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,079
My promotion is definitely in the bag this time.

109
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,199
Hello? Who is this? Speak.

110
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,360
Hello? Hello?

111
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,879
Director Qiu, it's Tong Qiu.

112
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,879
It's a bit noisy on your end.

113
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,399
Here's the thing.

114
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,079
Do you have time now?

115
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,680
I have some business matters I'd like to discuss with you.

116
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,199
Speak up, I can't hear you.

117
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,360
Forget it, wait a moment.

118
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,199
Manager Jia!

119
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,839
Manager Jia, sit with us.

120
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,879
Come over here, come find your sister.

121
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,639
Third Uncle.

122
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,519
It's been a week now.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,639
The same stuff every day.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,360
Is life this boring for you rich people?

125
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,480
It's dull.

126
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,680
Don't you have any other tricks?

127
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,240
If it's just like this,

128
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,240
then I think

129
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,560
you can't really help me much.

130
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,399
These things aren't important.

131
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,560
I get it.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,879
Your main goal this time

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,160
is to get my dad and the others to apologize to you, right?

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,399
You can't even handle me right now.

135
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,519
How are you going to handle them?

136
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,639
Your dad and the others

137
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,320
are much easier to handle than you.

138
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,559
Is that so?

139
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,159
You've always wanted to know

140
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,799
what the meaning of life is, right?

141
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,240
We're getting very close.

142
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,159
Do you remember the days when you needed

143
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,080
to get perfect scores five times

144
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,639
just to beg your parents for a pair of sneakers?

145
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,240
I heard from your Uncle Qiu

146
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,360
that you kept those shoes spotless,

147
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,159
storing them in special boxes.

148
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,399
That's right.

149
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,720
Money can buy happiness,

150
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,279
it's just not very precious.

151
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,240
What's truly worth cherishing

152
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
are the feelings you get back,

153
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,200
and the people and things you can't forget.

154
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,039
I'm happy.

155
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,440
Weiguo.

156
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,039
My dad...

157
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,320
likes gardening.

158
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,279
I know.

159
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,120
You know our...

160
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,919
When it's time, let's tear up the bricks in the yard.

161
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:06,960
And then?

162
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,120
Don't let him plant flowers.

163
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,679
Let him plant... vegetables.

164
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,559
Okay.

165
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,120
Mr. Ma, Mr. Tong.

166
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,399
Yes.

167
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,200
The contract is ready.

168
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,679
Good.

169
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,120
You can take a close look first.

170
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,039
Call me anytime if you have questions.

171
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:25,440
Thank you.

172
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,080
Okay, thanks.

173
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,919
You're welcome.

174
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,279
I'll look it over for you.

175
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,679
Just give it a quick look.

176
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,120
What's wrong?

177
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,840
Nothing.

178
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Weiguo.

179
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,159
Those glasses look really good on you.

180
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,720
How could such a great thing

181
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
land on my head?

182
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,840
It's like manna from heaven!

183
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,360
And it's fennel and pork filling, no less!

184
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,159
If it were just a three-delicacy shrimp one,

185
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,879
I wouldn't even pick it up or eat it.

186
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,080
Just sign it.

187
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,799
What is it?

188
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,840
Why is this all messed up?

189
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,360
What? It's unusable now.

190
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,120
I...

191
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,759
What's wrong with you?

192
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,200
I think it's like this, Weiguo.

193
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,960
I think...

194
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,519
No, no... don't buy it. Don't buy it.

195
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,080
Where are you going?

196
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,559
I don't want it.

197
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,279
What did you say?

198
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,879
You said you're not buying it?

199
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,600
I think my whole life is just...

200
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,360
And taking care of Auntie

201
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,279
is my duty anyway.

202
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,679
If I were to take

203
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,919
an apartment from you for this,

204
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,799
I'm afraid I wouldn't sleep well at night.

205
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,240
Weiguo.

206
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,279
Weiguo!

207
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,039
Let me ask you a question.

208
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,159
I was someone who once had a villa, right?

209
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,039
Such a huge villa.

210
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,480
I was the one who didn't take it.

211
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,360
Such a huge villa,

212
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,639
I didn't want it.

213
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,399
I didn't take it.

214
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,360
I myself didn't take it.

215
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm pretty awesome, right?

216
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,320
But don't worry,

217
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,039
I'll rent a place to live soon.

218
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,960
And then?

219
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,120
I'll clear out that room,

220
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,320
clean it up spotlessly,

221
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,879
and make sure Auntie lives comfortably.

222
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,039
You can rest assured.

223
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,799
Don't worry.

224
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,200
Are you out of your mind?

225
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,200
I put so much effort into helping you find a place,

226
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,559
and now you tell me you don't want it?

227
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,519
Think it through carefully!

228
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,679
You only get one chance.

229
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,639
I can't think it through!

230
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,440
If I think it through,

231
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,879
I'm afraid I won't be able to bear leaving here.

232
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,000
Qiu.

233
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,320
Can't go back.

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,159
Can't think it through.

235
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,679
Absolutely must not think it through.

236
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,200
That's just too scary.

237
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,679
You really didn't take it?

238
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,120
Why didn't I take it?

239
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,919
Why didn't I take it?

240
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,799
How come I didn't take it?

241
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,720
I guess I'm just destined to be a loser, Bro.

242
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,440
But I really think I couldn't take it.

243
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,200
You know what?

244
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,799
Just as my hand was about to press down,

245
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,360
a voice flashed in my mind:

246
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,879
"No reward without merit," brother!

247
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,360
If you just take something so valuable from your brother,

248
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,679
are you even human, brother?

249
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,360
That brother in your head,

250
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,840
he's a really good brother.

251
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,039
From now on,

252
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,440
you're still my brother.

253
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,279
I'll add you back to our group chat.

254
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,519
Bro, can I ask you a favor?

255
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,120
Go ahead.

256
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,360
In the future, could you not just casually

257
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,320
kick me out?

258
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,360
Do you know how much of a jerk

259
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,200
you were that day?

260
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,360
Yes, yes, it was the heat of the moment.

261
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,399
And the atmosphere got so intense,

262
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,200
I couldn't... control myself.

263
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,320
Don't worry,

264
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,399
I won't take it to heart.

265
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,840
I'll add you back to the group right now.

266
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,399
Okay.

267
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,120
An apartment worth over twenty million...

268
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,879
a "big villa"...

269
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,240
Why didn't I take it?

270
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,120
Bro, if it were you, would you have taken it?

271
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,240
Why isn't he out yet?

272
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,159
Excuse me, excuse me!

273
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,120
Dad!

274
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,200
Boss Dong

275
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,559
Excuse me, coming through.

276
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,679
You're so busy, yet you still pick up your kid yourself.

277
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,720
I heard that new roast duck place you invested in

278
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,960
isn't doing well.

279
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,080
Beg me, and I'll help boost your ranking.

280
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,960
Who cares about you?

281
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,240
I've never seen someone as shameless as you.

282
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,639
No, saying that isn't objective.

283
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,159
We grew up together.

284
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,799
How can you say you've never seen it?

285
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,360
Right, you've been shameless since we were kids.

286
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,639
By the way,

287
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,399
I heard Weiguo is back.

288
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,000
Don't mention him to me.

289
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,480
You couldn't beat him even when we were kids.

290
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,360
Now he's a big boss.

291
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,279
I suggest you stay far away from him.

292
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,480
What do you mean I couldn't beat him?

293
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,399
Just wait and see how I deal with him.

294
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,879
Xuanxuan, over here!

295
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:40,559
Yuanyuan.

296
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,200
Mom!

297
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,240
See you tomorrow, Xuanxuan.

298
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:44,840
Let's go.

299
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,600
Yuanyuan, what tasty food do you want to eat?

300
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,679
After pizza, Dad will take you to the claw machine.

301
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,480
Really?

302
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,679
I really want to play!

303
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:54,759
Tom.

304
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,120
Hello.

305
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,600
Lao Kai, what are you doing here?

306
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,120
Sorry,

307
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,799
but I'm afraid I need to swap

308
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,079
my time with Jenny today.

309
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,279
That won't do.

310
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,839
I'm strictly following the agreement.

311
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,400
You changing the time last minute

312
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,960
isn't even legally supported.

313
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,599
I'm truly sorry,

314
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,400
but a friend of mine

315
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,240
told me he's suddenly in Beijing

316
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,160
and only staying for two days.

317
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,920
You know,

318
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,400
he's one of Australia's best pianists.

319
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,920
Jenny, you know,

320
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,240
she's always loved learning piano.

321
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,599
I think she should meet him.

322
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,480
It's a rare opportunity.

323
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,799
Dad?

324
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,440
Yuanyuan.

325
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,519
Honey, today's opportunity is really rare.

326
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,680
You go with Kevin,

327
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,319
and next time Dad will take you

328
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,000
for pizza and the claw machine, okay?

329
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:51,400
Go on.

330
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,440
There's a very talented pianist.

331
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,319
Yuanyuan.

332
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,599
Bye-bye.

333
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,359
Wait, Teacher Mao,

334
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,759
if there's something, just say it, okay?

335
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,720
You staring at me like this makes me nervous.

336
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,839
What's wrong?

337
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,480
Look at this.

338
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,319
This one phone

339
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,920
costs as much as my monthly salary.

340
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,200
These limited edition sneakers

341
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,440
my husband has been eyeing for months but didn't dare buy.

342
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,200
Where... where did all this come from?

343
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,000
These were all gifts from your Wang Fei to his classmates.

344
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,599
Mr. Wang,

345
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,079
honestly, how much money you have

346
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,359
is none of my business.

347
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,039
But you indulging Wang Fei in flaunting wealth

348
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,279
isn't really appropriate, is it?

349
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,200
No, I... I really didn't do that.

350
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
On a minor level,

351
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,799
it's bad to attract attention from bad people.

352
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,920
On a major level,

353
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,400
this is a form of moral decay.

354
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,119
No, no, no,

355
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,079
please don't make it sound so serious, okay?

356
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,359
How is it not serious?

357
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,240
His behavior

358
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,279
is now seriously affecting the atmosphere of our class

359
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,200
and even the entire school.

360
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,240
And many students, because of him,

361
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,960
simply don't want to study anymore.

362
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,079
Materialism!

363
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,480
Stop, please, don't say that.

364
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,599
In short, if Wang Fei continues like this,

365
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,519
I can't teach him.

366
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,680
Wait, Teacher Mao,

367
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,920
actually, Wang Fei is a good kid at heart.

368
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,640
His nature is good.

369
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,160
He was just led astray by that bad influence.

370
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,920
You know?

371
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,640
These things,

372
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,119
I'm taking them now.

373
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:44,759
And then,

374
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,200
I'll deal with them right now.

375
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,160
I'm going to find that bad influence right now.

376
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,599
Ma Weiguo!

377
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,799
Ma Weiguo!

378
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,599
Come out! You hear me?

379
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,119
Don't hide! I see you!

380
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,319
If you don't come out, I'll smash... smash the windows!

381
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,640
Come out!

382
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,720
If you don't come out, I'll really smash them!

383
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,559
Calm down.

384
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,000
What's wrong with you all?

385
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,039
Coming here one after another to make a scene.

386
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:47,559
You... you...

387
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:50,039
Is this how you take care of my son?

388
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,680
You've ruined my son, you know that?

389
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,039
The school is going to expel him now, you know?

390
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,839
Is that all this is about?

391
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,599
Just this little thing?

392
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,599
I said...

393
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,960
Give me some time.

394
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,519
The time isn't up yet.

395
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,559
The important part is coming later.

396
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,079
You know?

397
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,640
If I give you more time...

398
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,799
If I give you more time...

399
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,759
My son will be finished, you know?

400
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,960
Did I owe you from a past life or something?

401
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,240
You messed me up...

402
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,039
Now you're messing up my son!

403
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,559
Come in, come in!

404
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,759
Come on, come on! Let's go!

405
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,279
I...

406
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,440
You come in, you come in!

407
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,759
Come on, come on! Let's go!

408
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:23,680
You come, you come!

409
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,200
No, no, no! Don't actually come in!

410
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,200
You come, you come!

411
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,000
You just wait!

412
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,799
Fang, what's wrong with Auntie?

413
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,799
Big Brother, where are you?

414
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,079
Can you come over?

415
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,359
Hold on, I'm coming right over.

416
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,400
You wait for me!

417
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,039
What's wrong with Auntie?

418
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:50,680
What's wrong with Auntie?

419
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,119
Auntie...

420
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:55,839
Auntie...

421
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,480
Auntie...

422
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,960
What's going on now?

423
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,359
It's nothing.

424
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,519
I haven't gone back to Baofang Hutong yet.

425
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:05,000
I can't bear to leave.

426
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,799
Xiao Fang, why are you here alone?

427
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,079
Zhi Xin and I stayed up all night.

428
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,559
I told him to go home and sleep.

429
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,279
You should go back and rest too.

430
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,000
We're here...

431
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,839
Yeah, you should hurry back.

432
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:22,920
Come again tonight.

433
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,079
Go back and rest for a while.

434
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,759
None of you need to come.

435
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:27,960
Alright then.

436
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,279
I'll go back and cook.

437
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:29,960
Exactly.

438
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,519
Then, Big Brother, I'm counting on you.

439
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,039
It's fine, don't mention it.

440
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,079
It's fine, you hurry back and rest.

441
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,960
Don't just stand around here.

442
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,079
You all should go back too.

443
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,880
We don't have anything to do.

444
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,680
We'll stay with you a bit longer.

445
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,480
Right, we're already here, and we're not busy.

446
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,880
There's space here, sit, sit.

447
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,920
You two have things to do, things to do.

448
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,119
What I meant was, I want the eldest and Weiguo to stay.

449
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,599
I have something to say to the two of them.

450
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,680
What can't you say in front of us?

451
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,319
Then say it to our faces.

452
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,640
Auntie is sick...

453
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,880
But my mind is perfectly clear.

454
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,079
You two never actually made up.

455
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,119
Don't keep fooling me all day.

456
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,200
Isn't that right?

457
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,680
Dare to tell me the truth?

458
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,799
You two brothers should leave first.

459
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:36,000
Then let's go.

460
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,799
Let's go, let's go.

461
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:38,920
We're leaving, Big Brother.

462
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,039
If I could jump out of this bed...

463
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,039
I'd tear into you.

464
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,160
Beat you up.

465
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,759
Just like when we were kids.

466
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:00,599
No, no, no.

467
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,000
Hit me, hit me, hit me.

468
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,720
Hit me hard.

469
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,799
I absolutely won't dodge.

470
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:04,400
Go ahead and hit me.

471
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,000
I don't have the strength to hit you.

472
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,039
Auntie...

473
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,079
Do you remember?

474
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,799
Do you remember when we were kids?

475
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,440
Back then, you two were the closest.

476
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,319
Right?

477
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,359
There were still dance halls back then.

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,720
You brothers sneaked off to go.

479
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,480
And got caught red-handed.

480
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,000
Chunsheng got a good beating from your grandpa.

481
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,759
His butt was beaten black and blue.

482
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,000
You see...

483
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Weiguo was stubborn.

484
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,000
He insisted it was him who pestered Big Brother to go.

485
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,279
That time, you two were just like today.

486
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,640
Sitting beside me.

487
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,400
One on each side.

488
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,279
No, Auntie...

489
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,480
Could you close your eyes and rest for a bit?

490
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,000
You two, just like back in the day, talk.

491
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,319
Say what's bothering you. Say it.

492
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:26,920
Speak.

493
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:30,720
Alright, Auntie.

494
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,720
Since you brought it up,

495
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,079
then I'll speak my mind today.

496
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,400
Auntie, over twenty years ago, right?

497
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:47,319
Over twenty years ago, it was because of him, Ma Weiguo,

498
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,359
that us brothers got into that fight, right?

499
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,200
I went to jail for Ma Weiguo, didn't I?

500
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,000
But I never held a grudge about that.

501
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,720
Why?

502
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,480
Because I felt he was my younger brother.

503
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,480
I was his older brother.

504
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,640
But what I can't understand is,

505
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,839
how could this guy just vanish without a word?

506
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,160
He just disappeared.

507
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,759
Where has he been for over twenty years?

508
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,519
What did he take me for, Auntie?

509
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,519
You tell me, a person like him,

510
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,359
could do something so heartless.

511
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,039
So why should I bother, Auntie?

512
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,279
Why should I bother? Why?

513
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,200
But he's back now, isn't he?

514
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:31,880
Yeah.

515
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,359
But do you know what he's done?

516
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,440
He just uses his lousy money

517
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,720
to slap us brothers in the face.

518
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,799
Handing each of us a bank card,

519
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,079
and keeps saying

520
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,480
he's going to buy Tong Qiu a house.

521
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,319
And messing with our Feifei.

522
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,279
These are the things he's done.

523
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,400
Tong Qiu himself said he needed a house.

524
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,960
As for your Feifei's situation,

525
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,400
you interrupted me halfway through.

526
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,960
You're the one lacking patience.

527
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,119
Right, right, exactly, Ma Weiguo.

528
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,359
You've been like this your whole life.

529
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,079
All the mistakes are always someone else's.

530
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,960
You're the only innocent one, right?

531
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,319
So what do you suggest we do?

532
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,720
I don't know what to do.

533
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,599
Let me tell you.

534
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,559
You brothers,

535
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,640
do whatever you want.

536
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,400
Just don't come messing with me.

537
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,720
Yes, you have your lousy money.

538
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
But I'm telling you,

539
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,240
I won't indulge your bad habits.

540
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,720
If you're so capable, buy the entire

541
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,559
Baofang Hutong.

542
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,400
Kick us all out.

543
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,160
Then you can do whatever you want in this hutong.

544
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,240
Do whatever you please.

545
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,799
Lie down if you want.

546
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,279
Roll around if you want.

547
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,799
Go dance in the latrine if you want.

548
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:34,559
Go dance there.

549
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,079
Hold on, Big Brother.

550
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,599
Are you dredging up old scores in front of Auntie now?

551
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,039
Is that it?

552
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,359
Handing out bank cards to everyone?

553
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,599
Is that something a decent person does?

554
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,799
We haven't seen each other for twenty years.

555
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,960
I think we should still go check on Auntie.

556
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,920
We should go back and see her.

557
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,480
Big Brother is with Auntie.

558
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,960
What could possibly happen?

559
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:02,640
Didn't you have an appointment with some Director Qiu this afternoon?

560
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:03,640
You'd better hurry.

561
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,160
It's fine.

562
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,759
Go back to work without worry.

563
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,880
Go on.

564
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,880
Alright then. Message me if anything comes up.

565
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:26,720
Director Li.

566
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,559
Director Fan, who was going to invest in our project,

567
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,000
now wants to invest in another project instead.

568
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,920
Can you come over right now?

569
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,799
One-zero-eight.

570
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,240
One-zero-eight.

571
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,640
In the middle of the afternoon,

572
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,400
you won't drink yourselves to death.

573
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,599
Come on, bottoms up! Bottoms up!

574
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,640
Don't leave any! Drink it all!

575
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,200
You're so young,

576
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,599
can't even chug a bottle of beer?

577
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,200
Come on, do it!

578
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,960
Chug it! Chug it!

579
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,799
I'll toast you.

580
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,960
You over there, drink!

581
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,079
Be more proactive!

582
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,400
Down it! Down it!

583
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,839
No leftovers! No leftovers!

584
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,640
Manager Tong!

585
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,039
Coming!

586
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,720
Director Qiu!

587
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,279
Careful! Careful!

588
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,880
That's more like it!

589
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,519
Everyone having a good time

590
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,720
makes it easier to talk business.

591
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,160
Right? If we're happy,

592
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,640
the contract can be signed, right?

593
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,640
Why be so mercenary?

594
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,480
Have fun and drink first, then we'll talk.

595
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,480
Here.

596
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,799
Third Brother.

597
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,559
Sorry to trouble you, Third Brother.

598
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,119
No problem.

599
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,279
Big Brother.

600
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,720
Both of them have gone quiet.

601
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,440
Mom.

602
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Xiaofang and I just picked out a Sanhuang chicken.

603
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,880
It's been simmering all afternoon.

604
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,200
You like the original broth, right?

605
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,640
I deliberately didn't add much salt.

606
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,599
And there's Uncle Zhang's fried liver.

607
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,440
I got it just the way you like it.

608
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,319
I ordered delivery.

609
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,400
It'll be here soon.

610
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,400
Uh, Xiaofang is here.

611
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,880
I'm going out for some air.

612
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,319
I, I, I...

613
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:43,359
Get three mao from my bag.

614
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,039
Oldest.

615
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,039
Go buy that ice-cold soda.

616
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,319
Why drink ice-cold soda?

617
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,240
It's too cold.

618
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,079
I brought you soup.

619
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,240
Drink something hot.

620
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,599
Mom just wants a sip of ice-cold soda.

621
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,319
If Mom wants to drink it, let her have a sip.

622
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,640
Mom, I'll buy it for you.

623
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,680
I'll go.

624
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,920
Oldest, you go too.

625
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,279
Go together.

626
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,279
Go, go.

627
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,079
Together.

628
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,920
Go together.

629
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:21,440
Go.

630
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,759
Go buy it.

631
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,799
Go.

632
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:34,599
Mom.

633
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:42,200
just wants a sip of ice-cold soda.

634
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,839
Then will you drink my soup first?

635
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,559
Alright.

636
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,440
Ice-cold soda.

637
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,759
I'll go buy it.

638
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,000
You go back.

639
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,200
No, I... I'll get the doctor.

640
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,240
You go buy the soda.

641
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,880
What would you like to order?

642
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,000
I'll have a soda.

643
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,119
One soda.

644
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:56,960
Scan the code.

645
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,039
Thank you.

646
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,960
16:37 in the afternoon.

647
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,039
The patient has passed away.

648
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,039
We are very sorry.

649
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,400
We did everything we could.

650
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,000
Mom.

651
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,680
Mom.

652
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,279
Auntie is gone.

653
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,119
She went before me.

654
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,279
The barrier between me and death...

655
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,000
...seems to have thinned by another layer.

656
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,759
I thought I had no feelings...

657
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,319
...about death at all.

658
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,759
But when I really heard Auntie had died...

659
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,799
...my mind seemed to be instantly emptied.

660
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,960
Turns out I am afraid.

661
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,440
I'm afraid of death.

662
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,519
And afraid of life's sudden farewells.

663
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,800
I've been so worried these past couple days.

664
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,400
Our cat got out.

665
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,920
I've been searching everywhere.

666
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,400
But don't you have a private elevator?

667
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,360
How did it even get out?

668
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,079
Don't even ask.

669
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:21,719
You know there are pet-finding services now, right?

670
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,719
They're not cheap for a single job.

671
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,320
But they really can find them.

672
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,360
I heard that...

673
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,679
...Young Master Lei from Tengfei...

674
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,280
...got his family's dog back that way.

675
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,199
So, you see...

676
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,039
...many industries...

677
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,519
...are already sunset industries.

678
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,519
We really need to keep our eyes open when investing.

679
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,960
What are you doing?

680
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,079
Can you drink or not?

681
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,280
You drinking?

682
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,800
Come on.

683
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,679
Drink up, baby.

684
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,159
Can you handle it or not?

685
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,239
Drink.

686
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,679
Not bad.

687
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,119
Another one! Another one!

688
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,960
Let's go.

689
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,239
Drink, drink, drink!

690
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,679
Keep going!

691
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,199
Have some strong liquor. Be a man.

692
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,440
Take it easy.

693
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,719
Get off me.

694
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,039
Come on, Qiu, get in the car.

695
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,079
Wait a second.

696
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,559
It's getting late.

697
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,800
I need to get back.

698
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,800
Get back where?

699
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,320
We haven't signed the contract yet.

700
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,000
Where do you think you're going?

701
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,239
Get in the car.

702
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,480
Close the door.

703
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,599
Tongtong, Qiuqiu.

704
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,000
What's wrong?

705
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,840
I feel sick.

706
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,719
You drank too fast just now.

707
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,880
Here, I'll take you to the curb.

708
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,039
Open the car door.

709
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,800
It's not the alcohol making me sick.

710
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,000
Then what is it?

711
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,920
It's looking at you that makes me sick.

712
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,199
Sick just looking at you.

713
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,239
Get lost.

714
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,719
Get lost! Get lost!

715
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,639
Get lost.

716
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,559
Dad.

717
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,920
Is Great-Aunt feeling better?

718
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,800
Great-Aunt has passed away.

719
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,760
What is it?

720
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,840
That box.

721
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:18,639
What box?

722
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:20,960
Let me see.

723
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,440
This one.

724
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,400
Where did you dig this up from?

725
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,119
Give it to me.

726
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:35,960
Go inside.

727
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,519
You're really throwing it away?

728
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,320
Go inside.

729
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,559
Mom.

730
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,039
When I was changing Auntie's shoes...

731
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,559
...I just couldn't get them on her feet.

732
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,440
Jing.

733
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,920
Auntie must have had some unfinished business.
