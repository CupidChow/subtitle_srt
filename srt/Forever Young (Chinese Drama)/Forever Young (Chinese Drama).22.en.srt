1
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,159
Don't leave anyone behind.

2
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,919
Right, make sure no one's left out.

3
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,240
The new shop's renovation really looks the part.

4
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,319
Here.

5
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,520
Morning.

6
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,199
Bro.

7
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,120
Where's Ma Weiguo?

8
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
He hasn't arrived.

9
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,039
You should've called him this morning.

10
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,560
This is the busiest time before opening.

11
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,279
Great, and he's slacking off.

12
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,600
He's not the type to slack off.

13
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,519
Wait, you two this morning...

14
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,680
...didn't see him at all?

15
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,480
No.

16
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,120
He didn't reply to messages last night either.

17
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,480
If that's the case...

18
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
When I went to see my parents this morning...

19
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,000
...there was no sound from his room.

20
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,240
After I came back...

21
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,560
...the things I should do...

22
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,360
...and the things I wanted to do, I've already done them.

23
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,959
As for what comes next...

24
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,560
...just let it be.

25
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,920
I appreciate your feelings for me.

26
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,000
But I don't have much time left.

27
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,079
I don't want to live in a wretched state.

28
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,680
And I don't want anyone's pity.

29
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,279
Do you understand what I mean?

30
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,160
Where has he gone?

31
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,360
Darn it.

32
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,839
Big Brother, what's wrong?

33
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,000
What happened?

34
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,160
Big Brother?

35
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,600
Weiguo!

36
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,920
I always said he was unreliable.

37
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
What time is it, and he's still sleeping?

38
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,720
Weiguo!

39
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,480
Weiguo! Weiguo!

40
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Weiguo!

41
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,480
Weiguo!

42
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,839
Big Brother! Big Brother!

43
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,160
Weiguo!

44
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,839
Big Brother, it's not that serious.

45
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,079
No, you don't know.

46
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,160
Well... still, it can't be that bad.

47
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,079
What's this?

48
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,439
Bro.

49
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,480
What is it?

50
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,639
Is this a password?

51
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,480
Try it.

52
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,079
It really is.

53
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,360
Weiguo...

54
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,519
Weiguo...

55
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,199
Packed up and left.

56
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,839
Weiguo...

57
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,040
I'm gone.

58
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,360
By the time you read this letter...

59
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,720
...I will already...

60
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm gone.

61
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,879
By the time you read this letter...

62
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,519
...I will already be in America.

63
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,439
I came back just to make you admit your mistakes and apologize.

64
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,800
Now that wish is fulfilled.

65
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,560
There's nothing left to hold me here. Farewell.

66
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,040
I originally wanted to wait until...

67
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,519
...the cooperation between Peng Le Xuan and Dong Qian...

68
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,040
...was formally established before leaving.

69
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,360
But reality doesn't permit it.

70
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,600
Fortunately, things are on track now.

71
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,199
The next step is up to you.

72
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,560
I set up a fund a while ago.

73
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
Once matters in the US are settled...

74
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,800
...a lawyer will contact you.

75
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,720
Our brotherhood ends here.

76
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,480
If there's a chance in the next life...

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,959
...goodbye.

78
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Goodbye.

79
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,720
What's going on?

80
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
He was fine yesterday.

81
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
How could he just up and leave like that?

82
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,800
That bastard, he ran off again.

83
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
He's sick.

84
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,199
He really is sick.

85
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,319
Yeah, he's sick.

86
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,160
He's genuinely ill.

87
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,000
If he weren't sick, would he do something like this?

88
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,040
No.

89
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,959
He has something growing in his brain.

90
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Brain cancer.

91
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,800
Big Brother, did he trick you again?

92
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,759
No.

93
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,920
Is it true?

94
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,439
It's true.

95
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,480
How do you know, Tongtong?

96
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,040
Late-stage glioma.

97
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,040
I took him to the hospital.

98
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,199
He came back because of this.

99
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,519
You took him?

100
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Martin.

101
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,079
Suspected tumor pathology.

102
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,120
Second Brother.

103
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,879
I'm going to find him right now.

104
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,120
Which one of you is coming with me?

105
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,680
No, wait, wait, wait, hold on, bro.

106
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,120
This is a bit chaotic. How did it suddenly...

107
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,680
Calm down, calm down.

108
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,240
Let's all calm down first and think.

109
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,720
How did it suddenly come to this?

110
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,959
You... you want to go?

111
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,680
Do... do you even have a visa?

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll get one.

113
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,720
This is something I can't control either.

114
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,480
The necessary procedures must be followed.

115
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,839
I heard...

116
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,039
...that President Yang from Keyong...

117
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,720
...also went to Beijing.

118
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,519
And stayed for over a week.

119
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,679
I imagine you ran into him?

120
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,720
Old Ma.

121
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,120
As a co-founder of Rice...

122
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,240
...you know the situation of every business line...

123
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,120
...better than anyone.

124
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,840
And you hold a significant amount of shares.

125
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,919
Now you suddenly want to resign for no apparent reason.

126
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,840
Of course...

127
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,360
...I trust you one hundred percent.

128
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,519
But what others might think...

129
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
...is another matter.

130
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,679
What are you laughing at?

131
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,960
I'm laughing at myself.

132
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,879
There's something I don't know if I should say...

133
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,720
...but I'll say it anyway.

134
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,120
If you start your own business, only I can invest.

135
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,320
If others get involved...

136
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,039
...I wouldn't be at ease.

137
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,480
You don't need to worry.

138
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,519
We can sign a non-compete agreement.

139
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,399
And I can also guarantee...

140
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,960
...that I won't enter this industry again.

141
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,039
As for all my equity...

142
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,399
...I can also transfer it to you.

143
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,679
The detailed specifics...

144
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,399
...let Lawyer Wang discuss with you.

145
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,919
Old Ma.

146
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,600
No matter what...

147
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,600
...Rice is your child.

148
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,399
When you have time...

149
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,759
...come back and visit often.

150
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,000
Welcome home.

151
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,600
You finally decided to come back.

152
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,080
No, wait for me a second.

153
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,879
I've been waiting for you all night.

154
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,639
You must be exhausted after such a long flight.

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,759
Maybe rest a bit, get over the jet lag.

156
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,679
This place of yours isn't bad.

157
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,720
The location, the size...

158
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,159
Not cheap, right?

159
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,919
It's okay. I bought it early.

160
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,480
More Chinese people have been coming these past two years.

161
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,840
That's what drove the housing prices up.

162
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,679
Get me something to eat, will you?

163
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,679
The food on the plane was awful.

164
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,399
Something light.

165
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,679
I've been a bit under the weather lately.

166
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,559
You're so demanding.

167
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,639
I don't usually cook for myself either.

168
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,399
Just eat whatever's in the fridge.

169
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,960
No, I came all this way...

170
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,159
And this is how you treat me?

171
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,600
Big Brother, Qiu'er.

172
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,720
I've arrived. I've seen Weiguo.

173
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,840
Where is he?

174
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,200
How is he now?

175
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,679
He's fine, alive and well.

176
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,399
Hold on.

177
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,240
Big Brother, Qiu'er.

178
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,120
Weiguo.

179
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,159
H-how are you doing now?

180
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
You... you know...

181
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,840
Listen to your big brother.

182
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,679
If there's no place to treat you over there,

183
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,559
then come back.

184
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,360
We'll be together and figure it out together.

185
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
We'll get you proper treatment.

186
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,159
If you find the few of us annoying,

187
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,679
we won't bother you.

188
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,559
Weiguo, you have to come back.

189
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,440
You need someone to take care of you.

190
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm pretty good at taking care of people.

191
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
I've gotten used to it caring for my dad these years.

192
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,840
If you come back, I'll definitely...

193
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,039
...take care of you real good.

194
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,840
Thanks, I appreciate the thought.

195
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,360
You... listen to Big Brother.

196
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,480
Weiguo.

197
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,840
If you really leave like that,

198
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,559
I'll never be at peace for the rest of my life.

199
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,919
Qiu'er, Qiu'er, Qiu'er.

200
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,480
Don't talk like that, it's bad luck.

201
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
What are you doing?

202
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,840
It's fine, it's fine.

203
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,559
And don't worry about that either.

204
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,320
I think Weiguo is doing just fine.

205
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Nothing's wrong.

206
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,559
Let's just go about our business.

207
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,679
Listen to me.

208
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,679
Alright, then... Second Brother, thanks for your trouble.

209
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,320
If... if anything comes up, call.

210
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,840
That's it, hanging up now.

211
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:18,879
That's it?

212
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,159
This is no different from being on the plane.

213
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,080
Peng Le Xuan is about to open.

214
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,200
Aren't you busy?

215
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,559
Busy or not,

216
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,720
after all this time running around,

217
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,600
you gotta relax a little too.

218
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:37,879
This trip,

219
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,559
how long are you planning to stay?

220
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,840
Hard to say.

221
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,759
I've been here so many times before,

222
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,440
but never really got to explore properly.

223
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,720
Every time, it's just rushing to meetings,

224
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,639
and leaving right after.

225
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,080
This time,

226
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,159
I really plan to stay for a good while.

227
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,919
Look.

228
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,480
Towel.

229
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,720
Cup, toothbrush, shower gel.

230
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,200
I even brought a thermos.

231
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,840
If you don't have anything going on,

232
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,440
keep me company these next few days.

233
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,639
Take your time eating.

234
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,639
I'm heading to my room first.

235
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,120
You can crash on the sofa.

236
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,320
No.

237
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
What time is it even?

238
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,360
Going to bed so early?

239
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Let's chat a bit more.

240
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,080
Good night.

241
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,960
What a guy.

242
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,879
Uncle, how's it going?

243
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,799
Keep your voice down.

244
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,679
It's normal for now.

245
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,679
But you know him,

246
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,799
his stubborn temper.

247
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,200
Stubborn as a mule.

248
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,799
I can't say too much either.

249
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,519
Dare not force it. It's giving me a headache.

250
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,519
You really don't plan to come over?

251
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,679
I really don't understand you guys.

252
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,240
What exactly are you all thinking?

253
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,120
Uncle, I told you,

254
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,519
there was nothing between us before,

255
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,120
and there definitely won't be anything after.

256
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,360
It doesn't look that way to me.

257
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,039
Uncle, please stop guessing.

258
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,960
I'll send you some stuff, some materials.

259
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,840
Use it if it helps, forget it if it doesn't.

260
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,559
Anyway, I can't be bothered with his business.

261
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,399
Bye.

262
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,879
What an attitude.

263
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,919
Women...

264
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,799
Every single one of them.

265
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,599
Who knows what they're thinking.

266
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,079
No, look, here's the thing.

267
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,079
Can you just take a look for me?

268
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,960
I really don't dare give you wrong info.

269
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,559
Just take a look for me, please?

270
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,240
Desperate times call for desperate measures, I get it.

271
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,799
Alright, Lao Wang.

272
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,559
My classmates, friends...

273
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,720
I'll find everyone I can for you.

274
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,079
Don't worry.

275
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,759
Anyone I can find,

276
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,079
I won't leave a single one out.

277
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,880
Okay?

278
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,599
Alright, brother. I'm counting on you.

279
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,279
I'll wait for your call.

280
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,640
I'm off.

281
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,200
Okay.

282
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Hey, Jing'er.

283
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,920
Hey, Chunsheng.

284
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,400
You remember my dad's chess buddy, Uncle Fu, right?

285
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,920
His son-in-law works at Xiehe Hospital.

286
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,160
I'll have my dad ask him for some advice later.

287
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,160
I'll text you his number in a bit.

288
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,480
Alright, send it over.

289
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:15,920
Mom.

290
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,720
Hold on a sec, Feifei wants to talk to you.

291
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,400
Dad.

292
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,160
I just looked it up online.

293
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,240
It says these next few days,

294
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,039
a group of experts from Shanghai will be in Beijing.

295
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,920
Maybe we can go try to find them?

296
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,799
Sure, you look up the address first.

297
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,240
Then text it to me.

298
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
The address.

299
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,720
Okay, I'll look it up and send it to you.

300
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,359
Alright.

301
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,279
Don't hang up yet.

302
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,440
Are you coming back for dinner later?

303
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,039
I won't be back for dinner.

304
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,720
Text me that phone number.

305
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
I'm heading to Xiehe right now.

306
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,680
While they're still at work.

307
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,799
Okay then.

308
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,160
Grab a bite to eat outside.

309
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,000
Alright, alright.

310
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Weiguo.

311
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,839
Weiguo.

312
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,680
Ma Weiguo!

313
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,359
Where did you go?

314
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,519
To buy breakfast. Foreign breakfast.

315
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,519
Make do with this.

316
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,240
You have a conscience, I'll give you that.

317
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,960
This is it?

318
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,119
This can't compare to soy milk and fried dough sticks.

319
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,319
What about yours? Not eating?

320
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,400
I'm not hungry.

321
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,519
I'm not really hungry either.

322
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,599
But the thing is,

323
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,400
when it's time to eat, you gotta eat heartily.

324
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,720
Then you'll have energy to go out and have fun later.

325
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,079
There's nothing fun here.

326
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,920
I've tried all the things to do and see. Boring.

327
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:03,960
It's different.

328
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,039
Going out by yourself

329
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:06,920
versus going with friends

330
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,160
is completely different, okay?

331
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,440
Let me tell you,

332
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,039
where you go isn't important.

333
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,400
But who you go with is.

334
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,720
For example,

335
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,279
some tourist spots might seem ordinary,

336
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,160
but if you go with your buddies,

337
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,640
it becomes a lot more fun.

338
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,480
Didn't you say it doesn't taste good?

339
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,599
Yet you're eating it so eagerly.

340
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:29,839
I'm full.

341
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,480
That's just how I am.

342
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,079
The worse something tastes,

343
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,680
the more I wolf it down.

344
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,480
Alright, let's go.

345
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,680
The apartment is yours.

346
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,920
Stay as long as you like. I'm leaving.

347
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,759
What do you mean?

348
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,880
Wait for me, let me change.

349
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,599
I say, Boss Ma,

350
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,039
you're really generous.

351
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,279
Just giving up such a nice place like that.

352
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,079
Just worldly possessions.

353
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,039
If you like it,

354
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,480
stay as long as you want.

355
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
There are lots of things I like.

356
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,440
What else have you got?

357
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,160
Perfect timing, let's go see.

358
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,799
Martin.

359
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,160
Jack.

360
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,319
You okay?

361
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,160
Far from okay.

362
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,559
You try getting whacked on the head.

363
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,000
How do you manage to piss people off everywhere?

364
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,799
It hurts like hell.

365
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,079
Let's head back first.

366
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:25,400
Go back and put some ointment on. Let's go.

367
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,440
Dizzy.

368
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:28,519
Quick, quick, quick.

369
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,880
It's fine, your head's hard.

370
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,079
Go back and put some ointment on.

371
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:40,920
About all this...

372
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,599
Manager Tong.

373
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,720
Please don't worry about any of this.

374
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,119
Okay.

375
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,599
Call me anytime if there's a problem.

376
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,079
Okay, no problem.

377
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,079
I stay up late anyway.

378
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,079
Alright, sounds good.

379
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:50,559
Actually, perfect timing.

380
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,599
Okay, that works.

381
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,079
Thank you, Manager Tong.

382
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:58,839
Sister Fan, let's keep in touch.

383
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,319
Okay, goodbye.

384
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,079
Thank you, thank you.

385
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:00,720
Alright.

386
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,119
Big Brother.

387
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,440
How come there's no news from Second Brother?

388
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,119
Look at how you've been performing these past two months.

389
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,039
Your team's key performance indicators aren't being met.

390
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,680
Your results can't even match Tong Qiu's now.

391
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,359
Assistant Jia, do you not want this job anymore?

392
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,680
What are you standing there for?

393
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,400
Get out.

394
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,839
Old Tong.

395
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,599
You've been doing great lately.

396
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,039
Just this month was okay.

397
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,680
You're being too modest.

398
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,119
Assistant Jia, don't take it too seriously.

399
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,000
The branch manager speaks without thinking.

400
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,400
Don't take it to heart.

401
00:23:58,759 --> 00:23:59,640
Thanks.

402
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,599
We're all colleagues.

403
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,319
I've been talking to a client recently.

404
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,680
It's pretty much settled.

405
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,079
But he's in Xi'an.

406
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,319
Insists I go there to finalize it.

407
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,160
I'm swamped here and can't get away.

408
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,079
Would it be convenient for you?

409
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,200
Xi'an?

410
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,319
Yes, yes, convenient.

411
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,319
Alright then.

412
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,839
I'll then,

413
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,799
send you the contact info and materials.

414
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,720
Thanks.

415
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,960
Okay, thank you.

416
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,640
I'll go first.

417
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,880
Come in.

418
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,279
You really did come looking for me.

419
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,599
What happened?

420
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,079
I couldn't find a job.

421
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,480
Got divorced, and the bank took the house.

422
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,839
But you're doing just fine.

423
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,559
God must be blind.

424
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,319
Seeing me like this...

425
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,319
...you must be happy, right?

426
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,359
You're right.

427
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,599
I'm not a good person.

428
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,680
To be precise, I'm a jerk.

429
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,079
But you're no saint either.

430
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,839
You work for a Chinese company...

431
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,240
...yet you look down on us Chinese.

432
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,920
The state you're in now...

433
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,359
...you deserve it, you know that?

434
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,079
We Chinese have an old saying.

435
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,680
It's better to resolve a feud than to keep it going.

436
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:41,319
Let bygones be bygones.

437
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,319
Take it.

438
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:48,839
Martin.

439
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,960
Don't you want to know...

440
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,279
...why I targeted you back then?

441
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,839
Do you think people like us...

442
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:56,960
...really have friends?

443
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:58,839
He promised me...

444
00:25:58,839 --> 00:25:59,680
...that if I took you down...

445
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,400
...I could retire ten years early.

446
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,839
You say I...

447
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,720
...instigated Jack against you?

448
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,400
Do you believe that?

449
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,559
Ten years.

450
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,279
We started a business together for ten years.

451
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:29,119
We may not be sworn brothers...

452
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,880
...but we were at least like brothers.

453
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,440
Of course I knew you weren't targeting me.

454
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,319
You were just using someone else to do your dirty work.

455
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,359
You used me to take down Jack.

456
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,119
And made sure he blamed me for everything.

457
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,359
While you walked away clean.

458
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,920
It must be a misunderstanding.

459
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,119
Haven't you always wanted to know...

460
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,200
...why I suddenly quit?

461
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,000
When was this?

462
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,759
Whatever you need me to do, just say it.

463
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,519
I don't need anything.

464
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,599
Then how about this.

465
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,240
The terms you offered before...

466
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,960
...I agree to all of them.

467
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,880
We'll do it your way.

468
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,400
The commercial investigation...

469
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,640
...will stop immediately.

470
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,920
Your funds...

471
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,039
...will be unfrozen soon.

472
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,759
No need for a non-compete agreement either.

473
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,240
It's just the matter of transferring the shares.

474
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,079
Let's get it done as soon as possible, okay?

475
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Sorry about this...

476
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,839
...but I've changed my mind.

477
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,119
You know me...

478
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,839
...I hate being used the most.

479
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,359
And this matter...

480
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,680
...involves my brother.

481
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,720
There's no room for discussion.

482
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,599
Then what do you want?

483
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,079
I've already contacted...

484
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,079
...your old rival, General Manager Yang.

485
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:05,720
I'll transfer all my shares to him.

486
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,200
If you want to keep investigating, go ahead.

487
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,200
I'll see it through to the end.

488
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,119
Rice can't handle all this.

489
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:12,759
I'm sorry.

490
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,720
Given your situation...

491
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,960
...I shouldn't have lost my temper with you.

492
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,079
Old Ma, I admit I was wrong before.

493
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,319
I beg for your forgiveness.

494
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,400
But...

495
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,599
...let's just leave it at that.

496
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,559
Old Ma...

497
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,720
Fine, fine, fine.

498
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:41,720
He kicked you?

499
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,839
More than kicked me, he even talked to me.

500
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,920
What did he say?

501
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,079
He said Mommy works very hard.

502
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,920
He told Daddy to take good care of Mommy.

503
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,640
Alright, stop joking around.

504
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,880
Watch out, he might end up like you.

505
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,359
What do you mean, 'end up like me'?

506
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm his father.

507
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,519
Who else would he take after if not me?

508
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,640
Seeing you has cheered me up a lot.

509
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:10,920
Honey.

510
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,640
Don't worry too much.

511
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,240
Third Brother has been through so much.

512
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,920
No matter how hard it is, he'll pull through.

513
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,759
I believe Second Brother will definitely bring him back.

514
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,359
Let's reach out to...

515
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:24,839
...any doctors or hospitals we know.

516
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,880
When he comes back...

517
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,640
...we have to take him to see a doctor.

518
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,880
Okay.

519
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,400
It's getting late.

520
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
I'm off to meet a client now.

521
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh, right.

522
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,119
I'll send you the address later.

523
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,359
Then after work, you head over.

524
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,839
We'll have dinner at the mall.

525
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:41,839
Alright.

526
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:57,359
Honey

527
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,079
I left a file at your place.

528
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,519
Yes, okay. I'll bring it over in a bit.

529
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:03,599
Alright, I'll send you the location later.

530
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,359
When you're done,

531
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,720
bring the file to me here.

532
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,839
Then we can have dinner together.

533
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:09,960
Okay.

534
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,319
Director Cao, this is Tong Qiu.

535
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,839
We spoke before.

536
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:18,599
Have a seat.

537
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:20,519
Hello.

538
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,839
Long time no see.

539
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,359
Director... Director Qiu?

540
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,000
Long time no see.

541
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,359
What... what are you doing here today?

542
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,240
You didn't know?

543
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,359
Director Cao and I are old friends.

544
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,400
Old friends, old friends.

545
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,440
Didn't I tell you?

546
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,359
He's quite handsome, isn't he?

547
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,880
Indeed, clean-cut features.

548
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,160
Quite likable.

549
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,920
What's the use of being handsome?

550
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,799
He just can't take a joke.

551
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,839
No, Director Qiu, really...

552
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,960
About before, I'm sorry.

553
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,160
I don't socialize much.

554
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,759
So I hope you understand.

555
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,559
Can't take a joke, and on top of that, hypocritical.

556
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,599
Says one thing to your face, another behind your back.

557
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,160
What do you mean by that?

558
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,839
Playing dumb with me?

559
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,079
I've heard.

560
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,839
You've been telling people everywhere

561
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,640
that you could have me in a minute.

562
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,839
And that I'm past my prime, you're not interested.

563
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,799
Even if I threw myself at you,

564
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,599
you wouldn't take the bait, right?

565
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,559
Impossible! Who told you that?

566
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,079
Impossible! He wouldn't do such a thing.

567
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,039
Honey!

568
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,119
Husband, I brought it for you.

569
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,359
Don't be so careless next time.

570
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,880
You're his wife?

571
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,640
This guy here,

572
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,440
talks a lot, very gossipy.

573
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,279
But at heart, he's an honest man.

574
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,599
Thin-skinned.

575
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,680
Not very tough mentally either.

576
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,119
Even if you tried to force him to do something bad,

577
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,400
he wouldn't be able to do it.

578
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,519
Alright, you two chat.

579
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,480
Okay, okay.

580
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,119
Tong Tong.

581
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,319
All those things between us...

582
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,839
You didn't report to your wife?

583
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,839
Don't talk nonsense.

584
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,200
What things between us?

585
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,039
We have lots of things between us.

586
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,319
I even have evidence.

587
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,240
Let me see.

588
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,880
Photos? I have to see those.

589
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,640
Our Tong Qiu here,

590
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,920
doesn't have any great talents.

591
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,680
He just has one virtue.

592
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,400
He hides nothing from me.

593
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,240
Here, take a look.

594
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,680
Is it this one?

595
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,960
That's the one.

596
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:31,599
I thought it was some big scandal.

597
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,720
Just this?

598
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,359
Honey.

599
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,000
If I...

600
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:47,079
show you my phone,

601
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:49,920
can you promise not to get angry?

602
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:51,839
What do you mean?

603
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,119
I mean,

604
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,880
if I show you my phone, someone just

605
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,039
sent me a picture.

606
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,559
But don't get angry, okay?

607
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,160
I won't get angry.

608
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,759
Okay.

609
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,400
Go ahead, show me.

610
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,839
Don't get angry.

611
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,880
It's... it's a bit hot in here.

612
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,519
I'm sweating.

613
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,119
Just took a shower. Where's your towel?

614
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,599
Here, here it is, here.

615
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,119
Sweating like this, so useless.

616
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,640
You've gained quite a bit of weight lately.

617
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,119
Your fitness management is lacking.

618
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,319
My heart... scared me to death.

619
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,599
I'm... having hot and cold flashes.

620
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,680
I feel like these few seconds

621
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,759
felt like a whole century.

622
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,559
Good that you're not angry.

623
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,039
Of course I'm angry.

624
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,039
Tong Tong.

625
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,639
Didn't expect you to be a henpecked husband.

626
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,320
That's because we trust each other.

627
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,039
We have no secrets between us.

628
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,800
Tell me, in this world,

629
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,840
where are all the good men, right?

630
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,280
He doesn't fancy me today,

631
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,119
tomorrow he might fancy someone else.

632
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,320
Little sister, I advise you not to be naive.

633
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,360
Don't be fooled by this man in front of you.

634
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,960
No, Director Qiu, please stop talking nonsense.

635
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,159
In my phone here,

636
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,880
the chat logs, the photos...

637
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,159
He has... deceived me plenty.

638
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,599
Constantly making up lies to me.

639
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,800
I've caught him out countless times.

640
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,360
You say it yourself, isn't that right?

641
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:54,960
Many times.

642
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,920
But every time he lies to me,

643
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,360
it's about a promotion, a raise,

644
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,840
whether I've gained weight again,

645
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,800
what clothes look good on me, things like that.

646
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,119
To keep me in a good mood normally,

647
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,519
he'll make up any lie.

648
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,360
But when it comes to crucial matters,

649
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,559
even if I would get angry,

650
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,039
he never hides them from me.

651
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,559
That's what being a couple is about.

652
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,000
Who doesn't argue?

653
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,639
After arguments like this,

654
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,280
I actually feel more at ease.

655
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,360
Director Qiu.

656
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,760
You're not wrong.

657
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,599
There aren't many good men out there.

658
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,800
But I just happened to meet one good man.

659
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,639
Call it my good luck.

660
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,679
Anything else to discuss?

661
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,599
I... I-I-I... what was I going to discuss?

662
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,199
Well, uh, Director Cao,

663
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:40,079
I'm sorry.

664
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,880
I'll... I'll contact you again later.

665
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,920
Director Qiu, sorry.

666
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,159
Let's go.

667
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
Forgot my bag.

668
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,960
I just told you not to be careless.

669
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,840
Sorry about that.

670
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,440
Can't take a joke.

671
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,119
I'm probably going to lose this job.

672
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,159
But it's okay.

673
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,719
You were just awesome back there.

674
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,559
Of course.

675
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,960
Don't worry about the job either.

676
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,320
Worst case, I'll take care of you.

677
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,719
I can't let you do that.

678
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,800
You have enough on your plate.

679
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,159
And you're carrying our baby.

680
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,559
Anyway, we have evidence, so we're not afraid of her.

681
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,480
If she tries to harm you regardless of her reputation,

682
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,800
then we won't hold back either.

683
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,679
How did I get so lucky?

684
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,800
To have such a wonderful wife.

685
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,679
But don't you worry.

686
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,280
I can handle all of this.

687
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,199
Let's go get something good to eat first.

688
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,159
Don't scare the baby in your belly.

689
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:42,760
Let's go.

690
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,199
Let's go.

691
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,000
Didn't you say you really wanted to die?

692
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:53,639
I actually came up with an idea.

693
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,920
To let you die once.

694
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,679
We'll act as if you're already dead.

695
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,480
Hold a funeral for you.

696
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,079
So you can see for yourself

697
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,440
what it's like after you die.

698
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,760
How did you think of this?

699
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,000
To be honest with you,

700
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,400
I've had this idea for a long time.

701
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,000
I really wanted to know

702
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,440
what it's like for a person after they die.

703
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Alright, you're getting a freebie this time.

704
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,400
Hello, Manager Zhao?

705
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:36,960
The funeral I asked you to prepare for me earlier,

706
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,039
can be held now.

707
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,880
Mr. Martin's life began with

708
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,119
his most enduring quality: kindness.

709
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,920
It ended with his noblest character: integrity.

710
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,880
He shone like the sun,

711
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,159
and will continue to shine.

712
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,440
We miss him.

713
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,639
He spent his life showing us

714
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,960
how faith and hope begin with oneself

715
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,800
and then flow to others.

716
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,679
He shared a better version of himself with us:

717
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,719
Commitment,

718
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,519
happiness,

719
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,719
and love.

720
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,840
May the deceased rest in peace, may the living strive forward.

721
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,920
Alright, enough acting. Get up.

722
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
Okay, stop.

723
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,599
You really went all out with the ceremony.

724
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,039
Must have cost a lot, right?

725
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,760
So, Martin,

726
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,159
As per your request,

727
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,519
I got these choir kids

728
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:30,119
and all these attendees back.

729
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,199
Same people as before.

730
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,440
Alright.

731
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,639
Let them leave for now.

732
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,760
At your service anytime.

733
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,519
Everyone, let's go.

734
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,159
Take a break.

735
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,000
Thank you.

736
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,199
Let's go get some water and snacks.

737
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,079
See?

738
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,639
Wanting to die is simple, isn't it?

739
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,440
You can just lie down in this coffin,

740
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,400
close your eyes, lid goes on,

741
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,000
and that's it.

742
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,079
Or I can hold another one for you back in Beijing.

743
00:38:59,239 --> 00:38:59,880
Slow down.

744
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,920
I really didn't expect you to still have these photos.

745
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,719
That one.

746
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,880
Back then, I was eight months old, you were six.

747
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,800
My mom was holding you.

748
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,440
Your mom was holding me.

749
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,239
I remember my dad said,

750
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,039
if you had been a girl back then,

751
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,800
our families would've arranged a marriage.

752
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,000
Good thing you weren't.

753
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:23,960
This one.

754
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,360
This was when Qiu'er turned one.

755
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:34,159
We had a big feast at your place.

756
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,360
Here, my dad, your dad, and Uncle Tong

757
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,639
are chatting next door.

758
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,480
I remember this photo was taken by Auntie.

759
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,559
Right after it was taken,

760
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,039
Qiu'er peed all over the table.

761
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,159
Don't rush, there's enough for everyone.

762
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,480
There's enough.

763
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,119
They're all mine, all mine!

764
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,199
They're all mine!

765
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,679
Here.

766
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:53,840
Look at this.

767
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,679
Come on, eat up.

768
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,199
Why are you taking them all?

769
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,159
Take them all, go ahead.

770
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:57,639
Here.

771
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,960
Give me two skewers.

772
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,280
Eat this when you're hungry.

773
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,679
Big Brother's cooking is great, right?

774
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,000
By the mountains and water,

775
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
eating little skewers.

776
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,199
Awesome.

777
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,320
Awesome.

778
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,440
I'm going out for a bit.
