1
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,039
My dear third child

2
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,919
Why did you run off without taking the money?

3
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,759
Let's give each other another chance.

4
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,120
Otherwise, I'm afraid we'll both regret it.

5
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,000
This is never-ending.

6
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,400
So annoying.

7
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,039
I don't need your peanuts.

8
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,960
Evans, do me a favor.

9
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,479
I have an account at Citibank.

10
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,840
Transfer four point two million dollars for me.

11
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,199
Into my domestic account.

12
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,840
Please hurry.

13
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,639
I need it urgently.

14
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,599
Gotta go.

15
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,199
Qiu'er

16
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,599
How's the moving situation going?

17
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,199
You think finding a house is that easy?

18
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,680
No need to look.

19
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,560
Here's an idea.

20
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,240
I'll buy you a house.

21
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,560
You can just move in.

22
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,080
You think I'm a fool, right?

23
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,599
Are you recording me with your phone?

24
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,680
My phone is in my hand.

25
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,240
You hid a camera.

26
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,479
You want to record me and post it online, huh?

27
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,479
That's so mean.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,919
I'm not lying to you.

29
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,439
I know you're not lying.

30
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,680
To get my aunt back, you'll buy me an apartment.

31
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,719
I thank you.

32
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,800
I thank you very much.

33
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,159
But I'll have to decline.

34
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,319
Where on earth did you hide the camera?

35
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,719
I've realized why you never got promoted.

36
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,759
There's a reason.

37
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,240
Alright, I'm going back to grab a bite.

38
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,719
Come over if you're hungry. Don't be shy.

39
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,759
Mom, can you find me a jacket? It's a bit chilly.

40
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,919
I'm not joking with you.

41
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,639
I believe you.

42
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,080
I believe you very much.

43
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,199
Wang Fei, come here.

44
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,839
Wait, what are you doing here?

45
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,360
Can't I come?

46
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,079
Come with me.

47
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,560
Taking you to a great place.

48
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,879
This is a connection Grandpa Tong pulled for us.

49
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,720
You know, a film crew.

50
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,439
So many people want in but can't, you know?

51
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,480
Hello, hello, hello.

52
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,879
You must be the director.

53
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,279
Yes, yes, yes.

54
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,439
Um, I'm, uh...

55
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,079
A friend of Teacher Tong.

56
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,240
This is our son.

57
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,879
Don't touch other people's things.

58
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,560
He just wants to see the makeup room.

59
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,439
No problem, no problem.

60
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,199
The makeup room is here.

61
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:54,600
Great.

62
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,480
Here, take this.

63
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:55,959
Take this.

64
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,480
You're too kind, too kind.

65
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,000
This is roast duck, for, for lunch.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,879
You're busy, you're busy.

67
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,439
Thank you, thank you.

68
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,600
Okay, no worries.

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,759
Touching people's stuff.

70
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,800
You'll end up breaking something.

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,680
This makeup room is just a big bus.

72
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,720
Keep quiet. Don't talk once you're up there.

73
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,319
Okay.

74
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,279
Teacher, after you.

75
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,160
This armor is plastic too.

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,000
Why do you care if it's plastic?

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
How do you fight in it?

78
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,959
Wait, Dad.

79
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,360
Why did you bring me to see a makeup room?

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,639
Aren't you interested in, you know, face painting...

81
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,759
...and makeup and all that stuff?

82
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,079
So I brought you to see.

83
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,639
How professional makeup artists work.

84
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,120
Let me tell you.

85
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,759
These people aren't just high schoolers.

86
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,279
They all went to proper universities.

87
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,519
They have professional training, you know?

88
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,439
Anyway, if you're interested in this,

89
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,120
Your mom and I will overcome all obstacles

90
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,480
to create the conditions for you.

91
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,120
But you have to take the college entrance exam.

92
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,879
You have to go to university, understand?

93
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,079
This kid.

94
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,800
What are you doing here?

95
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,839
Uh, we're friends of Director Liu.

96
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,720
Just here to look around.

97
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,560
Okay.

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,439
To learn.

99
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,480
Is this real or fake?

100
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,480
Just glued on.

101
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,920
It's done.

102
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,600
Eat up.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,279
Eat, take it.

104
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,600
Look, we went to see it today.

105
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,639
Those professional makeup artists, right?

106
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,720
Look at their work.

107
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,680
They use that makeup.

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,519
You'd have to learn some chemistry.

109
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,480
Right?

110
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,639
Look at how they...

111
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,399
...apply lines, draw eyebrows, it all takes precision.

112
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,120
You'd have to learn some art, right?

113
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,519
And say it's a modern drama.

114
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,959
If it were a period drama,

115
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,560
you'd have to learn some history.

116
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,920
And some geography, right?

117
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,079
Yeah, after seeing it, I'm not interested.

118
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,720
I also think that stuff...

119
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,279
...isn't that great.

120
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,199
Alright then.

121
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,839
Later on,

122
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,399
have your Uncle Qiu'er contact their school.

123
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,560
I'll take you to see the Finance College.

124
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,600
We'll check out their library,

125
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,560
dorms, cafeteria,

126
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,439
see what the campus is like,

127
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,319
how people date and stuff.

128
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,000
Stop with the hassle.

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,240
I go to watch people date?

130
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,319
Right? No.

131
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,639
If you still don't like it,

132
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,319
then we'll go where your second uncle works.

133
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,399
We'll go to the Central Business District.

134
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,879
See their high-end,

135
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,160
what their offices are like.

136
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,560
Stop with the hassle.

137
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,480
Wait, Dad, are you willing to listen

138
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,720
to my real thoughts?

139
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
Speak, speak, speak.

140
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,720
I've thought about it myself.

141
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,839
It's not that I'm saying

142
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,319
I absolutely must

143
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,079
not go to university.

144
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,879
Great, then let's just take the exam.

145
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,360
No, no, yes, yes, let me finish first.

146
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,079
Speak, speak, I'm willing to listen.

147
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,639
Go on.

148
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,480
Now everyone says

149
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,120
that kids must go to college.

150
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,680
Then what is the meaning of taking the college entrance exam?

151
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,399
Just like there are many things I can't figure out.

152
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,000
I can make money doing live streaming now.

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,920
But if it's just for the sake of making money,

154
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,600
then what is the meaning of my live streaming?

155
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
So in the end,

156
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,399
what is the meaning of making money?

157
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,600
I am only nineteen years old now.

158
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,039
I still have decades left to live.

159
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,200
Then for every single day that I live,

160
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,960
what is the meaning of it?

161
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,360
No, you... you...

162
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,759
You are concerned about my future.

163
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,320
Yes.

164
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,279
What about Uncle Qiu'er?

165
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,559
He's concerned about the house, right?

166
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,519
Second Uncle is just concerned about his career.

167
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,320
Teacher Mao is all about enrollment rates every day.

168
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
And the classmates are concerned about their scores.

169
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,559
It seems like everyone is just focused on this one thing,

170
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,720
running forward with their heads down.

171
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,840
Is this one thing the entirety of life?

172
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,960
Obviously not.

173
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,320
But what I see right now is,

174
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,080
everyone is living their lives just like ants.

175
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,799
So what is the meaning of life?

176
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,200
What are we pursuing?

177
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,360
I don't understand. I really don't.

178
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,559
This question is worth thinking about.

179
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,039
You, don't give me any of that talk about

180
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,799
what's meaningful and what's not.

181
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,480
Since talking nicely to you doesn't work,

182
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,320
then from now on,

183
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,679
you will listen to me.

184
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,960
All this messy stuff,

185
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,559
I'm confiscating it for now.

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,960
When you get into college later,

187
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,480
I'll give it back to you.

188
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,399
I've made you too comfortable in the past.

189
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,799
Take these headphones off.

190
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,480
Hand them over.

191
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,759
Don't give me this silent protest.

192
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,360
So many revolutionary martyrs,

193
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,000
in extremely arduous environments,

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,399
created great causes.

195
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,879
You are far from that.

196
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,919
Didn't you say to strike a balance between work and rest?

197
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,200
Don't join in the fuss.

198
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,919
Get ready to perm my hair.

199
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,639
I'm getting it ready for you.

200
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,120
The tone you use with our son from now on,

201
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,360
can't it be a bit gentler?

202
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,080
Is he your biological son or not?

203
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,720
I'm telling you, being soft doesn't work.

204
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,840
We have to be tough.

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,120
I just can't stand his...

206
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,039
look at him, just drifting along day after day.

207
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,559
When I was learning to roast ducks back in the day,

208
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,440
how much hardship did I endure?

209
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
How many beatings did I take? Right?

210
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,039
They are happy enough now.

211
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,679
Stop always talking about "back in the day."

212
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,600
That was ages ago.

213
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Your son is going through a rebellious phase now.

214
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,039
Don't make things worse.

215
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,559
Rebel? Let's see if he dares to rebel.

216
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,480
Where can he rebel to?

217
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,399
After all, he is our biological son, right?

218
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
What are you afraid of?

219
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,000
I just don't believe it.

220
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,240
I've accompanied him growing up all this time.

221
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,399
I'll grit my teeth and accompany him for another two years.

222
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,759
I don't believe I can't get him into college.

223
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,679
Accompany, accompany, accompany.

224
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,240
Just wait a moment.

225
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,440
You... go in and see what he's doing.

226
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,320
Fix this up.

227
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,240
Your coffee.

228
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,799
Thank you.

229
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,200
A coffee shop with so many books.

230
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,799
It's a place for studying.

231
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,919
Hello sir, what would you like?

232
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,360
I heard there's a tutoring class here, right?

233
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,399
No, there isn't.

234
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
No? But this is the address.

235
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,759
However, there is an interest class.

236
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,120
What kind of interest class?

237
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,480
It's just that our boss,

238
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,600
learned some coffee techniques abroad,

239
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,080
and often shares them with interested people.

240
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,440
I can see that you, Mr. Wang, love drinking coffee.

241
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,440
Right?

242
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
You love it, don't you?

243
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:31,799
Yes.

244
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,679
I... I... I do love drinking coffee.

245
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,960
I... if I don't drink coffee,

246
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,919
I can't even sleep.

247
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:37,759
That's great.

248
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,879
Then you can sign up for

249
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,960
a prepaid membership card for our shop.

250
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,879
There are options for 8,000, 10,000, and 20,000.

251
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,120
After getting the card,

252
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
when you buy coffee at our shop,

253
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,279
you will get a corresponding discount.

254
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,200
Well, no...

255
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,360
Besides teaching about coffee here,

256
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,759
don't you also teach something else?

257
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Mr. Wang,

258
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,159
here with us,

259
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,639
you can learn the best coffee techniques.

260
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,679
Alright, take a look at the form.

261
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,799
What would you like to study?

262
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,120
Just check the boxes.

263
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,360
Right here, see?

264
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,759
This sour mocha is Chinese, right?

265
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,720
We have to check this one.

266
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,080
Mexican coffee is math.

267
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,159
Colombian coffee is foreign language.

268
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,039
Arabica coffee, this is politics.

269
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,039
We'll skip art, music, and dance.

270
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,879
Then... then just these subjects.

271
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,960
Mr. Wang.

272
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,720
Our interest class teachers

273
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,840
are all top-tier in the industry.

274
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,159
The teachers for small and large classes are also different.

275
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,159
You know what I mean?

276
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,080
I understand.

277
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,600
I get it.

278
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,799
For my son.

279
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,240
I'll transfer it to you.

280
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,799
Okay.

281
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:00,960
Did it go through?

282
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,759
It's here.

283
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,960
Um, can we get an invoice?

284
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,480
An invoice?

285
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,360
Who's in charge here?

286
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,240
Hello, can I help you?

287
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,720
We've received reports from the public

288
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,039
that you're using this cafe

289
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,120
to conduct paid tutoring under the guise of membership.

290
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,240
We'd like to verify this.

291
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,519
Please come with us now.

292
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Wait, miss.

293
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
I just paid the money!

294
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,720
If he had said anything else,

295
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,519
I might have believed him.

296
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,799
But leading with buying a house?

297
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,519
Is that something a normal person would do?

298
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,320
Tell me.

299
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,879
How can he not be ashamed?

300
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,399
Qiu'er, here's what you do.

301
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,679
If he says he'll buy you a house,

302
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,279
you actually take him to look.

303
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,159
See how he

304
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,679
talks his way out of it then.

305
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,120
Right, hear what he says.

306
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,279
Play along with his scheme.

307
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,759
I don't have time for this. I want to sleep.

308
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,840
Coming!

309
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,480
Weiguo.

310
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Well, look at that.

311
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,360
Morning, Brother Dayang.

312
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,279
See, there's a connection now, see?

313
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Are you ready?

314
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,960
Ready for what? What's up?

315
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,799
To go see a house.

316
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,279
Weiguo.

317
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,799
If you keep joking about the same thing,

318
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,519
it stops being funny.

319
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,960
Who's joking about something this boring?

320
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,159
The real estate agent is here.

321
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,000
Xiao Hu.

322
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,159
Hu Wan, from Chenghe Real Estate.

323
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:18,919
Hello.

324
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,399
Hu, as in the character for 'moon'.

325
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,039
They don't need one.

326
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,679
Just for reference, we're all friends.

327
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,159
Here you go, brother.

328
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,279
No, no, no need.

329
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,679
We'll wait outside. Hurry up.

330
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,080
Weiguo.

331
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:29,799
You see, my lottery shop is a bit cramped.

332
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,039
Given our friendship,

333
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,480
you should find me a bigger place.

334
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,919
No... Huh, what does this mean?

335
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,840
This is... he's serious.

336
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,440
You should take him seriously too. Go on.

337
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,360
Go, go, go.

338
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:49,600
Alright then.

339
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll go scout ahead.

340
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,799
I'm off, brother.

341
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,440
Take it easy.

342
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,879
Bye, Brother Dayang.

343
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:53,519
Bye, bye.

344
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,320
What's going on here?

345
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,799
He's not terminally ill,

346
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,039
and suddenly feeling charitable before he dies, is he?

347
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,000
If he really is terminally ill,

348
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,399
he should go find a place to die.

349
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,320
Don't cause trouble for me here.

350
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,399
What's wrong? Family trouble again?

351
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,399
If I tell you, you'll just go blabbering everywhere.

352
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,879
I'm just concerned about you, buddy.

353
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,360
You're really buying me a house?

354
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,279
I thought you were joking.

355
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,039
Do you know Beijing housing prices?

356
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,000
They're not cheap.

357
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,720
Maybe buy somewhere farther out.

358
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,120
But it can't be too far from the hospital.

359
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
You know about my dad's illness.

360
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,440
The house isn't a free gift.

361
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,519
There are conditions.

362
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,039
I want you to take care of Auntie in her old age.

363
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,320
That's no problem.

364
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,039
Besides,

365
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,360
there's also Xiaofangzi and her husband.

366
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,279
Let me tell you something.

367
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,639
I don't trust that Tang Zhixin.

368
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,919
You're being too judgmental.

369
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,240
No matter what, she's her own daughter, he's her own son-in-law.

370
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,159
They wouldn't just abandon their own mother.

371
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,039
Taking care of Auntie is our duty.

372
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,240
If I took your house for that,

373
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,360
people would laugh at me.

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,639
Don't talk to me about duty.

375
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,080
I only believe in equivalent exchange.

376
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,799
When the house is handed over,

377
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,120
I'll sign a contract with you.

378
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
If Auntie suffers any mistreatment,

379
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,839
I'll take the house back immediately.

380
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,160
Second, do you know why I'm giving it to you

381
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,200
and not someone else?

382
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,880
Because you...

383
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,799
are the most cowardly and greedy.

384
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,119
A coward, even with bad intentions,

385
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,119
can't commit any great evil.

386
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,799
A greedy person cares about gains and losses.

387
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,079
So entrusting the house to you

388
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,200
makes me feel most at ease.

389
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Third, I'm telling you,

390
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,160
you must be careful of that Tang Zhixin.

391
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,200
When Auntie was bedridden,

392
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,319
the second time he met me,

393
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,480
he wanted to talk business.

394
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,759
It shows he values profit.

395
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,960
And he doesn't know how to hide it.

396
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,920
So in the future, any benefits

397
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,960
must absolutely not go to him.

398
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,400
Even if Auntie begs you. Understand?

399
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,279
Let's go.

400
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,440
Wait, were you complimenting or insulting me just now?

401
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,759
Can I ask you something?

402
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,920
How much are you actually planning to pay?

403
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,160
I'm really nervous about this.

404
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,119
Qiu'er.

405
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,680
I want to confirm something with you.

406
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,359
After I buy you the house,

407
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,920
will your urgent problems be solved?

408
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,000
Not exactly.

409
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,440
I want a promotion and a raise.

410
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,640
My dad needs medical treatment.

411
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,839
My mom wants to buy a nice burial plot.

412
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,000
My wife wants to have a baby.

413
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,640
That's a lot of problems.

414
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,680
There's more.

415
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,000
But the top priority, ultimately, is the house.

416
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,960
Alright then.

417
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,079
After we solve your problem first,

418
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,039
then we'll talk about Wang Chunsheng and Li Lianbao.

419
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,480
Help me pass a message to them.

420
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,759
Tell them if they have any conditions,

421
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,759
they can bring them to me.

422
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:21,720
I understand, Weiguo.

423
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,680
You're just being shy.

424
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,720
You didn't just come back for Auntie.

425
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,599
You came back for us too.

426
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,559
You genuinely want to reconcile with us.

427
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,079
Right?

428
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,799
Don't get me wrong, I don't want to make up with you.

429
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,000
I just want to stay with Auntie a bit longer.

430
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,559
As for Wang Chunsheng and Li Lianbao,

431
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,799
I just want to confirm if they're trustworthy.

432
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,480
What do you mean, trustworthy?

433
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,400
We grew up together, we're brothers.

434
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
How could we not be trustworthy?

435
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,240
Just think about that fight Big Brother got into as a kid...

436
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,200
Alright, enough joking around.

437
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:48,839
Weiguo.

438
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,440
If you don't want to hear about the past,

439
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,559
I won't bring it up.

440
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,920
I just hope us brothers

441
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,240
can sit down and have a proper talk.

442
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,519
Let bygones be bygones.

443
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,880
Okay?

444
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,200
Take Big Brother now, for instance.

445
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,960
Actually, actually...

446
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,640
He's mainly worried about his kid.

447
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,759
For his son, Feifei,

448
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:10,960
he'd spare no expense.

449
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,119
Feifei.

450
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,720
Yeah, his son.

451
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,680
I know.

452
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,880
Feifei.

453
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,759
Weiguo.

454
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,640
Weiguo.

455
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,720
Don't be fooled by how Big Brother always scowls

456
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,039
and glares at Feifei.

457
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,079
Anyone home?

458
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,279
Actually, Feifei is the apple of his eye.

459
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,319
Feifei had a serious illness as a child.

460
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,839
Anyone home?

461
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,480
He was out of school for a whole year.

462
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
So he's a bit older than kids his age.

463
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,000
And because of that,

464
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,759
Big Brother feels even more pressure.

465
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,960
What's the big deal?

466
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,200
Sorry about that.

467
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,319
That's basically how it is with Big Brother.

468
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,319
What about Lianbao?

469
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,640
His wife ran off with a foreigner.

470
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,240
The kid went with the mom.

471
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,079
I heard that foreigner runs a big international fund.

472
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,240
He's loaded.

473
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,759
Other than that,

474
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,359
he doesn't seem to have any worries.

475
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,680
Old Chen, we're old friends.

476
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
What do you mean by this?

477
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,839
Just say what's on your mind.

478
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,880
Yuanyuan, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

479
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,640
Daddy's work is just too busy.

480
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,920
Look, so many people are fighting

481
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,400
to work with Daddy.

482
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,119
Just wait a few more years for me.

483
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,240
Wait until Daddy's work,

484
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,160
this career, gets bigger and bigger.

485
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,680
I'll leave it all to you, okay?

486
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,480
Daddy's the best!

487
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
As for Second Brother,

488
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,079
Where else do you want to go play?

489
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:45,839
he's still the same.

490
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,680
Sharp tongue, soft heart.

491
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,880
But if he actually gets gentle,

492
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,440
it's actually a bit scary.

493
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,759
Just between you and me,

494
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,359
that feeling

495
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,400
is a bit like

496
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,920
an African baboon trying to meow.

497
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,839
You just don't know what's gotten into him.

498
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,240
Everything feels off.

499
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,799
Tom.

500
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,319
Yuanyuan, come down now.

501
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,519
Jenny.

502
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,759
You gave her something cold to eat, didn't you?

503
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:20,599
Why don't you just install

504
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,680
a camera on her?

505
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,559
Yuanyuan, how could you forget this?

506
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,000
Bye, Daddy.

507
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:28,720
Bye.

508
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,839
We're going home now.

509
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,200
Let's go.

510
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,640
Go.

511
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,319
Did you drink any water?

512
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,759
Your water bottle is still full.

513
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,759
I just filled it.

514
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,119
Really?

515
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,440
Are you tired?

516
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
I made you some Portuguese egg tarts.

517
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,079
I made them myself.

518
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:44,720
Really.

519
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
Yes, yes, yes.

520
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,759
Hurry up and go inside.

521
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,119
Here, this way.

522
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,519
It looks nice from the outside.

523
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,799
Why is it still like this inside?

524
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,559
Bro.

525
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,079
It's much better than before now.

526
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,519
During the coal-to-electricity conversion, it wasn't this clean.

527
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,839
Look at the road now, how wide it is.

528
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,200
It's here, Bro, over here.

529
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,039
Look, right here.

530
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,359
Bro, look.

531
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,920
Retro courtyard, private garden.

532
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,799
In the bustling city, yet away from the noise.

533
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,440
This house is the king of value for money.

534
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,839
Just a bit small.

535
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,200
Weiguo.

536
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:03,960
You...

537
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,079
My house outside the Fifth Ring is big,

538
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,839
and the area is convenient.

539
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,519
But I always feel something's off.

540
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,200
Later, I figured it out.

541
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,839
If I want some fried liver and baozi,

542
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,920
I have to come back here to buy it.

543
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,200
That place doesn't have this flavor.

544
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:20,680
So, how about we consider this as one of our options?

545
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,720
What do you think?

546
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,119
Okay, it's alright, it's alright.

547
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,400
Forget it, let's not look anymore.

548
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
We're not looking anymore?

549
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,799
Can't you see how crude this is?

550
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:30,680
Alright then.

551
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,759
Take us to see

552
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,079
a house with better conditions.

553
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,640
Bro, a place with better conditions

554
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,759
costs more, the value isn't good.

555
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,759
I never look at value for money when I buy things.

556
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,279
Money...

557
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,200
should be spent on things that aren't a good deal.

558
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,480
That's what makes it money, understand?

559
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,680
Look at this, it's like a maze.

560
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,519
You call this value for money?

561
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,079
Understood, bro. I'll go make a call.

562
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,720
Get up, get up now.

563
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,559
Get up.

564
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:16,880
Wang Fei.

565
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,319
Hurry up and get out of bed.

566
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,400
It's only five o'clock, even the birds aren't up.

567
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,240
You get up for me, hurry, get up.

568
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,920
Mom!

569
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
Don't call your mom.

570
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,559
Your mom can't handle this matter.

571
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,079
Starting today,

572
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,680
we both get up at five o'clock.

573
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,359
I'll accompany you, we'll memorize vocabulary.

574
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,319
Let me tell you,

575
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,160
the early bird catches the worm.

576
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,759
While others are resting,

577
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:37,319
is the best time for you to catch up, you know?

578
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,559
Get out of bed and put your shoes on, quick.

579
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,920
Fine, right away, right away.

580
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:44,400
Yeah, the early worm gets eaten by the bird.

581
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:45,920
Hurry up.

582
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,640
Bored, bored.

583
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,880
B O R E D.

584
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,119
Bored, bored.

585
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,240
Bird, right? That means little bird, doesn't it?

586
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,720
What little bird?

587
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,319
Bored.

588
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,200
Don't try to fool me.

589
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,160
I've learned a fair bit of English here and there.

590
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,839
Bird, bird.

591
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,160
B I R D.

592
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,799
Bored. I'm not lying, look.

593
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,240
Bored.

594
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,960
That's me.

595
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,640
Don't have so much...

596
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,000
Don't have so much nonsense.

597
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,839
Bored.

598
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,200
B O R E D.

599
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,319
Bored, bored.

600
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:39,359
Bored, bored, bored.

601
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,759
B O R E D.

602
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:41,960
Bored.

603
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,079
Bored.

604
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,160
Bored.

605
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,920
Dull, dull, dull.

606
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,920
Dull, dull, dull.

607
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,920
Dull, dull, dull.

608
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,400
Dull, dull.

609
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,119
Alright, Martin.

610
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,680
The money is yours.

611
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,000
I respect your choice.

612
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,519
When you're back in New York, let's have a couple of drinks.

613
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:17,640
Uncle Tong.

614
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,359
Kid, come to my room quickly.

615
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:21,680
Give me some feedback on my script. Come on.

616
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,359
That...

617
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,480
Story about some CEO or something?

618
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,559
Yeah.

619
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,000
I thought you'd be perfect to ask, I'm stuck here.

620
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,599
Let's go, come on, hurry up.

621
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,160
I'm stuck here.

622
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,839
Is it appropriate?

623
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,279
Can't really figure this out.

624
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,839
Actually, the story itself isn't too bad.

625
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,799
It's just not very realistic.

626
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,960
Corporate espionage, daily cash burning.

627
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,319
Being a CEO isn't that easy either.

628
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,400
But as for Uncle Tong...

629
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,000
He's been an artsy type for seventy years.

630
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,359
Optimistic his whole life.

631
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,880
It's understandable.

632
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,079
Besides,

633
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,599
he's so old now.

634
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,519
Who can possibly change him?

635
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,720
Actually, there is someone.

636
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,359
The client.

637
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,000
Uncle Tong.

638
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,680
Where's the new episode script you mentioned?

639
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,559
Is this it?

640
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,519
Waiting for someone.

641
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,920
Waiting for who?

642
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,799
Grandpa Tong

643
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,759
Speak of the devil

644
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,039
Quick, have a seat. Sit, sit, sit.

645
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,759
Sit, sit.

646
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:26,359
Here, have some tea. Tea.

647
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,839
Thank you, Uncle Tong.

648
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,599
Here's the thing.

649
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,519
My client...

650
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:35,559
wants me to add...

651
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,079
a more sophisticated romance subplot for the male lead.

652
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,079
I thought about it, and you two...

653
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,839
just came back from abroad.

654
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,599
Both are very sophisticated.

655
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,079
So, how about it? Help me brainstorm.

656
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,720
Grandpa Tong, he looks like a real ladies' man.

657
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,279
He definitely knows...

658
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,519
how to write that romance plot.

659
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:56,359
Yeah.

660
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,480
I'm sure I can't write it.

661
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,559
Where are you going? Sit, sit, sit.

662
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,599
You just got here and you're already leaving?

663
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,559
Take a look at the script.

664
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,799
Today...

665
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,000
I need to record some audio.

666
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,039
Sorry about this.

667
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,759
Apologies, apologies.

668
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,720
Here's my design.

669
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,920
A middle-aged man worth over a hundred million...

670
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,920
and an inexperienced female college student.

671
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,440
The two meet by chance during a trip.

672
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,559
It's love at first sight.

673
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,599
What do you think?

674
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,839
This plot point is sophisticated enough, right?

675
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,079
I think it's quite sophisticated.

676
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,279
Just write it like that, Uncle Tong.

677
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:51,039
Wait, wait, wait. Here's the problem.

678
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,799
Writing this romance plot is easy.

679
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,720
The key is these two people...

680
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,279
In their own familiar lives...

681
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,359
their age, status, social circles...

682
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:05,000
The gap is just too, too big.

683
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,000
How do you...

684
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,440
how do you move this romance forward?

685
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,000
Help me figure it out.

686
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,200
Figure it out.

687
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,599
Middle-aged man.

688
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,000
A chance encounter on a trip.

689
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:20,240
In an idol drama, it's a story.

690
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,960
But in real life...

691
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,200
it's an accident.

692
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,119
Is that so?

693
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,319
What if the college girl chases the middle-aged man?

694
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:30,079
The audience will definitely call her a gold digger.

695
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:31,799
What if it's the middle-aged man...

696
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,400
chasing the college girl?

697
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,519
Some people would probably love to watch that.

698
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,839
But not me.

699
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,759
Well said, well said. Keep going.

700
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:39,400
That's it.

701
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,920
I was just talking casually, Grandpa Tong.

702
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:43,319
Say more, I love hearing it.

703
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,039
Go on.

704
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,319
I think that girl probably...

705
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,359
wouldn't like that guy either.

706
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,640
After all, that middle-aged man...

707
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
is also quite old.

708
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,359
And their statuses don't match.

709
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,240
I don't think the story really works, right?

710
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,640
What do you think?

711
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,200
I think so.

712
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,480
What I just said to Grandpa Tong...

713
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,039
was only about the script.

714
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,079
It has nothing to do with me personally.

715
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,440
Because I don't believe in love.

716
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,039
Same here.

717
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:43,720
Good.

718
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,920
Then let's consider it settled from now on.

719
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,000
I'll just consider you another uncle.

720
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:49,960
Whatever.

721
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:51,960
I have another question.

722
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,599
Since you're not short on money...

723
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,000
and you don't like the people in the *hutong*...

724
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,799
why do you insist on squeezing in here?

725
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,799
Don't worry.

726
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,079
I won't be staying much longer.

727
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,480
Right.

728
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,000
We actually met a long time ago.

729
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,279
One year ago.

730
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,599
Back then...

731
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,960
I never imagined he'd become my Uncle Ma.

732
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,039
A martini, please.

733
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:21,880
Thank you.

734
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,720
Chinese?

735
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,000
Chinese.

736
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,079
You were here yesterday too.

737
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:52,960
Yes.

738
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,119
What a coincidence, running into you again.

739
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,200
Buy me a drink.

740
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,359
One whiskey.

741
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,640
Why are you always alone?

742
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,000
Am I?

743
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,480
Yeah. You're new here, right?

744
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,559
As a longtime local, let me give you some advice.

745
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,960
This bar isn't the easiest place to make friends.

746
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,480
Really.

747
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,279
The cheesy script of a middle-aged man and a college girl.

748
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,960
I guessed about eighty percent of it right.

749
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,119
But with our character settings...

750
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,000
I bet even Grandpa Tong wouldn't dare write it.

751
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,839
Uncle Wang.

752
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,839
Tongtong, you're back just in time.

753
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,400
Say hello to your Uncle Ma.

754
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:31,160
My cousin's daughter, Jin Tong.

755
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:34,160
She'll be staying long-term at Courtyard 36 from now on.

756
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,440
She might cause some disturbance.

757
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:36,519
Please be understanding.

758
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,279
Hello. I've heard so much about you.

759
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,480
Seeing you is better than just hearing about you.

760
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:48,440
Baofang Hutong is truly a magical place.

761
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,720
Letting us reunite with new roles.

762
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,279
As for why Uncle Ma insists on squeezing in here...

763
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,880
it's definitely not because of me.

764
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,759
However...

765
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,359
I am a bit curious about the reason.

766
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,519
Jin Tong asked me...

767
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,800
why I'm squeezing in here.

768
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,159
I don't know.

769
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,440
Even less do I know...

770
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,920
how to explain this thing between her and me...

771
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,639
to Lianbao and the others.

772
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,159
Looking at it this way...

773
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,920
coming back was really a mistake.

774
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,639
Are you kidding me?

775
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,920
Seriously, Lianbao.

776
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,320
We were all there.

777
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,599
Qiu'er.

778
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,199
Use your head and think carefully.

779
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,239
Why would he just give you a house for no reason?

780
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,679
He said it's so I can take care of Auntie.

781
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,159
Xiao Fangzi and her husband are taking care of Auntie.

782
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,280
He should buy them a house too then.

783
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,440
Right, it doesn't make sense.

784
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,519
This whole thing is fishy.

785
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,719
No, Weiguo said he feels...

786
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,159
...that Tang Zhixin seems a bit untrustworthy.

787
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:52,920
That's not it.

788
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,719
How many times has he even met the guy?

789
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,639
And he already doesn't trust him?

790
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,760
Isn't this clearly...

791
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,400
...the kind of talk online scammers use?

792
00:34:59,079 --> 00:34:59,840
As for me...

793
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,320
...I've already sent someone to check him out.

794
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,519
There's definitely a scheme here.

795
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,400
I think...

796
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,159
...he probably has his eye on our Old Wang's Peng Le Xuan.

797
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,239
Big brother.

798
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,400
Could he be after Auntie's inheritance?

799
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,159
That's unlikely.

800
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,519
He's so rich from America.

801
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,840
Unlikely, very unlikely.

802
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,960
Scammers always package themselves well.

803
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,519
Who knows if his money is real or fake?

804
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,519
Lianbao is right.

805
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:23,239
These rich people...

806
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,760
...the richer they are, the craftier and more calculating.

807
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,360
Don't even mention an old neighbor unseen for twenty years.

808
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,960
Even blood brothers...

809
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,039
...don't just drop a house on you right away.

810
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,519
He must have never met truly rich people.

811
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,760
He's just acting based on his own imagination...

812
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,199
...playing the part of a generous man.

813
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,519
Little did he know he'd run into our Lianbao.

814
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,039
Lianbao is a truly rich man.

815
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,960
He saw right through his flaws.

816
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,280
Me, I wouldn't call myself rich.

817
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,199
You're being modest.

818
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,000
But...

819
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,880
...I deal with rich people a lot.

820
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,199
He is definitely not...

821
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,039
The letter's here!

822
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,679
I'll open it, you see for yourselves.

823
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,480
Look.

824
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,880
Big brother, you look too.

825
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,960
You'd better take a look yourself first.

826
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,199
I told you Weiguo definitely wouldn't lie to me.

827
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:13,719
I'm off to work.

828
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,719
Qiu'er!

829
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,280
Qiu'er really hit the jackpot this time.

830
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,559
Big brother.

831
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,480
I think we should go with him.

832
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:25,840
Go where?

833
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:28,400
We can't let Ma Weiguo lead Qiu'er astray again.

834
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,000
Big brother.

835
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,159
Morning.

836
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,639
Weiguo.

837
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,079
Big brother and second brother said...

838
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,079
...to come along and take a look.

839
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,119
Help give some advice.

840
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,519
Qiu'er is too honest.

841
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:57,000
We're afraid he'll get tricked.

842
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,320
Going with him, no objections, right?

843
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,079
No objections.

844
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,079
Let's go. That Xiao Hu is waiting there.

845
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,559
No need. I have plenty of connections here.

846
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,760
All good properties.

847
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,760
This is the place?

848
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,719
Yes, yes, right here.

849
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,239
This... this place doesn't look cheap.

850
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,719
This is peanuts for Boss Ma.

851
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,639
Right, Boss Ma?

852
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,599
Then let Qiu'er see if she likes it first.

853
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,360
What a show-off.

854
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,039
Where are you going?

855
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,880
What are you two doing?

856
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,079
Isn't he trying to buy you off?

857
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,360
Then I'll test just how capable he really is.

858
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,400
If he's all talk and no action,

859
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,039
I'll make him

860
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,559
too ashamed to stay in Baofang Hutong.

861
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,559
Can you two

862
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,360
not involve innocent bystanders?

863
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,199
Listen up.

864
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,000
Keep your knees locked straight.

865
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,400
Don't just kneel the moment someone

866
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,239
promises to buy you a house.

867
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,400
That's pathetic.

868
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
Kneel for one house? Don't be ridiculous.

869
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,960
I'd kneel for a jianbing pancake.

870
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,360
Stop joking around with me, will you?

871
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,880
Look at you two.

872
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,000
You, with the family restaurant, are the "win-by-doing-nothing" type.

873
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,679
What's the "win-by-doing-nothing" type?

874
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,559
And you, a company executive,

875
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,719
are the "996 blessing" type.

876
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,199
Can you possibly understand

877
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,440
the helplessness and bitterness of living paycheck to paycheck?

878
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Manager Li, look.

879
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,079
This house of ours

880
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:31,639
was designed by a famous Nordic designer.

881
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,719
You see, the overall style

882
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,599
is modern.

883
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,440
It incorporates minimalist elements.

884
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,679
You can look at our furniture;

885
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,760
it's all internationally renowned brands.

886
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,440
Five... five burners!

887
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,199
I could cook dumplings in five pots!

888
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,119
One dumpling per pot, no flavor mixing!

889
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,239
This is fun.

890
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:49,239
Manager Li, please, this way, this way.

891
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,239
Our master bedroom here

892
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,000
has excellent natural light.

893
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:56,119
Imagine waking up, having a coffee,

894
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,519
then opening the window for a gentle breeze.

895
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,360
Careful!

896
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,840
How pleasant, right?

897
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,599
Don't act like you've never seen anything nice.

898
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,440
Truly north-south through ventilation, excellent light.

899
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,280
This property of ours

900
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,320
is highly sought-after in the capital.

901
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,119
It's perfect for high-income individuals like you.

902
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,719
I'm not the one buying it.

903
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,599
It's perfect for...

904
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,559
I'm not buying it either.

905
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,800
It's perfect for your kind of...

906
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,960
Miss, he's buying it for her.

907
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,039
What do you mean?

908
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,199
I'm standing right here in the middle,

909
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,320
and you just skip over me?

910
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,480
Stop fooling around.

911
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
Let me ask you.

912
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,400
Are you satisfied with this house?

913
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,119
It's pretty good.

914
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,119
Let me ask you again.

915
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,960
Are you satisfied?

916
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,280
It's okay.

917
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,360
Did you hear that, Boss Ma?

918
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,920
Qiu'er is very satisfied.

919
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,320
It's just a little pricey.

920
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,840
That's not a problem for you, right?

921
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,599
Not expensive.

922
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,880
This is much cheaper

923
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,559
than the courtyard house I showed Qiu'er yesterday.

924
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,480
A lot cheaper.

925
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:01,440
Qiu'er,

926
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,519
since you like it, let's pay.

927
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,639
Wait.

928
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,719
You said this is two bedrooms, one living room, right?

929
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,440
I think it's a bit small.

930
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,320
Right, big brother?

931
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,559
This is too small.

932
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:17,519
Do you have anything bigger? This won't do.

933
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,719
Actually, I think this house...

934
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,480
Don't think about it.

935
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,639
Let's go, let's go, look at something else.

936
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:23,559
Sir, take another look.

937
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,320
We also have three-bedroom, one-living-room units.

938
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,320
Come, this way please, watch your step.

939
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,840
Alright.

940
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,800
Our surrounding

941
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,719
living facilities and commercial amenities

942
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,840
are extremely comprehensive.

943
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,039
And it includes

944
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,320
top schools from kindergarten through high school.

945
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,679
When you have children in the future,

946
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,440
getting them to and from school

947
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,840
will be very convenient.

948
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
To own a townhouse

949
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,159
in a location like this

950
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:43,199
is truly a rare opportunity.

951
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,199
Come, this way please.

952
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,920
Do I even have the fate to live in a villa?

953
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,800
Let me tell you something.

954
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
Don't be so spineless.

955
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,159
Keep your knees locked straight.

956
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,000
Don't you dare kneel.

957
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:51,440
Boss Ma,

958
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,400
don't think it's too expensive.

959
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,000
This is all for Qiu'er's sake.

960
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,400
Qiu'er,

961
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,559
just see if you like it.

962
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,039
If you like it, we'll sign the contract.

963
00:40:58,559 --> 00:40:59,679
Really?

964
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,559
Then let's sit inside.

965
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,679
I'll go prepare the documents now.

966
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:02,320
No, no, no.

967
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,199
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

968
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,800
Looking at it this way,

969
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,320
I still feel it's lacking something.

970
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,039
How do I remember

971
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,440
Uncle Tong likes living in that hutong?

972
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,320
Right, big brother?

973
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
What?

974
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:14,519
It's a villa!

975
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:15,679
My dad's opinion isn't important.

976
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,800
Who says it's not important?

977
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,320
Filial piety, filial piety. What does it mean?

978
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,679
Filial piety means

979
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:23,039
you have to follow the elder's wishes, right?

980
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:23,960
Never heard of that.

981
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,199
Let's go, let's go, let's look at something else.

982
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,360
What? What?

983
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,760
What do you mean look at something else?

984
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,480
I... the mood was built up to this point, big brother!

985
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
This won't do, won't do.

986
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,320
This still isn't good enough?

987
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,840
It's fine.

988
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,320
I'll take you to see more.

989
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:32,800
Don't mind them.

990
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,280
Where to?

991
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,800
Sorry about that.

992
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,559
Come with me.

993
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,199
Where to?

994
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,079
Go where?
