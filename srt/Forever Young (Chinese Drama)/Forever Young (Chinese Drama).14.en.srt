1
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,120
What's the meaning of this group chat?

2
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,959
As the Chairman,

3
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,599
I feel I need to strengthen

4
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,040
the company's structure.

5
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:03,959
Wait,

6
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,120
you're right here with me.

7
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,319
If you have something to say, just say it directly.

8
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,400
No, from now on,

9
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,159
all matters in our company, big or small,

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,680
should go through a meeting.

11
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,759
Then everyone votes by a show of hands.

12
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,639
Finally,

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,919
we must wait for the official notice in this group chat.

14
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,319
For instance, cleaning the shop tomorrow.

15
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,319
You go to the market to buy two rags.

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,599
This is a company public affair.

17
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,080
We need to discuss it first.

18
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,400
Then vote by a show of hands.

19
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,680
Finally,

20
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,960
wait for the official notice in this group chat.

21
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,680
Take your motorcycle.

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
The shop is being renovated now.

23
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,280
Don't let it get scratched or bumped.

24
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,000
Do you want to move it somewhere else?

25
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,360
Wait for the official notice in this group chat.

26
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,280
Hold on, Jing.

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,719
What are you doing?

28
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,960
What are we eating tonight?

29
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,719
Wait for the group chat notice.

30
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,680
No, I'm being serious with you.

31
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,800
Are *you* being serious right now?

32
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,039
Me? How am I not being serious?

33
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,240
Uncle Zhang.

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,719
Big Brother.

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,199
Which talent agency did you sign with?

36
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,080
Your Big Brother is now putting on airs

37
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,759
and acting high and mighty.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,560
Can you be serious for once?

39
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,840
Chairman Wang, Chairman Wang, I was wrong.

40
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,759
Tongtong, what are you...

41
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,840
My photography exhibition's theme is Beijing's transformation.

42
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
So I'm here today

43
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,080
to specifically document

44
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,280
Peng Le Xuan's developmental journey.

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,599
And incidentally, take the meeting minutes.

46
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,319
Right.

47
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,240
We even hired a secretary today.

48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,000
Of course.

49
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,360
Manager Li.

50
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,560
No, no, no.

51
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,719
Just call me Second Brother.

52
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,800
It makes me feel at ease.

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Come on, we should be formal when it's called for.

54
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,680
Right, Qiu'er?

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,960
Why am I "Qiu'er" now?

56
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,120
Don't cause trouble.

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,599
Then what, should I call you Manager Qiu'er?

58
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,120
No, no, I don't deserve that.

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,600
Everyone is here.

60
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,399
Let's officially start the meeting now.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,319
First agenda item:

62
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,680
The shop's renovation.

63
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,079
This plan...

64
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,720
Yes, this very plan...

65
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,120
is actually, in my mind,

66
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,560
the most ideal plan.

67
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes, yes, yes.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,759
But...

69
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,839
Here, we...

70
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,199
are just missing a mountain.

71
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,160
So, Tong Tong, find that...

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,279
Can you be serious, please?

73
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,519
Don't laugh. What's so funny?

74
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,839
So, Tong Tong, that...

75
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,199
bring out our less-than-ideal,

76
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,439
but more feasible plan.

77
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay.

78
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,959
Recently, I've been studying

79
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,160
the decor of all Beijing's time-honored brands.

80
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,759
And then I believe

81
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,319
this type of plan is more suitable for Peng Le Xuan.

82
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Firstly,

83
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,439
it's spacious and bright.

84
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,959
Furthermore, it balances modern style

85
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,000
with traditional elements.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,879
Look, it's like this.

87
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,560
Also, it's both high-end and classy,

88
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,279
while at the same time,

89
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,759
having a strong local, common touch.

90
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,199
Write down 'common touch'.

91
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,720
Good.

92
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,120
Big Bro... I mean, Chairman.

93
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,959
I think that's too down-to-earth.

94
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,319
No, what do you mean?

95
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,639
Our Peng Le Xuan is right in this alley.

96
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,879
Shouldn't it take a folksy, approachable route?

97
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,439
No, I think...

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,639
since our Peng Le Xuan is upgrading,

99
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,959
then some viewpoints must change.

100
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,439
No matter how much changes,

101
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,439
we cannot lose Peng Le Xuan's essence.

102
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,160
You know? Write 'essence' clearly.

103
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,519
Don't laugh.

104
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,519
Remember this clearly.

105
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,759
What if, in the future, our Peng Le Xuan

106
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,759
has hundreds of chain stores?

107
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,720
This flagship store...

108
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,199
would have to open a museum.

109
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,199
Meeting minutes are very important.

110
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,759
Yes, we won't lose our essence.

111
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,439
But I feel that...

112
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,959
What do you feel? What do you feel?

113
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,439
Weren't you disagreeing?

114
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,680
If you disagree,

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,560
that's fine.

116
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,120
Then let's follow democratic principles.

117
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,199
Let's have a show-of-hands vote, okay?

118
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:32,519
Good.

119
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,879
Fine, I agree to that. Let's do it.

120
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,199
Good, I'll tally the votes.

121
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,959
Those who agree with my view, raise your hands.

122
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,720
Li Jing, you're betraying me, aren't you?

123
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,519
Is it as serious as betrayal?

124
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,560
Did I find a toy boy or have an affair?

125
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,319
Professional matters should be left to professionals.

126
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,920
Qiu'er.

127
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,879
You... this, this...

128
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,560
Qiu'er.

129
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,720
Raise it.

130
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,519
Come on.

131
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,319
Now, those who agree with my view, please raise your hands.

132
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:07,959
Good.

133
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,639
No, you... this...

134
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,319
Two to two, a tie.

135
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,959
Is it just because I didn't reimburse you?

136
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,000
Is it worth it?

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,439
Second Brother, let me tell you.

138
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,839
You're usually quite cunning,

139
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,720
but don't you now

140
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,120
measure the heart of a gentleman with your own mean yardstick.

141
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,199
No, Chairman.

142
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,040
When you're happy, you call me 'Manager Li'.

143
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,279
When you're anxious, I'm back to 'Second Brother'.

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,560
Our second agenda item...

145
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,000
regarding the selection of a fresh vegetable supplier.

146
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,720
Tong Tong, show the pictures.

147
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,879
Come on, those who agree with my proposal, raise your hands.

148
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,720
Li Jing.

149
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,000
Those who agree with my view, raise your hands.

150
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,519
No, Li Jing, what exactly do you mean?

151
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,279
No, no.

152
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,519
You, you... can you be serious?

153
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,519
How am I not being serious?

154
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,560
Why do you keep pointing that broken ladle at us?

155
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,519
Can't I just hold it because it's handy?

156
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,439
No, Manager Li, what are you doing?

157
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,319
Chairman.

158
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,720
Don't keep doing it over and over.

159
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,959
You can't use threats, inducements, and coercion.

160
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,279
We agreed on democracy.

161
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:08,959
Right.

162
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,079
Good, our next agenda item.

163
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,439
Those who agree with me, raise your hands.

164
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,079
Those who agree with me, raise your hands.

165
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,600
Those who agree with me, raise your hands.

166
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,519
No, Uncle Wang.

167
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,959
If this goes on, it'll always be two to two.

168
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,879
It'll never end.

169
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,000
When will it ever stop?

170
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,720
Alright then.

171
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,879
Then, our final agenda item...

172
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,200
is...

173
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,440
whether to hire an external roast duck chef.

174
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,840
I agree.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I agree too.

176
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,919
Great! Finally, a unanimous vote.

177
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,759
Good.

178
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,639
Then, next we...

179
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,840
need to decide...

180
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,120
about this external roast duck chef...

181
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,000
should we find one...

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,559
over forty or under forty?

183
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,440
I think we should find one over forty.

184
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,360
No, no, Big Bro...

185
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,159
Chairman.

186
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
I feel that...

187
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,200
we should first do some market research.

188
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
This decision...

189
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,840
we can make at the next meeting.

190
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,240
Okay?

191
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,720
Yes, Bro.

192
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,159
Let's not vote on it this time.

193
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,159
We've already raised our hands enough.

194
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,279
Fine, then.

195
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,960
This meeting's...

196
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:16,960
um...

197
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,360
matter regarding hiring an external roast duck chef

198
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
is...

199
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,879
the only proposal that passed.

200
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,840
We have passed it.

201
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,759
But next, we must...

202
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,200
ensure its implementation.

203
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,679
We must vigorously ensure this implementation.

204
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,600
And then...

205
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,480
Meeting adjourned.

206
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,200
Is it your place to say 'meeting adjourned'?

207
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,840
No.

208
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,720
Meeting adjourned.

209
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,720
I really can't do this job anymore.

210
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,200
It's taken half my life.

211
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,840
This information is enough.

212
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,600
Thank you.

213
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,720
You're welcome.

214
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,720
Remember, you owe me this favor.

215
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,080
Alright, I know.

216
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Stop going on about it.

217
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,440
Their biggest hurdle right now

218
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,360
is finding a chef

219
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,759
who can replace Big Brother.

220
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I actually have a suitable candidate.

221
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,240
Old Li, you...

222
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,200
His contract isn't up yet.

223
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:48,159
Fine, fine. You keep working there for now.

224
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,720
Once I get things sorted out here,

225
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
you can come over then.

226
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,960
Great, great.

227
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,360
Goodbye.

228
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Why do I hear people saying

229
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,039
Weiguo is going back soon?

230
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,200
Going where?

231
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Back to where he came from.

232
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,000
Dad.

233
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,960
Should I go ask Third Uncle for you,

234
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,000
see what's going on?

235
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,240
No, don't you get involved.

236
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,039
He has a home and a career there.

237
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,679
It's normal for him to go back.

238
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,720
Have some food.

239
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,399
Qiu'er.

240
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,240
I need to tell you something.

241
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,720
Why do I hear

242
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,240
Weiguo is going back?

243
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,120
Are you working tomorrow?

244
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,600
If you have time tomorrow,

245
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
let's go see Weiguo together.

246
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,360
Let me know.

247
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,720
Let's eat.

248
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,440
Who did you hear that from?

249
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,039
Why are you leaving again

250
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,279
so soon after coming back?

251
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,679
I have no reason to stay any longer.

252
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,559
Here's your card back. I didn't touch it.

253
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,399
Don't be like that. This was meant for you.

254
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,399
I don't need it.

255
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,360
No, Qiu'er.

256
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,799
Look...

257
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,360
I know you're not well-off.

258
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,639
You keep your own card.

259
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,639
And then...

260
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,519
I have a card here.

261
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,480
Take it for now.

262
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,360
What's this? I can't accept it.

263
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,559
No, aren't you in trouble?

264
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,919
Don't you need money?

265
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,639
Besides, recently

266
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,200
you've spent a lot on Feifei, right?

267
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,120
Feifei is my nephew.

268
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,799
I've been abroad all these years.

269
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,279
I didn't take good care of him.

270
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,759
Consider it a small token for him.

271
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,679
No, no, that's too much.

272
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,519
And as for me,

273
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,279
this is all the money I have on hand right now.

274
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,480
Take it and use it.

275
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
To ease your urgent need.

276
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Big Brother, thank you.

277
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,799
I appreciate the thought.

278
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,399
No, just take it.

279
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,240
Stop messing around.

280
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
Thank you, Big Brother.

281
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,919
Auntie is gone.

282
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,799
She might not come back again.

283
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,360
Don't be like this.

284
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,559
What are you doing?

285
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,759
Sit down. What are you doing?

286
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,759
Why is this so...

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,360
Before I leave, I want to give you some advice.

288
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,879
But whether you listen is up to you.

289
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,240
Your shareholder structure has problems.

290
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,240
For key decisions,

291
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,879
there's no effective voting mechanism.

292
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,799
That Li Lianbao has been in big companies too long.

293
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,360
He's very self-centered.

294
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,879
He won't listen to others' opinions.

295
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,399
I advise you

296
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,440
not to fight him.

297
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,799
You can't win against him.

298
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,879
But if something really happens,

299
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,039
you'll have to fend for yourselves.

300
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,039
Just live your own lives well.

301
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,080
This is for you.

302
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,159
What is it?

303
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,360
You're trying to appease your wife.

304
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,000
What's the point of buying her a fake bag?

305
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,879
Give her this bag. It's genuine.

306
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,519
You... how did you know I bought a fake bag?

307
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,799
Don't worry about it.

308
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,360
No, this is too valuable.

309
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,799
I said take it, so take it.

310
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,240
You wouldn't let me buy you a house.

311
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Can't you even accept a bag?

312
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
This is just too valuable.

313
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,519
Take it.

314
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,159
Stop dawdling.

315
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,000
That's it then.

316
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,759
Big Brother, take your card back too.

317
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,639
No, no, you keep it for now.

318
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:52,919
I'll leave it here.

319
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,399
Why are you leaving it there?

320
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,159
Go on, go on.

321
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,240
I'll take the bag.

322
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,120
Let's go.

323
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,840
So, that's the situation at our place.

324
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,440
Alright, alright.

325
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,279
Chairman Li, bottoms up.

326
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,679
Chairman Li, I'm finished eating.

327
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,039
I'll take my leave then.

328
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,320
Wait, wait.

329
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,039
How about this? In a couple of days,

330
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,919
find some time to come take a look at our place.

331
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,399
If it's suitable, we can keep talking.

332
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,080
Deal.

333
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,320
I'll go back and inform my old boss.

334
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,279
It wouldn't be right to leave suddenly.

335
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
Understood, understood.

336
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,799
I'll head off then.

337
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,519
I won't see you out.

338
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,559
No need to see me off.

339
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,400
Second Brother, Weiguo is going back to the US soon.

340
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,960
So he's going back. What's it to me?

341
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,640
He shouldn't have come back in the first place.

342
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,960
Hello, Xi'an Lincoln Center.

343
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,440
Manager Zhang is busy right now.

344
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,279
Okay, alright.

345
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,799
May I ask who's calling?

346
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,279
Okay, okay, okay.

347
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,480
Alright, goodbye.

348
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,519
Manager Zhang.

349
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,119
A client says they're waiting for you at Camus Western Restaurant.

350
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,160
Who is it?

351
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Said to be a friend of Chairman Li Lianbao.

352
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,000
Said they know you very well.

353
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,920
Okay, got it.

354
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:54,599
Alright.

355
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,240
Welcome.

356
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,039
You came in person.

357
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,200
You must be Chairman Li's friend.

358
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,359
Yes, that's right. I'm Chairman Li's friend.

359
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,920
What brings you here?

360
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,319
To apologize to you.

361
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,519
Have a seat.

362
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:35,599
Go ahead.

363
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,519
What exactly did you do wrong?

364
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
Everything. I was wrong about everything.

365
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,920
I was inconsiderate. That was wrong.

366
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,039
I failed to understand your good intentions. That was wrong too.

367
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,880
And the biggest mistake was leaving without a word last time.

368
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,920
My dear wife.

369
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Just look at how pitiful I am.

370
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,759
Please, please forgive me.

371
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,559
Alright, alright. I forgive you.

372
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,720
There are so many people around.

373
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,000
Let's eat.

374
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,480
Tong Qiu, this must have cost a fortune.

375
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,200
Making you happy is what matters, not the money.

376
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,960
Look at you, you've gotten thin from all the work.

377
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,759
How are things here?

378
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,279
Sleeping well?

379
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,000
I think your collar here...

380
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,160
Could be a bit higher.

381
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,400
If it's too low, I'll get jealous.

382
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,160
Are you going to let me eat or not?

383
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,920
Sorry, I'll shut up for a bit.

384
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,200
My old habit's acting up again.

385
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,400
I get excited when I see you.

386
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,920
Such an expensive bag.

387
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,400
You actually dared to accept it?

388
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,799
Are we trying to go bankrupt?

389
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:50,799
I didn't just take it for free.

390
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,119
I gave him the money.

391
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,480
I gave him the money.

392
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,480
Weiguo meant well, right?

393
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,519
I was actually quite touched.

394
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,960
This amount of money is nothing.

395
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,759
It's fine.

396
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,079
You're now the general manager of a 4S shop.

397
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,759
And also the wife of a deputy general manager...

398
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:05,799
...of a famous restaurant group.

399
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,839
We can't use fakes. We must use the real thing.

400
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,279
Use it, use it.

401
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,799
Honey.

402
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,680
I really don't care about this.

403
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,720
It would hurt to use something this expensive.

404
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,960
What's there to hurt about?

405
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,759
So many people use this bag.

406
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,519
Why can't you use it?

407
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,839
Use it, use it, use it.

408
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,720
Look, when I go to work normally...

409
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,960
If I carry this bag...

410
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,200
It would be so flashy.

411
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,559
My colleagues would be green with envy.

412
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,960
What a bad influence that would be.

413
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,519
Really.

414
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:42,799
That's true.

415
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,400
That would be a bit...

416
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,759
...involving showing off wealth, right?

417
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,200
Extremely showy.

418
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,519
I didn't think of that.

419
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,359
Then what should we do?

420
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,839
Return it.

421
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Return it?

422
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,759
We already bought it. Why return it?

423
00:21:58,759 --> 00:21:59,480
Use it, use it.

424
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,559
Return? Return what?

425
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,839
Why would we return it?

426
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,279
Honey.

427
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,079
With this much money...

428
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,799
...what couldn't we do?

429
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,599
Just to buy this thing?

430
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
Let's return it.

431
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,079
Really return it?

432
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,359
Tell me, what did I really...

433
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,000
...do to accumulate such virtue in my past life?

434
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,519
Did I save the galaxy?

435
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,319
To marry such a wonderful wife.

436
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,279
Tell me, this bag...

437
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,119
...doesn't it look like twins?

438
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,119
It does look a bit like twins.

439
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,160
Twins.

440
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,279
What do you say, maybe we...

441
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:53,519
Maybe we...

442
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,079
...should have twins too.

443
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,160
Wait a second.

444
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,759
Mom asked you to get that tonic.

445
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,079
Who cares about tonic right now?

446
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,319
You need to drink it.

447
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,000
We hardly get to see each other.

448
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,680
If you drink it, maybe...

449
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,039
...it could really increase our chances of success.

450
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,240
My little ancestor.

451
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,279
Get up, quick.

452
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,000
Bottoms up.

453
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,000
Master, thank you for making the trip.

454
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,000
Take care on your way out.

455
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:55,079
Finding a roast duck chef is this hard too?

456
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
How about we just use that Master Tan I found?

457
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,799
I think he's alright.

458
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:05,920
Let me tell you something.

459
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,279
That Master Tan is absolutely no good.

460
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,000
I mean, as soon as he gets here...

461
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,799
...he starts rubbing spices on the duck.

462
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,559
Just that alone puts me off.

463
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,359
Who *do* you approve of?

464
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:17,759
You even rejected the ones you found yourself.

465
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,799
You're so picky.

466
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,039
No, but regarding this matter...

467
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,079
...is it wrong for me to be a little strict?

468
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,000
No, it's not wrong.

469
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,319
If that doesn't work...

470
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,680
...I do know a Master Li.

471
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
His skills are good.

472
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,039
But...

473
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,759
...chances are he won't come either.

474
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,160
He has his own shop.

475
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,640
If not, I'll try to persuade him again later.

476
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,640
How about this?

477
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,319
Let's keep looking.

478
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,279
Keep looking.

479
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:56,400
Let's... let's all keep looking.

480
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,319
Yes, keep looking.

481
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,680
Hello?

482
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,279
Hello, is this Chairman Li Lianbao?

483
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,400
Who is this?

484
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,759
My name is Sun Yanhui.

485
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,960
I'm a roast duck chef.

486
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,039
I was also the runner-up in last year's Beijing Duck King Competition.

487
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,240
I heard from a friend...

488
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,680
...that you are...

489
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,079
...offering a high salary for a roast duck chef.

490
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Yes, yes, that's right.

491
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,680
Master Sun, right?

492
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
Hello, hello.

493
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,200
So, when would be convenient for you...

494
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,440
...for us to meet and talk?

495
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,839
Sure, I'm free anytime.

496
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,440
Good, good.

497
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,359
Duck King Competition.

498
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,160
He really is the runner-up.

499
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,920
Since Chairman Li has shown me such great respect...

500
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,880
...and I've gained your approval...

501
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,039
Say no more.

502
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,519
I'll come to work at Peng Le Xuan in a couple of days.

503
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,400
Well, that...

504
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,880
Let me pour you some.

505
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,680
As per the old custom, you see.

506
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:53,200
I should specially offer you tea, right?

507
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,400
We should set up a couple of tables.

508
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,599
That would be proper, right?

509
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,559
Isn't it?

510
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,599
So, Master Sun.

511
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,839
From now on, we're family.

512
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,960
You've gone to a lot of trouble.

513
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,599
Please take good care, Master Sun.

514
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,799
Oh, you're too kind.

515
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,640
Actually, Master Wang.

516
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,599
I've long heard of your reputation outside.

517
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,680
After coming to work at Peng Le Xuan.

518
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,160
I really need to learn from you.

519
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,880
And pick up a few good techniques.

520
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,200
You flatter me, you flatter me.

521
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,960
Well, I'll take my leave first today.

522
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:23,880
You all carry on.

523
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Alright, alright.

524
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Master Sun, take care on your way.

525
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,640
Take care.

526
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,440
No need to see me out.

527
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,119
Alright.

528
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:28,599
No, no, no.

529
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,160
We'll see you out.

530
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,880
Please, don't bother.

531
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,400
No, no, let us walk you out.

532
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,160
Please stay.

533
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,279
Take it easy.

534
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:35,680
Be careful.

535
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,119
Okay.

536
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Goodbye, Master Sun.

537
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Goodbye, goodbye.

538
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,359
Alright then, now we can relax.

539
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,519
Good, this weight in my heart.

540
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,759
Has finally been lifted.

541
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,119
Big Brother, satisfied now?

542
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:50,880
Satisfied.

543
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,759
We're not just hiring Master Sun as head chef.

544
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,920
We'll also have Master Sun represent Peng Le Xuan.

545
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,359
In this year's Duck King Competition.

546
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Duck King Competition?

547
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,359
I've done some careful research.

548
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,599
The trendy roast duck shops in recent years.

549
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,839
Have all won places in this competition.

550
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,880
It brings buzz and traffic.

551
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,519
But this competition...

552
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,640
Which established, venerable brand goes to compete?

553
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,839
Yeah, it's a bit beneath us, isn't it?

554
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,119
Kind of lowering our own status.

555
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,640
Big Brother, Sister-in-law.

556
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
You just don't get it.

557
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,599
Traffic is everything.

558
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,759
Think about it.

559
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,759
Master Sun got second place last year.

560
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,000
This year, we'll bring home the championship.

561
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,519
Then we won't have to worry about traffic.

562
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,279
By then.

563
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,599
These targets from the investors.

564
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,160
We'll easily meet them.

565
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,400
Maybe even multiply them several times over.

566
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,640
Fine, we'll listen to you then.

567
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:47,519
Li Lianbao!

568
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,279
Qianqian's here.

569
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,839
Li Lianbao!

570
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,880
You are such a piece of work!

571
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,640
What's going on?

572
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,599
Did I block your chimney?

573
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,119
Or burn your family's quilts?

574
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,160
You just have to mess with me alone, don't you?

575
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,680
Is this any way to do things?

576
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,599
What happened?

577
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,759
Qianqian, how come after just a few days apart.

578
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,119
You two are at it again?

579
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,640
No.

580
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,400
Big Brother, Sister-in-law.

581
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,079
You be the judge.

582
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,160
When I wanted to invest in Peng Le Xuan.

583
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,400
He snatched it away from me.

584
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,559
I let it slide without a word.

585
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,759
Now I just found a new head chef.

586
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,440
And he snatches him away too!

587
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:20,880
The shop I invested in.

588
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,960
Was counting entirely on Master Sun's skills.

589
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,559
What's the meaning of you always poaching from me?

590
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:26,880
Master Sun?

591
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,079
Which Master Sun?

592
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,359
Still playing dumb with me, huh?

593
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,359
Master Sun Yanhui!

594
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,640
No, I really didn't know.

595
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,799
He contacted me first.

596
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,519
You think I'm an idiot?

597
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,119
Can I believe you?

598
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,640
Let's be clear about this.

599
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,640
In business, what matters is.

600
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,279
Fair competition.

601
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,599
Master Sun didn't choose you, he chose me.

602
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,039
I couldn't stop him.

603
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,839
You're something, Li Lianbao.

604
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,119
I'm really so disappointed in you.

605
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:00,680
Qianqian!

606
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,400
Dong Qian!

607
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,519
No, Second Brother.

608
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:10,960
What you did is a bit underhanded.

609
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,759
No.

610
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,440
I truly didn't know.

611
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,519
Master Sun was connected to her.

612
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,400
I... I need to explain to Dong Qian.

613
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:23,160
Wait, so about this Master Sun.

614
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,680
Do we hire him or give him to Qianqian?

615
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,160
The way I'm hearing it.

616
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,759
This doesn't sound reliable again.

617
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:29,599
Look at you.

618
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,359
Your Big Brother finally found someone he likes.

619
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,240
And now this...

620
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
What a mess this has become.

621
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,279
Alright.

622
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,559
If not, I'll go look for that Master Li again.

623
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
About this Master Sun situation...

624
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,359
I have to make this clear to you.

625
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,079
He was the one who contacted me first, who came to me.

626
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,720
I've already agreed on terms with him.

627
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,960
We're about to sign the contract.

628
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,119
Why is he still looking for you?

629
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:58,640
I...

630
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,119
How much salary are you offering him for a year?

631
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,599
No, look.

632
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,599
That's exactly where the problem lies.

633
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,359
I'm offering him one and a half times more than his last place.

634
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,640
Plus year-end bonuses.

635
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,200
That price doesn't exist on the market.

636
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,240
Top talent deserves above-market rates.

637
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,519
See? The issue is clear now.

638
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,400
He's purely coming for the money.

639
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,640
That's why he's coming to me.

640
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
So, tell me.

641
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,519
What do we do about this now?

642
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,480
What do you mean?

643
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,680
There has to be some order of precedence, right?

644
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
He already gave me his verbal promise.

645
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,200
Even though we haven't put it in a contract yet,

646
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,359
when you do business,

647
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,160
you have to keep your word, don't you?

648
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,640
I sought him out specifically

649
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,119
because he won second place in last year's Duck King Competition.

650
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,079
That's why I went after him.

651
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,359
This year,

652
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,440
I'm determined to go for the championship in the Duck King Competition.

653
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,839
Alright.

654
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,400
I understand what you're saying.

655
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,000
Here's the thing.

656
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,640
I'll turn him down in a little while.

657
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,200
Wait for my word, okay?

658
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
Are you serious?

659
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,559
No, I mean...

660
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,599
Don't you trust me on this?

661
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:04,880
Fine.

662
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
I'm heading out first.

663
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,519
Now that we've finished talking business,

664
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,599
what about us?

665
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,480
No, hold on.

666
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,599
Don't keep saying "us" like that.

667
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,599
If others hear it,

668
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,359
they'll really think there's something between us.

669
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,039
But there is something.

670
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,880
You can't just act like you don't know me

671
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,480
after one night. Is that really necessary?

672
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,759
Keep your voice down.

673
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,759
No, I mean...

674
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,799
What do you want to talk about then?

675
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,279
Don't tell me

676
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,839
you want me to take responsibility for you?

677
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:34,279
No.

678
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:36,079
What I mean is...

679
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,599
Since things have already happened this way,

680
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,839
and I'm not the kind of man who shirks responsibility,

681
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,440
right?

682
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,759
Even though we know each other pretty well,

683
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,160
actually getting into a relationship... that's a bit...

684
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,640
Okay, I get it.

685
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,119
You don't need to give me the "even though, but" speech.

686
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,000
I understand what you're implying.

687
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,559
It's just that

688
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,640
you don't want anything to do with me,

689
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,400
but morally you look down on yourself for it?

690
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,160
So you're passing the ball to me,

691
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,200
making me be the one to decide.

692
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,160
No, Qianqian.

693
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,880
How can you think of me that way?

694
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,119
I'm afraid...

695
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,279
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

696
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,640
Relax.

697
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,640
Adults take responsibility for their own actions.

698
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:12,880
Men and women alike.

699
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,119
What happened between us,

700
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,720
is in the past.

701
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,000
From now on, things will go back to how they were.

702
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:24,440
Back to business as usual.

703
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,799
No, but what exactly does that mean?

704
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,359
So, how did it go?

705
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,240
He told me he'd turn down Master Sun soon.

706
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,759
Told me to wait for his word.

707
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,279
So, do you think

708
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,799
he'll actually give up on Master Sun?

709
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,240
Director Dong.

710
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,960
Director Ma.

711
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,680
What should I do next?

712
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,519
Master Sun.

713
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,719
Once you get into Peng Le Xuan,

714
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,039
stall them first.

715
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,679
Don't rush to sign the contract.

716
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,039
Got it.

717
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,760
Actually, based on my understanding of Li Lianbao,

718
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,000
he's too competitive,

719
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,880
and too eager to prove himself.

720
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,719
I think with his personality,

721
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,440
he probably won't give up on Master Sun easily.

722
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,000
And who knows,

723
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
he might suffer even bigger losses in the future.

724
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,239
It seems

725
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,920
you understand him very well.

726
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,320
And you care about him a lot too.

727
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,800
Won't you regret

728
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,119
dealing with him like this?

729
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,480
Business is business.

730
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:47,000
It has nothing to do with personal relationships.

731
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,039
Good, then.

732
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:57,360
Master Li

733
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,199
Sorry, really sorry.

734
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,360
Didn't... didn't delay your work, did it?

735
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,880
No, no. The lunch rush is over.

736
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,519
I figured it was about time.

737
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,639
There's this matter...

738
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,159
I felt over the phone...

739
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,360
it wasn't quite appropriate to tell you.

740
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,519
I still need to apologize to you in person.

741
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,239
It's fine. Just go ahead and say it.

742
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,119
Right.

743
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,519
Well, before, didn't we say...

744
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,880
we wanted to invite you to work at my restaurant?

745
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,039
But...

746
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,719
Our Second Brother...

747
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,440
He already approached another chef first.

748
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,679
And also, that chef...

749
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:27,679
has some ongoing dispute with another restaurant.

750
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,880
For the time being...

751
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,159
this matter can't be resolved.

752
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:30,960
So...

753
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,679
When we can give you a definite answer...

754
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:34,039
we can't confirm it right now.

755
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:34,880
I'm afraid...

756
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,119
it might hold you up.

757
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,320
What's there to hold up?

758
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,079
Well...

759
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,920
Is the trouble on your end hard to handle?

760
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,519
You see, our Second Brother...

761
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,960
found a Chef Sun.

762
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,159
I think this Chef Sun's skills are quite good.

763
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:48,920
It's said...

764
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,000
last year he even won...

765
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,719
the runner-up prize in the Duck King Competition.

766
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,000
But the way I see this guy...

767
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,679
his eyes always seem a bit shifty.

768
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,480
Who knows what else might happen later.

769
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,199
Which Chef Sun?

770
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,679
Called Sun Yanhui.

771
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,719
Sun Yanhui.

772
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,440
You haven't heard of this Sun Yanhui before?

773
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,679
No, no, haven't heard of him.

774
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,639
In our circle...

775
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,000
his reputation is not so great.

776
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,360
There's such a thing, huh?

777
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,519
Alright, Brother Wang, don't worry yet.

778
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:20,280
Let me introduce you to someone.

779
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,360
Sun Yanhui used to work for him.

780
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,679
Go ask him for details.

781
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,440
Okay, thanks.

782
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,280
Hello?

783
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,159
Well, I have a friend here...

784
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,119
who wants to ask you about that Sun Yanhui.

785
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,360
Alright.

786
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,000
Then I'll have him go see you, okay?

787
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,480
That's it.

788
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:46,360
Well, okay, Brother Wang...

789
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,639
Look, here's his phone number.

790
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,559
Take it down.

791
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,039
Manager Tian, right?

792
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,280
Hello, Master... Master Wang.

793
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,239
Yes, yes, hello.

794
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:06,679
Hello.

795
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,960
I'm a friend of Xiao Li.

796
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,199
He mentioned it to you on the phone, right?

797
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:09,880
Yes, he did.

798
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,559
I just came here to...

799
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,760
ask about someone.

800
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,719
This Sun Yanhui.

801
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,559
Please, sit.

802
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,079
Sit, sit, let's talk.

803
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,679
Him?

804
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,159
He was our head chef before.

805
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,559
Master Sun, well...

806
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,519
His skills are quite good.

807
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,079
Right.

808
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,559
But he has one bad habit.

809
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,280
He's not clean-handed.

810
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,480
He takes kickbacks.

811
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,440
The kitchen was under his control, right?

812
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,519
He'd demand benefits from suppliers.

813
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,079
If they didn't give, he'd replace them.

814
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,960
The key is, his appetite was huge.

815
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,760
A supplier couldn't take it anymore,

816
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,159
and reported him.

817
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:53,559
So our shop let him go.

818
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,360
You could say that.

819
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,159
Well, what can you do?

820
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:58,679
Yeah.

821
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,880
Good thing I asked around a bit more.

822
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,440
Who would have thought

823
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,960
that guy was this kind of person?

824
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,480
Right, we can't hire someone like that.

825
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,000
Second Brother.

826
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,079
Qianqian is still mad at you for poaching him.

827
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,519
We definitely can't hire someone like this.

828
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,159
To avoid more trouble between you two.

829
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,360
Right, give Qianqian a heads-up too.

830
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,480
I, however, still stand by my opinion.

831
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,559
This Master Sun...

832
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,480
must be hired.

833
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,280
Don't we already know what kind of person he is?

834
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,239
And we still want to hire him?

835
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,079
Yeah.

836
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:31,559
His character is no good.

837
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,559
Didn't Big Brother investigate it clearly?

838
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,679
Isn't it normal for people to have some flaws?

839
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,519
No, is this a small flaw?

840
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,719
This is a major flaw.

841
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:42,440
Anyway, let me tell you,

842
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:43,719
my Peng Le Xuan,

843
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,119
for over a hundred years,

844
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,480
since my great-great-grandfather's time,

845
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,119
has always been upright and honorable.

846
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,559
We've never tolerated this kind of dirt.

847
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,920
I think Big Brother is right.

848
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,880
No, Big Brother.

849
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,800
He's the best chef

850
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,000
we've found on the market.

851
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:06,079
Sec... Second Brother, this really won't do.

852
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,320
Your big brother can't stand this type of person.

853
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:10,320
How many chefs have we tried?

854
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,559
He's the only one we all approved.

855
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,679
What's wrong with him earning a little extra?

856
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,559
Water that is too clear harbors no fish.

857
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,159
That's exactly what I value.

858
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,599
As long as he makes good roast duck, isn't that enough?

859
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:23,039
With your level of skill,

860
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,840
what do we have to keep him here?

861
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,239
No, so all those strict

862
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,559
rules and regulations you set

863
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,239
are just for us few?

864
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,079
He takes kickbacks. Can you tolerate that?

865
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,159
Yeah.

866
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,519
What's wrong with taking a little kickback in business?

867
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:38,840
A little kickback...

868
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,119
His kickback, that... that...

869
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:42,320
Those receipts I wanted to submit the other day,

870
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,840
they totaled two thousand yuan at most.

871
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,679
He embezzled this...

872
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:47,480
You're being too nice to outsiders, aren't you, Bro?

873
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,960
Qiu'er, that's not the same thing.

874
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
Master Sun has his value.

875
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,000
I think it's worth it.

876
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Anyway, I'm telling you,

877
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,239
even if you talk until the sky falls,

878
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,559
I don't agree to this.

879
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,079
I think Big Brother is right.

880
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,239
Since you insist on disagreeing,

881
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,199
I can't say anything more.

882
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,480
The investor called a couple days ago.

883
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,079
Asked why we haven't started renovating,

884
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,519
why we're not moving forward.

885
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,119
I didn't know what to say.

886
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
It's good that today the Chairman

887
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,599
and Deputy General Manager are both here.

888
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,599
You go explain it to the investor.

889
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,239
Don't feel any pressure.

890
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,079
At worst, they'll withdraw their investment.

891
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,239
We'll just pay a million or so in penalty fees,

892
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,280
and start over from scratch.

893
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,639
Okay?

894
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,559
This...

895
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:38,199
This...

896
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,320
How come he just left?

897
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,760
Isn't this a blatant threat?

898
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,519
What do we do?

899
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,199
Just let Lianbao mess around like this?

900
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,920
What can we do?

901
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,719
Let it go cold.

902
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,400
"Let it go cold"? What does that mean?

903
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,960
It means we drop it.

904
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,719
No, no, no.

905
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm counting on this to turn things around, Bro.

906
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:26,079
But Second Brother just said those things.

907
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:26,719
Right?

908
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,519
Using money to talk to us.

909
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,119
What more can we say?

910
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,719
You... you, don't get angry yet.

911
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:36,480
You... use your clever head to think of another way, Bro.

912
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:38,679
Let's go.

913
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:39,880
Go where?
