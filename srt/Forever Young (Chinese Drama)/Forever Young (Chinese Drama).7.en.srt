1
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,719
Leaving so soon?

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,840
Weiguo.

3
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,480
What brings you here?

4
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,560
If there's anything,

5
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,519
let's go inside to talk.

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,840
We'll go together later.

7
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,359
Okay.

8
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,439
Come on, inside, inside.

9
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,239
Senior.

10
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,760
I found you a large conference room.

11
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,760
Why is he here?

12
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,680
How should I know?

13
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's go see first.

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,599
Why are you leaving?

15
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,760
Wang Chunsheng and Li Lianbao.

16
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,200
I'd call them the Super-Macho Twin Stars.

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Humanoid low-boiling-point nitroglycerin.

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,719
Explodes when cold, hot, hit, or near a flame.

19
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,240
Tong Qiu can trigger it.

20
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,280
The Unlucky Human Trio's combined attack.

21
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,360
As for those two,

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,479
we still have to help.

23
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,360
It's just that

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,879
there should be a small price, right?

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,680
Hello?

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,560
Third Uncle, I'm here.

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,479
Which table are you at?

28
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,280
Walk further in.

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,280
I see you.

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,280
Why aren't you out having fun this weekend?

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,240
What did you come to see me for?

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,240
Third Uncle.

33
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,759
With this thing happening at home now,

34
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,800
how could I be in the mood to go out?

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,039
Um...

36
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,439
This time,

37
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,919
Third Uncle, you really don't plan to help my dad?

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,840
I think...

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,800
I also heard

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,719
that my dad once

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,199
went to jail for you, right?

42
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,400
So how can you bear to see him go in again?

43
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,000
With your dad's temper,

44
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,479
always ready to hit someone,

45
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,560
he's bound to get in trouble sooner or later.

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,800
He deserves to learn a lesson.

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,560
Besides,

48
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,719
wouldn't it be better for you if he's inside?

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,879
No one would be on your case then.

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,439
That guy...

51
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:43,960
It's true.

52
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,400
He has a bad temper and lots of flaws.

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,199
And he's super lazy.

54
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,719
But no matter what, I think

55
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,639
he's still my dad after all.

56
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,840
And this time I was there, Third Uncle.

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,159
I saw with my own eyes that it was that

58
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,759
Tang Zhixin who started it.

59
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,960
If it were me, I'd...

60
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,719
I'd have to hit him too.

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,520
Isn't your Second Uncle handling it?

62
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,479
We just wait for his news, okay?

63
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,639
Second Uncle, he...

64
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,199
He just found a lawyer,

65
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,360
but he didn't sound very committed on the phone.

66
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,719
Third Uncle...

67
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Please.

68
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,839
Don't worry.

69
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,120
It's all arranged.

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,160
Wang Chunsheng is my older male cousin.

71
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,560
My eldest aunt's son.

72
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,040
This is my older sister-in-law.

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,319
She takes good care of me.

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,680
And this young man here

75
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,439
is my nephew.

76
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,160
His name is Wang Fei.

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,360
Sit properly. Greet him.

78
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,839
Hello, Uncle.

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,839
Well...

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,480
Had I known about this connection earlier,

81
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,600
we wouldn't have needed all this trouble, right?

82
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,800
Da Zhang.

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
I'm not here to poach your case.

84
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,199
If there's any difficulty with this matter,

85
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,839
Come on, Senior, don't embarrass me.

86
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,959
If I had to trouble you with this,

87
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,839
I'd lose all face.

88
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,920
Show them this.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,519
Maybe they'll give up.

90
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,399
This is my father's draft from back then.

91
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,920
It's a declaration jointly signed

92
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,040
by my youngest aunt and my grandfather.

93
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,160
It's been notarized.

94
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,920
It clearly states

95
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,560
that my father and my youngest aunt

96
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,920
renounce their inheritance rights to Pengle Xuan.

97
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,319
As a keepsake,

98
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,439
I've kept it all this time.

99
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,680
Weiguo, this is impressive.

100
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,439
Second Brother.

101
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,680
There really was such a declaration back then.

102
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,920
Your eldest brother and I didn't take it seriously.

103
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,639
We kept moving it around and lost it.

104
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,759
Hold on.

105
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,560
You had this?

106
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
Why didn't you bring it out sooner?

107
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,279
I tried to give it to Eldest Brother the day after I returned.

108
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,079
But he refused it.

109
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,959
What could I do?

110
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,160
Eldest Brother.

111
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,680
And this too.

112
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,560
It's very important to you.

113
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,879
Take it.

114
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,120
You giving me this thing,

115
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,720
no matter how important it is to me,

116
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,319
I don't want it.

117
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,319
This Tang Zhixin,

118
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,439
once he realizes

119
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,040
he can't gain any advantage at Pengle Xuan,

120
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,160
he'll give up.

121
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,199
As for the beating he took,

122
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,040
we'll compensate as required.

123
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,120
So you can rest assured.

124
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Thank you.

125
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,439
No problem, no problem.

126
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,720
Manager Li, leave this matter to me.

127
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,680
You can rest easy.

128
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,720
Attorney Zhang, I appreciate the sentiment.

129
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,279
But you must accept the fee.

130
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,319
No, Manager Li.

131
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,399
Don't put me in a difficult position.

132
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,199
My senior is a partner at Daheng.

133
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,240
It's not appropriate.

134
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,480
I'm not joking.

135
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,959
Rice is a major client.

136
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,399
My senior being able to help me

137
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,000
is a huge advantage for me.

138
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,199
Manager Li.

139
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,600
I'll need to work with you in the future.

140
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,680
Please look out for me.

141
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,319
Okay, okay, of course, of course.

142
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,199
Then let's schedule another time.

143
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,160
Sure, sure.

144
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,000
Alright.

145
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,639
Why is Ma Weiguo everywhere?

146
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,879
Hello? What is it?

147
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,839
I want to start immigration procedures for Jenny.

148
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
I need you to sign a consent form.

149
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,600
Immigration?

150
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,079
Immigrate where?

151
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,120
Hu Nana

152
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,639
What do you want?

153
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,560
You and Lao Kai want to emigrate.

154
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,279
I don't care if you move to Mars.

155
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,560
Yuanyuan is so young.

156
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,519
Why go abroad?

157
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,560
I'm telling you, I don't agree.

158
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,040
Li Lianbao, you don't have to be like this with me.

159
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,959
Emigrating is a simple matter.

160
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,439
I just want our child to get a better education.

161
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,759
Now there's an opportunity.

162
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,800
And we have the means.

163
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,560
Isn't China's basic education better?

164
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,199
You can emigrate later if you want.

165
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,720
The earlier she goes, the sooner she adapts.

166
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,920
Yuanyuan is studying piano.

167
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,959
Of course you should study Western music abroad.

168
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,560
Enough!

169
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,240
Don't give me all that nonsense.

170
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,560
Let me make this clear to you.

171
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,519
If you want to take my daughter to emigrate...

172
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,720
...forget about it.

173
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,959
How about this?

174
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,839
Give me custody of Yuanyuan.

175
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,600
Don't even think about that either.

176
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,720
Hello, Tom.

177
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,480
Lao Kai.

178
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,399
Was emigrating your idea?

179
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
Watch your tone.

180
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,360
It's fine, it's fine.

181
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,040
Tom, calm down.

182
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,600
We really just want...

183
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,199
...to give Jenny a better life.

184
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Don't worry.

185
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,240
I can provide all that.

186
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,480
I know it's hard to find a job now.

187
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,519
If money is tight...

188
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,000
...you don't have to pay this anymore.

189
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,279
Stop pretending to be so noble.

190
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,039
I'm doing just fine.

191
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,120
I don't need your pity.

192
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,480
And don't try to look good in front of my daughter.

193
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,240
I won't spend a single cent of yours.

194
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,799
I'll earn money to support her for life.

195
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,559
Tom, you've really misunderstood.

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,600
We don't want to fight with you over anything.

197
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,960
We're purely doing this for Jenny.

198
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,039
Isn't Martin your good friend?

199
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,960
He's doing very well now.

200
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,559
Isn't it precisely because...

201
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,759
Don't mention him to me!

202
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,679
I'll say it one last time.

203
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,840
If you want to take my daughter to emigrate, no way!

204
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,559
You're insane.

205
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,399
Nana, Nana!

206
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,559
Old Tong, you're finally here!

207
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,519
I've been waiting and waiting...

208
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,840
...for you to arrive.

209
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
Now that you're here...

210
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,799
...you must share your experience.

211
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,919
You're too kind.

212
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,639
I'm here mainly to learn.

213
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,960
So modest. You can tell you're from the city.

214
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,440
But excessive modesty is just pride.

215
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes, yes, I... I...

216
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,240
Right, right.

217
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,960
Old Tong...

218
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,519
...our place here is newly established.

219
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,840
Many are newly hired staff.

220
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,279
Their professional skills...

221
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,039
...leave a lot to be desired.

222
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,440
Since you're here...

223
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,600
...how about you handle the job training?

224
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,159
I'm new here.

225
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,919
I'll follow your arrangements.

226
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,240
Great, great, great.

227
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,000
Old Tong...

228
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,320
...our location is really too remote.

229
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,440
And the people are too honest.

230
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,360
I won't beat around the bush.

231
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,600
Show us some real skill.

232
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Teach by word and example.

233
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,840
Say what's on your mind.

234
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,399
Don't hold back at all.

235
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,000
Answer the phone.

236
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,799
I'll step out.

237
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,600
No, no, no.

238
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,960
This is your, your, your office.

239
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,240
I'll, I'll go out.

240
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,000
Honey, you finally called!

241
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,120
I've missed you so much.

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,120
I want to come back in a couple of days.

243
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,679
You forgive me?

244
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,919
Who said I forgive you?

245
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm still angry.

246
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,519
But... it's my ovulation period.

247
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,720
It's understandable for a wife to be angry.

248
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,679
It's only right.

249
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,200
My wife is considerate of the bigger picture...

250
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,320
...and that's why she's giving me some face.

251
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,679
You know what's good for you.

252
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,399
Where are you now?

253
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm at the bank.

254
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,039
Why do I hear a rooster crowing?

255
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,000
A colleague changed their ringtone.

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Isn't that, isn't that funny?

257
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,279
Honey, maybe... maybe you shouldn't come.

258
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,120
It's too much trouble for you.

259
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,639
I'll come to Xi'an to see you.

260
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,919
Alright.

261
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,360
Then come as soon as possible.

262
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,320
Okay, I'll go as soon as I finish up here in a couple of days.

263
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,320
Darn it, what is this?

264
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,039
Brother Liu.

265
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,480
I need a favor.

266
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,480
That Booker Restaurant case.

267
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,360
Help me find out which team did it.

268
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,679
Let me know if you hear anything.

269
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,159
Keep this confidential.

270
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,200
Don't let anyone know.

271
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,360
That's it.

272
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,559
Bye.

273
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,360
What's so funny?

274
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,559
You scared me.

275
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,039
Listen.

276
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,519
I've figured it out.

277
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,960
Why am I even looking for a job?

278
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,279
Aren't they all saying I'm too old and expensive?

279
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,159
Fine. I won't serve them anymore.

280
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,120
I'll do my own thing.

281
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,480
You're starting a business?

282
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,720
Well, how about this then?

283
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,120
While you're at it, tell my mom.

284
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,679
Say you need help for your startup.

285
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,519
Let me join in.

286
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,919
I'm short on cash lately anyway.

287
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,600
No, if you're short on money,

288
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,519
just tell me.

289
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,519
I have some here.

290
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,679
But my situation...

291
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,320
You really can't help with.

292
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,039
Just focus on preparing your photo exhibition.

293
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,720
How could I possibly take your money?

294
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,919
I know the principle of being indebted.

295
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,480
Alright, go home and rest early.

296
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,440
Don't rush off.

297
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,960
I have a surprise for you.

298
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,399
You've really taken a lot of photos.

299
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,159
I want the theme to be Beijing's twenty-year transformation.

300
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,000
Specifically?

301
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,279
Start with the familiar Baofang Hutong.

302
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,639
Sounds interesting.

303
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,440
How do you want me to help?

304
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,480
I want to use you four brothers as a thread.

305
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,720
Take a set of before-and-after photos.

306
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,200
I'll also collect some old items.

307
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,120
Old photos.

308
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,320
And some of your old...

309
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,039
food, things you used, clothes you wore.

310
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,440
Then I hope you'll recreate them...

311
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,399
in your present state.

312
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,399
I just remembered something I need to do.

313
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,320
I have to go.

314
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,600
Uncle, don't go!

315
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,720
I was counting on you to lead this for me.

316
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,679
You should go to your mom for this.

317
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,000
What good would finding my mom do?

318
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
I thought Uncle Ma was quite concerned...

319
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,519
about Uncle Wang's situation.

320
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,440
I thought you four had made up.

321
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,679
Made up? Made up my ass!

322
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,519
He's just showing off.

323
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,360
Making us shamelessly apologize.

324
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
And suck up to him.

325
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,799
That's pretty wild.

326
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,639
Who is it?

327
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,360
You don't know him.

328
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,759
I'm not that conservative.

329
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,919
Your uncle loved to have fun when he was young too.

330
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,440
But a reminder, Tongtong.

331
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,879
As a girl, you still need to be careful.

332
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,919
What are you talking about? You're overthinking.

333
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,200
Go, go, go!

334
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,639
No.

335
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,759
I think he looks familiar.

336
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,480
Why would a foreigner look familiar?

337
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,960
Go on, get out.

338
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,440
A foreigner?

339
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,000
With a foreigner, you need to be even more careful!

340
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,279
What nonsense are you saying?

341
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,720
Young lady, don't play so recklessly.

342
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,840
You're overthinking it.

343
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,759
What?

344
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,799
Big brother.

345
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,759
Stop fussing, sit down.

346
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,679
Qiu'er, why are you so listless today?

347
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,600
You get the brothers started eating and drinking.

348
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,440
Wait, there's one more dish.

349
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,200
Big brother, there's something...

350
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,320
I need to discuss with you.

351
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,279
Not now, Second Brother.

352
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,320
We'll talk later.

353
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,519
Here.

354
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,240
Here.

355
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,519
I have a good idea in my heart.

356
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,279
So here's the thing.

357
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,840
This...

358
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,919
I won't say much more.

359
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,000
It's all in this drink.

360
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,200
Weiguo.

361
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,519
I'll finish this.

362
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,039
To keep you company.

363
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,320
Come on, come on.

364
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,919
Big brother, you don't need to drink.

365
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,840
There's no need for thanks between us.

366
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,480
No, no, no.

367
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,480
Sit down.

368
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,840
I don't need your thanks.

369
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,960
Hey, Ma Weiguo.

370
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,519
Is it fun always being a Monday morning quarterback?

371
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,799
Does big brother need to thank you?

372
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,440
If you had produced that IOU earlier,

373
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,360
would big brother have had to suffer like that?

374
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,559
Big brother.

375
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,759
After all these years...

376
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,360
how come you still haven't changed?

377
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
How are you still so impulsive?

378
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,080
So unreasonable?

379
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,639
Weiguo.

380
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,200
You... the way you're talking...

381
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,279
Look, we closed the shop specially today.

382
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,960
Your big brother prepared this whole table of food.

383
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,400
No, no, no.

384
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
All just to thank you!

385
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,799
I said I don't need his thanks.

386
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,279
Fine. Perfect timing.

387
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,319
Since we're being official about it,

388
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,119
then let's go point by point.

389
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,440
You say...

390
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,039
I came back just to humiliate you?

391
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,359
To disgrace you?

392
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,960
Then my words still stand.

393
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,240
The three of you owe me an apology.

394
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,319
Pay up now.

395
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,720
Are you out of your mind?

396
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,119
You really are crazy.

397
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,279
They've all left.

398
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:46,960
You apologize.

399
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,160
Apologize to yourself.

400
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Then, keep on making trouble.

401
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,279
Good luck with that.

402
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,079
So it was you who went to find him.

403
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,039
No, why would I need you to beg him for me?

404
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,640
What the heck does he think he is?

405
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,759
Dad, Third Uncle is not the kind of person you think.

406
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,599
Even if I didn't go to him,

407
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,519
he wouldn't ignore your problem.

408
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,559
Third Uncle also said

409
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,599
he will take full responsibility for my issues.

410
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,599
How is he going to take full responsibility for you?

411
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,240
The school is about to expel you.

412
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,720
Take full responsibility, my foot!

413
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,440
What?

414
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,720
Can he take care of you for the rest of your life?

415
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,240
Make our Wang family ancestors proud from their graves?

416
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,559
No, I have to go find him right now.

417
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,200
Dad, Dad, don't go, don't.

418
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,039
Get out of my way.

419
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,079
Dad, during the time I've spent with him,

420
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,880
I finally feel understood by someone.

421
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,519
I'm willing to trust him.

422
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,720
At least Third Uncle can understand what I'm saying.

423
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,440
Not like with you.

424
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,720
Talking is just exhausting.

425
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,839
You always say you understand, you understand,

426
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,799
but actually you don't understand anything.

427
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,759
No, well, well...

428
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,720
So your Third Uncle, he understands everything?

429
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,160
Well, he's seen the world.

430
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
What I understand or don't, he gets it all.

431
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,519
You've only known him for a few days.

432
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,400
Go back to your room and do your homework, now.

433
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,039
You wanted to see me.

434
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,759
I just want to ask you,

435
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,200
are you sincere about wanting to help Feifei?

436
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:21,200
The issue isn't about...

437
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,680
No, no, no.

438
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,160
Don't give me that useless talk.

439
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,440
This child,

440
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,559
now wants you to help him.

441
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,799
I just want to know if you're sincere.

442
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,119
I sincerely want to help him.

443
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,400
But I have conditions.

444
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,000
Isn't it just about making me apologize to you?

445
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,160
For the child's sake,

446
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,200
I'd even kneel to you.

447
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,000
But don't mess with me, okay?

448
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,960
Don't worry.

449
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,720
He's my nephew.

450
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
I won't harm him.

451
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,920
Do you want to come take a look?

452
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,559
Remember this, right?

453
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,279
When you were little,

454
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,799
you always waited here for your mom and dad to come home.

455
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,680
You said standing here was high up, you could see far.

456
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,400
Yeah.

457
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,160
You could see the alley entrance at a glance.

458
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,480
You could see Auntie Li

459
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,400
carrying honey pastries and steamed buns.

460
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,880
You two would both run up to her.

461
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,519
Li Lianbao, on the other hand, would hide far away.

462
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,119
You could see Uncle Tong in a suit,

463
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,319
carrying a briefcase.

464
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,200
There were always one or two books in it,

465
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,160
by Jin Yong and Gu Long.

466
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,559
You could also see Uncle Wang in a leather jacket,

467
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,359
riding his Phoenix brand bicycle.

468
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,039
You all said,

469
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,640
my dad, my mom,

470
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,480
would definitely come down this road too.

471
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,839
I'll wait for them right here.

472
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,440
Every single day I waited,

473
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,880
I recorded it.

474
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,000
Look.

475
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,440
This is the last day.

476
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,079
Don't think too much about it.

477
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,160
Weiguo will need you to take care of him from now on.

478
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,720
Pull yourself together.

479
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:18,640
I know where he is.

480
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,000
It was May of 1998.

481
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,279
New York.

482
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,079
That accident was in the papers.

483
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,599
But their names were nowhere to be found in the article.

484
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,519
To this day,

485
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,000
I still don't know where they are.

486
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,680
What they were talking about when they were alive,

487
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,960
what they were doing.

488
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,920
Big Brother.

489
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,160
You ask me why I left.

490
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,039
Because I'm too darn cowardly.

491
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,759
All these years,

492
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,519
I've both hated you all

493
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,839
and felt I owed you.

494
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,440
Ma Weiguo!

495
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,599
Ma Weiguo!

496
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,440
Ma Weiguo!

497
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,160
Brought you some soda.

498
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,400
Come down!

499
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,200
Come on down.

500
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,319
Come down!

501
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,079
Down.

502
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,920
Maybe we should just let this matter go.

503
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,640
What are you all doing here?

504
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,039
Feifei called us.

505
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,200
Afraid you two would fight.

506
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,519
Brother, Weiguo.

507
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,359
Let me say one more thing.

508
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,599
All these years, I feel

509
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,480
we brothers have all had it pretty tough.

510
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,680
Let's just turn the page on some things.

511
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,279
As long as Big Brother agrees, I...

512
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:56,680
What's wrong?

513
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,119
Don't move. Turn your face away.

514
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:58,960
What is it?

515
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,960
Turn around.

516
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,480
What are you doing?

517
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:05,640
Ma Weiguo!

518
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,559
You jerk!

519
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,440
What the heck are you doing?

520
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,839
Don't hold me back!

521
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,279
What's wrong with you?

522
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:10,799
Ask him!

523
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,839
What he's done!

524
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,640
What did I do?

525
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,519
What's wrong with you?

526
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,640
You tell me what's wrong with you!

527
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,200
No, no, no.

528
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,680
Don't hold me back!

529
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,279
No, no, no!

530
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:16,839
If you have something to say, say it.

531
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,519
Don't hold me back, I'm going home.

532
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,640
No, what are you doing?

533
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,599
Which, which nerve is acting up again?

534
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,200
Are you okay?

535
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,079
Are you okay?

536
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:30,839
Don't touch me.

537
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,400
Are you alright?

538
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,839
I... I have to talk to Big Brother about him, you...

539
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,799
What's going on now?

540
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,200
What did you just say to him?

541
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,839
What's Second Brother doing?

542
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,119
You, Li Lianbao!

543
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,160
What, haven't you fought enough?

544
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,519
Come out and talk.

545
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
I'm sleeping.

546
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,519
Didn't you want to hear me apologize?

547
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,519
Will you apologize?

548
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,519
I'll be waiting for you outside.

549
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:51,839
Get in the car.

550
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,279
Speak your mind.

551
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,079
Let me treat your wound.

552
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,039
No need.

553
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,400
No treatment, no apology.

554
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,680
Go on, tell me which part to break.

555
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,319
Li Lianbao.

556
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,480
What's wrong with you?

557
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,559
There must be some misunderstanding.

558
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:50,880
A misunderstanding, huh?

559
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,079
A misunderstanding, you say?

560
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:54,960
What is it?

561
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,000
What's wrong? Are you okay?

562
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,240
You stay right there, don't move!

563
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,200
You jerk!

564
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,039
What's gotten into you?

565
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,559
Ma Weiguo.

566
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,000
You're that old.

567
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,279
Yet you target a young girl.

568
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,599
Aren't you disgusting?

569
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,039
Stop, stop, stop!

570
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,839
You should have just asked me about this.

571
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,880
There's really nothing between Jin Tong and me.

572
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,559
It's not as complicated as you think.

573
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,279
As for her and me...

574
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,440
We just met abroad.

575
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
In a bar.

576
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,880
Someone took a photo of us.

577
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,200
I felt a connection with her at the time.

578
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,519
But after that night, I couldn't find her.

579
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,480
That's all there was to it.

580
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,599
I never imagined it would be so melodramatic.

581
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,000
And she's your niece.

582
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,759
So you came back still thinking about my niece?

583
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,480
No.

584
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,799
You're trying to deny everything after having your fun, is that it?

585
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,279
I'm going to break your legs today!

586
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:43,759
Calm down.

587
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,359
Just you wait.

588
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,720
If your back is bad, maybe don't fight.

589
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,559
Alright, go back home.

590
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,640
Pulling a knife, huh?

591
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:58,000
Today, I'm definitely taking a piece of you!

592
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,480
Calm down!

593
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,680
Don't run!

594
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:25,720
What's wrong, Uncle?

595
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,480
Does this look familiar?

596
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,799
If anyone crosses me...

597
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,559
...don't blame me for going too far.

598
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,519
You went to confront him?

599
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,720
I didn't break his arms.

600
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,920
I regret it now.

601
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,240
Wait, what?

602
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,720
Why did you use a knife?

603
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,960
That's so dangerous! You didn't hurt him, did you?

604
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,039
Do you think I'm stupid?

605
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,240
If there was real blood, there'd be a lawsuit.

606
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,319
I just ruined this piece of his clothing.

607
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,119
No, Uncle...

608
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,359
Now that you've done this, how awkward is it for me?

609
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,559
How can I face him now?

610
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,839
There was nothing going on between us.

611
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,000
You call that nothing?

612
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,279
An uncle and niece were hugging and kissing!

613
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,680
That shameless...

614
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,200
I have to teach him a lesson.

615
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,680
And you, what's wrong with you?

616
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,160
A few years abroad and you play so wild?

617
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,359
Of all people, why did it have to be him?

618
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,519
Uncle, you're exaggerating a bit.

619
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,039
Besides, I didn't know before...

620
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,160
...that you two had this kind of relationship.

621
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,839
Couldn't you have found out beforehand?

622
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,160
Where was I supposed to find out?

623
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,200
If I had found out beforehand...

624
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,839
Learning to talk back, are you?

625
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,039
I... I just don't understand.

626
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,240
You two live back-to-back in the same alley.

627
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,319
What are you planning?

628
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,440
To rekindle an old flame?

629
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,599
No.

630
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,400
Do you remember that time I came home for batteries?

631
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,160
You were there, and Uncle Wang was too.

632
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,039
That was the first time I met him.

633
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,839
I'd forgotten if you hadn't mentioned it.

634
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
That day, I could tell something was off with you two.

635
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,640
Is that bastard still after you?

636
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,359
Nothing like that.

637
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,920
Nothing's even started yet.

638
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,680
And after I came back, I told him.

639
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,240
I said to leave the past in the past.

640
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,680
So you just listen to him?

641
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,759
Tongtong, listen to me.

642
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,720
Move out of here immediately.

643
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,119
Stay far away from him.

644
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,680
You can stay in either of my apartments,
the one inside the Third Ring or the Fifth Ring.

645
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,400
Whichever you like.

646
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,440
You absolutely cannot stay here.

647
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,480
That won't do.

648
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,440
I told you.

649
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,799
I still have to prepare my photography exhibition.

650
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,880
Do you believe I'll call your mom right now?

651
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,359
Uncle, you know perfectly well...

652
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,559
...how important this exhibition is to me.

653
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,200
How about this?

654
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,359
If he makes...

655
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,480
...any move on me...

656
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,680
I'll tell you immediately.

657
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,559
You can beat him up right then, okay?

658
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:35,400
Please, Uncle.

659
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,240
Uncle.

660
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,119
Uncle.

661
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,039
Just until the exhibition is over.

662
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,039
Okay, fine.

663
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,160
During that time, you'd better stay away from him.

664
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,480
I'll be watching you the whole time.

665
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,799
But when I'm working on my exhibition...

666
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,759
...there's no discussion.

667
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,160
Fine. We'll have nothing to do with each other.

668
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,039
Satisfied?

669
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:07,880
Yes, master.

670
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,359
Put it right against the wall.

671
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,720
Take it easy.

672
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:12,680
Right.

673
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:14,880
Here, master, put it here.

674
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,559
Help me put these two pots...

675
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,640
...by the window.

676
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,400
Got it, master.

677
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,279
Auntie Tong.

678
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,039
Weiguo, it's right that you moved back.

679
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,480
If you go abroad again in the future,

680
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,960
I'll keep this house for you.

681
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,680
Don't you worry.

682
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,720
Sorry for the trouble.

683
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,759
Kid.

684
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:30,799
Uncle Tong.

685
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,039
Look at this.

686
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,839
Look at all your old stuff.

687
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,440
What stuff?

688
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,960
Qiu'er kept it all for you.

689
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,960
Look, look, what a mess.

690
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,720
Quick, quick.

691
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,240
Come on, come on.

692
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,759
These are all things I collected as a kid.

693
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,160
Just throw away what's useless.

694
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,480
Oh, don't do that!

695
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,519
I'll keep it, I'll take it all.

696
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,279
Your uncle just loves picking up junk.

697
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,279
She doesn't get it, she doesn't.

698
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,240
What do you mean I don't get it?

699
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,000
Only you understand.

700
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,599
It's piled up under the bed.

701
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,640
What's the big deal? What's the big deal?

702
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,200
That's the memory of an era.

703
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,759
What era memory?

704
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,400
It's not food or drink.

705
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,599
Lighting a fire for the stove...

706
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,359
...wouldn't even boil a kettle.

707
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,960
What's the point of telling you this?

708
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,519
You don't understand.

709
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,240
Who understands like you do, you old man.

710
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,960
It's fine, it's fine.

711
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,839
By the way.

712
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,319
This room...

713
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
...I think it's a bit damp.

714
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,279
You should find a renovation master...

715
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,519
...to help you fix it up.

716
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,960
Otherwise, it's not livable.

717
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,000
Auntie Tong.

718
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,400
I don't plan for anyone to live here.

719
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,359
Not live here?

720
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,359
Then what for?

721
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,680
I'm going to convert it into a toilet.

722
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,960
Convert it into a toilet?

723
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
I've researched it long ago.

724
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,799
High-tech and eco-friendly.

725
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,960
Electric blade shreds it, goes down the drain.

726
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,640
You're everywhere, this old man.

727
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,279
It's fine, it's fine.

728
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:38,559
Really.

729
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,359
Auntie Tong, you go rest.

730
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:39,759
Okay.

731
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,079
Come on, go rest a bit.

732
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,720
Okay.

733
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,880
Come on, come on, master, here.

734
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,519
Alright, okay.

735
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,599
Here, easy, easy, easy.

736
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,279
Come on, come on.

737
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,240
Weiguo.

738
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,319
Your uncle won't take your stuff for free, you...

739
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,799
...how is this like Sun Wukong?

740
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,559
This... and a bunch of little monkey kings next to it.

741
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,599
You're exactly like your dad when he was young.

742
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:05,640
Your head's full of strange ideas.

743
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,039
This.

744
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:12,839
This here is a letter your dad wrote to me.

745
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,359
Treasure it well.

746
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,480
These two notebooks are my records...

747
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,680
...of some stories from our alley.

748
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,799
Here, look.

749
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,440
Originally,

750
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,839
I wanted to train Qiu'er as my successor.

751
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,039
Now it seems he's not cut out for it, is he?

752
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,599
Back when you went abroad, you were young.

753
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,839
Now it seems just right.

754
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,279
Thank you, Uncle Tong. I'll keep them.

755
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,599
You're welcome.

756
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,519
See.

757
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,000
Brother Daxi

758
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,359
Give my regards to your family

759
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,680
The past few days of travel were exhausting

760
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,240
Only today have I settled down

761
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,960
Though I have no time to reply

762
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,559
I miss you dearly

763
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,839
It's been a week since I was transferred to Shanghai for training

764
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,599
Now past thirty

765
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,880
I can't help but lament my ability to learn

766
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,400
It's truly not what it used to be

767
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:03,480
Thinking about working and living abroad in the future

768
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,519
I can't help but feel some panic in my heart

769
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:07,319
And even more reluctance

770
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,559
Yesterday by the Huangpu River

771
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Looking at the lush greenery on the opposite bank

772
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,760
Sparsely dotted with construction sites

773
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,599
I wonder, when I revisit this place

774
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,840
What will it look like then?

775
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,280
I guess

776
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,079
Probably everywhere will be filled with

777
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,559
Five or six-story tall buildings

778
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,360
Elder Brother

779
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,079
These two banks of the river

780
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,599
Seem like our two generations

781
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,239
Hardship on this side

782
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,280
The future on that side

783
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,000
Tell me

784
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,119
When the children grow up

785
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,679
What will these letters between them

786
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,639
Talk about then?

787
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,960
I'll stop here for now

788
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,440
There's work to be done at hand again

789
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,880
I'll write to you slowly later

790
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,119
Short letter, deep affection

791
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,960
Wishing you all the best

792
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,760
Your younger brother, Zhiyuan

793
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,519
April 10, 1986

794
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,400
Third Uncle

795
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,400
Third Uncle

796
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,880
Come in, the door's unlocked

797
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,199
Third Uncle

798
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,320
How come you're not worried at all?

799
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,480
I've been waiting for you

800
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,800
To give me the second treatment

801
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,199
You haven't forgotten about me, have you?

802
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,800
Don't be in such a hurry

803
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,960
Your illness has deep roots

804
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,360
I need to think it over carefully

805
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:14,639
Alright

806
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,199
However

807
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,559
I now have a preliminary idea

808
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,519
So how do you plan to treat me?

809
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,719
It's not that spending money thing again, is it?

810
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,519
To be honest

811
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:27,519
Spending money felt great at first

812
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,960
But later on, the more I spent

813
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,000
The less fun it became

814
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,280
Don't worry

815
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,960
I'll definitely give you a big surprise

816
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,800
Once I've figured it out

817
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,719
I'll tell you

818
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,639
Okay then

819
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,519
I'll wait for your news

820
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,679
You should rest early

821
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,480
I'll head back now

822
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,039
What have your dad and the others been up to lately?

823
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,280
My dad?

824
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,960
You don't know yet, right?

825
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,239
It's Second Uncle

826
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,559
He's been egging my dad on

827
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:51,360
To use Penglexuan to start a business together

828
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,960
He really knows how to dream

829
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,239
But my dad shot him down

830
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,159
With my dad being so lazy

831
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,559
He simply can't be bothered to go through the hassle

832
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,119
That Second Uncle of yours

833
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,239
Has no good points

834
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,199
Except for one thing

835
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,679
Once he sets his mind on something

836
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,960
He absolutely will not give up

837
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,000
He'll keep pestering your dad

838
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,920
Yeah

839
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,920
This new wine in the shop is good. Try it.

840
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,480
You're really giving it to me?

841
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,719
I'll try it.

842
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,400
You'll try it just because I told you to?

843
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,760
What did the doctor say?

844
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,159
Do you even want to get better?

845
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,199
Aren't you being ridiculous?

846
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,760
If you want to drink it yourself, then drink it yourself.

847
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,239
You're so bored you're teasing me.

848
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,880
I'm testing you.

849
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,800
Annoying.

850
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,320
Weiguo even took leave and stayed for our Feifei.

851
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,039
That's why I say...

852
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:46,119
You can only rely on your own brothers.

853
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,239
It shows...

854
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,559
He still has me, his big brother, in his heart.

855
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,840
Oh, come off it.

856
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,480
A toad on the main road...

857
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,039
Pretending to be a colorful little jeep.

858
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,159
Stop with all that sour, grumbling talk.

859
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,199
Why isn't Feifei up yet? Feifei!

860
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:02,880
Feifei!

861
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,559
Feifei! Dinner's ready!

862
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,480
Can he even hear us from here?

863
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,760
My voice is loud.

864
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:13,920
Finished your homework?

865
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
Homework's done.

866
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm telling you, you're not allowed to drink.

867
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,920
I won't drink.

868
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,800
Then who are you pouring it for?

869
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,519
Alright, alright.

870
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,679
What? You're just pouring it for your dad?

871
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,039
Mom, it's fine.

872
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,599
Dad will just take a tiny sip, right?

873
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,360
What tiny sip? You...

874
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,960
What's this? Need a favor from me?

875
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,480
No.

876
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,360
Well...

877
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,760
Third Uncle told me...

878
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,960
That from now on, I'll learn from him.

879
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,159
I have to listen to him in everything.

880
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,440
I have to do whatever he tells me to do.

881
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,519
He said you and Mom can't interfere either.

882
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,880
He really said that?

883
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:51,800
Yeah.

884
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:58,599
Fine. Trust is the most important thing.

885
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,239
Right.

886
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:00,320
As long as you promise...

887
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,360
To take the college entrance exam.

888
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And study hard.

889
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,599
Then we'll give him our full trust.

890
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,320
Okay. Since Third Uncle said so...

891
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,000
You don't need to manage me anymore, right?

892
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,280
What do you mean I don't need to manage you?

893
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,840
I'm your dad. If I don't manage you...

894
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,480
Would you have grown up this big?

895
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:18,199
Let me tell you...

896
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,599
His is a foreign system.

897
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,639
Mine is a traditional Chinese cultural system.

898
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,519
We'll give you a Chinese-Western fusion.

899
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,440
I'm going.

900
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,039
Son, serve the rice.

901
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:33,679
Going to study.

902
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,800
I ate a small burger this afternoon.

903
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,840
I'm okay. You guys eat.

904
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,119
Good. He knows to study now.

905
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,079
Isn't that right?

906
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,599
Second Brother said he's coming to see you tomorrow.

907
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,480
Aren't you and Qianqian discussing a partnership?

908
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,199
He heard a rumor from somewhere.

909
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,400
Said he's coming to keep an eye on you.

910
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,880
Why keep an eye on me?

911
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,239
Would Qianqian harm me?

912
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,159
Tell me...

913
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,239
Could Second Brother and Qianqian get together?

914
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,360
Those two...

915
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,440
Look, today you argue with me.

916
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,360
Tomorrow I argue with you.

917
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,559
That's how they do it in TV dramas.

918
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,199
These two people...

919
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,760
They argue and argue and end up together.

920
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,239
TV dramas are made up.

921
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,079
But if they do get together...

922
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,559
It would actually be pretty good.

923
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,199
Think about it.

924
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,599
Qianqian has a son.

925
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:20,800
Lianbao has a daughter.

926
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,119
If those two get together...

927
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:23,039
It makes the character for "good."

928
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,440
Right, a son and a daughter.

929
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,079
Exactly.

930
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,119
I'll just dip the very tip of my chopstick.

931
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,480
This wine is so fragrant.

932
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,760
Seriously, aren't you something.

933
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,639
You keep tempting me with it.

934
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,599
Where are you going?

935
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,920
I'm going to eat over there.

936
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,079
You think if you go over there...

937
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,960
You won't crave this wine anymore?

938
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:53,519
Wang Chunsheng.

939
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,000
Wang Chunsheng.

940
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,840
This wine is really fragrant.

941
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,159
Last time, I had you two

942
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,440
help me give feedback on the script.

943
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,360
The effect was fantastic.

944
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,679
The Beijing dialect was spot on.

945
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,800
Oh, right. Take a look.

946
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,039
This is my creative output from the last couple of days.

947
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:27,920
Take a look.

948
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,039
Look, look.

949
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:32,800
As for me,

950
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,159
I'd also like to invite you two to accompany me to a meeting.

951
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:37,760
A meeting?

952
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,559
Yes.

953
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,280
I've arranged to meet with a top person from a platform.

954
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,639
This guy,

955
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,760
don't let his young age fool you.

956
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,159
He's an absolute fox, a real operator.

957
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,519
He'd squeeze blood from a stone.

958
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,199
We need to knock his arrogance down a peg.

959
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,239
Otherwise,

960
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,920
the price for my script

961
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,639
will be driven way down by him.

962
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,320
Grandpa Tong, you mean...

963
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,320
My meaning is,

964
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,559
I'm asking you two to do me a favor.

965
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:06,000
Accompany me in putting on a show.

966
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,320
Let them see how impressive I am with two assistants.

967
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,760
I've even thought of the division of labor.

968
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,840
You handle business, okay?

969
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,440
At the meeting, you keep making calls.

970
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,440
You say, "Teacher Daxi

971
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,280
is very busy lately.

972
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,719
His schedule is completely full.

973
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:25,280
Booked solid until the end of next year."

974
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:26,880
As for you,

975
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,320
you handle lifestyle, right?

976
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,480
You just keep

977
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,199
handing me this thermos cup.

978
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,159
You tell him,

979
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,000
"This was a gift from President Ma.

980
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,280
Old mountain ginseng from Changbai Mountain.

981
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:39,440
And he has to drink it daily, and while it's hot."

982
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,440
Hold on, Uncle Tong.

983
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,440
These are all old tricks.

984
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,679
If your thinking

985
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:47,280
is still stuck twenty years in the past,

986
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,719
it'll be hard for you to keep writing.

987
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,760
What do you mean by that?

988
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,880
Uncle Ma's words are truly

989
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,679
equally unpleasant to everyone.

990
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,039
I'm just telling the truth.

991
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,960
It's okay, Grandpa Tong.

992
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,800
I, alone,

993
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,159
can do the work of two people.

994
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:05,760
You're still the best.

995
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:08,039
So it's settled, okay?

996
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:09,800
Okay, no problem. Good.

997
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,000
Good.
