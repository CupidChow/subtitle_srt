1
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,120
Mr. Martin's life began with

2
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,000
his most enduring quality: kindness.

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,920
From Goldman Sachs to Morgan Stanley,

4
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,040
from investment bank partner to Nasdaq bell-ringer,

5
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,640
such a life has only one ending:

6
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,640
decomposition into inorganic salts, carbon dioxide, and water.

7
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,000
And I

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,719
seem to have reached this day.

9
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,159
How faith and hope begin with oneself

10
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,920
and then flow to others.

11
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,879
He shared a better version of himself with us,

12
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,359
promises,

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,319
happiness,

14
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,680
and love.

15
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,599
May the deceased rest in peace.

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,639
Lying in a coffin doesn't necessarily mean peace.

17
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,000
See this strange little peak on the deathbed ECG?

18
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,039
This isn't some final rally.

19
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,879
It's this little tormentor, like a black square,

20
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,000
telling you,

21
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,319
"You're not off work yet."

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,840
What's up, Kong Liang?

23
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,479
Mr. Ma.

24
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,080
The meeting is about to start.

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,159
Jack is already here.

26
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,400
Mr. Zhang will be here shortly.

27
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,439
Is everything ready?

28
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,520
Everything is ready.

29
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,120
Alright, I'll be right there.

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,400
Martin.

31
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,759
How are you feeling?

32
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,479
Keep the doves.

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,319
But lose the choir and the pastor.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,599
The list of friends and relatives attending the funeral,

35
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,800
please give it to us as soon as possible.

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,960
Especially those from China, we need to prepare in advance.

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
No one will attend.

38
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,400
How is that possible?

39
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,400
It's inconvenient to come from China, fine.

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,120
But you've been in the US for so many years.

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,000
You're a senior executive at a big company.

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,560
Don't you have any friends?

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,120
Not needed, thank you.

44
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,960
Don't you have any friends?

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,879
My God.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,879
This is in Manhattan, New York.

47
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,199
The most artificial,

48
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,719
most impersonal street in the world.

49
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,879
Hearing the funeral director mention the word "friend"

50
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,479
feels like something from a past life to me.

51
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,840
I once had friends too.

52
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,159
Though now we are estranged,

53
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,199
they wouldn't even attend my funeral.

54
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,080
But looking back now,

55
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,360
the happiest times of my life

56
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,439
were running with them every day in Baofang Hutong,

57
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,439
those days of youthful ignorance.

58
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,159
It seemed like it was always summer then.

59
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,000
Arctic Ocean soda,

60
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,199
big watermelons soaking in Houhai Lake.

61
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,919
On the last day of my life,

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,000
I actually find myself missing it quite a bit.

63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,960
By the way,

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,879
I heard my three brothers

65
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,680
are now doing quite well back in China.

66
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,439
Our Chinese culture is profound

67
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,120
and has a long history.

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,759
Now, I will use this bowl of congee

69
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,560
to offer you all my most sincere blessings.

70
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,000
Working at a big tech firm,

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,240
reaching middle management.

72
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,680
He might be a smooth, versatile business genius.

73
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,439
This

74
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,879
represents the two focal points of the Yin-Yang symbol.

75
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,480
Symbolizing unique insight and foresight.

76
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,199
Or perhaps

77
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:24,920
First, for you two.

78
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,319
he's a scheming workplace expert.

79
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:26,879
As the saying goes,

80
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,519
"Solitary Yin does not grow, lone Yang does not birth."

81
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,199
This cycle of Yin and Yang

82
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,279
is what brings harmony and stability.

83
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,920
Our Director Liu's work

84
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,240
is of utmost importance.

85
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,160
Forget it, I can't keep this up.

86
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,759
You flatter me, no, no.

87
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,000
To be honest,

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,199
he's really stupid, dull, and annoying.

89
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,720
You're too kind.

90
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,360
And hyper-masculine.

91
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,600
Let me tell you this.

92
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,959
We,

93
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,759
Cambridge, Harvard, Oxford...

94
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,639
Our Wang Fei,

95
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,959
his academic performance is absolutely no problem.

96
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,959
A top bird, a duck king for the ages.

97
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,560
Alright then.

98
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Okay, thank you for your trouble.

99
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,279
Don't misunderstand, he's the descendant of a famous chef.

100
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,639
And he does have some skills.

101
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,800
One for scrubbing pots, one for brushing oil.

102
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,399
Come on, lift your shirt.

103
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,839
The gel is a bit cold.

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,120
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,279
Are you embarrassed?

106
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,759
No, it's just... we're too familiar, you know?

107
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,839
Director Qiu, I'm at the door.

108
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,040
The door is closed. Are you inside?

109
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,759
The previous one was for preparing the duck.

110
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,560
Okay, okay.

111
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,600
This one now is for slacking off.

112
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,240
But it seems

113
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,079
Let me see...

114
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,839
he never slacks off at the right time.

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,319
Trying to discuss wealth management with these people,

116
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,480
I'm afraid you won't get out without losing a layer of skin.

117
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
Fishing in troubled waters, be careful not to twist your ankle.

118
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,199
Sisters, let's get hyped!

119
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,079
Hello.

120
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,720
Is Director Qiu in?

121
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,319
You... who are you looking for?

122
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,399
Looking for Director Qiu.

123
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,759
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

124
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,839
I'll go find her for you.

125
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,680
Unfortunately,

126
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,079
that matter between me and them

127
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,399
ultimately had no chance to be resolved.

128
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,519
Hello, Martin.

129
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,199
Good morning.

130
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,959
Director Zhang.

131
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,959
We reviewed the data from the past two years.

132
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,399
Under Martin's leadership,

133
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,680
business growth has been very slow.

134
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,639
This is complete inaction.

135
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,720
I propose

136
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,800
the board dismisses Martin from his position.

137
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,800
That old fool Jack

138
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,839
probably still thinks he has the upper hand.

139
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,879
He thinks he bribed my people,

140
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,240
little does he know

141
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,480
the words in their hands

142
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,439
and the evidence in their pockets

143
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,160
were all fuses I handed over.

144
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,879
Martin,

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,319
you set me up.

146
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,560
Fine.

147
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,759
Spare me this once, okay?

148
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,879
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,800
Idiot, get back to your country.

150
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,560
But as you wish.

151
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,360
I kind of regret it.

152
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,639
I should feel sympathy for old Jack right now.

153
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,720
His situation is truly difficult.

154
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,439
But,

155
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,680
what does it have to do with me?

156
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,480
Sympathizing with others

157
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,800
declares your innocence,

158
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,680
but it also declares your incompetence.

159
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,399
Moreover,

160
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,920
how can the last day of your life

161
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,199
be so undignified?

162
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,199
I'm Coy Wire.

163
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,319
Welcome to CNN 10.

164
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,360
Today's show is packed with great content.

165
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,519
We bring it to you right now.

166
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,519
First, focusing on the Gulf of Mexico,

167
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,319
a tropical storm is forming

168
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,360
and poses a serious threat to the southeastern US.

169
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,199
The National Hurricane Center says

170
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,360
this weather system will rapidly intensify

171
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,920
and quickly upgrade to Hurricane Helen.

172
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,000
Florida is on high alert,

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,959
potentially facing the season's strongest US hurricane.

174
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,279
The Florida Keys could experience

175
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,279
tropical storm-force winds as early as this afternoon.

176
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,800
The hurricane is expected to make landfall in the state tomorrow evening.

177
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,240
This will be the fourth hurricane to hit the US this year.

178
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,120
Mr. Martin,

179
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,240
I'm Evans.

180
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,279
I'd like to confirm with you one last time.

181
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,839
Are you sure you want to donate all your assets?

182
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,799
Martin,

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,360
in your brainstem,

184
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,000
a glioma lesion has been discovered.

185
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,919
Surgery is recommended immediately.

186
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,639
If the nerves can be spared

187
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,759
and the lesion successfully removed,

188
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,759
then you can live normally,

189
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,840
just like before.

190
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,480
But the surgery is extremely difficult.

191
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
If anything goes wrong,

192
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,679
you could become paralyzed

193
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,919
or fall into a vegetative state.

194
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:01,720
Ma Weiguo!

195
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,039
Who do you think you are to talk about making peace?

196
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,240
Stop fighting! Stop!

197
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,759
Someone's dead!

198
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,639
Ma Weiguo!

199
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,120
How can you leave and face us three brothers who stood up for you?

200
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,679
If you dare leave, we sever all ties!

201
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,759
Alright, I admit it.

202
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,240
The world still has some kindness.

203
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,559
You're not just remembered by work calls,

204
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,919
but also by

205
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,440
debt collectors.

206
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,759
Hello?

207
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,559
Weiguo, you need to come back right away.

208
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,399
Aunt is critically ill.

209
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,720
What?

210
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
Emotional debt

211
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,159
is still debt.

212
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,840
An old knot in a Beijing hutong,

213
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
the tighter it's tied,

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,200
after twenty years,

215
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,559
the more painful it is to untie.

216
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,879
Back then, young Ma left carrying an old canvas bag,

217
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,440
without even looking back.

218
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,960
Wishing he could shake off the hutong's shadow.

219
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,159
Word came from home.

220
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,559
The aunt who doted on him back then is fading.

221
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,360
People,

222
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,759
they fear being just in time.

223
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,200
You can dodge time,

224
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,240
but there's always something

225
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,879
that's a hook in your fate.

226
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,080
When it pulls you back,

227
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,879
your own days are already numbered.

228
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,360
Goodbye, Aunt.

229
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,320
Goodbye.

230
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,720
Let me walk you out.

231
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,679
I'll make you something good to eat.

232
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,480
You stay with Aunt, Fang.

233
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,200
It's okay.

234
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,000
Second Brother, oh right.

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,759
Thank you for the private room.

236
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,360
It wasn't me.

237
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,080
It's nothing.

238
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Really, thank you.

239
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,480
It's fine.

240
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,639
You stay with your mom.

241
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,440
It's okay, I'll see you out.

242
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,360
The critical condition notice was issued three times.

243
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,000
Although she's stable now,

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,399
the doctor says we must still avoid major emotional swings.

245
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,879
Fang, hurry back inside.

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,480
It's okay, it's okay, don't worry.

247
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,799
Going home is really not easy.

248
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,000
On the plane back to the country,

249
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,080
I wondered if I should leave immediately after seeing Aunt,

250
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,240
and return right away.

251
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
Or should I stay for a day

252
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,519
to settle old scores with the three of them?

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,120
Or perhaps,

254
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,679
I should return to my roots,

255
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,960
and wait for my grand finale in this city.

256
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,879
I don't know.

257
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,120
There were countless reasons I used to convince myself,

258
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,759
"What a pity,

259
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,240
I can't go back to Beijing this time either."

260
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,799
Because the ticket is too expensive.

261
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,240
Because I can't get time off.

262
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,600
Because I'm too tired.

263
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,720
I want to rest.

264
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,639
Only now do I understand.

265
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,120
When it comes down to it,

266
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,360
the hardest part

267
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,039
has always been lacking the courage to go home.

268
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,519
You just got back.

269
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,480
If there's anything you don't understand, just ask me.

270
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,080
Auntie Tong.

271
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,679
Here, fried dough. Eat it while it's hot.

272
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,360
Thanks.

273
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,519
Stop chatting, the steamed buns are here.

274
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,080
Did you eat your egg?

275
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,639
I did.

276
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm working on it.

277
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,240
Need to get your protein.

278
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,200
Look.

279
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,840
Nine outer, seven inner, and four imperial gates.

280
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,639
Each gate...

281
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,679
Chunsheng.

282
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,000
Chunsheng!

283
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,600
Stop practicing, it's time.

284
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,720
Coming!

285
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:19,960
Mom.

286
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
You haven't left yet?

287
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,559
Wait, is he going today?

288
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,080
You... don't worry about it.

289
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,159
I'll discuss it with him in a bit.

290
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,080
You just came back from studying in the US.

291
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
For your photography exhibition...

292
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,879
You should photograph our Baofang Hutong.

293
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,000
Uncle Tong.

294
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,399
When will you finish writing that new episode script?

295
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,919
I'm eager to read it.

296
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,919
Write what? I'm not writing.

297
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,000
I was right at a crucial point in writing...

298
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,919
And you forced me to come out for breakfast.

299
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,799
Jing'er, two more baskets of buns for me.

300
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,879
Are two baskets enough?

301
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,720
It's enough, plus these three baskets already.

302
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,440
Uncle Tong, Auntie Tong.

303
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,159
Morning.

304
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,120
Morning, morning, morning.

305
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,279
Uncle Wang, morning.

306
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,120
Morning.

307
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,120
Adding two more baskets?

308
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,679
Didn't you say you were dieting?

309
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,960
Young lady.

310
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,639
Don't listen to his nonsense all day long.

311
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,080
There aren't any stories.

312
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,080
Let's go.

313
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,720
Your Uncle Lianbao, Uncle Wang, and their brothers...

314
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,279
They had lots of stories back in the day.

315
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll tell you all about it later.

316
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,840
The story of the Four Baofang Brothers.

317
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,480
It can't exceed five bricks here.

318
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,320
It has to be knocked down.

319
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,799
Over there, that's enough, that's enough.

320
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,919
Everyone, quiet down please.

321
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,320
Perfect timing, let me say a few words.

322
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,039
Unauthorized construction will definitely be strictly investigated.

323
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,600
No ambiguity about it.

324
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,679
Qiu'er.

325
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:28,720
You're renting the house from Ma Weiguo's family.

326
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,960
But this storage room...

327
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,120
It's not on the property deed.

328
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,480
This was built by Weiguo's father...

329
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,559
...himself back then, right?

330
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,039
Yes, but that was over ten years ago.

331
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:38,960
And you still have to tear it down now?

332
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,519
Of course it has to be torn down.

333
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,240
It's a mistake.

334
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,720
A mistake can't become correct...

335
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,000
...just because a long time has passed, right?

336
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,639
Yes, yes, yes.

337
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,159
Qiu'er, Qiu'er, Qiu'er.

338
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,159
Don't argue with them.

339
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,159
If it needs to be torn down, tear it down. Listen to the neighborhood committee.

340
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,320
The eldest brother is still the sensible one.

341
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,960
Qiu'er.

342
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,080
Later, you take care of this trash...

343
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,960
...yourself.

344
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,759
Got it.

345
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,639
Might as well get rid of myself along with it.

346
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,159
He's just being stubborn.

347
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:58,559
Don't say anymore.

348
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,519
This is the district's directive.

349
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,159
Yes, yes, yes.

350
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,120
Alright, let's all head back.

351
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
You few, come with me.

352
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,559
There are a few more households waiting to be dealt with.

353
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,519
This afternoon, after I finish my business...

354
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,799
...I'll help you clean this up.

355
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,720
I'd better get a promotion and raise quickly.

356
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,799
Then, in this hutong, I'll...

357
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,399
...find another room to rent.

358
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,320
Master Wang.

359
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,919
I've wanted to contact you for a long time.

360
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,120
But Wang Fei always said you weren't available.

361
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
That you were unwell.

362
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,279
That kid.

363
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:27,320
I... I actually don't have any major issues.

364
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,840
Minor problems, nothing serious.

365
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,759
That's good then.

366
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,320
Um, Teacher Wang.

367
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,159
Look.

368
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,240
Look, I brought you a duck.

369
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,799
Please take it.

370
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,639
No, no, that won't do.

371
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,080
No, this... this is fine.

372
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,559
This duck is especially delicious, I'm telling you.

373
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,440
That still won't do.

374
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,960
We have strict rules. Thank you.

375
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,039
Look, this, this, this...

376
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,080
Take a look.

377
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,840
Master Wang.

378
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,559
Your wife had a phone call with me.

379
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,159
Some circumstances...

380
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,039
...she might not be able to explain to you clearly right away.

381
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,519
It's like this, Master Wang.

382
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:02,080
High school learning is different...

383
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,120
...from previous learning.

384
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,119
Not adapting is also a very normal situation.

385
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,039
As for this child...

386
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,359
Although right now...

387
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,079
...there's been this little hiccup.

388
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,720
But the studies are so intense now.

389
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,599
He was directly admitted in junior high.

390
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,960
And he was a "Three-Good Student" every year.

391
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,480
An outstanding Young Pioneer. How could he...

392
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,799
We were thinking...

393
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,240
...for now, let's not disturb him.

394
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,000
After he gets directly admitted to university...

395
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,079
...then we can slowly guide him.

396
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,559
You see, right?

397
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:35,359
It's just that Wang Fei's Chinese scores have always been okay.

398
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,319
That's true.

399
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,960
But the overall situation...

400
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,640
...is actually not very ideal.

401
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,880
Then...

402
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,119
With his current academic performance...

403
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,680
...what kind of university can he get into?

404
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,640
Actually, getting into university for him...

405
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,480
...isn't the only path either.

406
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,559
Lianbao, going to see your brother?

407
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,119
Yeah.

408
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,119
Big brother, sister-in-law.

409
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,799
What's wrong? Are you sick?

410
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,079
Uh, um...

411
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,160
What's going on?

412
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,960
Your big brother is here waiting to catch Feifei.

413
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,279
We've even cleared the area.

414
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,920
To avoid hurting any innocent bystanders.

415
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,799
My face...

416
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,680
This time it's completely unsalvageable.

417
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,200
And here I am, bragging to everyone all the time.

418
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,880
"He studies well, no worries."

419
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,799
"Getting into college is a sure thing."

420
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,799
I've been accompanying him, supporting him.

421
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,440
And scaring him a little.

422
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
I thought these last couple of years...

423
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,359
He's grown up, right?

424
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,279
I'd give him some freedom, let him be more independent.

425
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,079
And he studies like this? He even skips school!

426
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,839
Nothing else.

427
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,200
He's just asking for a beating.

428
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,880
No, no, no.

429
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,960
Big brother, calm down.

430
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,400
Let me have a drink of water.

431
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,839
You can't manage a child like this.

432
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:07,599
Have some water.

433
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,359
Sister-in-law.

434
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,000
Go make a couple of side dishes.

435
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,200
I'll have a couple of drinks with big brother.

436
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,519
A couple of drinks will make it better.

437
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,920
Alright, alright, alright.

438
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,440
Big brother, get up.

439
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,240
It's not that big a deal. It's not worth it.

440
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,880
Feifei's all grown up now.

441
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,400
You little brat!

442
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,000
What's going on?

443
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:27,799
Big brother.

444
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,680
You stop right there!

445
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,920
What's happening?

446
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,480
Dad.

447
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
No, no, you can't use that.

448
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,359
You, you use this instead.

449
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,079
Use a plastic one.

450
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:33,599
Take this.

451
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,039
Feifei, you run, now!

452
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,200
If I don't beat you to death today...

453
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,559
I'll write my surname "Wang" upside down!

454
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,279
Right, it's still "Wang".

455
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:38,640
Stop!

456
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,039
Hurry up and run!

457
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:41,920
Qiu'er, no...

458
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,720
Are you okay, Dad?

459
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,319
Oldest brother, stop chasing him!

460
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,440
Don't break other people's stuff!

461
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,440
You little punk!

462
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,559
I'll beat you to death!

463
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,160
Weiguo.

464
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,960
Weiguo.

465
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,519
Big brother, second brother.

466
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,920
Weiguo is back.

467
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,640
Second brother, second brother!

468
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,000
No, what are you doing?

469
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,039
Second brother! Second brother!

470
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,119
What are you doing?

471
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,599
Don't hold me back, I have to hit him!

472
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,079
What are you doing?

473
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,160
Second brother, you...

474
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,720
Well, well, Ma Weiguo.

475
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,519
Coming alone to face us. Got guts.

476
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,839
Trying to be a hero?

477
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,519
Where are your buddies?

478
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,720
Where's Li Lianbao?

479
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,039
I came to make peace.

480
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,880
Make peace?

481
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,119
Who do you think you are?

482
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,880
Ma Weiguo, let's go, charge!

483
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,319
Let's go!

484
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,000
Alright, let me hear it. How do you make peace?

485
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,480
Stop fighting! Stop!

486
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,880
Stop fighting! Stop!

487
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:06,839
Chunsheng.

488
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,359
Big brother, big brother, don't!

489
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,880
No, no, no!

490
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,240
No, brother, brother!

491
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:13,599
Brother, brother!

492
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,119
No, don't get serious!

493
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,960
Second brother.

494
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,279
Let me help you back.

495
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,200
Weiguo.

496
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,000
Qiu'er, go quickly.

497
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,160
Keep an eye on him.

498
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,640
Weiguo.

499
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,240
Uncle Tong.

500
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,839
Auntie Tong.

501
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,519
Sister-in-law.

502
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,319
Alright, let's go, go, go!

503
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,880
What's going on?

504
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,640
You, you, you...

505
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,720
Let the brothers talk a bit more.

506
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,440
Let them talk first.

507
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:19,319
Alright, alright.

508
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,039
Let's go, go.

509
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,839
Talk then.

510
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,559
Tomorrow at noon, twelve o'clock.

511
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,400
The four of us.

512
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,359
Let's have a meal together.

513
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,880
I'll text the location to Tong Qiu.

514
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,039
Weiguo, you just got back.

515
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,640
Come on, come on, have some tea.

516
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,640
Sit down and talk slowly. Come on, quick.

517
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,480
It's fine, sister-in-law.

518
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,400
Isn't this a good thing?

519
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,240
Us four brothers, after all these years...

520
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,799
What do you mean 'four brothers'?

521
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
It's always been three brothers, okay?

522
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,799
So what?

523
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,480
Are you going or not?

524
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,400
No.

525
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,799
I've said it before, that person is dead to me.

526
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,640
Get me some ice.

527
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,839
That's enough of this.

528
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:15,039
So many years have passed.

529
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,079
This matter still isn't over?

530
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,039
A human life is right there.

531
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,119
How can it be over?

532
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,279
No, how did this bastard come back?

533
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,119
I knew it was you.

534
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,880
Why are you so angry?

535
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,279
Aren't we brothers?

536
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,599
How are we brothers?

537
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,039
Fine then, childhood friends.

538
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,039
As childhood friends, he's back.

539
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,920
Shouldn't we give him a chance to turn over a new leaf?

540
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,920
And he said having a meal...

541
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,279
Is to apologize to us.

542
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,799
So an apology settles everything?

543
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,160
Then what?

544
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,359
Should Weiguo kowtow to you as well?

545
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,000
No.

546
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,680
Qiu'er is right, isn't he?

547
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,920
Auntie must have missed Weiguo terribly all these years.

548
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,160
And aren't we all family?

549
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,240
Now that he's finally back...

550
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,319
We should meet, and this meal should happen.

551
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,880
Can you stop meddling here?

552
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,319
Wang Chunsheng!

553
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,440
Your foot doesn't hurt anymore, you've got energy now, huh?

554
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,519
Let me tell you, what happened earlier isn't over.

555
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,359
I don't care anymore. Go if you want, don't if you don't.

556
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:28,119
Sister-in-law, don't be angry.

557
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,720
Let me ask one more time.

558
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,119
Are you going tomorrow?

559
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:38,920
No.

560
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,440
Yes.

561
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,880
Big brother.

562
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,279
I want to see what that bastard is up to.

563
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,960
Wang Fei.

564
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,240
Where's Wang Fei?

565
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,599
He went back first.

566
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,839
Send me the address.

567
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,759
Got it.

568
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,640
You know their aunt...

569
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,720
...used to have a son named Xu Liang.

570
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,000
He was even younger than Tong Qiu.

571
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,319
Ever since he was little,

572
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,839
he loved following Weiguo around.

573
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,000
Over twenty years ago,

574
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,759
these four brothers had a sworn enemy in Baofang Hutong.

575
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,079
His name was Scarface Xue.

576
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,039
One day,

577
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,440
someone saw Weiguo

578
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,240
get cornered by Scarface Xue's gang in a grove.

579
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,400
Chunsheng got word of it.

580
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,960
He took Lianbao and Tong Qiu.

581
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,359
The two groups got into a brawl.

582
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,480
Somehow,

583
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,880
that kid had followed them that time.

584
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,039
He got hit once.

585
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,000
Just like that, he was gone.

586
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,640
Later, Scarface Xue lost an eye

587
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,759
when Chunsheng blinded him.

588
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:51,000
After that fight,

589
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,680
all their lives took a turn.

590
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,039
Chunsheng got the heaviest sentence.

591
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,279
He was sentenced to two years.

592
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,440
Weiguo was criminally detained

593
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,799
and expelled from school.

594
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,640
Lianbao lost his guaranteed university spot.

595
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,000
Tong Qiu got a disciplinary record.

596
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,039
Their aunt, heartbroken,

597
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:10,440
stayed in the hospital for a long time.

598
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,920
For many years,

599
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,480
she didn't speak to them.

600
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:20,240
Even though no one wanted it,

601
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,599
this incident

602
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,759
did start because of Weiguo.

603
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,559
But he himself...

604
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,799
...just silently went abroad alone.

605
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,200
He never contacted the three brothers again.

606
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,720
It's heartbreaking.

607
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,039
I'm fine. Go back.

608
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,079
Go back.

609
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,519
Aunt.

610
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,519
Weiguo.

611
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,440
It's been over twenty years.

612
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,599
You still won't forgive me.

613
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,519
I know.

614
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,440
Take good care of yourself.

615
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,799
You need to look forward.

616
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,519
Right, Weiguo?

617
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
After all these years, this matter...

618
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,599
...can be let go.

619
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,119
It's good you could leave home.

620
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,119
Not missing home is even better.

621
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,880
It means you've truly grown up.

622
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,720
Aunt doesn't blame you.

623
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,880
Xu Liang certainly wouldn't blame you either.

624
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,160
So don't blame yourself anymore.

625
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,000
I've been to death's door myself.

626
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,119
It's time to let go.

627
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,319
It's good you're back.

628
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,960
It's good you're back.

629
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,599
You brothers have cleared the air.

630
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,240
You're still good brothers.

631
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:42,880
I'm sorry.

632
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,000
I've thought it over and over,

633
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,960
and there's no one who can truly take this on.

634
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,000
I left in a huff back then, cleanly.

635
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,440
Now, looking back,

636
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,119
I've become all alone.

637
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,559
For the rest of Aunt's life...

638
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,480
...must I, someone nearly in the grave,

639
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,480
still worry with my dying breath?

640
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,680
Remember what you said as kids?

641
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:19,119
You'd take care of me together in my old age.

642
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,279
Aunt is old now.

643
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,519
I just hope you four can make peace.

644
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,680
Have a drink with me.

645
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,400
Didn't the doctor tell you not to drink?

646
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,039
No, it's...

647
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,279
Your hair, these highlights need a perm.

648
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,400
I'll touch it up for you later.

649
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,720
There's hardly any curl left.

650
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,400
You have to see Weiguo tomorrow.

651
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,640
Talk properly when you meet.

652
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,039
No, Li Jing.

653
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,119
After all our years together,

654
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,119
can we even mention this person?

655
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,160
Is my word just hot air or something?

656
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,640
Did I say I was going to see him?

657
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,839
You must go.

658
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,880
Who listens to whom in this family?

659
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,319
You tell me, who listens to whom?

660
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,440
I'm just confirming.

661
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,680
Anyway, your grandpa only has this one grandson.

662
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Do as you see fit.

663
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,279
What a hassle.

664
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,200
When I'm stressed, I get insomnia.

665
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,119
And when I'm insomniac,

666
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,559
a wind-up monkey always pops out.

667
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:19,599
It parades through my head, banging gongs and drums.

668
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,240
Today is an exception.

669
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,119
Today there are three.

670
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,279
One's even playing the trumpet.

671
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,200
This is not a good sign.

672
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,119
I've brought clients here before.

673
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,279
The per-person cost is really not low.

674
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:42,000
No, no matter how expensive, that's not the point.

675
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,200
Right, right.

676
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,000
We're here.

677
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,599
Weiguo.

678
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,599
Big brother, second brother, you're here.

679
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,880
You're late.

680
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,319
Didn't I say

681
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,240
to meet at noon sharp?

682
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,319
Are you insane?

683
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,280
Bro, bro, we're already here.

684
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,360
We're all here.

685
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,440
Come on, sit, sit.

686
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,679
You came all this way.

687
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:22,880
What would you like to drink?

688
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:23,880
Is red wine okay?

689
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
That's not necessary.

690
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,719
Weiguo.

691
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,159
You've been to see Aunt, right?

692
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,880
I asked you here

693
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,960
to make peace with you.

694
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,800
Here are three bank cards.

695
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,599
What's the PIN?

696
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
It's your birthdays.

697
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,800
So you're showing off your stinking money, huh?

698
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,559
It's not just the money. There's also this.

699
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,079
It's important to you.

700
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,400
Take it.

701
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,320
What do you mean?

702
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,400
Are you crazy?

703
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,559
Are you out of your mind?

704
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,320
What's this? Handouts for us?

705
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,800
You're giving me this thing.

706
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,440
No matter how important it is to me,

707
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,079
I don't want it.

708
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,159
Take it away.

709
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,400
Big brother, let me say one more thing.

710
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,639
I think Weiguo might have good intentions.

711
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,840
Good intentions? Treating you like a beggar?

712
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,079
Good intentions? He's using this money to humiliate you!

713
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,840
I went to see Auntie.

714
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,199
She said we should resolve our grudges.

715
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,159
I was thinking...

716
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,480
We could put on a show.

717
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,719
It's been so many years.

718
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:30,880
I...

719
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,000
We're finally all together again.

720
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:40,199
I... I thought I'd never...

721
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,159
...see this in my lifetime.

722
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,920
Auntie, don't say that.

723
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,360
But you see it now. We're all together.

724
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,239
Third brother, you must be busy over in America.

725
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,039
As for us...

726
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,800
We really should have visited you sooner.

727
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,920
Let's take another photo.

728
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,000
Just like when we were kids.

729
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,400
Let's take a photo together again.

730
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,840
Okay, come on, come on.

731
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,079
Come take a photo with Auntie.

732
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,559
Alright.

733
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,599
Taking a photo.

734
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,119
Look at my memory.

735
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,280
Weiguo, this is your first time meeting them.

736
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,280
This is Xu Fang, my daughter.

737
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,159
This is Tang Zhixin, Xu Fang's husband.

738
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,440
Come on.

739
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,360
Get closer, get closer.

740
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,840
Closer.

741
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,639
Be more affectionate.

742
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,039
Maybe you should take it.

743
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,039
Fine, fine, I'll take it.

744
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,400
Okay, get ready.

745
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:36,760
Get closer.

746
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,480
Closer.

747
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,159
One, two, three.

748
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,880
Cheese!

749
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,719
You really don't hold back, do you?

750
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,800
Didn't you say you'd leave after seeing Auntie?

751
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
Second brother, why are you so aggressive?

752
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,800
It's good he's back. He should be with family.

753
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,400
Fine.

754
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,719
He stays, I'll get lost.

755
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,119
Why are you getting angry?

756
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,360
Anyway...

757
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,880
It's all for Auntie.

758
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,880
If we're putting on a show,

759
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,400
let's do the whole act.

760
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,760
But don't forget your place.

761
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,039
Why are you acting all cool now?

762
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,719
Actually...

763
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,119
I think it's good.

764
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,679
Weiguo.

765
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,239
Weiguo, wait for me! Weiguo!

766
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
If you ask me...

767
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,239
I think we should really make peace.

768
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,760
I've had that thought for a while too.

769
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,840
Now...

770
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,559
It's just Big Brother and Second Brother.

771
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,960
But you see, Auntie has already forgiven you.

772
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,599
Right?

773
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,119
I think they'll be fine with it too.

774
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,719
We all grew up together.

775
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,880
It's not needed.

776
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:06,920
You still think...

777
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,960
...that fight back then was because of me, right?

778
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,440
What do you mean?

779
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,599
Forget it. It's not important.

780
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,360
After all these years, it's impossible to explain.

781
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,480
Alright.

782
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:21,039
Then stay at my place for a couple of days.

783
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:21,679
Make do.

784
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,519
Where are Uncle Tong and Auntie Tong?

785
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,679
Those two...

786
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,440
Their health hasn't been good these past years.

787
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,920
They're probably out for a walk right now.

788
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:30,760
Come in.

789
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,280
Have a seat.

790
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,159
I want to bring Auntie back here.

791
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,440
Spend some quality time with her.

792
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,920
You, Uncle Tong, and Auntie Tong should move out.

793
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,960
Vacate the house.

794
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:51,440
What do you mean?

795
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,360
To spend quality time with her.

796
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,039
Then... then...

797
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:54,760
How about...

798
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,760
...I squeeze into my parents' room?

799
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,440
You and Auntie can stay in this room for now.

800
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,320
I'll tidy it up.

801
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,400
Auntie is getting old.

802
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,760
She must be comfortable.

803
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,280
Also, I need to work.

804
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,079
It's inconvenient to live with others.

805
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,599
Yes, yes, she should be comfortable.

806
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,599
But this is too sudden.

807
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,519
You... you... you...

808
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,760
Can't we just make do for now?

809
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,039
I can't make do. Hurry up and find a place.

810
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,239
Let's discuss this.

811
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,039
No discussion.

812
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,039
Or should I discuss it with Uncle Tong?

813
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,679
No, no, no! You'll upset him.

814
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:20,639
It's settled then.

815
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,079
Vacate this room first.

816
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,280
I'll move in tonight.

817
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,599
What do you mean 'settled'?

818
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,280
Tonight? You're moving in tonight?

819
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,960
Are you serious?

820
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,880
What kind of person is this?

821
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,400
I say...

822
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,119
Moving back in is one thing...

823
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,360
...but why is he replacing all the furniture?

824
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,280
You don't understand.

825
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,400
Weiguo's lifestyle...

826
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
...is meticulous and refined.

827
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,719
You know what?

828
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,320
This is exactly like those online novels.

829
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,199
I need to have a good chat with him.

830
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,480
What's it like being a CEO?

831
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,519
Useful for scripts, right?

832
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:03,559
Why are you still writing scripts like that?

833
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,760
Do you even understand what you're writing?

834
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,480
You guys don't get it.

835
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,639
Young people love it.

836
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
You're here.

837
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:25,760
Uncle Tong, Auntie Tong.

838
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,440
Weiguo.

839
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,000
You're finally back.

840
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,920
Your uncle's been wanting to have a drink with you.

841
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,119
Come over for dinner tonight.
