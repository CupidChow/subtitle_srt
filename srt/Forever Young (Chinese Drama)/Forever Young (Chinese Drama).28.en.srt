1
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,920
Big Bro, about Tongtong, I...

2
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,879
Yes, I do have feelings for her.

3
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,079
But that thing with sister-in-law...

4
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,599
It wasn't really collusion, just...

5
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,920
giving a little suggestion, that's all.

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,120
Your suggestion to your sister-in-law was not to come back, right?

7
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,159
No, it was Tongtong, Tongtong...

8
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,920
Right, it was Tongtong, not me.

9
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,799
There's a lot going on downstairs.

10
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,519
Hurry up, get down there.

11
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,359
No, no, what's going on with you? Back then...

12
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,120
I say, Lao Kai...

13
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
What are you trying to do now?

14
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,640
We agreed that I would take care of Yuanyuan today.

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,159
Sorry, Tom.

16
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,400
Jenny has been looking forward to this piano master's concert for so long.

17
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,479
Originally, there were no tickets left.

18
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,680
But the organizers...

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,159
specially arranged seats for us.

20
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,000
So I don't want her to miss this chance.

21
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,840
No...

22
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
How come every time I'm with Yuanyuan...

23
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,400
there are so many sudden things?

24
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Jenny...

25
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,960
You've been looking forward to this concert for a long time, haven't you?

26
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,919
Then tell Daddy...

27
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,800
this is a very rare opportunity.

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,919
Yuanyuan, then you go.

29
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,080
Practice the piano well.

30
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,400
In the future, you can become a master too.

31
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,560
Come on, Jenny.

32
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,360
Come here.

33
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,439
But I want to stay with Daddy today.

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
And also, I don't want to emigrate.

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,000
I want to stay with Daddy forever.

36
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,639
Alright.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,960
It seems...

38
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,319
what's yours is yours.

39
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,000
What isn't yours, you can't keep anyway.

40
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,360
You see now, don't you?

41
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,879
Having money doesn't mean you can take everything.

42
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,680
You've misunderstood.

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,120
I don't want to take anything away.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,840
Goodbye.

45
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,360
The things I want...

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,159
other people...

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,639
will hand to me with both hands.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,360
What? What does this foreigner mean?

49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
He's not happy he couldn't take Yuanyuan away.

50
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,319
Yuanyuan, Auntie will take you upstairs to play for a bit.

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,000
Go on, go with Auntie.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,919
Go on, be careful.

53
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,960
There's water upstairs.

54
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,599
Drink some water.

55
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,080
I know.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
It's fine.

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,000
After all, he's the investor.

58
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,159
Don't make things too awkward.

59
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,240
Feifei gege, Feifei gege!

60
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,159
What are you doing?

61
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,319
Play with me for a while.

62
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,319
What's this?

63
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:02,879
This...

64
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,120
Go, go play over there.

65
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,719
What's wrong, son?

66
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,639
We're all here.

67
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,920
Alright, come here.

68
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
What's going on here?

69
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,639
What's the matter, really?

70
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,240
Talk to us.

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,399
You all know.

72
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,160
What's wrong?

73
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,920
It's nothing, son.

74
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,360
Son, why are you crying?

75
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,439
Let's not cry.

76
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,199
Alright, I'll admit my mistake first.

77
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,879
I really shouldn't have lied to you three.

78
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,480
I was fired from my job.

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,160
So, Third Brother, your investment money...

80
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,680
don't leave it with me anymore.

81
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,879
And Penglexuan's...

82
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,319
that account, don't even think about keeping it with me.

83
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,600
I don't have the ability for that now.

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,399
But don't worry.

85
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,160
I've thought it through.

86
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,680
I have to shoulder this myself.

87
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,600
I'll just start looking for a new job first.

88
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,199
Get my own situation settled first.

89
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,199
You can all rest assured.

90
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,959
Really.

91
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,759
Start over properly.

92
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,639
Good for you, Qiu'er.

93
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,279
And then?

94
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,160
The three of us have also discussed it.

95
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,120
Your position at the restaurant...

96
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,600
no matter how you fare in the future...

97
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,240
we'll keep it for you.

98
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,800
Yuanyuan...

99
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,319
Yuanyuan...

100
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,920
What are you doing here?

101
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
What's going on here?

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,600
What?

103
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,360
What is it?

104
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,160
The three most beautiful words in the world...

105
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,319
are "I love you."

106
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,959
My dear Tongtong jie...

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,399
I... I like...

108
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:05,959
Who?

109
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,680
Wang Fei.

110
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,680
Wang Fei also likes Tongtong.

111
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,160
Feifei gege, I'm sorry.

112
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,759
It's okay.

113
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,160
Wasn't his condition quite stable before?

114
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
How did it just...

115
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,040
No, we can't delay this any longer.

116
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,839
Second Brother, here's the plan.

117
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,439
You get ready these next couple of days.

118
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,600
Sort out the things on your plate...

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,360
get them in order.

120
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,399
Once my visa comes through...

121
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,120
the two of us will take him to the US.

122
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,279
That won't work.

123
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,279
Let's just find that professor first.

124
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,480
We'll kneel at his door...

125
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,639
and get him to do Weiguo's surgery first.

126
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,399
If I can go, I'll go with you this time.

127
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,879
Going won't help.

128
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,600
What do you mean it won't help?

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,480
There's no special medicine at all.

130
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,560
He was lying to us.

131
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,040
No, we all met that professor.

132
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,360
How could he lie about something like this?

133
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
Did you know about this all along?

134
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,800
Such a big thing...

135
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,680
and you didn't tell me earlier?

136
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,319
No, no, no...

137
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:04,759
What are you doing?

138
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,120
Are you trying to kill him?

139
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,360
I want to die in his place.

140
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,199
Can I take his place?

141
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,240
No, no, no, listen to Second Brother first.

142
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,079
Keep your voices down, everyone.

143
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,720
The patient is awake.

144
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,439
Thank you.

145
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,639
He's awake.

146
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,759
So?

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,159
Did I scare you all?

148
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,360
No, for something this serious, you pull a...

149
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,639
You pull a fake professor to trick us?

150
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,240
You're really something else.

151
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,320
Such a big deal,

152
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,240
I just now

153
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,279
suddenly thought of an idea.

154
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,399
I was thinking,

155
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,919
before I die,

156
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,759
I'll eat a bellyful of corn kernels,

157
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,519
then drink a huge bucket of cream.

158
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,519
That way, my cremation will be quite a show.

159
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,559
Pop, pop, pop!

160
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,320
Can you please stop joking around?

161
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,159
Listen to me.

162
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,679
This time, no matter what you say,

163
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,399
once the test results are out,

164
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,879
as long as surgery is an option,

165
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,320
we must go for the surgery.

166
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,080
Even if I have to stuff you,

167
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,120
I'll stuff you into that operating room.

168
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,480
Big Bro,

169
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,879
can I ask you a question?

170
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,639
Don't ask. I don't want to hear it.

171
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,399
Weiguo,

172
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,919
you take a rest first.

173
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,639
Do you know

174
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
how high the risk

175
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
of this surgery is?

176
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,519
Weiguo,

177
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,600
no matter how high the surgical risk is,

178
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,919
as long as there's still a chance,

179
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,559
we have to try.

180
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,679
At a time like this,

181
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,440
why think so much?

182
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,879
Weiguo,

183
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,799
I'm not afraid.

184
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,360
Are you afraid?

185
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,559
Big Bro,

186
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,600
If you send me in there

187
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,120
and I never come out,

188
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,600
will you regret it?

189
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,559
Look,

190
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,879
at least I'm still alive and kicking now.

191
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,480
At least

192
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,360
I can still 'bounce' for three months.

193
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,240
That's almost a hundred days.

194
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,600
Lianbao,

195
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,559
Qiu'er,

196
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,679
are you afraid?

197
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,559
Can you say a little less?

198
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,039
Whether or not to have surgery,

199
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,120
we need to eat first.

200
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,559
Right, right, eat first.

201
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,799
You talk to him.

202
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,799
Talk to him properly.

203
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,679
Okay, it's fine. Don't trouble yourselves.

204
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,840
It's okay.

205
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,039
Really, it's fine.

206
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,240
Um, you stay with him for now.

207
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
I'll come relieve you later.

208
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,120
Okay.

209
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,000
No need. You all go attend to your business.

210
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,600
It's fine.

211
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm heading out.

212
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,879
Let's eat.

213
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,639
Big Bro, Qiu'er,

214
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,039
you all go back first.

215
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,240
I'll keep an eye on things here.

216
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,360
No, but there's a lot to do at the restaurant.

217
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,080
Let's go, Qiu'er.

218
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,799
Thanks for your hard work.

219
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,759
Um,

220
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,320
about Xiaoqi coming to see me,

221
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,759
you already know?

222
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,840
He told me everything.

223
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,919
He was right.

224
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,279
Actually, I've always...

225
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
I understand.

226
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,639
Some things,

227
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,559
I wanted to hear you say them yourself before

228
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,440
because I thought you were too stubborn.

229
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,279
I just wanted to teach you a lesson, push you a bit.

230
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,200
But now you don't need to say anything.

231
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,559
Because whatever you want to say,

232
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,200
I already understand.

233
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,480
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,919
Stop with the 'sorry's.

235
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,360
If you're really sorry,

236
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
how about helping me think now

237
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,759
about contacting venues.

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,240
Xiaoqi's gone now.

239
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,600
Time is tight, the task is heavy.

240
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,200
I really can't handle it alone.

241
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,159
And you say *I'm* stubborn?

242
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,080
When I gave you my card before,

243
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,600
you kept arguing with me.

244
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,440
Fine, I was wrong, I was wrong, okay?

245
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,080
Then give me your card now.

246
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:53,759
Give it to me.

247
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,919
Okay.

248
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,559
Wait a moment.

249
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,840
Here you go.

250
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,919
By the way,

251
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,879
have you seen Feifei these past couple days?

252
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,000
Why do you have endless worries?

253
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,600
If you're really that concerned,

254
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,279
how about helping me contact venues right now?

255
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,320
What's the big deal about your venue?

256
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,840
I can handle it easily.

257
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't worry.

258
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,600
Let's eat.

259
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,159
What's the situation?

260
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,480
It's nothing.

261
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,559
Chunsheng, you're back.

262
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,399
Don't worry.

263
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,399
Medicine is so advanced now.

264
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,120
Beijing has such great medical resources.

265
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,039
Traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine.

266
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,120
If surgery is needed, do surgery.

267
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,480
If acupuncture is needed, do acupuncture.

268
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,799
If all else fails,

269
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,240
I know a master.

270
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Super effective, really mysterious.

271
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,799
Alright.

272
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:06,320
Dayang, I know you mean well.

273
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,000
Weiguo will be fine.

274
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,639
Yangzi, thank you.

275
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,399
I hope he's okay.

276
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,559
So what's the deal?

277
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,879
The specific test results aren't out yet.

278
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,919
But the surgery still has to be done.

279
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
No, I mean,

280
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,039
can we make this decision for him?

281
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,440
If it were my own business,

282
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,639
I could decide without hesitation.

283
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,440
But this is Weiguo.

284
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,879
His uncle and aunt passed away early.

285
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,200
He doesn't have a wife.

286
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:09,360
Not a single child.

287
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,120
I mean, seriously,

288
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,039
if we talk him onto the operating table

289
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
and he doesn't come off it, what then?

290
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,679
Tell me,

291
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,440
how would we live with ourselves?

292
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,639
Day after day.

293
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,759
If we don't persuade him, he could still...

294
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,720
Don't rush.

295
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,919
Don't worry.

296
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,440
The kid and I are doing fine.

297
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,039
My colleagues are also looking out for me.

298
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,159
Don't worry, don't worry.

299
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,039
Dad, Mom.

300
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,599
Honey.

301
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,160
Mom, Dad, I'll hang up now.

302
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,440
Okay, okay, okay.

303
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,160
Okay.

304
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,559
Bye, bye, bye.

305
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,160
Son.

306
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,519
How is Weiguo doing now?

307
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,839
He's awake, and even cracking jokes.

308
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,640
Good heavens.

309
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,319
Son.

310
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,039
Do you remember always listening to your Third Grandpa

311
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,680
tell you that story when you were little?

312
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,440
The story of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"?

313
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,160
Why are you bringing this up now?

314
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Just talk about it.

315
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,920
Talk about it, talk about it.

316
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,960
It's about a kid

317
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,799
who kept lying.

318
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,440
He'd cry "Wolf!"

319
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
He lied so much, no one believed him anymore.

320
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,400
Finally, the wolf really came

321
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,960
and ate the kid.

322
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,640
No.

323
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,960
You've got the story wrong. No.

324
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,759
Every three-year-old knows this story.

325
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,759
That's how it goes.

326
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,519
The ending of the story is,

327
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,039
the wolf came, right?

328
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,559
The kid turned into a big tiger.

329
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,920
The tiger ate the wolf.

330
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,680
Understand?

331
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,400
Dad.

332
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,039
Mom.

333
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,960
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,759
I shouldn't have lied to you.

335
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,440
Silly boy.

336
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,599
Better to become a big tiger yourself

337
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,920
than to be eaten by the wolf.

338
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,759
Understand?

339
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,599
Good that you understand.

340
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,960
Jing'er.

341
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,799
Pour a glass of water.

342
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,559
When we left,

343
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,000
he was sitting right there.

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,079
Now we're back, and he's still sitting there.

345
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,079
Hasn't moved an inch.

346
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,400
We forgot about him all day.

347
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:01,960
Before, it was always "Third Uncle this, Third Uncle that."

348
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,240
Now that Weiguo is in this state,

349
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,960
you'd think he'd at least ask about him.

350
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,440
He likes Tongtong, and then

351
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,599
his Third Uncle and...

352
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,839
You think he and Tongtong...

353
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,440
He... he... he wouldn't...

354
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,160
What if he gets all angsty in his teenage years

355
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,519
and runs off with her or something?

356
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,839
Go talk some sense into him, quick!

357
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,519
What am I supposed to say to him?

358
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,039
You.

359
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,640
Anything related to Weiguo

360
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,720
has to come from you.

361
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,039
Think about it, what would you even say?

362
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
Hurry up.

363
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,319
Have a sip too.

364
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,519
Just think, if you were his age and this happened,

365
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,839
you... you... you know, you...

366
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,799
Don't let anything happen.

367
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,200
I know, I know, I know.

368
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,119
Studying?

369
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:18,880
Um...

370
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,839
Well...

371
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,519
You and that Tongtong...

372
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,240
Third Uncle.

373
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,400
No, no, your Third Uncle is fine.

374
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,599
Don't you worry.

375
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,759
You... you just...

376
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,359
Don't... don't worry about that.

377
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:49,720
Dad.

378
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,039
I've made a decision.

379
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,160
I was thinking

380
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,359
I should discuss it with you and Mom.

381
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,720
Jing'er.

382
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,359
Come here, come here.

383
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,440
Wh-what's wrong?

384
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,119
Come, come, sit here, sit here.

385
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,599
Well...

386
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,799
The kid says he's made a decision.

387
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,759
What?

388
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,559
This...

389
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:26,640
You tell us.

390
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,880
Wh-what happened?

391
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,240
You, you, you, tell us.

392
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,640
What... what have you decided to do?

393
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,200
I want to apply to medical school.

394
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,240
You kid, I'm telling you...

395
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,400
I thought you were going to do something else!

396
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,039
Like running away or something!

397
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:48,799
All that nonsense!

398
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,359
How could that be?

399
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,839
You want to go to medical school?

400
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,119
Your dad and I fully support you!

401
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,720
What were you thinking, huh?

402
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,359
Didn't you say before

403
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,720
you wanted me to go to college?

404
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,920
I never really figured out before

405
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,759
what the point of me going to college was.

406
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,039
Now I've found it.

407
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,799
I also know

408
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,279
studying medicine is really hard.

409
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:16,640
But I think doctors can save a lot of people.

410
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,200
Like people like Third Uncle.

411
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,119
You focus on your studies.

412
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:32,799
Don't worry about your Third Uncle's business, okay?

413
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,279
I've been researching all day today

414
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,200
about Third Uncle's condition.

415
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,559
I've gotten a rough understanding.

416
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Third Uncle's illness,

417
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,480
if he has surgery now,

418
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,960
the risk is very high.

419
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,119
Then don't think about this anymore.

420
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,000
Just do your studying.

421
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,839
Dad.

422
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,279
You don't need to be anxious either.

423
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,400
In the end, whether to have this surgery

424
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,559
should be left for Third Uncle to decide himself.

425
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,599
Come in.

426
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,039
Doctor.

427
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,400
Um, we're Ma Weiguo's family.

428
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,880
Don't all come in at once.

429
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,240
Just one person should come in.

430
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,440
Right, okay, you all go out.

431
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,440
Alright.

432
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,279
Doctor.

433
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:16,960
Please, have a seat.

434
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,640
What's Ma Weiguo's current condition?

435
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,799
The situation isn't very optimistic.

436
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,039
As for surgery,

437
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,200
the risk would be very high.

438
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,160
If we go with conservative treatment,

439
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,680
three to six months.

440
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,279
Thanks.

441
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,920
How are you, Big Bro?

442
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,680
How is it?

443
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,920
Not bad.

444
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,640
What do you mean, "not bad"?

445
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,680
It means my body's doing okay overall.

446
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,480
There's still hope.

447
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,400
Did you record it?

448
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,119
Let's hear it.

449
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,119
No.

450
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,920
The doctor saw my phone when I went in, so I couldn't record.

451
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:14,400
You should've just kept it in your pocket and recorded secretly. You...

452
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,119
Exactly.

453
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:15,839
Alright, here's the plan.

454
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,039
Let's first get Weiguo discharged from the hospital.

455
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,319
Let's go.

456
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,759
Go.

457
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,720
Go.

458
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:40,920
No, no, no.

459
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,880
You all go back.

460
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,640
Get in bed and rest.

461
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,359
Lie down for a bit, just lie down.

462
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:43,920
The room is so small.

463
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,799
What are so many people doing here?

464
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,519
Come on, come on.

465
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:46,759
No need.

466
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,440
Lie down.

467
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,079
Take off your shoes.

468
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,200
Alright, alright, alright.

469
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,160
Go back, go back, go back.

470
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,000
Big Bro.

471
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,640
Stop hovering around me, okay?

472
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,920
Go do whatever you need to do.

473
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,400
Alright.

474
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,680
Aren't you all usually very busy?

475
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,359
Not busy.

476
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,319
No, I mean, what do you want to eat?

477
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,880
I can't eat, I just got out of the hospital.

478
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,559
I'll make you a bowl of zhajiang noodles.

479
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,359
No need.

480
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,799
We just want to keep you company a bit longer.

481
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:06,359
No, no.

482
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,640
Just go back, okay?

483
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,160
Let him rest alone.

484
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,920
Let's go, come on, let's go.

485
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,160
But I think, you know, that thing...

486
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,319
About your hand, the surgery thing.

487
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,799
No, alright, alright, you're starting again...

488
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,799
What are you doing?

489
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,359
Big Bro, you all go ahead.

490
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,480
I'll chat with him a bit more.

491
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,160
Alright then.

492
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,920
Don't stay too long.

493
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,039
Don't worry.

494
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,200
Go, go, go.

495
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,480
No, I mean, you should go back.

496
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,759
Bro, I... I...

497
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,799
No, you've been busy all this time, you should go back.

498
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,480
I know, Bro.

499
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,160
I think we need to talk him into it.

500
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,920
Get him to have the surgery soon.

501
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,640
No, "talk him into it"...

502
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,640
How do we do that?

503
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,759
No, let him process it himself first.

504
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:00,279
Process it?

505
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,920
How long does he need to process it?

506
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,960
Do you think he's a bit scared?

507
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,000
Thinking the worst.

508
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,720
We have to persuade him.

509
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,160
How to think positively?

510
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,079
Aren't you the one thinking the worst?

511
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:09,920
No, I'm not.

512
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,920
Didn't I just...

513
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,480
I said...

514
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,920
The doctor said his physical condition is quite good now.

515
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,599
Right?

516
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,480
Really?

517
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,039
No, look at you.

518
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,000
You're about to be a father.

519
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,759
Don't be on the verge of tears all the time, okay?

520
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,720
I'm not, really.

521
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,200
I'll talk to him later.

522
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,279
I'll take you with me.

523
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,319
Feel better now?

524
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:30,960
Yeah.

525
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,279
Alright, hurry up and go back.

526
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,279
Go back, okay? I'm leaving.

527
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:33,839
Okay.

528
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,759
Then you...

529
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:50,599
Stop pouring water.

530
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,839
I have a terminal illness.

531
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,920
It's not like I'm paralyzed.

532
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,119
Here.

533
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,920
Just stay put quietly.

534
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,880
Come to think of it...

535
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm actually quite lucky.

536
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,920
What I have isn't the kind...

537
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,720
...that leaves you bedridden, unable to do anything.

538
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,680
Nor is it the kind where you drool when you talk...

539
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,720
...and need help with every basic bodily function.

540
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,160
If it really were like that...

541
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,160
I'd rather kick the bucket sooner.

542
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,039
Don't you worry.

543
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,119
As for you...

544
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,720
If it really comes to that day...

545
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,799
No one will be there to take care of you.

546
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,039
Because of your situation...

547
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,680
I almost got a beating from Big Bro.

548
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
So, what do you have to say for yourself?

549
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,599
Then you should've fought him.

550
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,119
Aren't you supposed to be tough?

551
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,279
Didn't you almost fight that guy...

552
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,319
...what's his name, Manager Luo, for Qianqian?

553
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,039
Wasn't that you?

554
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,279
Seems like you're not sick enough.

555
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,240
Still have time to worry about other people's business.

556
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,480
I'll say it again.

557
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,599
I respect your choice.

558
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,480
If you've made your decision...

559
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,519
...then don't regret it.

560
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,559
You all take care of yourselves.

561
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,160
Of course we'll be fine.

562
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,480
Everyone's so busy.

563
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,039
No matter how big a deal it is...

564
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,119
...it won't be long before it's forgotten.

565
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,680
Besides, Penglexuan is getting better and better.

566
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,119
In the future, when we make a fortune...

567
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,359
...eating, drinking, and having fun every day...

568
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:15,960
...we'll be living even better lives.

569
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,359
Who'll have time to worry about your problems?

570
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:33,119
Hello? What's up?

571
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,599
What?

572
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,279
Yuanyuan still wants to emigrate.

573
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,799
What nonsense is this?

574
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,599
Wait there, I'm coming right over.

575
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,480
Go ahead.

576
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,839
I'm not dying anytime soon.

577
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,279
I thought I had it figured out.

578
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,240
But I don't.

579
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,640
I thought they would understand me.

580
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,759
They don't.

581
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,960
I thought I understood them.

582
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,279
I still don't.

583
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:17,599
And also...

584
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,599
...what counts as living in misery?

585
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,640
What counts as dying meaningfully?

586
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,680
Have I really figured it out?

587
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,759
Mr. Chen

588
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,640
I don't know why

589
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,519
but you seem very familiar to me.

590
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,160
Xiao Tong, right?

591
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,640
You're quite good at breaking the ice.

592
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,039
Tens of millions of years ago,

593
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,400
we were all relatives.

594
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,160
Well,

595
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,920
I worked at my previous bank for fourteen years.

596
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,720
I'm familiar with all the operations,

597
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,680
and I've built up a solid client base.

598
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:59,519
Since you were so stable at your last job,

599
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,519
why the sudden desire to leave?

600
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,519
I've been there too long.

601
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,720
I just wanted a change of scenery.

602
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,960
And I came here seeking

603
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,519
greater opportunities for growth.

604
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,039
I see.

605
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,319
I'm sorry,

606
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:13,640
but we currently have no openings at your level.

607
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,279
That's okay.

608
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,359
I can start from an entry-level position.

609
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,319
After the background check results come in,

610
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,519
we'll contact you again.

611
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,400
A background check is mandatory?

612
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,319
It's a required procedure.

613
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,720
Is there a problem?

614
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,279
No, no, no.

615
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,680
Thank you.

616
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,839
Yuanyuan said herself last time she didn't want to emigrate.

617
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,000
She wanted to spend more time with me.

618
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,079
Didn't Kevin hear it too?

619
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,079
You think Yuanyuan is like you?

620
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,160
Changing your mind on a whim?

621
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,079
Why are you shouting so loud?

622
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
I need you to keep your emotions in check, okay?

623
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,480
You're scaring my daughter.

624
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,720
Jenny.

625
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,759
Tell Daddy yourself.

626
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,240
Yuanyuan.

627
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,400
Daddy's here.

628
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,559
You don't need to be afraid.

629
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,240
Just say what you're thinking.

630
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,160
Say what's on your mind.

631
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,759
Daddy, I'm sorry.

632
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,559
I thought about it again,

633
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:23,279
and what Mom and Uncle Kevin said makes more sense.

634
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,279
Going abroad earlier is better for me.

635
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,559
I also want to meet some

636
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,079
friends over there sooner.

637
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,559
Did you hear that clearly?

638
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,599
Weren't you the one who said

639
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,160
we should respect the child's wishes?

640
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,480
Just sign the consent form already.

641
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,480
The situation isn't very optimistic.

642
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
If we operate,

643
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,280
the risks would be very high.

644
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,920
With conservative treatment,

645
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,360
three to six months.

646
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,119
Big Bro.

647
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:19,920
Let's go play ball.

648
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,559
Come on.

649
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,400
Big Bro.

650
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,480
Hurry up.

651
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,280
Let's go.

652
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,400
I'm his big brother.

653
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,960
But I can't do anything.

654
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,880
I heard everything you said to Feifei that day.

655
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,920
I was listening.

656
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
You still remember that incident so clearly.

657
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,280
How could I forget?

658
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,719
From now on,

659
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,559
we gotta live like we did back in the day.

660
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,440
Since Weiguo came back,

661
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,519
so many things have really changed.

662
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,639
I thought life would just stay the same,

663
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,039
never expected it could bloom in so many ways.

664
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,880
Everything's truly different now.

665
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,039
Now, I

666
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,880
can understand his state of mind a little better.

667
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,079
When a person reaches the end,

668
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,159
who doesn't want to live with dignity?

669
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,960
So I won't pressure him either.

670
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,960
He came back this time

671
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,480
just wanting to live a relaxed,

672
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,960
ordinary life.

673
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,880
But,

674
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,480
we'll just stay by his side,

675
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,360
and cherish the time he has left.

676
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
Together.

677
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,280
Third Uncle.

678
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,199
You finally agreed to see me.

679
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,719
Are you feeling better?

680
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,639
Better than ever.

681
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,039
That's good.

682
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,760
Just get plenty of rest.

683
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,760
I should go, I have school.

684
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,840
I just wanted to check on you.

685
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,039
Feifei.

686
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,000
You're braver than I am.

687
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,159
Sit down and chat with me for a bit.

688
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:43,679
Okay.

689
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,840
And you don't need to feel awkward.

690
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,840
It's nothing.

691
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,360
People, no matter their age,

692
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,519
have emotions and desires.

693
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:58,480
That's perfectly normal.

694
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
Moreover,

695
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,480
and Third Uncle really admires you.

696
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,119
You're very brave.

697
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,960
When you like someone,

698
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,159
at least you dare to say it.

699
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,119
As for me, I...

700
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,119
No, Uncle.

701
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,880
Can we not talk about this?

702
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,199
I *want* to talk about this.

703
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,519
Feifei.

704
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,239
Remember this.

705
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,000
In the future,

706
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:26,119
you'll encounter all sorts of things.

707
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
No matter what,

708
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,280
you must stay brave.

709
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,280
Understand?

710
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,280
Okay.

711
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,400
And what about you?

712
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,199
Will you become brave too?
