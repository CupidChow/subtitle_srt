1
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Come on, come on!

2
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,439
Here.

3
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,199
Listen.

4
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,360
I've already severely criticized Ma Weiguo.

5
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,800
He's also deeply realized his mistake.

6
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,520
Crying and sniveling.

7
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,120
Kept begging me to apologize to you for him.

8
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
So, about this love letter thing...

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,159
I think we should just let it go.

10
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,719
You're so full of it.

11
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,560
I...

12
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,680
But I really didn't expect...

13
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,400
It really was Weiguo who wrote it.

14
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,680
How could that kid be so rotten?

15
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
Exactly!

16
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,400
If only you had told me back then,

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,120
this misunderstanding wouldn't have lasted all these years.

18
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,520
What a missed opportunity.

19
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,879
What missed opportunity?

20
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,439
Look, the misunderstanding is cleared up now.

21
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,199
Why don't we give it another try?

22
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,919
What are you doing?

23
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,319
There are so many people.

24
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,759
No, didn't I tell you?

25
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,599
Let's not complicate our relationship.

26
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,639
If you have something to say, just say it.

27
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,439
Alright, alright, let's get down to business.

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,000
From now on, matters regarding Peng Le Xuan

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,199
will be handled by me.

30
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,840
But let me warn you,

31
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,680
don't celebrate too soon.

32
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,080
Even though I've agreed to this,

33
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,000
it still has to get past my boss.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,680
What?

35
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,879
He doesn't know you like I do.

36
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,680
He might be a bit difficult.

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,120
Don't worry.

38
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,879
I'm prepared for how to talk to your boss.

39
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,000
I've got it all ready.

40
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,879
You,

41
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,120
just need to coordinate his schedule.

42
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,879
Prepared?

43
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,439
Come on, let's hear it.

44
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,120
No, no.

45
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,479
What I mean is,

46
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,159
you absolutely must not get involved.

47
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,599
If your boss sees you,

48
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,439
he'll think we're in cahoots.

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,319
Just wait outside for my good news.

50
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,000
Li Lianbao.

51
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,439
Don't mess this up.

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,840
If this doesn't work out,

53
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
it'll be hard to get another meeting with him.

54
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,439
Don't you trust me to handle things?

55
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,080
Actually, I really don't.

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,439
My water! Why are you drinking it?

57
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,479
How can I drink it after you?

58
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,960
Seriously? You care about that?

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,879
You're so annoying.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,600
What?

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,720
What's wrong with taking a sip?

62
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,639
No.

63
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,639
So stingy.

64
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,680
Go buy your own.

65
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,879
Hello, the number you have dialed is not in service.

66
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,160
He changed his number.

67
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,759
Why didn't he tell anyone he changed his number?

68
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,519
Seven, nine, five, seven, two.

69
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,240
Brother Tie, it's me...

70
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,160
You're looking for Lao Tie?

71
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:47,839
He...

72
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,360
I...

73
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,720
He's been gone for a while now.

74
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,040
What happened?

75
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,920
He just suddenly collapsed at work.

76
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,480
Collapsed at the company?

77
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,600
Please, don't get upset, calm down.

78
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,399
Please, accept my condolences.

79
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,920
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

80
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,360
Gone in his fifties.

81
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,959
Why work yourself so hard?

82
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,639
Come on.

83
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,079
Come on.

84
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,560
Brother Li.

85
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,839
Feifei.

86
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,319
So...

87
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,680
Dad needs to ask you a favor.

88
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,680
Look.

89
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,000
Our Peng Le Xuan

90
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,439
is about to open soon.

91
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,879
I want to start a social media account.

92
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,600
Record some daily life stuff and things,

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,439
to promote our Peng Le Xuan.

94
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
You see, you're pretty good

95
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,040
at planning and that sort of thing.

96
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,240
Could you help your dad out?

97
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,720
I won't make you do it for free.

98
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,120
I'll pay you.

99
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,959
Okay?

100
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,160
Will Mom agree to this?

101
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,319
Your mom will definitely agree.

102
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,040
Alright?

103
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:51,920
Really.

104
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
Wait, what's your answer?

105
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,279
Do you agree or not?

106
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,480
Dad.

107
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,000
If you have something to say,

108
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,680
you can really just say it directly.

109
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
No need to beat around the bush.

110
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,800
Look at you these past couple days,

111
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,240
finding all sorts of roundabout reasons.

112
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,560
No, what am I doing?

113
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,360
So I'm beating around the bush?

114
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,000
I know.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,639
You just want to apologize to me, right?

116
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,160
Have you realized that before,

117
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,480
your parenting methods were problematic?

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,920
Do you know you shouldn't have hit me?

119
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,279
You need to communicate with me as an equal.

120
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,360
Just say it directly.

121
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,800
No, why would I apologize to you?

122
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,399
This matter...

123
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,600
Can we see through it without spelling it out?

124
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
Is this fun?

125
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,519
It's fine.

126
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,240
I understand, alright.

127
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,759
But you want me to run this social media account.

128
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,560
Aren't you worried I'll neglect my studies?

129
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,519
And mess up getting into university?

130
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,279
No. If you're capable,

131
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,839
you won't mess up getting into university,

132
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,600
and you'll still help me out.

133
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,879
Help when you have time.

134
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,560
If you don't have time, forget it. Okay?

135
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,680
I know.

136
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,040
Right now, for the time being,

137
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,240
you can't find your own direction.

138
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,480
That's normal.

139
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,120
I'll be with you, and we'll look for it together.

140
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,199
Until you find your own direction.

141
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,040
Okay?

142
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,759
Then wait for me a moment.

143
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,879
Where are you going?

144
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,000
Hello.

145
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,240
Two, please. Vanilla flavor.

146
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,439
Take them yourself.

147
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,079
Alright.

148
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,160
You scan my code.

149
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,199
That's so expensive

150
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,759
Wait, I thought you didn't like this anymore?

151
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,000
Well, I like it again now.

152
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,399
Take it. It's on me.

153
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,519
Let's go sit over there to eat. Come on.

154
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,440
It's nice and cool here.

155
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,639
Dad.

156
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,080
Even though I haven't decided yet

157
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,279
whether to take the college entrance exam,

158
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,159
but at least

159
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,720
I mean,

160
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm willing to start studying hard.

161
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,000
I think you're right.

162
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,440
Whether going to college is meaningful or not

163
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
is something I can think about after I get in.

164
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,159
Thinking about it now is useless, right?

165
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
That's the spirit.

166
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
But... but you,

167
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,440
how did you suddenly figure it out?

168
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
You know why?

169
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm afraid you'll slap me again.

170
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,559
Oh, cut it out.

171
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,039
I promised you,

172
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,440
I won't lay a hand on you again.

173
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,320
Dad.

174
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,279
Actually, I've been wanting to tell you,

175
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,279
it's because of you

176
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,519
that I figured it out.

177
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,799
Because of me what?

178
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,320
To be honest, I really didn't expect

179
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,759
you could win the Roast Duck King title.

180
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,960
The Folk Duck King Cooking Contest

181
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,639
champion is Wang Chunsheng.

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,080
I was in the audience then,

183
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,480
watching you roast the duck.

184
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,679
I genuinely thought you looked so handsome,

185
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,799
so cool.

186
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,000
That's when I understood.

187
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,399
Actually,

188
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,879
doing something well

189
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,000
isn't important.

190
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
But putting in the effort to do something well

191
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,559
is very important.

192
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,919
Sign me up right now.

193
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,279
I'll make roast duck

194
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,919
and represent Peng Le Xuan in the Duck King contest.

195
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Put that down. Let your dad try.

196
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,799
No, take it away, take it away!

197
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,080
Before I've figured out

198
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,639
what I want to do myself,

199
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,519
I have to be ready at all times.

200
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,799
Otherwise, what if one day

201
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,919
I finally decide what I want to do,

202
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,039
and only then start trying hard?

203
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,200
Wouldn't that be too late?

204
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,639
Let me tell you,

205
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,320
right now,

206
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,919
you first get that bachelor's degree.

207
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:34,039
It'll lay a foundation for the future.

208
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,039
Can we not talk about the bachelor's degree?

209
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,960
Just tell me,

210
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,360
are you willing to get along with me like before?

211
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,679
Get along?

212
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,039
I'm telling you, we have a long road ahead.

213
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,279
You just get along,

214
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,159
and after a while, you'll realize

215
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,519
this dad of yours is a good dad.

216
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,080
And after a while, you'll also know

217
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,519
this son of yours is definitely a good son too.

218
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,480
Qiu'er, how did the talk go?

219
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,840
Let me know if there are any issues, okay?

220
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,960
Keep it up.

221
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,159
Hello, Uncle Qiu'er.

222
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,759
Can you stop relying so much on Uncle Ma?

223
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,879
You're a grown adult.

224
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,799
You're an adult.

225
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,759
You need to learn to solve your own problems.

226
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,879
He has his own things to deal with.

227
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,799
That's all. Bye.

228
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,080
You're meddling too much, aren't you?

229
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,799
Look at the state you're in right now.

230
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,080
And you still have time to worry about others?

231
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,279
I booked a therapist for you.

232
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,120
Charges by the hour.

233
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,679
Come with me, quick.

234
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,919
I never asked you to book one.

235
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,120
There are so many people in this alley.

236
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,360
Why are you only pestering me?

237
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes, so many people.

238
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,799
But which one of them is sick like you?

239
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,799
If a stray cat or dog on the street got sick

240
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,360
and I found out about it,

241
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,679
I'd still take care of it.

242
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,279
What?

243
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,039
I transferred the consultation fee to you.

244
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,919
Consider it as if I went.

245
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,399
Fine.

246
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,200
Let me be straight with you.

247
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,679
Our company's staff meals

248
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,559
are provided by a restaurant owned by the big boss's brother-in-law.

249
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,759
Who dares to change that, you tell me?

250
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,919
Manager Tong.

251
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,720
I came to you to discuss wealth management.

252
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
Why are you talking to me about a roast duck restaurant?

253
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,279
How unprofessional is that?

254
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,600
No, don't get upset.

255
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,639
I just mentioned it in passing.

256
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,279
If you raise the base interest rate a bit more for me,

257
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,720
I'll give you all of our

258
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,519
business banquet catering.

259
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,639
No, this is something I really have no say over.

260
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,679
Then forget it.

261
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,120
What kind of request is that?

262
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,480
Do you own the bank?

263
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,720
What's going on?

264
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,200
How come you can't close a single deal?

265
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
Should I shoot from this side to that side,

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,360
or from that side to this side?

267
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,120
Let's try both.

268
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,559
First... first, let's do it like this.

269
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't talk.

270
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,120
Bro.

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,360
You, don't talk yet.

272
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,240
Uncle Qiu'er.

273
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,679
This is yet another new day.

274
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Peng Le Xuan is bathed in sunshine.

275
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,240
You're in the shot.

276
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,360
Look, just look.

277
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,919
Bro, where's sister-in-law?

278
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,600
Sister-in-law is at home cooking.

279
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,919
I need to tell you something.

280
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,279
I... these past few days, I've really...

281
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,919
visited quite a few clients.

282
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,399
It's actually pretty tough.

283
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,519
It's not that I haven't... haven't tried, bro.

284
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,240
Yeah.

285
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,120
You... you're fighting on two fronts now.

286
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,720
It really isn't easy, right?

287
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Managing the bank over there,

288
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,120
and still having to look after the shop here.

289
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,600
Right.

290
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Look how tired my Qiu'er is.

291
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,879
Yeah.

292
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,480
Can you help me talk to Weiguo...

293
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,240
No, don't talk, don't talk.

294
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,679
I'll go from this side...

295
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,120
from this side to that side for one take.

296
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,759
Don't move your feet, don't move your feet. Go.

297
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,480
This is yet another new day at Peng Le Xuan.

298
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,919
Sunshine is bright.

299
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,080
Good.

300
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,879
This one's good.

301
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,559
This is great.

302
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,200
Because the sunlight is good.

303
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,960
Look.

304
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,559
See?

305
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,039
This is good, right?

306
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,039
Send it to me.

307
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,519
Click... click here, send.

308
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,279
Send.

309
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,159
Got it.

310
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,600
Alright, bro, I'm heading off first.

311
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,399
Okay.

312
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,279
Bye, Uncle Qiu'er.

313
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,159
Wait, what were you saying just now? What was it?

314
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,399
Nothing, nothing. You're busy.

315
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:01,919
Come by when you're free.

316
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,600
Will do.

317
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,120
This software...

318
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,879
is better, easier to use than your previous one.

319
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,120
See, just click here.

320
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,600
Darn it, it directly reads it over.

321
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,039
Click here, start editing.

322
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,799
Freely, splice.

323
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,039
I can then adjust to a warmer color.

324
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:13,919
Right?

325
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,039
Click this.

326
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Let me tell you.

327
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,679
Marketing is about strategy.

328
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,480
It's about having a clear target.

329
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,279
Just talking randomly definitely won't work.

330
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,799
Look at my four-quadrant method.

331
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,519
The horizontal axis is client development progress.

332
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,639
The further right, the more in-depth.

333
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,120
The vertical axis is client development potential.

334
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,320
The higher up, the greater the potential.

335
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Got it?

336
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,840
Take a good look.

337
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,600
Alright.

338
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,720
I'll definitely study it carefully tomorrow.

339
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,360
Don't!

340
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,399
Let's do it right now, since we said we would.

341
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,399
Right now?

342
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,440
Hurry up.

343
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm currently organizing...

344
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,919
this proposal for Boss Dong.

345
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,480
You're here, perfect.

346
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Let's work on it together.

347
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
If there are any issues,

348
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
we can communicate promptly.

349
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,519
Okay.

350
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,320
You look at it first, I'll make a call.

351
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,799
Okay.

352
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,320
Hello, Brother Liu.

353
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,840
I'll send you a set of data in a bit.

354
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,399
Help me verify it.

355
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,639
Yes, yes, yes. It's needed very urgently.

356
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,240
So, tonight you'll have to put in some extra effort.

357
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,000
Work overtime.

358
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,799
Alright then, I'll hang up now.

359
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Go wash your face, wake up a bit.

360
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,839
Bro.

361
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,240
I used to think your job was pretty easy.

362
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,839
Just eating and drinking with people,

363
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,119
shooting the breeze was all it took.

364
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:54,759
Didn't expect it to be such a rat race.

365
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,759
This is just the beginning.

366
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,440
Back when I was at the company,

367
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,799
to hit the key performance indicators,

368
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,440
I pulled a 997 schedule for three months straight.

369
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,039
Didn't expect that, did you?

370
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,720
That's how intense the rat race is.

371
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,480
That's how thrilling it is.

372
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,000
If you don't fight hard,

373
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,240
you won't even get a chance.

374
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:25,319
Yeah, I don't have your capability.

375
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,039
I'm going to sleep for a bit first.

376
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,240
No, no, no.

377
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,279
Let me see that spreadsheet you just made.

378
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,039
Show it to me.

379
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,680
Why did it shut down?

380
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,519
My hand...

381
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,319
Then you take a quick nap first.

382
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,599
I'll call you in a bit.

383
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,279
Darn it.

384
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Second Brother.

385
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,720
Second Brother.

386
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,839
Second Brother.

387
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,519
Again?

388
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,559
This rat race is too much.

389
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,079
Honey.

390
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,160
How come you're back, sweetie?

391
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,759
Why didn't you tell me?

392
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,799
I would have picked you up.

393
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,119
It's fine.

394
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,079
Seeing you has perked me right up.

395
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,559
I stayed up all night making spreadsheets.

396
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,160
Didn't sleep a wink.

397
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,599
Honey, honey.

398
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,319
I have a surprise for you.

399
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,599
Are you sure it's a surprise, not a shock?

400
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,000
It really is a surprise.

401
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Got an upset stomach?

402
00:22:59,079 --> 00:22:59,720
Really.

403
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,000
Really.

404
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,279
Really.

405
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,720
I'm going to be a dad.

406
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,440
I'm going to be a dad.

407
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,599
Oh my god.

408
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,440
I'm going to be a dad, right?

409
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,160
Oh my god.

410
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,920
I'm going to be a dad, right?

411
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,640
Are you okay? Are you okay?

412
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,839
Honey

413
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,279
I think

414
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,720
I feel... really strange.

415
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,880
Originally, it was because of us

416
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,400
that I wanted a child.

417
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,319
But now, all I can think about

418
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,880
is that as long as the baby can

419
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,599
arrive safely in this world,

420
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,920
I'm willing to endure any hardship.

421
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:45,519
Darling

422
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,759
There's something I need to make clear.

423
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,839
What is it?

424
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,359
When the baby's born, don't neglect me, okay?

425
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,880
Are you crazy?

426
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,799
Think about it, once your wife gets pregnant,

427
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,000
the financial pressure will be huge, right?

428
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,640
Those two medicines are ridiculously expensive.

429
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,680
I told the doctor to stop them.

430
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,359
Can you stop relying so much on Uncle Ma?

431
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,480
You're a grown adult.

432
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,400
You're an adult.

433
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,359
You need to learn to solve your own problems.

434
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,279
You can't compete with the young guys at work,

435
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,880
who pays the mortgage?

436
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,519
Your wife does.

437
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,200
A grown man,

438
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,759
not focusing on building a career,

439
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,880
just whining every day about going to Xi'an to find your wife.

440
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,319
Have you no shame?

441
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,920
Well, you need to think carefully

442
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,640
about your role and position.

443
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,799
Only then can you prove your worth.

444
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,960
This promotion opportunity

445
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,559
will be given to Xiao Jia.

446
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,920
You don't worry about anything,

447
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,240
you just play the nice guy.

448
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,839
So when problems arise, I have to solve them.

449
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,920
You can even mix up a bag worth tens of thousands.

450
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,839
At least make up a believable lie.

451
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,279
Ever since Peng Le Xuan opened,

452
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,759
you haven't accomplished a single thing.

453
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
Told to bring in clients, you failed.

454
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,440
Li Lianbao told you to quit your bank job

455
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
and focus on the startup.

456
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,480
You didn't listen, made endless excuses.

457
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,920
You keep telling me you'll work hard,

458
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,279
but are you really trying?

459
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,960
You're just *acting* like you're trying.

460
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Daily, monthly, quarterly, annual reports...

461
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,079
Look at the garbage you wrote yourself.

462
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,519
Brother Tong, congratulations!

463
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,759
Old Tong, congrats!

464
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,839
Congrats, Brother Tong!

465
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,640
Brother Tong, congratulations!

466
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,839
How did you know?

467
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,680
Doesn't everyone know already?

468
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,759
How does everyone know about that...

469
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,119
Your Peng Le Xuan is really impressive.

470
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,359
Another huge investment came in this morning.

471
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,920
Several million, right?

472
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,160
About that...

473
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:03,720
Congratulations!

474
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:04,640
Thanks.

475
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,000
Let's all get together after work tonight.

476
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,480
I have something to announce.

477
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,640
Come on, everyone.

478
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,119
Bottoms up!

479
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,200
Are you raising fish in there?

480
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,440
Yeah.

481
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,279
No, what's up?

482
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,079
If you don't like it, I can get you a bottle of red.

483
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,079
No, no, it's fine.

484
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,720
Today is a double celebration!

485
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,559
Big Brother won the Roast Duck King title.

486
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,079
And Qiu'er became a father.

487
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,880
Wait, no.

488
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,799
It's actually a quadruple celebration.

489
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,880
Listen up, guys.

490
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:57,119
Kevin's second payment has already come in.

491
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:57,880
Really?

492
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,279
Next, I'll close the deal with Boss Dong.

493
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,359
That'll bring in another chunk of cash.

494
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Qiu'er, we'll deposit it with you again.

495
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,759
I won't say thanks for the huge favor.

496
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,599
I'll down this one first, Second Brother.

497
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,960
Don't be so polite with me.

498
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
This is all money the four of us earned together.

499
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,400
Actually...

500
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,480
I didn't contribute much.

501
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,640
Qiu'er, don't say that.

502
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,839
You were chubby since you were a kid.

503
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,640
So fat you were like a little ball.

504
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,599
The three of us teased you nonstop.

505
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,680
Who would've thought...

506
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,640
All that teasing...

507
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,400
Teased you into a tall, slender guy.

508
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,720
A little more teasing and he's a dad now.

509
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,160
The fat you had as a kid wasn't real meat.

510
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
That was just puppy fat.

511
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,680
It's not over till it's over, right?

512
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,400
Right, it's not over till it's over.

513
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,559
Qiu'er, you're a father now.

514
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,200
Gotta work harder for that baby formula money.

515
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,920
Yeah, how's that client of yours going?

516
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,359
If you have any problems,

517
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,160
you can tell us.

518
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,319
We can give you advice, right?

519
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,119
Forget it, forget it.

520
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,359
Today is just a victory party, right?

521
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,359
Let's not talk about work.

522
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,519
Come on, come on.

523
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:55,880
Here, here.

524
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,799
Right, Qiu'er is new to this business.

525
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,200
He needs some time to grow.

526
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,039
Actually, you know what?

527
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,440
I really do want to talk about this today.

528
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:08,680
Talk about what?

529
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,720
It's just that...

530
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,960
I want to quit Peng Le Xuan.

531
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,359
And give my shares back to you guys.

532
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Big Brother, just listen to him.

533
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,160
We're about to make big money.

534
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,400
He'd quit right now?

535
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,640
He's joking.

536
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,920
No, I'm not joking.

537
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,359
I've thought it through clearly.

538
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,359
What have you thought through clearly?

539
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,960
Peng Le Xuan is run by the four of us.

540
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,440
I'm putting my foot down today.

541
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,759
Big Brother, can you not get angry first?

542
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,680
Can you let me finish first?

543
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,920
No, what are you saying?

544
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,680
Qiu'er.

545
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,759
Why did I move out of Courtyard 36?

546
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,480
Why did I struggle to learn roast duck again?

547
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,440
Why?

548
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,319
So the brothers could build up Peng Le Xuan

549
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,440
together again.

550
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,200
Why?

551
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,640
Wasn't it just so the four of us could be together?

552
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,839
And now you're telling me you quit?

553
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,200
What are you thinking?

554
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,640
I'm telling you, no way!

555
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,160
Big Brother, listen to him first.

556
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,160
Then I'll speak.

557
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,880
Actually, I've figured it out these past few days.

558
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,839
I think a person has to accept their fate.

559
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,680
You have to know your own limits.

560
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,640
I don't have much talent.

561
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,400
And I don't have big ambitions.

562
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,160
I just want a simple,

563
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,880
easy-going life.

564
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,720
Look,

565
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,920
Big Brother, I'm not as tough on myself as you are.

566
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,640
You can practice your craft even while vomiting.

567
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,640
And I'm not in the rat race like Second Brother.

568
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,079
Treating overtime like a daily meal.

569
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
And always staying full of energy.

570
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,240
Third Brother.

571
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
Third Brother.

572
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,599
Third Brother.

573
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,880
We're not from the same world.

574
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,880
Someone like me,

575
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
what help can I be to Peng Le Xuan?

576
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,440
I can only hold you guys back.

577
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,640
That makes me feel bad too, you know?

578
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,599
That's the first reason.

579
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:10,880
The second reason is...

580
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,839
I think a person can't have a foot in two boats.

581
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,880
You'll capsize both.

582
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,119
Biting off more than one can chew.

583
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,599
Trying to please both sides,

584
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,599
trying to have it both ways...

585
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,440
It's impossible.

586
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,759
Nothing's that easy.

587
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,440
So I was thinking...

588
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,720
Maybe I should just focus on one thing.

589
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,640
Something within my capabilities.

590
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,000
So I think...

591
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,759
the bank job is still right for me.

592
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,799
Didn't you say the bank was tough?

593
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,079
Tough, yes it's tough.

594
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,640
But what job isn't tough?

595
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,599
At least I've done it for over ten years.

596
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,799
I can still handle those tasks with my current skills.

597
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,599
So you plan to just coast along at the bank?

598
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,000
It's not coasting.

599
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,799
Before, I thought I was working hard.

600
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,440
But this time,

601
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,640
I finally saw what real effort looks like.

602
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
Look at Big Brother.

603
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,799
He won the Roast Duck King.

604
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,640
Second Brother.

605
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Brought in the money.

606
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,680
Got Peng Le Xuan back on its feet.

607
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,400
Qiu'er, what's wrong?

608
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,400
Second Brother.

609
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:25,680
How's the investment deal really going?

610
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,359
I'm talking to a few interested clients.

611
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,400
I'm not rushing you, Second Brother.

612
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,640
But it really needs to be soon.

613
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,079
This place is no place for people.

614
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,119
After you secure the investment,

615
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,400
we need to tell Big Brother right away.

616
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,920
I'll hurry.

617
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:44,799
Just wait a bit more.

618
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,440
I was just thinking, maybe...

619
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,400
I should also put in some real effort.

620
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,920
To see if I can

621
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,920
make something of myself at the bank.

622
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:03,079
Right, Big Brother?

623
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,639
Alright.

624
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,239
If you really think that way,

625
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,760
then just focus on doing well at the bank.

626
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,760
As for the restaurant,

627
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,559
don't worry about it for now.

628
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,519
But your shares,

629
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,559
we'll keep them for you.

630
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:31,519
Actually, no.

631
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,599
Having this with me

632
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,679
makes me feel uneasy.

633
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,039
No, you're being silly.

634
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:37,760
No, no.

635
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,039
I... I need to cut off my retreat first.

636
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:42,239
I think only someone like me can

637
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,480
charge forward without hesitation.

638
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,239
No, then why bother?

639
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,920
Big Brother.

640
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:54,840
Qiu'er.

641
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
How about this.

642
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,960
Your portion,

643
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,320
Big Brother, Lianbao, and I

644
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
will discuss it

645
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
and then decide how to handle it.

646
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,599
I'll give you a sum of money first.

647
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,559
Use it for now.

648
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,639
Actually, getting to this point

649
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,800
is already quite an achievement, I think.

650
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,119
Although it's not quite what we imagined,

651
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,119
but I think you're right.

652
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,400
Everyone should know their own limits.

653
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,400
And everyone has their own place.

654
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,119
Let's leave it at that for now.

655
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:25,880
Alright then.

656
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Qiu'er, take this money first, okay?

657
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,519
It'll give you some breathing room.

658
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,519
I also really think Qiu'er,

659
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,840
having the kid run back and forth like this,

660
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
don't let him get worn out.

661
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,880
So let's do that for now.

662
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,880
Whenever you want to come back, just say the word.

663
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:56,920
Five hundred thousand.

664
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,480
Take it for now.

665
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:01,719
A deposit.

666
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:02,840
A deposit.

667
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Deposit, deposit.

668
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:04,760
A deposit.

669
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,280
Honey.

670
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,199
Have you ever thought,

671
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,440
if Peng Le Xuan does well,

672
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,480
your annual dividend could be more than five hundred thousand?

673
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,280
Yes, yes.

674
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,239
But didn't you say it yourself?

675
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,800
I can't just rely on brotherly bonds

676
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,639
to stay at Peng Le Xuan, right?

677
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,199
I need to find my own value and purpose.

678
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,039
I looked. I didn't find it.

679
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,920
So that money isn't meant for me to earn.

680
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,360
Fine.

681
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,440
Since you've made up your mind,

682
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:37,960
there's no point in me stopping you.

683
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,840
Then just work hard at the bank from now on.

684
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,000
Okay.

685
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,719
Just watch me, kid.

686
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,199
I'll be more diligent than going to work.

687
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:44,920
I have an academic question

688
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,840
I'd like to ask you.

689
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:46,920
Go ahead.

690
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,440
I heard autumn in Beijing is especially beautiful.

691
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,320
The streets are lined with golden ginkgo trees.

692
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,480
You've seen it, right?

693
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,559
Yes.

694
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,079
Under the autumn ginkgo trees,

695
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,599
people often line up to take photos.

696
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,559
Especially little girls and aunties.

697
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,639
It's a shame autumn is still far away.

698
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:08,159
I can't wait.

699
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,800
I want to see it with my own eyes soon.

700
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,480
Is that all you wanted to ask?

701
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,360
I only recently learned

702
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,199
that all the ginkgo trees in the world come from China.

703
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,960
You're so knowledgeable,

704
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,400
you must know the reason, right?

705
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,159
I haven't really studied that.

706
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,920
Let me give you a simple science lesson.

707
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,079
The ginkgo tree

708
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:27,760
existed over three hundred million years ago in the Carboniferous Period.

709
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,360
It's even older than the dinosaurs.

710
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,119
It was once widespread all over the world.

711
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,480
After the glacial movements,

712
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,519
all the ginkgo families in the world

713
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,000
went completely extinct.

714
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,320
Only the ginkgo trees in China survived.

715
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,800
Do you know why?

716
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,840
Because it lived so long

717
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,559
it outlived all its natural enemies.

718
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,639
Don't you have any thoughts after hearing that?

719
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,360
That's pretty impressive.

720
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,559
Even the dinosaurs went extinct,

721
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,320
but the Chinese ginkgo could still pull through.

722
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:54,800
As a Chinese person,

723
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,079
shouldn't you learn from

724
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,880
the ginkgo's tenacious will to survive?

725
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,679
Medical science is constantly advancing.

726
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,679
Maybe one day

727
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,199
we can outlast the virus too.

728
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,960
I've told the story.

729
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,119
Are there any other methods?

730
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,159
You're not even related to him, yet you help him so much.

731
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:38,639
You must like him.

732
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,800
Why not just confess your feelings to him?

733
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,239
It might stimulate his will to live.

734
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,320
With this kind of illness, the patient themselves must want to live.

735
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,519
Out riding your bike in person?

736
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,519
What are you doing here?

737
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm here to supervise you.

738
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,920
Getting some sun, riding a bike, it's good.

739
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,159
Helps with recovery.

740
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,440
Don't follow me. I want to ride alone.

741
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,599
I'm not following you.

742
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,679
How is this following you?

743
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,519
Stay away from me.

744
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:47,360
Watch out!

745
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,719
What are you doing?

746
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,559
Are you crazy?

747
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,519
Yeah, I am sick.

748
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,639
If I weren't sick, why would I follow you?

749
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,719
*I'm* the one who's sick.

750
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,119
Why so serious?

751
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,519
Be happy.

752
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,159
Riding a bike is great.

753
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:02,960
I'm ignoring you.

754
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,239
So cold.

755
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,280
You're a girl.

756
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,360
Can't you be a little more reserved?

757
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,920
I want to help you.

758
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,440
If you want to help me, stay away from me.

759
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,480
Stop following me all the time.
