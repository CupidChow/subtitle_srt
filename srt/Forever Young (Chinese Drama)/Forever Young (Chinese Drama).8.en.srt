1
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,000
What is he doing?

2
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,439
Don't disturb him.

3
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,239
Teacher Tong.

4
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,480
Our boss is just too busy.

5
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,319
However, Teacher Tong's script...

6
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,040
We have discussed it carefully.

7
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,159
I won't talk about the strengths.

8
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,519
Let me just talk about the shortcomings.

9
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,759
Okay, sure.

10
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,080
Better to talk about the strengths first.

11
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,080
Anyone can pick out flaws, right?

12
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,599
Xiao Ma.

13
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,000
Should I drink some water now?

14
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,639
Go on, keep talking.

15
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,680
Teacher Tong, you've always written slice-of-life dramas, right?

16
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,199
Yes.

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,560
So you might not be very familiar...

18
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,599
with current mainstream trends.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,479
First, your romance plotline is cliche.

20
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,080
Also,

21
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
the sweet moments, heart-fluttering moments, kissing scenes, heart-wrenching moments are all insufficient.

22
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,479
Five sweet, three heart-fluttering, one heart-wrenching, one kiss per episode...

23
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,520
That's the standard.

24
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,960
Also, Teacher Tong,

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,719
your "satisfaction factor" isn't strong enough.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,280
One can also tell, Teacher Tong,

27
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,360
that you haven't dated much.

28
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,800
Even my grandma doesn't do it like this anymore.

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,599
When the leads meet, there must be a smoldering gaze.

30
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,759
I don't see it.

31
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,520
Actually, this genre has its formulas.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,240
Like the daily life of a CEO...

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,439
what he's like,

34
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,280
how he talks, how he acts.

35
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,840
You should read more works in this area.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,199
And this business rivalry...

37
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,360
isn't very exciting either.

38
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,280
I mean, one can tell...

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,919
your team probably...

40
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,000
doesn't have much exposure to business wars.

41
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,960
You're not very knowledgeable about this area.

42
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,879
Are you all experts on business wars?

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,759
Get me...

44
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,319
some water, add some water.

45
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,199
Every one of our editors...

46
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,759
reads a huge number of novels daily.

47
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,879
We must be very familiar with every trope.

48
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,080
Teacher Tong,

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,159
look at our current script here...

50
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,479
Even a basic comeuppance scene...

51
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,599
hasn't been written.

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,560
This is definitely not acceptable.

53
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,479
We can't approve this.

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,199
Hey, what...

55
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,240
are you looking for?

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,159
Under the bed.

57
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,719
No one can hide here.

58
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,280
I can't meet with her.

59
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,240
No, Qianqian is here to discuss business with me, right?

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,879
What are you doing here causing trouble?

61
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,039
Big brother, you're too naive.

62
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,400
Do you think she's still that...

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,919
white lotus from the old alleyway?

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,719
She's backed by big capital now.

65
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,280
She cut ties with everyone long ago.

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,919
Without me watching, you'll definitely get the short end.

67
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,800
Is it really that bad?

68
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,280
And you claim to keep up with the times.

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,360
Online...

70
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,639
aren't there plenty of stories about scamming friends and family?

71
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,000
Really.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,639
Sis.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,639
Qian.

74
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,680
Busy?

75
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
Looking for your big brother, right?

76
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
He's in the back. Go on.

77
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,240
Coming.

78
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,920
I'll be busy here.

79
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,639
Big brother, remember this.

80
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,000
Act according to my signals.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,240
No matter what she says,

82
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
don't agree to anything.

83
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,920
Remember, you must remember.

84
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,079
But that room is pitch black.

85
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,199
And your face is so dark...

86
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,680
how am I supposed to see your signals?

87
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,079
Remember what I just said.

88
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,839
Hurry, hurry.

89
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,720
Big brother.

90
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,639
Qianqian.

91
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,000
I brought you two bottles of wine.

92
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,319
Wow.

93
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,439
Such expensive wine.

94
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,240
It's not expensive.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,600
Look at you.

96
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,480
With our relationship...

97
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,720
why be so polite? Really.

98
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Back when I was a kid,

99
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
I often came here for free roast duck.

100
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,279
When you leave later,

101
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,519
I'll give you a couple of ducks to take.

102
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,439
Come on, sit, sit.

103
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:53,839
Alright.

104
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,319
Take them back for your parents.

105
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,519
Great, then I won't stand on ceremony.

106
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,959
Sit, sit, please sit.

107
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,360
Big brother, actually, the reason I came today...

108
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
is to discuss with you...

109
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,959
the acquisition of Peng Le Xuan.

110
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,680
No, it's fine.

111
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
Go on, speak.

112
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,879
Let me briefly explain to you.

113
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
Simply put,

114
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,040
we provide the capital...

115
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,480
and obtain Peng Le Xuan's...

116
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,680
brand rights and management control.

117
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,199
Then we give it a complete makeover.

118
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,360
First, we renovate Peng Le Xuan.

119
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,959
Then, combining internet...

120
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,439
marketing concepts,

121
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,240
we create a new-concept roast duck...

122
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,199
that blends tradition and modernity.

123
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,639
Strive to make our Peng Le Xuan...

124
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,839
bigger and stronger.

125
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,959
My little shop? Is it up to it?

126
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,319
Don't underestimate our Peng Le Xuan.

127
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,319
Here's the thing.

128
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,439
Let me show you...

129
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,800
the proposal I've prepared.

130
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,680
Young Mistress, you're here for candied haws.

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,240
Yes.

132
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,399
Please pick a skewered one.

133
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,319
I'll take one of these.

134
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,279
Thank you for your patronage. Please take care.

135
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,319
Come in and have a taste.

136
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,360
Alright, I'll definitely come another day.

137
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,720
How about a pottery figurine?

138
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,279
Boss Ma.

139
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,319
My respects to you.

140
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,120
Congratulations!

141
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,079
Congratulations to you as well.

142
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,480
Excellent.

143
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,639
Thank you, thank you.

144
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,120
Come by another day.

145
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,279
Yes, yes.

146
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,519
Now, in the capital city,

147
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,560
roast duck is all the rage.

148
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,720
Among the most exquisite feasts,

149
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,319
Peng Le Xuan stands alone.

150
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,439
Its master, Ma Hezhen, excels at crafting delicacies.

151
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,759
Those who catch its aroma

152
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,000
from ten paces away are all drawn in, mouths watering.

153
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,000
Sweet but not cloying,

154
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,680
salty but not overpowering,

155
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,160
mild but not bland,

156
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,720
rich but not greasy.

157
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,399
Patrons chatter excitedly,

158
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,480
as if enchanted, they dance,

159
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,600
often wishing to devour the very dishware.

160
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,959
The Empress Dowager heard of his fame

161
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,879
and summoned him.

162
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,959
He replied,

163
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,160
"Cooking is like practicing medicine.

164
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,360
With a focused mind, I diagnose the suitability of all ingredients,

165
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,319
and carefully balance the fire and water.

166
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,199
Thus, ten thousand mouths find sweetness as one."

167
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,759
The Empress Dowager was pleased and rewarded him,

168
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,759
then ordered him to provide meals for the military camp.

169
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,519
He was granted the title "Culinary Captain".

170
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,839
His descendants inherited it.

171
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,519
I just heard you mention "comeuppance", right?

172
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,120
Are you all very knowledgeable about business wars?

173
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,920
Of course.

174
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,759
Then have you ever seen a real business war?

175
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,720
The Century Truth War.

176
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,279
Marvelous Company versus Wall Street.

177
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,639
Blackwater shorting Libaid.

178
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,160
Nokela taking on AP one-on-one.

179
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,240
Have you heard of all these?

180
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,120
Of course.

181
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,679
Sorry, I made all of those up.

182
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
And how should a CEO date?

183
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,000
Tell us.

184
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,679
How do you write a "smoldering gaze"?

185
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,879
Have you been to a bookstore, seen the bestseller list?

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,480
Are you sure this is the mainstream?

187
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,639
And have you asked people

188
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,919
if they really want to watch this kind of thing?

189
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,679
Do they genuinely like it,

190
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,639
or do they just have no other choice?

191
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,120
You see,

192
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,440
your train of thought

193
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,879
sounds completely unrealistic from the get-go.

194
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,320
Our requirements for script review are very strict.

195
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,840
And this isn't our standard

196
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,919
script review process.

197
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,320
Alright, alright, alright.

198
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,159
Let's humbly listen to

199
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,320
the feedback they're giving on the script.

200
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,039
Um, what's your boss's name?

201
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,240
Tang Zhen, from the Copyright Department.

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,840
Is that Sarah still your secretary?

203
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,320
I haven't returned to the country.

204
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,960
Here's the thing.

205
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,240
My uncle is currently at your place in a script meeting.

206
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,159
He didn't bring any tea.

207
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,879
Can you have Sarah bring some down?

208
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,759
She seems to be an intern.

209
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,039
Not a supervisor.

210
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,960
She can't make decisions on matters like this.

211
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,919
Tong Daxi.

212
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,039
An old man.

213
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,360
Xiao Ma.

214
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,000
No, no, no.

215
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,879
Don't you come down to deliver it.

216
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,519
The old man doesn't like such a high-profile gesture.

217
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,559
Alright then.

218
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,759
I owe you one.

219
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,639
Good, I'll send you two more boxes in a couple of days.

220
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,399
This time, make it last.

221
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,759
It's a nutritional supplement, not a meal.

222
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,519
Don't ask so many questions. That's it.

223
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,279
Yes, yes, Brother Zhen.

224
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,559
No, you don't know him.

225
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,519
Hello?

226
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,440
Brother Zhen.

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,960
Qiao... Vice President Qiao told you?

228
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,000
Who is Vice President Qiao?

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
He's the one in charge of

230
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,799
their entire audiovisual division, the vice president.

231
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,279
Yes.

232
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:36,840
Um,

233
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,000
I just call him Xiao Qiao.

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,399
He's my classmate from the CEO training course.

235
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,080
Teacher Tong, sorry about that.

236
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,000
Please wait a moment.

237
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,759
Our boss,

238
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,639
Brother Zhen will see you right away.

239
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,279
Thank you, thank you.

240
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,320
Thanks.

241
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,080
Mr. Ma, sorry about earlier.

242
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,240
It's fine.

243
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,519
Teacher Tong, I'll make you some tea.

244
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,360
Would you like black tea,

245
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,799
Thank you, thank you.

246
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,799
or green tea, or...

247
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,200
No, no, don't trouble yourself.

248
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,919
Teacher Tong,

249
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,039
some water?

250
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,399
I'm not thirsty right now.

251
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:09,799
Really, I won't drink.

252
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,480
Not thirsty.

253
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,399
Not thirsty.

254
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,679
So you see,

255
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,519
this century-old cultural heritage,

256
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,960
just the signboard of our Peng Le Xuan,

257
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,440
offers limitless possibilities.

258
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,279
This is what capital values most.

259
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,559
Let me tell you,

260
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,480
I've actually thought about this too.

261
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,480
Take Peng Le Xuan for instance.

262
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,120
Just these three characters

263
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,519
are a major IP, right?

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,799
Exactly.

265
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,320
Right?

266
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,080
Think about what's behind

267
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,159
these three characters of Peng Le Xuan.

268
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,159
And it's very easy for

269
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,200
ordinary consumers to connect with.

270
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,720
You know, the basics of life.

271
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,799
Eating is the top priority, right?

272
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,759
Then we monetize it.

273
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,759
I must say, brother,

274
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,240
you really know your stuff.

275
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,159
Well, those marketing accounts online...

276
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,240
I read them in my spare time too.

277
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,639
Then it's even easier.

278
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,159
I've already drafted a preliminary agreement.

279
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,399
That fast?

280
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,360
Take a look.

281
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,879
If there are any issues,

282
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,399
we can discuss them right now.

283
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,279
If it's fine, we can sign anytime.

284
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,519
I even brought the company seal.

285
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,960
Really?

286
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,360
Well, um...

287
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,080
Wait a moment then.

288
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,120
I-I'll go get my glasses.

289
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,600
Let me take a good look.

290
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,600
Let me see.

291
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,159
Twenty percent, right?

292
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Ten million just for renovation?

293
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,000
Then it definitely needs a proper renovation.

294
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,919
Then let's sign it today.

295
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,960
Sign.

296
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,759
Why are there rats here?

297
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,879
This... this room...

298
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,440
No, if you have any concerns, just say so.

299
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,200
No, I think it looks just fine.

300
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,480
Then let's sign it.

301
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,440
Can't sign.

302
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,000
Signed.

303
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Not signing?

304
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,080
No, what on earth do you mean?

305
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,840
Boss Dong

306
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,360
My branch here

307
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,240
is different from other places.

308
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,200
Here, you gotta be able to drink.

309
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,240
What are you staring at? Open the bottles!

310
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,879
Okay, okay, open them, open them.

311
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,519
Alright, I'll cut to the chase.

312
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:41,960
Let me ask you all,

313
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,360
what is a client manager?

314
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,879
It's a salesperson!

315
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,679
What is a salesperson?

316
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,320
Someone who keeps the client happy!

317
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,039
You know how I made it back in the day?

318
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,639
I drank my way through, one client at a time.

319
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,480
Drink, drink, drink!

320
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,720
Back then, the liquor I drank...

321
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,399
I drank until it was coming out my ears.

322
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,279
What do you do when you feel sick?

323
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,080
Stick a finger down your throat and puke in the toilet.

324
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,639
Need to vomit?

325
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,000
I'd puke, then drink, drink, then puke.

326
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,240
We've all been through that, right?

327
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,440
This, right here.

328
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,399
Oh, Boss Dong.

329
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,480
When did you get here?

330
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,679
I was really tired earlier,

331
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,679
so I took a nap in Feifei's room.

332
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
I knew you were behind this mess.

333
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,399
Then go back to sleep.

334
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,279
Hey, that's a dirty trick!

335
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,600
How low can you get? Open the door!

336
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,000
Big brother, let's sign the contract.

337
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,159
Fine, let's sign it then.

338
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,679
Big brother, you can't sign it!

339
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,840
Big brother, my money is just sitting in the account.

340
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,559
Then let's just sign it.

341
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,159
Wait.

342
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,399
Dong Qian,

343
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,720
don't think I don't know.

344
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,159
You just have your eye on Peng Le Xuan.

345
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,720
You want to use Peng Le Xuan's name

346
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,919
to rebrand your own shop.

347
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,039
I'm not wrong, am I?

348
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,159
That is my plan, yes.

349
00:14:59,159 --> 00:14:59,879
But the money

350
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,960
is real and will go straight to you, big brother.

351
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,000
And Peng Le Xuan's reputation

352
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,159
will genuinely be elevated.

353
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:04,960
Isn't this a win-win?

354
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,559
Bullshit!

355
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,320
If that happens,

356
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
the operational rights won't be in your hands anymore.

357
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,120
Future matters of Peng Le Xuan

358
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,799
won't be up to you anymore, right?

359
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,879
Big brother, let me tell you,

360
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,080
we have a professional team to run it.

361
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,240
You save the hassle and effort.

362
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,600
You just collect dividends every year.

363
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,240
Plus, you keep the title of brand founder.

364
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,840
Isn't that a good thing?

365
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,480
A good thing?

366
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,080
Big brother, don't listen to her!

367
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
If it goes this way,

368
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,799
Peng Le Xuan is practically sold to outsiders.

369
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,960
If Grandpa knew in the afterlife,

370
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,080
do you think he'd agree?

371
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,559
Shut up!

372
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,240
Open the door!

373
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,759
No, no, no!

374
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,840
I... our door is broken.

375
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,320
Look,

376
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,480
look, Qianqian.

377
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,960
This...

378
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,159
I need to think about this some more.

379
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,919
You're something else.

380
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,879
Originally, with matters like this,

381
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,759
you really shouldn't force it.

382
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,399
So how about this, big brother.

383
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,519
My terms are all out in the open anyway.

384
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,320
Big brother, you think it over carefully.

385
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Don't worry, Qianqian.

386
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,600
I know.

387
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,360
You... you wouldn't screw me over.

388
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,759
But for something this big, you know,

389
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,159
I have to discuss it with your sister-in-law.

390
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,440
We need to talk it over.

391
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,000
Right.

392
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:03,879
Yes, yes, yes.

393
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,480
Must discuss it with sister-in-law.

394
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,759
Alright, if there's nothing else, you can head back. Go on.

395
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,200
Leave it here.

396
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,320
This is what I bought for you, big brother.

397
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,919
Exactly.

398
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,519
This, this... this liquor has to stay.

399
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,720
We... we need to drink it.

400
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,000
Then let's go.

401
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,240
My bag, get my bag for me.

402
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,080
Okay, sure, sure.

403
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,399
No, Qianqian, don't listen to him.

404
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,279
Look, it's almost dinner time.

405
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,720
Let's eat before you leave.

406
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,159
No, big brother, another day.

407
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,840
Big brother, Boss Dong is busy.

408
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,600
No time for a meal.

409
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,480
Here, here, take it.

410
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,200
Troublemaker.

411
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,039
See yourself out.

412
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,799
Hey, take it easy.

413
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,919
How about I roast a couple of ducks for you, big brother?

414
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,080
Big brother, big brother, she doesn't have time for that.

415
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,399
What does she need ducks for?

416
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,279
Look at you, you...

417
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,879
Let me be clear with everyone.

418
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,080
Next year,

419
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,960
under Manager Tong's leadership,

420
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,799
serve every client well

421
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,240
and complete our targets.

422
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,039
Alright, I have other bank matters.

423
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,559
Tong, I leave it to you.

424
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,519
Get the party started!

425
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,120
Okay, okay, okay.

426
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,919
Take care, boss.

427
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,919
Watch your step, boss.

428
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,880
Shall we start then? Let's start.

429
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:17,480
Start.

430
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,519
Let's begin, Manager Tong.

431
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,599
Manager Tong, welcome to our branch.

432
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,920
From now on, we're all on the same team.

433
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,839
So, on behalf of our branch,

434
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,200
I'll bottoms up first.

435
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,720
Everyone, eat up! Eat!

436
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,200
Here.

437
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,400
Quick, quick, quick!

438
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,119
Help him, help him! Quick!

439
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,599
Let's eat.

440
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,039
Big brother.

441
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,240
Second brother, you really are a clueless straight guy.

442
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,359
They're already here.

443
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,880
And you didn't even invite them to stay for a meal.

444
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,599
Honestly, you...

445
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,079
Your favorite spicy ribbonfish. Go ahead, eat.

446
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,960
Thanks, sis-in-law.

447
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,519
Big brother, hold on, don't eat yet.

448
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,200
Listen to my idea first.

449
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,599
No, I'm hungry.

450
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,640
No, at least wait until I finish talking about this big plan.

451
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,640
Go on, say it.

452
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,759
I've been researching diligently for days.

453
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,559
I've referenced countless case studies.

454
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,000
Combined with the most cutting-edge...

455
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,839
...big data analysis and AI algorithms.

456
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,039
I've finally found a...

457
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,000
...particularly high-quality startup project.

458
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,759
You want to start a business too?

459
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,279
Are you out of your mind?

460
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,759
Why can't I start a business?

461
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,519
I was laid off...

462
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,160
No, I quit...

463
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,240
...precisely to realize my personal value.

464
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,960
Just hear me out about this business idea.

465
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,440
I guarantee it'll knock you off your feet.

466
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,640
Alright, I'm sitting tight then.

467
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,839
So I don't fall on the floor later.

468
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,839
Let me ask you...

469
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,599
Do you understand Peng Le Xuan's potential?

470
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,359
To put it simply...

471
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,519
...I plan to integrate the internet...

472
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,599
...this internet marketing philosophy...

473
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,599
Then we'll give it a complete makeover.

474
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,200
To create a fusion of traditional and modern...

475
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,559
...a perfect blend of traditional and modern...

476
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,920
...new-concept roast duck.

477
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,519
We'll make the Peng Le Xuan brand...

478
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,440
...bigger and stronger.

479
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,440
Hold on, second brother...

480
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,039
Aren't you being a bit of a jerk?

481
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:24,200
Aren't you just copying someone's homework?

482
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,000
This, isn't this just...

483
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,559
...exactly what Qianqian was saying earlier?

484
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,960
This... you can't copy homework like this!

485
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,599
What is this?

486
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,440
Big brother, let me finish first.

487
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,319
No, aren't you just cutting in on her deal?

488
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,039
That's not it.

489
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,799
My plan is... I invest, you be the boss.

490
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll work for you.

491
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,279
You mean...

492
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,440
...us brothers work together?

493
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,680
What are you doing?

494
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,720
Loosening the soil.

495
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,079
Smelling what?

496
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,920
I read in a book that...

497
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,319
...in different places...

498
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,480
...the soil smells different.

499
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,720
Why can't I smell the difference?

500
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:21,039
You smell it.

501
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:22,400
No.

502
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,799
Weiguo.

503
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:26,839
Auntie Tong.

504
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:27,880
I know since you were little...

505
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,279
...you've loved my braised pork belly.

506
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,480
Dinner will be ready soon.

507
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,759
No need, Auntie Tong. I ordered takeout.

508
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,799
It's fine, hurry up now.

509
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,319
Don't be polite.

510
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,000
Mr. Ma, your delivery.

511
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,559
Thank you.

512
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:38,200
What's all this fuss about?

513
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,839
This meal was specially prepared for the two of you.

514
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,839
You'll eat it whether you want to or not.

515
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,559
Come over here, quick.

516
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,759
Uncle Tong, I already ordered takeout.

517
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,960
No. Hurry up.

518
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,160
Come on, come on.

519
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,920
This dish here...

520
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,000
...is flavored with twenty-year-old Huadiao wine.

521
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,039
You won't find this anywhere else.

522
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:02,960
Go ahead, eat.

523
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,519
My secret recipe, my patent.

524
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,839
Eat. You eat too.

525
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:06,759
Auntie Tong, I won't stand on ceremony then.

526
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:07,480
Go ahead, eat.

527
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,519
I won't be polite then.

528
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,319
This time, it's all thanks to Weiguo.

529
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,119
Not at all.

530
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,599
Don't worry, Grandpa Tong.

531
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,279
This time...

532
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,359
...with Uncle Ma involved...

533
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,799
...the project will definitely get the green light all the way.

534
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,240
After all these years...

535
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,799
...this is the first time I feel settled.

536
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,319
Auntie Tong's braised pork belly...

537
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,640
...is better than Mom's.

538
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,319
I want to eat at Auntie Tong's house.

539
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,799
Then Mom will learn from Auntie Tong...

540
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,759
...and make it for you.

541
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,519
What's wrong?

542
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,559
In a couple of days, Mom and Dad have to go on a business trip.

543
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,279
Weiguo.

544
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,480
You wait for us at home until we return.

545
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,039
It's delicious.

546
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,559
Delicious.

547
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,759
That's good then.

548
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,400
Come on, come on.

549
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,039
Here.

550
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,319
Have another piece, another piece.

551
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,519
Alright, eat up now.

552
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,359
Uncle Tong, Auntie Tong.

553
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,160
Let me get a bottle of red wine for you to try, okay?

554
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,200
Excellent.

555
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,160
Wonderful.

556
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,920
Grandpa Tong, Grandma Tong, you should eat too.

557
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,599
You eat, go ahead and eat.

558
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,599
Dong Qian's idea is not wrong.

559
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,759
The problem lies in

560
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,440
her representing the interests of capital.

561
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,559
So we have to do this ourselves.

562
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:36,759
Funding, distribution, customers, promotion...

563
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:37,839
and so on.

564
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,720
Everything needed to start a restaurant business,

565
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,000
I have it all right here.

566
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,799
All these years I've worked at the big company,

567
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,039
were preparation for Peng Le Xuan's future.

568
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:47,680
Second brother.

569
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,599
I advise you, don't get this idea.

570
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,200
Why not?

571
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,599
Look.

572
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,880
If Qianqian does this,

573
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,799
she has capital backing her, investing money.

574
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,400
Right?

575
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,599
If she loses, the capital doesn't care.

576
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,920
Whether it makes or loses money,

577
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,880
that's what capital does, right?

578
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,480
It doesn't affect Qianqian's own income.

579
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,559
Isn't that so?

580
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,440
But if you run this operation,

581
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,279
you... you're spending your own money.

582
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Let's not even mention

583
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,359
how all those deals of yours over the years

584
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,279
got started.

585
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,160
I know all about it.

586
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,680
That money was hard-earned and put in your pocket.

587
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,880
I can't let you take this risk.

588
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Big brother, that's easy to solve.

589
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,759
I can also go raise funds.

590
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,039
Isn't financing the same?

591
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,880
That money comes to you,

592
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:32,799
but wouldn't you

593
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,799
still be bound by personal liability?

594
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,160
Wouldn't you have to sign a betting agreement?

595
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,039
You even understand these things?

596
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,319
What don't I understand?

597
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,319
Five thousand years of history, past and present, domestic and foreign.

598
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,759
Tell me, wouldn't you have to sign a bet?

599
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,640
Big brother, everything you say is correct.

600
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,640
But I'm not a novice.

601
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,440
Back when I was in investment,

602
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,559
those VPs today

603
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,920
were still in diapers.

604
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,519
A whole crowd of people begged me for favors.

605
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,599
Who dared to set conditions for me?

606
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,799
No, no, no.

607
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,720
That was then, this is now.

608
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,319
No, big brother...

609
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,720
Listen to me, don't get this idea.

610
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,400
Your big brother won't let you take this risk.

611
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,000
Let's eat.

612
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,640
This time,

613
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
I really should thank you properly.

614
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,759
Here.

615
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:18,920
Uncle Tong.

616
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,640
No need.

617
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,200
Drink up.

618
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,200
Here.

619
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,039
Come on, uncle toasts you a cup.

620
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,759
Uncle Tong, listen to me.

621
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,319
You can't write this script.

622
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,400
Why not?

623
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,079
I helped you this time,

624
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,960
but if you write this kind of script,

625
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,319
you'll be subject to gossip and criticism.

626
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,359
Are you willing to accept that?

627
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,759
Actually, I'm writing this script

628
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,279
just to earn a little extra money for the family.

629
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,240
Now Qiu'er

630
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,920
is always working outside jobs, and wants to have a baby.

631
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,839
We old folks,

632
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,920
should help out where we can.

633
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,319
Come on, come on, drink.

634
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,960
Uncle Tong, you're seventy this year, right?

635
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,119
Sixty-nine.

636
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,880
Uncle Tong, let me ask you.

637
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,039
How many complete scripts can you still write?

638
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,519
Weiguo, let's not talk about this, let's eat.

639
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,319
What if this story

640
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,480
Eat more vegetables.

641
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,119
is the last script you ever write?

642
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,480
Would you be content with that?

643
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,640
What are you saying?

644
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,039
Stop talking.

645
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,279
Here, come on.

646
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,400
Eat, eat your food.

647
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,599
Eat, eat.

648
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,400
Uncle Tong,

649
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,599
I still remember how much I admired you as a child.

650
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,680
I also really appreciated the things you wrote.

651
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,680
Just eat, okay?

652
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,000
You told me the story of *The Eagle Shooting Heroes*.

653
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,759
You said never to associate with

654
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,720
people or things you look down upon.

655
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,960
You said to stick to your principles and ideals.

656
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,279
But now...

657
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,319
Think about it.

658
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,559
Are you really content?

659
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,839
Can you swallow this indignity?

660
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,759
I'm sorry, Grandpa Tong, Grandma Tong.

661
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,799
Stop eating.

662
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,279
What are you doing?

663
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
You're the one with all the talk.

664
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,480
What are you doing?

665
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,640
I think you're only suited to eat this Japanese food.

666
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,000
You're just like that "Solitary Gourmet."

667
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,799
Did I say something wrong just now?

668
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,079
You didn't say anything wrong.

669
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,680
But can you speak properly?

670
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,160
You're harsh to me, Uncle Wang, Uncle Qiu, my cousin...

671
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,880
We can tolerate you being so mean to us.

672
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,839
Grandpa Tong has written articles his whole life.

673
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,119
In the end, to be criticized as worthless

674
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,200
by some youngster,

675
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,680
and have to rely on connections to get by...

676
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,400
Do you think he really feels good about that?

677
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,559
That's precisely why I need to advise him

678
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,079
not to waste time

679
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,559
on things not worth wasting it on.

680
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,440
He doesn't have that much time left to waste.

681
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,240
What are you laughing at?

682
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,640
You only seem smart.

683
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,599
Actually, you don't understand people's hearts at all.

684
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,519
No, it's that you don't *want* to understand.

685
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:51,759
Because in your eyes,

686
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,359
there's only one standard way to live:

687
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,160
your way, Martin's way.

688
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,160
As soon as anyone thinks differently from you,

689
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,240
you think they're wrong.

690
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,599
You think you're correcting them,

691
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,680
but is that really helping them?

692
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,400
Life really isn't as long as you imagine.

693
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,039
I speak bluntly, it can hurt people.

694
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,480
That's because I don't have that much time to waste.

695
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,640
You're really narcissistic.

696
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,960
As if only your time is precious.

697
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,480
Pretending to be profound.

698
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,440
What are you looking at?

699
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
I know why you've been avoiding me since you came back.

700
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,279
Rest assured,

701
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,000
I had no interest in you before,

702
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,640
and I have even less interest in you now.

703
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,079
So you can just settle down

704
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,279
and put your heart back in the Pacific Ocean.

705
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Brother Tong, drink, drink.

706
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,279
Brother Tong, let me tell you.

707
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,799
I'd rather have a hole in my stomach

708
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,720
than let a crack form in our friendship.

709
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:57,559
Right!

710
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,160
Drink!

711
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,119
Well said!

712
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,079
Bro, bro, let me.

713
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,559
I... I'll have one with you, bro.

714
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,039
Come on, I... I'll toast you.

715
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,359
Stop drinking, you've had enough.

716
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,000
It's fine, bro, I can hold my liquor.

717
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,400
I'm from Qingdao.

718
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,880
I'm a really heavy drinker, bro.

719
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,799
Even if you're from Qingdao, you've had a lot.

720
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,079
It's fine, bro.

721
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,000
You...

722
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,920
Eat something, eat something.

723
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,160
I'll take this away for you.

724
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,759
Bro, you're so handsome.

725
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,039
What's wrong?

726
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,200
I can't drink anymore.

727
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,720
If you can't drink, then don't.

728
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,119
What about our task?

729
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,759
No more drinking, anyone! Stop drinking!

730
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,640
Stop drinking, stop drinking.

731
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,480
Sit down and rest, quick, quick.

732
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,079
We're not doing this anymore.

733
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,920
Deposits aren't solicited this way.

734
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,400
That's how I got through it.

735
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,759
Those few are still kids.

736
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,039
You feel sorry for them, but who feels sorry for me?

737
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,559
If you really drink someone into a bad state,

738
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,720
how will you explain it to their parents?

739
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,680
I only care about the task.

740
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,319
Get the deposits you're supposed to get.

741
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,240
Are you kidding me?

742
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,720
How much can kids bring in?

743
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,960
They can't drink and they can't complete the task.

744
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,839
Are you going to shoulder their task?

745
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,200
I'll shoulder it.

746
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,200
It's not like I'm shouldering it.

747
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,960
Brother Ming, please, no need to see me out.

748
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,759
Don't bother seeing me off.

749
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,279
Please reconsider the loan matter.

750
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,720
Contact me again if you need anything.

751
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,079
Weiguo.

752
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,920
I need to see you about something now.

753
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,480
Second brother, what's up?

754
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,000
Didn't big brother disagree?

755
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:10,880
That's because he hasn't seen the money yet.

756
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,519
Once I bring in the money,

757
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,559
how could he disagree?

758
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,519
Is it reliable?

759
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:19,039
That's why I need you as insurance.

760
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,119
Me as insurance?

761
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,039
Yes.

762
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,799
Big brother cares for you the most.

763
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,599
When the time comes, help me persuade big brother.

764
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,400
Are you setting me up?

765
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,359
Why does this sound so shady to me?

766
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,720
I'll give you five percent of the shares.

767
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,279
Once the money is in place,

768
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,160
the company account will be opened at your bank too.

769
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,400
It'll count as your performance.

770
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:42,720
Is that enough?

771
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,160
Really?

772
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,759
Oh, my second brother!

773
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,960
You're truly a lifesaver, like Song Jiang.

774
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,480
You've helped me tremendously.

775
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,759
I was just about to ask Weiguo

776
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,240
to deposit some money with me,

777
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,440
to boost my performance numbers.

778
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,119
That money from our company,

779
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,680
must be at least eight to ten million, right?

780
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,039
I need to ask you a favor.

781
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,400
Can we not deposit it all at once?

782
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,319
Let's split it into eight or ten installments.

783
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,240
That way it looks like I have

784
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,279
performance every month for a year.

785
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,039
What, you're asking Ma Weiguo for a favor?

786
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,359
That was before.

787
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,319
I've now turned over a new leaf.

788
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,519
Turned over a new leaf?

789
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,240
Come on, come on, drive!

790
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,240
Where are we going?

791
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,119
Take me home.

792
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,519
You have the nerve.

793
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,200
And I'm supposed to take you home?

794
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Get out, walk back yourself. I have things to do.

795
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,279
What things?

796
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,079
Do I have to tell you my business?

797
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,160
You're messing with me.

798
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,680
Hurry up.

799
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,279
Alright.

800
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Heartless.

801
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,119
There's nothing wrong with this project.

802
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,880
But the environment isn't good right now.

803
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,519
And you,

804
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,680
don't have much practical operational experience.

805
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,039
How about

806
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,880
transferring this project directly to us?

807
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,559
The way you put it...

808
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,759
couldn't be more blunt.

809
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:18,839
But it's correct.

810
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:22,039
Li Lianbao really is insulated from good luck.

811
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,559
Clearly the protagonist,

812
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,759
why does he live like a non-player character?

813
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,400
Trouble follows him every moment.

814
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:30,319
Now big brother and Tong Qiu are dragged in too.

815
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,799
Looks like it won't be long

816
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,680
before I have to step in to bail someone out.

817
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,160
What was that saying before?

818
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,799
Ma Weiguo,

819
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,559
you're really going to plague me for life.

820
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,759
Yes, that's the one.

821
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,240
I've switched careers to insurance now.

822
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,599
Don't look down on it.

823
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,039
It's a very meaningful industry.

824
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,319
And furthermore,

825
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:03,799
it's a benevolent act that benefits humanity.

826
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,319
You know?

827
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,880
Ever since I entered this field,

828
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,720
my life suddenly

829
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,880
is no longer aimless.

830
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,279
Listen to me.

831
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,000
Stop chasing after these

832
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,319
startups and investments.

833
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:19,240
Hurry up and join us.

834
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,240
Join our warm, big family.

835
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,400
Old Li, you know me.

836
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,279
I don't invest in entrepreneurs

837
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,599
over thirty years old.

838
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,480
Young people,

839
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,920
have plenty of room to grow.

840
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,640
But at our age,

841
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,160
with a bit of money in hand,

842
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,319
just enjoy life, that's enough.

843
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,800
Old Fei, where are you?

844
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,679
Lianbao.

845
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,519
Sorry about this.

846
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,400
I have a last-minute meeting today.

847
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,599
I can't make it to the meal.

848
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,119
Alright.

849
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,639
You go ahead and take care of your business.

850
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,960
We'll get together another time.

851
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,119
Let's meet up another day then.

852
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,280
The hotel owner came to console me, saying

853
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,239
Such a large private room

854
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,440
hasn't been booked for a long time.

855
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,199
The owner is a good person.

856
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,000
But he's right.

857
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,519
Those were the good old days.

858
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:57,159
This place was always bustling.

859
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,280
Everyone would come over to toast me.

860
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,159
Glasses clinking back and forth,

861
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,039
every drink was a bond of friendship.

862
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,679
I used to think that on these dinner tables,

863
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,239
being lively and happy

864
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,679
was just a natural, given thing.

865
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,440
Only now do I understand

866
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,079
that hosting a dinner party

867
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,639
is so difficult.

868
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,320
Lianbao.

869
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,440
To be honest with you,

870
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,840
these people are all dogs.

871
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Bullshit.

872
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,239
They really came for you.

873
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,039
Yes.

874
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,880
I was the one who set this up for you.

875
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,480
Alright.

876
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,119
You've had too much today.

877
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,000
But you want to squeeze money from them.

878
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,079
Have you ever thought,

879
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:17,360
when you were at your lowest,

880
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,920
did any of these bastards lift a finger to help?

881
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,280
Lianbao, I'll be straight with you.

882
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,719
This gathering,

883
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,119
I never really wanted to arrange it.

884
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,679
I bet fifty million.

885
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:39,719
Fifty million.

886
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,320
Two projects.

887
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,960
Just two projects.

888
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,159
Lost it all.

889
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,519
Up to my neck in debt.

890
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,280
I thought to myself,

891
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,079
I can't even afford to play anymore myself,

892
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,079
why should I bother with you?

893
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,360
But then I thought again,

894
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,079
what if?

895
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,920
What if you got some money

896
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,559
and bounced back?

897
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:04,679
Lianbao.

898
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,679
You're not like those bastards.

899
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,760
You're not like me either.

900
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,519
You can make it.

901
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,000
I believe in you.

902
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:19,920
Earlier...

903
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,480
You drank too fast today, take it easy.

904
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,440
I'm okay.

905
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:28,199
So, shall we have a bit more?

906
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,239
Alright.

907
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,800
That money...

908
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,519
Alright, alright, alright.

909
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,280
Manager Li, the bill is settled.

910
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,599
Let's go.

911
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,480
What about them?

912
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,760
I'm tired.

913
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,639
Brother Liu.

914
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,079
Sorry to bother you so late.

915
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:32,719
My gout is acting up.

916
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,599
I have another engagement tomorrow noon,

917
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,639
driving will probably be tough.

918
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,000
You'll have to come pick me up.

919
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:41,400
No problem, no problem.

920
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,039
Get some rest, I'm hanging up.

921
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,159
Hello, honey?

922
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,320
Wife.

923
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,280
I've really run into an unexpected situation here.

924
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,039
Can we postpone it for another couple of days?

925
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,639
Then I'll come back to Beijing.

926
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,400
Don't trouble yourself with the trip.

927
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,719
I promise, as soon as I'm done here,

928
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:39,360
I'll go to Xi'an immediately.

929
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,119
Okay, I have to go to a meeting now.

930
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,480
When will your money come through?

931
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,840
Is it reliable or not?

932
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,679
If it really doesn't work, I'll ask Weiguo.

933
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,400
At least his money is readily available.

934
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,480
Go on, all of you go find Ma Weiguo!

935
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,159
Without Ma Weiguo,

936
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,559
you all can't survive, is that it?

937
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:01,920
Honestly.

938
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:05,280
Manager Li, who else are we meeting today?

939
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,840
Let's go, we're going to see Dong Qian.

940
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:12,760
Got it.

941
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,280
Li Lianbao, you're utterly shameless!

942
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,960
You just modified my project and used it.

943
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,119
Do you have any shame left?

944
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,559
This circle is only so big.

945
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,119
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?

946
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:31,000
I wasn't afraid of you knowing in the first place.

947
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:33,400
Besides, everyone wants a good project.

948
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,119
Fair competition, then.

949
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:35,840
Fair competition?

950
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,639
Why don't you go find your own project?

951
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,840
Arguing over this shows a lack of vision.

952
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,840
We're both doing this for the boss's good.

953
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:47,920
Fine, today I'll show some big-picture thinking.

954
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,000
I won't argue with you about who's right or wrong.

955
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,480
So, having trouble finding money, huh?

956
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,760
Who says?

957
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:58,119
I have several potential clients already.

958
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:01,360
I need to choose carefully,

959
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,639
and then maybe set up something like

960
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,400
a last-place elimination or something.

961
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,400
Li Lianbao, oh Li Lianbao.

962
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,239
We've known each other since we were born, right?

963
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,079
We know each other inside out.

964
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,639
Why are you putting on an act with me?

965
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,639
Yes, usually

966
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,559
we always bicker as soon as we meet.

967
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,840
But when it comes down to it,

968
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,679
there's no deep-seated hatred, right?

969
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,559
Our mothers are sworn sisters.

970
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,840
My grandma and your grandpa...

971
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,800
Stop, stop, stop.

972
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,840
Let's not trace it back any further.

973
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,400
If we keep going back like this,

974
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,679
we'll really become childhood sweethearts!

975
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,159
You know,

976
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,639
sometimes I don't know

977
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,320
if you're really naive or just pretending.

978
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,840
What do you mean?

979
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:51,880
Usually,

980
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:54,000
I really wish I could step on you a couple of times.

981
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,480
But when I see you at your wit's end,

982
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,119
I hope you can pull through.

983
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,960
Just look at society today.

984
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,239
Those who can truly let their guard down and be honest

985
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:06,760
seem to be only a few of us

986
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,239
who grew up together.

987
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,960
So, you, towards me...
