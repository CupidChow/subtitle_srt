1
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:37,840
Feifei.

2
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,560
Remember this.

3
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,319
In the future,

4
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,519
you'll encounter all sorts of things.

5
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,079
No matter what,

6
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,599
you must stay brave.

7
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,599
Understand?

8
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,599
Okay.

9
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,719
And what about you?

10
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,519
Will you be brave too?

11
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,799
Oh, right.

12
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,120
There's someone right now

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,520
you need to go see immediately.

14
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,319
Nah, forget it.

15
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,120
What do you mean "forget it"?

16
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,560
Go on! Come on.

17
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,000
Go right now.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,520
Right now.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,759
Alright.

20
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Be brave!

21
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,639
Feifei.

22
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,639
What's up? Sneaking around.

23
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,439
Are you looking for me or not?

24
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,000
I...

25
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,400
You, you, you, you...

26
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,840
What's wrong?

27
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:05,879
It's not that.

28
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,719
You know about me and Uncle Ma, right?

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,960
You and Uncle Ma didn't have a falling out, right?

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,280
No.

31
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,759
We're good.

32
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
He and I,

33
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,360
we can talk about anything.

34
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,400
That's good then.

35
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,560
So...

36
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,039
This matter is...

37
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
behind us.

38
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,280
Behind us.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,759
Maybe I still need some time.

40
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,199
But it's fine, it's my own issue.

41
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,719
I just hope

42
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,560
we can get along like before.

43
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,840
Sis.

44
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,000
You don't need to feel pressured.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,840
Or avoid me.

46
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Or be shy.

47
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,000
You little rascal, turning the tables on me!

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,639
You're the one who's been avoiding me!

49
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,800
Yeah, yeah.

50
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
Alright, don't be sad.

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,000
Heartbreak

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
is a required course for growing up.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,159
You'll get used to it.

54
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,759
Sis, right now the whole Baofang Hutong,

55
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,280
even Auntie Zhao is comforting me.

56
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,319
I really don't need one more person.

57
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,080
Fine.

58
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,840
I was just afraid

59
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,120
of losing a little brother like you.

60
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm late, Sis.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,039
Sis, I really have to go.

62
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,800
Otherwise you really will lose me.

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,360
Go on.

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,400
Pay attention in class.

65
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,840
Bye.

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,399
Bye.

67
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,120
So where exactly is this place?

68
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,079
Don't ask so many questions.

69
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,040
I've got it all arranged.

70
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,360
Just follow me.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,839
Always so mysterious and secretive.

72
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,319
Chunsheng, not bad!

73
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,839
A Harley Street Glide.

74
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,160
Chrome luggage rack.

75
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,079
Fairing.

76
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,959
Upgraded suspension.

77
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,519
This bike is sweet.

78
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
Wow, you know your stuff.

79
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,519
That's about the extent of my knowledge.

80
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,800
Talking like a real expert.

81
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,199
Big bro.

82
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:54,720
Really nice!

83
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,519
Uncle Wang.

84
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,360
Whose bike is this?

85
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,319
Mine.

86
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,759
What about the old one?

87
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,800
Why'd you get a new one?

88
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,839
The old one's ancient, I'm keeping it as a collectible.

89
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,120
This one's brand new.

90
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
I plan to take your auntie out on a trip.

91
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,120
Then, then what about Feifei?

92
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,319
Feifei's about to

93
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,519
start college soon, right?

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,079
We need to get used to being a couple again.

95
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,160
So Feifei's on his own.

96
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,800
And the restaurant...

97
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
The restaurant is your responsibility too.

98
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,360
Alright then.

99
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,800
Wife, let's go!

100
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,560
Stop rushing me!

101
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,800
I need to sort things out at the restaurant first.

102
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Auntie.

103
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,839
Sis, you look twenty years younger!

104
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,079
That's a bit of an exaggeration.

105
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,160
More like ten years or so.

106
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,160
Auntie, if you dressed like this every day,

107
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,319
Uncle Wang would be totally smitten.

108
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,560
Would your Uncle Wang dare look at anyone else now?

109
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,600
Let's go, beautiful.

110
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,600
So sweet.

111
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
Let's go.

112
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,519
Wow, this gear is really something.

113
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,160
We're off!

114
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,399
Be safe!

115
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,279
Have fun!

116
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,160
Old Wang, shirking his duties.

117
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,800
Off to be romantic.

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,519
Watch your leg swinging on!

119
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,120
Be careful, Auntie!

120
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,839
Have your fun, but be safe, okay?

121
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,120
Take a picture!

122
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,800
Safe travels!

123
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,319
Go!

124
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:00,959
We're leaving!

125
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,639
Fun, riding a motorcycle like this.

126
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,519
What a gas guzzler.

127
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,519
It's quite spacious.

128
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,439
This place is really nice.

129
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,160
But it must be expensive, right?

130
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,480
I can't afford it.

131
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Actually,

132
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,720
Actually... Stop with the "actually"!

133
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,360
I told you, I have principles.

134
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,879
I have to handle everything for this photo exhibition myself.

135
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,560
Actually, it's not as expensive as you think.

136
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,879
You can afford it.

137
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,560
The owner here,

138
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,319
also grew up in Beijing.

139
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,160
He lives abroad now.

140
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,639
When he heard

141
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,920
you wanted to hold an exhibition about Beijing's ecology,

142
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,959
he got really excited.

143
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,519
So he gave us a discount.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,199
Really?

145
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
You must have blackmailed him or something.

146
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,920
Honestly, Xiaoqi arranged it.

147
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,519
Really.

148
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,319
The day he came to see me,

149
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,399
he had already made the arrangements.

150
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,079
He told me not to tell you.

151
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,160
And insisted on taking the credit for it.

152
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,399
That little punk is actually not so bad.

153
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,519
I got something for you.

154
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,839
What is it?

155
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,319
Well?

156
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,799
You remembered?

157
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:34,879
I remember.

158
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,120
Come in.

159
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,279
Hello.

160
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:10,879
Hello.

161
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,919
Alright, have a seat.

162
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,720
Thank you, thank you.

163
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,120
Tong Qiu, right?

164
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,240
I heard you were fired.

165
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
And for inappropriate conduct with the opposite sex.

166
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,840
Mr. Tong,

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,480
your background check did not pass.

168
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,360
Very regrettable.

169
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,480
Sorry. We look forward to future cooperation.

170
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,120
Thank you.

171
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,159
Goodbye.

172
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,639
Brother Ming.

173
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,879
Xiao Tong.

174
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,080
You're here to... to hire people.

175
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,159
Interviewing?

176
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,360
You... your side...

177
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,639
had some issues.

178
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,799
I can... can understand. This, this...

179
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:03,399
It's tough to achieve good performance these days.

180
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,360
If the heart is there, the dream is there.

181
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,960
At worst, you just start over.

182
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,519
Going to the restroom.

183
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:18,320
Well...

184
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,440
You go ahead then.

185
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,159
I'm not in a hurry.

186
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Then I'll go first.

187
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,519
So awkward.

188
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,559
A terrifying coincidence.

189
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,360
Hello?

190
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,720
Lian Bao.

191
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,159
Have you signed Yuanyuan's immigration consent form?

192
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,279
I was just about to. What's up?

193
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,559
Don't sign it yet.

194
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,320
Make a big scene, then quietly leave.

195
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
Easier said than done.

196
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,679
Too much reluctance and concern.

197
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,759
Prevent me from leaving quietly.

198
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,919
Let alone actually leaving.

199
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,480
Since things can't be spoken plainly,

200
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,840
leaving some hope is better for everyone.

201
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
All I can do

202
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,480
is try to settle everything properly.

203
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,879
And then...

204
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,480
quietly await that day's arrival.

205
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,440
Mom, Dad, I'll hang up now.

206
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Okay, okay, okay.

207
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:09,480
Alright.

208
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,720
Bye, bye, bye.

209
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,039
You're useless too.

210
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,840
Can't even compete with those young kids at work.

211
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,399
Who pays the mortgage?

212
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,600
A grown man,

213
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,120
doesn't know to focus on his career.

214
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,440
Our company

215
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,240
has a transfer opportunity.

216
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,440
To Xi'an.

217
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,759
Salary increases by fifty percent.

218
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,440
Not coming back for a year?

219
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,320
That... wouldn't work.

220
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,799
But this time is different.

221
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,799
It's not just a salary increase.

222
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,080
There's a chance to become a director.

223
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,840
Right now, the competition for the director position

224
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,639
is extremely fierce.

225
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,320
And headquarters' idea is that

226
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,240
if I stay in Xi'an for another year,

227
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,879
it's more secure.

228
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,039
Stay another year?

229
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,519
Your key performance indicators for the past six months

230
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,600
haven't been properly met.

231
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Daily reports, monthly, quarterly, annual reports...

232
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,720
Look at the garbage you wrote yourself.

233
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,799
Don't be angry.

234
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,320
Yes, it's my problem.

235
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,799
It really is my problem.

236
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,679
Honey.

237
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,600
This promotion probably isn't happening this time.

238
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,480
And the next promotion probably won't happen either.

239
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,720
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,320
What a mess.

241
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,679
Why do you think everything is so simple?

242
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
This matter of yours is unclear.

243
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,600
Would another bank dare hire you?

244
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,799
Yes, yes, yes.

245
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,480
Don't... don't get worked up.

246
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,440
Besides,

247
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,919
those two clients of yours,

248
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,639
did you get them through your own ability?

249
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,559
Don't you think it's strange?

250
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,079
Before, Yuanyuan said she didn't want to immigrate.

251
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,839
Now she suddenly changed her mind.

252
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,640
Kids...

253
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,680
Maybe Yuanyuan just feels sorry for her old dad,

254
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,279
trying to cheer me up for a bit.

255
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,000
The way you are as a father...

256
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,079
You have so little faith

257
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,599
in Yuanyuan's feelings for you.

258
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,039
What do you mean?

259
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,279
Yuanyuan actually didn't tell you the truth at all.

260
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,559
You know how it is,

261
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,119
kids can't keep secrets.

262
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,319
She told Xuanxuan about it.

263
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,079
Xuanxuan told me.

264
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,599
She said she doesn't want to go abroad at all.

265
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,839
Hu Nana told her to say that to you.

266
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,880
Jenny

267
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,039
Do you love Daddy?

268
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:07,839
Yes.

269
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,039
Daddy is in trouble now.

270
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,480
Do you want to help him?

271
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,039
Yes.

272
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,079
You know what, Jenny?

273
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:21,480
Uncle Kevin is Daddy's investor.

274
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,359
If it weren't for Uncle Kevin,

275
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,000
Daddy wouldn't have a job.

276
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,119
But now,

277
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,519
Uncle Kevin wants you and Mommy

278
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,279
to move abroad together.

279
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,359
If you don't want to go,

280
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,279
Uncle Kevin will be unhappy.

281
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,240
And if Uncle Kevin is unhappy,

282
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,640
Daddy will lose his job.

283
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,519
What should I do then?

284
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,599
I don't want Daddy to be sad.

285
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,319
So,

286
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,839
you need to tell Daddy

287
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,200
that you want to move abroad with Mommy.

288
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,799
And also,

289
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,839
you must tell Daddy

290
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,640
that it's your own idea.

291
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
If Daddy finds out the truth,

292
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,960
he'll be very, very upset.

293
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,119
Understand?

294
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,000
I understand.

295
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,839
Come on, pinky swear with Mommy.

296
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,759
Pinky swear, a solemn vow,

297
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,559
for a hundred years, no changing.

298
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,440
Seal it.

299
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,599
What if you break it?

300
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:14,240
A puppy.

301
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,039
A puppy, you'd be a puppy.

302
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,279
You'd be a big dog.

303
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,720
What a jerk!

304
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,680
She's lying to Yuanyuan.

305
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,920
And using me to threaten Yuanyuan.

306
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,960
How could she do such a thing?

307
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,599
I think you need to...

308
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,359
I'm going to confront her.

309
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,960
Lianbao, don't be impulsive.

310
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,640
Li Lianbao!

311
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,759
Hu!

312
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:39,799
When we divorced,

313
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,279
you wanted custody of Yuanyuan.

314
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,920
I thought since she was young,

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,759
being with her mother might be better.

316
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:45,920
So I didn't fight you for it.

317
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,279
All these years,

318
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,480
you've been badmouthing me to Yuanyuan.

319
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,759
Saying our marriage fell apart

320
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,000
because I neglected the family.

321
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,119
I put up with that too.

322
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,759
Now you're lying to Yuanyuan again.

323
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,440
Is this how a mother should act?

324
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,599
Just give up on this idea.

325
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,799
I will absolutely not agree

326
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,240
to Yuanyuan emigrating with you.

327
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,440
If you keep playing

328
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,759
your dirty tricks behind my back,

329
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,359
we'll have a nice chat in court

330
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,359
about custody.

331
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,039
Li Lianbao,

332
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,039
I'm doing this for the child's own good.

333
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,480
Cut the crap with me.

334
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,519
If you dare lie to Yuanyuan again,

335
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,519
you'll have me to deal with.

336
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,119
Is Lao Kai involved in this too?

337
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,839
Where is he?

338
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,680
Wait for me a second.

339
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,519
Sis! Sis!

340
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,279
Director Gao!

341
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,960
Your bathroom...

342
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,039
Gao Feng!

343
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,519
Brother Bao!

344
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,920
Brother Bao!

345
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
What took you so long?

346
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,519
Quick, come in and have a drink with us.

347
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:39,920
What are you doing here?

348
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,799
We're celebrating our success here.

349
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,000
Drinking!

350
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,960
Come on, come on!

351
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,759
Director Gao, let me show you.

352
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,240
Sis, it's fine, wait a moment.

353
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,000
Director Gao!

354
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,759
No, you explain first.

355
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:50,920
What's going on here?

356
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,720
Brother Bao, I really have to thank you.

357
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,240
Thank you for transferring your shares to Kevin.

358
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
That's what allowed

359
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,359
Honeycomb Tech to break through successfully.

360
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,759
I promise,

361
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,359
when it's time for the IPO,

362
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,799
we'll definitely invite you

363
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,039
to ring the bell together with us.

364
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,119
IPO?

365
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,480
Yes, an IPO!

366
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,519
Once we're listed,

367
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,039
our hardships will finally pay off.

368
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,119
It's just a bit regrettable

369
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,839
that you didn't hold on till the end.

370
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,440
But it's okay!

371
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,599
Selling those shares

372
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,039
earned you a pretty penny, right?

373
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,519
Now we're all free!

374
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,000
Financially free!

375
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,440
See? That's what I was saying.

376
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,480
Financially free!

377
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,039
Weren't you going to the bathroom?

378
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,319
Don't hold it in, you'll hurt yourself.

379
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,720
Right, right. Brother Bao, Brother Bao,

380
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,440
let's go, let's go.

381
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,920
Wait for me.

382
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,519
Nana, take care of him, quick.

383
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,519
Let's talk outside.

384
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,799
Talk. What's going on?

385
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,680
It's really nothing.

386
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,400
I simply

387
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,880
helped Honeycomb Tech with a tech pivot,

388
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,960
integrating it into my other investment areas.

389
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,759
The feedback has actually been excellent.

390
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,160
Better than I ever expected.

391
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,240
An IPO is indeed on the agenda now.

392
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,920
No big issues.

393
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,400
Tom.

394
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,119
Let me share something else with you.

395
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,960
The shares you transferred to me

396
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,279
will soon be worth a hundred million.

397
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,480
No, probably more than a hundred million.

398
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,200
You've been scheming against me from the start.

399
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,039
In business, that's not called scheming.

400
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,079
It's strategy.

401
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,440
I told you,

402
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,000
the things I want,

403
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,079
others will hand to me willingly.

404
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:46,559
Right?

405
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,079
Honeycomb Tech

406
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,960
has nothing to do with you anymore.

407
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,079
At most, you're just a...

408
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,599
predecessor.

409
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,119
Come on, want to join us for a drink?

410
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,119
Tom.

411
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,359
Sorry, Manager Li.

412
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,319
I'm just executing the layoff list

413
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,400
set by Kevin.

414
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,160
Please cooperate.

415
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,519
Complete the procedures as soon as possible.

416
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,440
Haven't you always wanted

417
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,160
shares in Hive Tech?

418
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,119
Sure.

419
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,000
Name your price.

420
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,519
The price is negotiable.

421
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,240
But I have one condition.

422
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,200
You must invest in Penglexuan.

423
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,079
Jenny,

424
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,240
tell your dad yourself.

425
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,079
Dad, I'm sorry.

426
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,880
I thought about it again,

427
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,599
and Mom and Uncle Kevin are right.

428
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:01,319
Lao Kai,

429
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,119
was moving abroad your idea?

430
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,559
Tom, calm down.

431
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,119
We really just wanted

432
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,559
a better life for Jenny.

433
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,200
Lao Zhang,

434
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,440
Lao Ma, I've figured it out.

435
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,279
This Kevin guy is really something.

436
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,000
He completely severed

437
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,160
Hive Tech's

438
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,279
home entertainment division.

439
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,759
He pivoted entirely to smart agriculture.

440
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,200
And what's more,

441
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:53,279
he used

442
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,480
two of Hive Tech's original

443
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,880
patents for entertainment photography,

444
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,799
for dynamic tracking and capture,

445
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,200
to develop a whole new

446
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,240
pest and disease control system.

447
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,240
His earlier investments in Southeast Asia

448
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,680
and that new agri-tech company in Central Europe

449
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,440
were all to set up this play in advance?

450
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,759
Exactly.

451
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,000
Hive Tech's patents

452
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,240
can seamlessly integrate with those companies.

453
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,519
The entire upstream and downstream supply chain

454
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,759
has already been connected.

455
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,440
And from what I know,

456
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,519
he's already signed cooperation agreements

457
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:27,240
with certain countries' agriculture ministries.

458
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,640
Alright, I got it.

459
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,759
Send me the detailed information.

460
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,119
I'll contact you later.

461
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,559
Okay.

462
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,319
So, how's it going?

463
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,240
Not bad.

464
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,759
Nice, looks pretty professional.

465
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,599
What are you doing with that?

466
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,039
I still want

467
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,880
to make the photo frames by hand.

468
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,279
But I'd like you to help me design them.

469
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,200
What do you have in mind?

470
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,960
I want all the frames

471
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,079
to be different sizes.

472
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,200
But I think this area is really good.

473
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,559
It faces the sunlight perfectly.

474
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,519
I'd like to put some

475
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,559
larger photos here,

476
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,640
to highlight the theme.

477
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,440
What do you think?

478
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,559
Sounds good.

479
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,839
Since you're working so hard,

480
00:26:58,839 --> 00:26:59,960
here's a gift for you.

481
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,519
Getting a gift before I even start?

482
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,039
Here.

483
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,720
These...

484
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,880
Aren't these the ones from the market last time?

485
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,960
I bought them back then just for a photoshoot.

486
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,759
Now that the shoot's done,

487
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,640
I can give them to you.

488
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:15,759
Thanks.

489
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,440
Try them on.

490
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:18,960
Now?

491
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,559
Yeah.

492
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,559
You have to wear these shoes.

493
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,200
They go perfectly with your outfit.

494
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,599
Come on, try them!

495
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:25,279
Try them on!

496
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,039
Comfortable?

497
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,240
How are they?

498
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:41,160
Alright.

499
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,039
Do they fit?

500
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:42,880
They fit pretty well.

501
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,400
What a coincidence, I just bought them and they're your size.

502
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:48,720
Thanks, they're quite comfortable.

503
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,799
Stay like that.

504
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,359
Sit down, let me take a picture.

505
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,039
No need.

506
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,039
Picture. Sit.

507
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,240
Really, no.

508
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,079
Hold this.

509
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,079
Isn't this silly?

510
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,079
It's supposed to be silly.

511
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,119
Now hold this one too.

512
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,480
Here.

513
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,079
Look at me.

514
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,079
Fine.

515
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:05,880
Look at me.

516
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,640
One, two...

517
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,440
You're being a bit...

518
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,160
You're being a bit too goofy.

519
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,079
One, two, three!

520
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:23,960
Now a proper one.

521
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,839
One, two, three!

522
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,640
Hello?

523
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,319
Tongtong?

524
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,480
I saw the photo you sent me.

525
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,039
It looks really nice.

526
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:34,799
Why aren't you asleep yet?

527
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,960
What's wrong with you?

528
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,839
You sound a bit off.

529
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,920
What about you, why aren't you asleep?

530
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,480
I'd like to ask you

531
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,279
for a favor.

532
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,839
I don't know if you'd be willing.

533
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
Of course I'm willing.

534
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,720
Just say it.

535
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,759
I'd like to ask you

536
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,319
to help me document

537
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,559
the time I have left.

538
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,079
Is that okay?

539
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,880
If you don't want to, it's fine.

540
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,799
No pressure.

541
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,480
I'll do it.

542
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,640
That's great.

543
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,079
Well then...

544
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,480
If there's nothing else, you should rest early.

545
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,480
Good night.

546
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,680
Good night.

547
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,720
I want to buy back all your shares in Penglexuan.

548
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,400
To force me out.

549
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,319
That's right.

550
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,039
I don't want to work with you anymore.

551
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,400
You're so underhanded.

552
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,519
Tom.

553
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,920
Do you know why

554
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,720
I invested in Penglexuan with my personal company?

555
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,240
It's because from the very start,

556
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,920
I never had faith in you.

557
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,599
You think

558
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,920
just because you spent a few years at a platform,

559
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,359
you can start a business?

560
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,160
In reality,

561
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,720
you have neither the vision to understand the market

562
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,880
nor the ability to execute and strategize.

563
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,720
Take Honeycomb Tech, for example.

564
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,599
How many years did you have it?

565
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,880
Did you make any money?

566
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,720
When I bought it at five times the price,

567
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,200
you were perfectly happy.

568
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,640
But when I used my own ability

569
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,920
to multiply its value dozens of times,

570
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,720
you couldn't accept it.

571
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,759
Your understanding

572
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
and ambition only go this far.

573
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,559
That's right.

574
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,599
My investment in Penglexuan

575
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,200
was solely

576
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,440
to get shares in Honeycomb Tech.

577
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,960
As for the Penglexuan investment,

578
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,640
I could let it go down the drain. I don't care.

579
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,920
That was always the plan.

580
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,599
But I didn't expect you to get lucky.

581
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,359
Martin was still willing to help you.

582
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,599
Too bad

583
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:37,599
he won't be around much longer either.

584
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,880
He'll outlive you.

585
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:42,920
Without Martin,

586
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
just you and that cook,

587
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,440
sorry,

588
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,720
at the time, I had no hope

589
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,119
for Penglexuan's development.

590
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,720
Cut the crap.

591
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,000
Are you selling out or not?

592
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,640
Yes, of course I'm selling.

593
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,160
My goal has been achieved.

594
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,880
And this project is too risky.

595
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,720
Why wouldn't I sell?

596
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,039
Then hurry up.

597
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,759
According to the original agreement,

598
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,039
how the buyback happens

599
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,640
is up to me.

600
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,720
Name your price.

601
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,440
For Jenny's sake,

602
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,760
and considering our relationship,

603
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,880
I won't ask for much.

604
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,880
A flat price: thirty million.

605
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:17,960
Are you insane?

606
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,039
Thirty million?

607
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,800
Is he out of his mind?

608
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,800
He only invested ten million total with us!

609
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,239
That's a twenty million profit in and out!

610
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,360
He's robbing us!

611
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,800
That's exactly what he's doing now!

612
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,480
Forget that we don't even have thirty million right now,

613
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,440
even if we did, we wouldn't give it to that bastard!

614
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,360
No matter what,

615
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,639
I must get him out.

616
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,880
Wait, Lianbao.

617
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,320
Don't get so worked up yet.

618
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,199
Weiguo,

619
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,119
other than forcing him out,

620
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,239
do we have any other options?

621
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:59,800
According to the agreement,

622
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,360
if we want to force him out,

623
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,400
right now we can only agree to his demands.

624
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,440
Just thinking about

625
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,800
working for him in the future,

626
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,199
every penny Penglexuan earns

627
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,320
still having to give him a cut,

628
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,519
I can't stand it.

629
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,199
Lianbao.

630
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:16,199
A little impatience spoils great plans.

631
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,199
Anger is a major taboo in business.

632
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,679
I know what you want to say,

633
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,000
but I don't want to hear it right now.

634
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,639
This Kevin, as darn it as he is,

635
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,280
he's not wrong in what he did.

636
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,800
He just did what a businessman

637
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,880
is supposed to do:

638
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,920
maximize his own commercial value.

639
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:32,760
I think

640
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,760
first, you need to separate the Honeycomb issue.

641
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,559
Kevin is right about this.

642
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,239
The equity is in your hands,

643
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,920
but without his resources,

644
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,440
that equity is basically worthless.

645
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,199
So what he did

646
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,559
is, relatively speaking, helping you get out of a bind.

647
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,239
So according to you,

648
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,559
I should thank him?

649
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,360
Objectively speaking, yes.

650
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,039
As for how much money he makes with that equity,

651
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:56,079
that's his business, not yours.

652
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,320
Our Penglexuan is just starting out.

653
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,800
There's no need to burn bridges with him.

654
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,440
Wait until our Penglexuan

655
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,800
is strong and thriving,

656
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,320
then it won't be too late to challenge him.

657
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,119
I won't accept it.

658
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:06,760
Lianbao.

659
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,000
Alright, alright, I know everything you say is right.

660
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,320
I also know you mean well for me.

661
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,119
Thank you.

662
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,800
But no matter the cost,

663
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,559
I must get Old Kai out.

664
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,320
This isn't just a business matter.

665
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,320
It's personal between him and me.

666
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,360
Lianbao.

667
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,000
Alright, alright.

668
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,360
This isn't just a spur-of-the-moment impulse for me.

669
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,199
I've thought it through carefully.

670
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,440
After Dong Qian's money comes in,

671
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,639
the shares Old Kai holds will double in value anyway.

672
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,760
If we buy those shares back now,

673
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
our stake in Penglexuan will be larger.

674
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
In the future, those shares

675
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,360
will definitely be worth more than they are now.

676
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,000
I understand, but

677
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,559
we can't be so optimistic about things.

678
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,039
We have to consider the worst-case scenario first.

679
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,000
If I let him keep walking all over me,

680
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,039
the rest of my life might as well be dead.

681
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,760
That is the worst outcome.

682
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,360
I'm back!

683
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,719
Why haven't you eaten?

684
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,480
I'm talking to you.

685
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:13,320
I'm working on the script right now.

686
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,599
No time for that.

687
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,800
Your, uh...

688
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,400
Put it in the fridge.

689
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,840
I'll eat it in a bit.

690
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,960
It's not just today, is it?

691
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,280
It's been several days now.

692
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,960
What's going on with you?

693
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,039
If you're not feeling well,

694
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,400
I'll take you to the hospital.

695
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,519
No, no, don't.

696
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,840
Stop, I'm fine.

697
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,800
I'm begging you, okay?

698
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,039
I'm begging you, don't disturb me.

699
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,039
These past few days,

700
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,920
you've been staying up late every night.

701
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,599
You get up at dawn and start writing again.

702
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,079
Are you trying to ruin your health?

703
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,039
Stop writing.

704
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,679
You need to eat properly.

705
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
See, see?

706
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,480
All my inspiration,

707
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,079
you've just chattered it all away.

708
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,559
Old lady, listen to me.

709
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,360
The production company,

710
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,199
they're meeting me in a couple of days.

711
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,840
I'll just write for a little while, okay?

712
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,719
Just a little while.

713
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,559
Qiu'er isn't short of work.

714
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,800
Where did you get that idea?

715
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,480
I'm not writing for his sake.

716
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,960
I'm doing it for myself.

717
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
Don't think I don't know.

718
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,480
Before Qiu'er quit his job,

719
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
you weren't writing like this,

720
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,440
day and night.

721
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,760
Our Qiu'er is being so stubborn now,

722
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,239
isn't it just to keep us old folks from worrying?

723
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:37,960
Isn't that right?

724
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,760
You know how hard it is to find a job now.

725
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:44,079
Plus, our Qiu'er is too picky.

726
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,719
And on top of that, they're about to have a baby.

727
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,440
It's so hard.

728
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,840
Just a little writing, a little writing.

729
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,960
Aren't there his brothers?

730
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,559
He won't suffer.

731
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
You, don't be like this.

732
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,320
Just eat your meal properly.

733
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,480
Come eat first, okay?

734
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,559
I know my own condition.

735
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,480
Let me tell you,

736
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,840
I just want to finish the first few episodes.

737
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,000
Finish them and sign the contract.

738
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,440
Once the contract is signed,

739
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,440
the deposit will come through.

740
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,000
Aren't you...

741
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,320
...feeling more at ease now?

742
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:17,840
Right?

743
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Just a bit of writing, a bit.

744
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,559
That's still not okay.

745
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,079
No, no.

746
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,440
Alright, promise me one thing.

747
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Don't you dare tell our son about this.

748
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,400
He's having such a hard time, too much pressure.

749
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,559
Deal?

750
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:31,039
No.

751
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,840
You absolutely must not tell Qiu'er.

752
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,440
Do you hear me?

753
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,719
He's under way too much pressure right now.

754
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,760
Okay?

755
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,079
Fine.

756
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:42,320
Let's eat first. I'll heat up the food.

757
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,840
I never thought you still loved me this much.

758
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,159
Isn't it just to keep us old folks from worrying?

759
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,039
Isn't that right?

760
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:21,800
You know how hard it is to find a job now.

761
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:25,079
Plus, our Qiu'er is too picky.

762
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,679
And on top of that, they're about to have a baby.

763
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:29,440
It's so hard.

764
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,599
Hello, this is Tong Qiu.

765
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,800
I interviewed with your company.

766
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,599
May I trouble you to ask,

767
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,159
do you have a result yet?

768
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,400
Are you crazy?

769
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,239
What time is it to be asking this?

770
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,639
Don't I need to sleep?

771
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
You don't even understand basic courtesy.

772
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
How could I hire you?

773
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,840
I'm sorry.
