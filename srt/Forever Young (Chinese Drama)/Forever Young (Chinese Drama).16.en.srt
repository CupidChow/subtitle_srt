1
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,959
What's going on with Xiaofeng?

2
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
This person brought a fake bag to return.

3
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,359
No, I... I...

4
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,959
Okay, okay, um, I...

5
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,959
I'll leave the bag here as collateral.

6
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,599
I'll bring you the real bag, okay?

7
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,439
Don't leave yet.

8
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,280
If you... if you don't believe me, then I'll have to...

9
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,400
Otherwise... otherwise I'll call... call the police.

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,719
Let the police... the officers clear my name.

11
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,840
Is that okay with you?

12
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,799
I'll call them myself.

13
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,080
Driver, we're not going to Baofang Hutong anymore.

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
I'll change the address.

15
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,479
Alright, go ahead and change it.

16
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,479
What happened?

17
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,000
Why didn't you look more carefully?

18
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,800
You made Xiaoshi come all this way for nothing.

19
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,479
That fake was made exactly like the real one.

20
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,120
An ordinary person really couldn't tell the difference.

21
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,919
Luckily, the misunderstanding was cleared up.

22
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,919
And the bag was returned.

23
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,080
Have some dumplings.

24
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,759
Go ahead, eat.

25
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,560
Eat more, you must be hungry.

26
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,000
Xiaoshi.

27
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,159
Since you've come back with such difficulty,

28
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,280
stay a few more days before leaving.

29
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,080
I applied for a job rotation.

30
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,439
So I can come back and stay for a while.

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,199
Good.

32
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,560
That's good then.

33
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,719
I tell you, you young people...

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,919
Why are you all so busy?

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,919
Look,

36
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,159
as for me,

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,199
I got you some more traditional medicine.

38
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,479
Tonic medicine. This is tonic medicine.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,199
I originally wanted to mail it to you,

40
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,759
but since you're back now,

41
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,879
it's perfect timing.

42
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,639
You have to remember,

43
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,199
take one dose every morning and evening.

44
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,039
Okay, Mom.

45
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,759
You have to drink it too.

46
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,159
You're the one who needs it most.

47
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,319
What's going on with you two?

48
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,479
It's been so long,

49
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,680
and there's still no news.

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,080
Mom, then I suggest don't give me the medicine.

51
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,639
Just grill me two big kidneys tonight.

52
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,039
What are you talking about?

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,960
Tell Weiguo to do it.

54
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,919
Why call him?

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,199
No, how can you talk like that?

56
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,319
Alright, enough.

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,839
Don't meddle so much in the kids' business.

58
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,639
What's going on with you and Third Brother?

59
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,759
Come on, come on, eat dumplings, eat dumplings.

60
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,759
Eat, eat, eat.

61
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,480
They're delicious.

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,279
Want some vinegar?

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,439
Have some.

64
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,560
Shi, I really envy you.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,839
Ever since I married your Boss,

66
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,120
I've been revolving around Peng Le Xuan every day.

67
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,800
I'm busy to death every day.

68
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,120
And have no time to go out and see the world.

69
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,000
Auntie, please don't say that.

70
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,560
I think Peng Le Xuan is your domain.

71
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
If you weren't here,

72
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,839
could Uncle Wang handle it alone?

73
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,399
He absolutely couldn't.

74
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,240
Exactly.

75
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,560
See, Tongtong knows how to talk.

76
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,279
Shi'er, I've always been too embarrassed to ask you...

77
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,800
But today it's just the three of us.

78
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,240
Do you and Tongqiu plan to have children or not?

79
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,399
You've been married for so many years now.

80
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,720
From my experience,

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,720
if you want them, have them early.

82
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,519
We do want them now.

83
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,879
Really?

84
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,959
Auntie.

85
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,319
Before, I heard you and Uncle Qiu'er were going to be DINKs.

86
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,319
Not having children.

87
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,279
Was it because of Grandpa and Grandma's pressure?

88
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,879
No.

89
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,439
It was because of my father-in-law's illness.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,560
These past two years we've been running to the hospital a lot.

91
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:55,959
You know,

92
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,759
what I encountered most often?

93
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,160
Many elderly people without children accompanying them.

94
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,879
They don't know how to make appointments on their phones.

95
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,759
Don't know how to use the registration machines.

96
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,959
Don't know how to scan codes to get lab reports.

97
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,720
And certainly don't know electronic payment.

98
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,879
We young people find this digitalization very convenient,

99
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,759
but for the elderly, these are all problems.

100
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,399
You're right about that.

101
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,519
Just these newfangled things,

102
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,079
even now I can't figure them out.

103
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,879
Right.

104
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,879
When my father-in-law was hospitalized,

105
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,319
the elderly in the ward,

106
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,079
some had tubes inserted,

107
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,639
some were on ventilators.

108
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,959
They couldn't get out of bed.

109
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,079
Eating, drinking, and relieving themselves all in bed.

110
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,879
Just the incontinence pads had to be changed several times a day.

111
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,839
So I thought,

112
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,839
right now my father-in-law

113
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,759
still has the two of us to care for him.

114
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,199
But in the future, when Tongqiu and I are old,

115
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,199
if we have no children,

116
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,319
what will we do?

117
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,399
So you decided to have children because of this?

118
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,959
It might sound...

119
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,720
pretty selfish.

120
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,759
But this is truly my real thought.

121
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,319
But if a child is born

122
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,439
and knows their parents originally thought this way,

123
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,399
they would surely be very hurt.

124
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,199
If I had a child,

125
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,879
I would definitely love them very much.

126
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,000
That doesn't conflict.

127
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,519
But what if they aren't filial?

128
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,519
You two are getting off track.

129
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,959
Whether they're filial or not is a separate issue.

130
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,199
First, you have to have the child.

131
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,639
Also,

132
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,879
Look at Wang Fei now.

133
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,519
Just this one matter of going to university

134
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,079
has me and your Boss

135
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,519
in a constant uproar all day long.

136
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,079
We still haven't figured it out.

137
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,079
So don't overthink it.

138
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,079
Just get pregnant first.

139
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,920
I even want two.

140
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,519
Twins.

141
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,399
I support that.

142
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:48,959
Here.

143
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,879
Come on, come on.

144
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,079
Come on, come on.

145
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,439
Hope you have twins.

146
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,040
It's definitely possible.

147
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,759
You can do it.

148
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,639
Hearing you say that, I admire Third Brother even more.

149
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,439
Third Brother has strategy and skill.

150
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,839
No wonder they say he's had lots of ideas since he was little.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,279
No wonder he's made it big in the US.

152
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,759
Look at you with those starry eyes.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,120
The more capable someone is, the more trouble they can cause.

154
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,120
He hasn't done anything particularly terrible, has he?

155
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,439
Besides,

156
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,759
When it comes to business,

157
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,039
you have to separate it from personal feelings.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,120
Originally,

159
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,240
I was quite worried about you running Peng Le Xuan together.

160
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,320
But now with Third Brother involved,

161
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,000
I think it's a sure thing!

162
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,000
A sure thing!

163
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,759
This... this is a sure thing?

164
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,679
Sure... sure thing.

165
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,000
Sure, sure, sure.

166
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,519
Sure, sure, sure thing.

167
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,120
That "sure thing" sounds too convincing.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,639
You haven't seen

169
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,240
how much trouble he's caused us.

170
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,240
He drove Boss to that state,

171
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,559
and keeps insisting I quit my job.

172
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,559
Honey,

173
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,519
think about it carefully.

174
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,320
What he says makes some sense.

175
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,000
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

176
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,879
If you try to ride two horses at once,

177
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,440
you'll fall sooner or later.

178
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,799
Third Brother is so capable.

179
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,519
You have a chance to start a business with him now.

180
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,159
It might suit you better than the bank in the long run.

181
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,840
At least you won't earn less money.

182
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,879
What do you say we give it a try?

183
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,200
Listen to Third Brother.

184
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,879
Stop, just stop.

185
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,120
You can't just quit a job on a whim.

186
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,080
And whether I'll work with him

187
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,879
is still up in the air.

188
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,799
Don't be so emotional.

189
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,759
I think Third Brother's

190
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
approach to handling things is quite right.

191
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,600
His approach is right,

192
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
but he can't be heartless either.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,519
Asking you to think about the future is heartless?

194
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,519
Are you taking his side now?

195
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,720
Whose side are you on, anyway?

196
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm your husband!

197
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,360
And now it's all money, money, money every day.

198
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Is there nothing else in our lives

199
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,759
besides money?

200
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,000
Mom, wife,

201
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,360
I have some great news to announce.

202
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,000
We have a house!

203
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
A big house!

204
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,000
A villa, actually!

205
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,639
A villa!

206
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,679
If I had accepted Weiguo's villa back then,

207
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,799
would things be different?

208
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,759
Qiu'er, Qiu'er.

209
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,960
What's wrong?

210
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,600
You look all wilted.

211
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,120
Like you've lost your soul.

212
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,240
It's nothing, nothing.

213
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
Nothing? That can't be right.

214
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,600
Nothing, really, it's nothing.

215
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,360
If it's nothing, why are you sweating so much? What's going on?

216
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
Re-really, it's nothing.

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,759
There's definitely something.

218
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,360
Nothing.

219
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,600
There really is something.

220
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,360
There is something. You...

221
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,240
Let's talk at home.

222
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,879
Let's talk when we get home.

223
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,360
Alright, alright.

224
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,840
This is no place to talk.

225
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,759
Talk at home, talk at home.

226
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,240
Let's go.

227
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,000
I've already found that chef.

228
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,600
It's still that Chef Sun.

229
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,159
He agreed to sign the contract soon.

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,240
I also had him sign up for

231
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,600
this year's Duck King Competition.

232
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,279
No need to be in such a hurry, right?

233
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,679
Let's wait for Boss a bit longer.

234
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,679
Time waits for no one.

235
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,320
Registration closes in less than a week.

236
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,159
But if the roast duck

237
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,960
isn't made by Boss himself,

238
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,080
then for Peng Le Xuan,

239
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,320
it holds no meaning at all.

240
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120
Let me be honest with you.

241
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,559
The money I secured comes with conditions.

242
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,679
Within six months,

243
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,679
Peng Le Xuan must be

244
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,679
pushed into the top ten on all major platforms.

245
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,960
The only chance

246
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,840
is to win this year's Duck King Competition.

247
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,440
That's why I'm set on Chef Sun.

248
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,240
He was the runner-up last time.

249
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,799
The last champion, due to his age,

250
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,600
has announced he won't compete anymore.

251
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,080
So for this championship,

252
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,559
Chef Sun has a very high probability.

253
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,799
With Boss in his current state,

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,240
what else can I do?

255
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,480
What if Chef Sun doesn't win the championship?

256
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,960
He must win.

257
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,320
I have no other way out.

258
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,440
You mustn't tell Boss and Qiu'er about this.

259
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,559
They can't handle the pressure.

260
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,919
Especially with Boss like he is now.

261
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
If we put more pressure on him,

262
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,559
he simply won't be able to take it.

263
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Having Chef Sun step in to replace him now

264
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,080
might actually be a good thing.

265
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,240
Getting Boss back on his feet

266
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,440
isn't just for Peng Le Xuan's sake.

267
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,080
It's even more for his own sake.

268
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,159
If he can't pull himself together,

269
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,320
what will he do with the rest of his life?

270
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,440
I can't worry about that much anymore.

271
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,559
We'll deal with the future later.

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,759
Boss.

273
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,960
Weiguo and I have discussed it.

274
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,759
We still need to hire a chef.

275
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,240
So we won't trouble you anymore.

276
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,960
It's still that Sun guy, isn't it?

277
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,000
Chunsheng.

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,879
Boss.

279
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm doing this for Peng Le Xuan's good too.

280
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,840
And that Chef Sun

281
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
can also help Peng Le Xuan take a big step forward.

282
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,120
Just trust me this once.

283
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,279
Um,

284
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,399
Peng Le Xuan's renovation officially starts tomorrow.

285
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,519
Before work begins, there's a Signboard Removal Ceremony.

286
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,240
You and Sister-in-law must come.

287
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,120
Well, if there's nothing else, I'll head off now.

288
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,480
That's fine. Go ahead.

289
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,360
You'll have one less worry from now on.

290
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,080
Your roast duck restaurant, with Peng Le Xuan's backing,

291
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,120
is sure to break out and become a hit.

292
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,039
This is all thanks to you.

293
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,879
For making Peng Le Xuan split from within.

294
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,120
That's a ruthless move.

295
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,480
You know,

296
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,960
people used to say my methods

297
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,639
were ruthless enough.

298
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,840
But compared to you,

299
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,399
I really feel I fall short.

300
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,200
Good thing we're just business partners.

301
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,960
If you were my opponent,

302
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,639
I'd really be in for a world of hurt.

303
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,279
Weiguo.

304
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,639
Aren't you worried

305
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,519
Lianbao will have a complete falling out with you?

306
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,559
And what about you?

307
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,080
Me?

308
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,080
Li Lianbao,

309
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,159
he always likes to take shortcuts.

310
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,399
Sooner or later,

311
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,200
he'll pay the price and learn his lesson.

312
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,639
The ancient Greek philosopher Thales said,

313
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,559
"The easiest thing in the world

314
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,159
is to give advice to others.

315
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,840
And the most difficult thing

316
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,080
is to know oneself."

317
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,799
They all hit the mark.

318
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,000
No matter who it is,

319
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,799
there's always a weakness to exploit.

320
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,039
Everything went smoothly.

321
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,000
The interior needs a major renovation.

322
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,640
We'll reopen after the renovation is complete.

323
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,720
He's here, he's here!

324
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,319
Chunsheng is here!

325
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,160
Here he comes!

326
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,839
Alright then,

327
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,559
everyone's here.

328
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,720
Let our ceremony officially begin.

329
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:26,680
Boss.

330
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,200
This Peng Le Xuan signboard,

331
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,559
should be taken down by you personally.

332
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,680
That really amps up the ceremonial feel.

333
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,359
Right.

334
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,559
Come on.

335
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,960
Be careful.

336
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,960
Take it slow.

337
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,079
Slowly, slowly.

338
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,160
Chunsheng, take it easy.

339
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,119
Be really careful.

340
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,599
Give him a hand. Catch it.

341
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,640
Lend a hand and catch it.

342
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,799
Grab it, grab it.

343
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,599
Easy now.

344
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,559
Slow down, slow down.

345
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,640
This, this signboard has seen many years.

346
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,440
Boss.

347
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,359
We'll have someone send this signboard to your home later.

348
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,720
Later, when Peng Le Xuan's renovation is done

349
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,880
and it's time to reopen,

350
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
you'll still be the one to hang it back up.

351
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:02,160
So, everyone's here today.

352
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,440
I have an announcement to make.

353
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,160
Starting today,

354
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,880
my boss, due to personal reasons,

355
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,359
will step back to a secondary role.

356
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,240
He will no longer cook roast duck.

357
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,640
Wait, personal reasons?

358
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,319
What kind of personal reasons?

359
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,319
So does that mean we won't get to eat

360
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,359
Chunsheng's roast duck anymore?

361
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,000
Exactly!

362
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,160
If Chunsheng isn't making roast duck,

363
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,480
can your place even still be called Peng Le Xuan?

364
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,079
Don't worry, everyone.

365
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,359
Although my boss won't be cooking roast duck,

366
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,160
Peng Le Xuan has hired a new head chef.

367
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,079
His skills are absolutely top-notch.

368
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,119
You'll all be very satisfied.

369
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,200
So who is this master chef?

370
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,359
Next, let's welcome Peng Le Xuan's head chef

371
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,640
to make his grand entrance!

372
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,599
Esteemed old neighbors,

373
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,640
my surname is Sun.

374
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,119
You can call me Chef Sun.

375
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,640
I am the fifth-generation successor of Southern City Sun's Roast Duck.

376
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,720
I was also last year's

377
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,079
runner-up in the Beijing Duck King Competition.

378
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,319
From today onward,

379
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,680
I will be the head chef at Peng Le Xuan.

380
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,319
I welcome all our old neighbors

381
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,160
to patronize us often and offer your feedback.

382
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,319
Please do patronize us, please do.

383
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,480
Alright, next up is the tasting session.

384
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,960
Then we can all sample Chef Sun's skills.

385
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,119
We have to try it, right?

386
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,839
See how it compares to our Chunsheng's.

387
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,359
You're right. Let's taste it.

388
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,319
Come on, come on.

389
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,359
Everyone, have a taste.

390
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,720
Where are you going?

391
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,720
No, you all eat, you eat.

392
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,599
You all go ahead and eat.

393
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,480
Come on, make some room for me.

394
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,240
Come on, come on.

395
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,839
Everyone, eat and drink up!

396
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,839
The duck will be up in a moment.

397
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,039
Good.

398
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,319
Chunsheng, why aren't you sitting at that table?

399
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,599
What's with you coming over to our table?

400
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,880
I just like being with everyone, is that not allowed?

401
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,319
Right, right.

402
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,319
Fine, if you're happy, we're even happier, right?

403
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,240
You eat, you eat, you eat.

404
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,119
Pick up your chopsticks and eat.

405
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:02,359
What chopsticks? There are no chopsticks.

406
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,599
I'll get them for you.

407
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,839
Today, my stomach isn't feeling too good.

408
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,559
You all eat, don't let me bother you.

409
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:07,920
Don't be like that.

410
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
No, you should all eat.

411
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,079
Come on, come on.

412
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:10,880
Don't worry about me.

413
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,400
Come on, we have to toast at least one.

414
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,079
Congratulations to Peng Le Xuan.

415
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,720
For finding such a great chef.

416
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

417
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,240
Thank you, thank you.

418
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,319
Thanks, thank you, thank you.

419
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,559
Come on, come on.

420
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,480
The duck is here!

421
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:24,559
Duck.

422
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,200
This big duck.

423
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,279
Plenty fat.

424
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,039
Look at how well it's roasted.

425
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,599
The color looks good.

426
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,400
Of course.

427
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,160
Crispy outside, tender inside, right?

428
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,079
Look at that color.

429
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,079
With one cut.

430
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,880
Every slice has both fat and lean meat.

431
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,240
Look.

432
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,880
Look at how he holds the knife.

433
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Is that even a knife?

434
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,720
It's like a calligraphy brush, like painting.

435
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,640
With one stroke, the meat is 'painted' off.

436
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,240
A whole plate is done.

437
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,079
Crispy outside, tender inside.

438
00:21:59,079 --> 00:21:59,880
Look at this knife work.

439
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
The knife work is excellent.

440
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,119
Yes.

441
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:01,839
Roasted perfectly.

442
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,359
Good.

443
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,599
That's why Peng Le Xuan hired him.

444
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,359
Right.

445
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,079
Good.

446
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,920
Every slice has both fat and lean.

447
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,000
Absolutely.

448
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,400
Good.

449
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,200
Every cut has meat and skin.

450
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,400
I'll have a slice first.

451
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,359
Quick, quick, here, here.

452
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,240
Put it here, here, here.

453
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,599
Okay, okay, okay.

454
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,880
These pancakes are still warm.

455
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,200
I've got to have a slice.

456
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,279
Chef Sun.

457
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,720
Tastes great, great.

458
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,440
Authentic.

459
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,079
Not bad, not bad.

460
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:56,880
How is it?

461
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,720
Not bad.

462
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,720
Compared to Chunsheng's skills back in the day.

463
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,839
They're on par.

464
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,400
Both are great, authentic.

465
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,599
No wonder he's a chef who won second place.

466
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,880
The flavor is just different.

467
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,799
Let me announce one more thing to everyone.

468
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,079
Chef Sun.

469
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,880
Will also represent our Peng Le Xuan.

470
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,079
In the annual Duck King Competition.

471
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,079
Great!

472
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,799
Good!

473
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,920
With skills like his.

474
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,640
He's sure to bring back a big trophy.

475
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,200
Didn't he get second place last year?

476
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,640
So this year, when he goes.

477
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,319
He's got to bring back the championship, right?

478
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,839
Exactly, the championship.

479
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,599
If he wins the championship.

480
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,880
Then our Peng Le Xuan will be famous!

481
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,559
Bring out our registration form too.

482
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,359
Let everyone cheer for our Peng Le Xuan.

483
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,160
Here.

484
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,480
Everyone, take a look.

485
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,839
The registration form.

486
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,319
Lianbao, hold on a second.

487
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Everything else is correct.

488
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,839
But this 'entering unit' field.

489
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,599
Why doesn't it say Peng Le Xuan?

490
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,240
What's going on?

491
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,880
The entering unit is written as.

492
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,680
Some 'Spring River' roast duck restaurant.

493
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,839
Not Peng Le Xuan.

494
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,799
What's the meaning of this?

495
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,240
Chef Sun, what's the meaning of this?

496
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,119
Why is the entering unit Spring River Roast Duck Restaurant?

497
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,880
Isn't that Dong Qian's restaurant?

498
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,880
What's wrong, Chunsheng?

499
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,640
Chunsheng, Chunsheng.

500
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,319
What's going on?

501
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,359
What's happening?

502
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,079
Chunsheng, what's wrong?

503
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,160
Are you really not feeling well?

504
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,599
Did you eat something or...?

505
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,400
Chunsheng.

506
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,359
Come outside with me.

507
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,079
Have some water to calm down.

508
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,240
He's really not well.

509
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,400
I thought he was just sulking.

510
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,079
How about this.

511
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,559
You, take him home.

512
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,599
Let him rest for a couple of days.

513
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,119
No, it's just that I...

514
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,240
The smell of duck makes me sick.

515
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,400
This... just rest for a couple of days.

516
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,599
He's tired.

517
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,079
Sorry about this, sorry.

518
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,079
For disrupting everyone.

519
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,000
Are you okay? Rest a bit.

520
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,559
I'm fine, fine, fine, don't worry.

521
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,319
Take it easy.

522
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,000
You all eat, you all go ahead and eat.

523
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,440
Look at this mess.

524
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,920
Chef Sun

525
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,279
What do you mean?

526
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,160
You promised clearly.

527
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,720
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

528
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
We haven't even signed a contract yet.

529
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,720
What kind of timing is this?

530
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,839
You backing out now...

531
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,599
Where am I supposed to find another chef?

532
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,480
This is out of my hands now.

533
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:24,559
Boss Li.

534
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,720
You're in business.

535
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,759
How can you have no sense of risk?

536
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,759
Did you and Dong Qian...

537
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,240
plan this together to screw me over?

538
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,240
I really don't know what you're talking about.

539
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,720
I have other matters to attend to.

540
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,079
I'll take my leave.

541
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,720
Dong Qian...

542
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,240
What a malicious scheme.

543
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,480
Where's Boss?

544
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,200
Let me tell you,

545
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm really done for.

546
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,480
No, wait.

547
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,279
No, what's this first one?

548
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,359
Shredded potatoes.

549
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,519
No, shredded potatoes are fine.

550
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,160
Try it.

551
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,000
Just give it a try.

552
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,440
Try it.

553
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:25,839
Right?

554
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,359
Try it.

555
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,200
No, look at me.

556
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:28,960
I said I'm fine.

557
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,200
Shredded potatoes, right?

558
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,400
What's this?

559
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,240
Mustard duck feet.

560
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,720
I'm telling you, the mustard flavor is really strong.

561
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,440
It completely masks the duck taste.

562
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,160
You try it.

563
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,680
Here.

564
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Put it there, let your dad try it.

565
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
No, take it away, take it away!

566
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
Hurry, take it away! The smell...

567
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,240
This... this has a smell too?

568
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,920
Then I'll take it to the kitchen.

569
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,240
What's this third one?

570
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,400
Duck head.

571
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,440
Duck head.

572
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,000
Take it away! Take it away!

573
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,799
Nauseous.

574
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:12,200
See?

575
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,759
Alright, alright, take it away.

576
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,039
I get it now.

577
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,200
Anything related to duck...

578
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,519
makes you nauseous.

579
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,960
Dad, you're basically useless now.

580
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,200
Don't talk nonsense.

581
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,880
Um, Boss...

582
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,720
Do you think you could try to endure it a bit more?

583
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,519
Overcome it.

584
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,480
Overcome my foot! How can I overcome it?

585
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,440
Right now,

586
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,440
I can't even think about this stuff, okay?

587
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,680
This is a psychological issue you have.

588
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,960
You really need to overcome it.

589
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Overcome my foot!

590
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,519
Didn't I just say?

591
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,920
Don't worry about me.

592
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,279
You should go review your lessons.

593
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,960
Boss, calm down a bit.

594
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,000
Look, Peng Le Xuan is in a crisis right now.

595
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,440
That guy Sun stood us up.

596
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,160
If we want to find another chef...

597
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,599
there's not enough time.

598
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,480
We still have to rely on you for the competition.

599
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,240
Me? What about me?

600
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,519
I can't do anything.

601
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,440
Don't tell me to do this today...

602
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,759
and that tomorrow.

603
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,839
From now on, I won't be involved in your affairs.

604
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,519
Do whatever you want.

605
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,200
Don't be like that.

606
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,920
Chunsheng, you...

607
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,720
Boss...

608
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,279
You can't be like this.

609
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
What did I do?

610
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,200
You're the one who said...

611
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,920
"Boss, stop practicing roast duck."

612
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,759
Now you're telling Boss to practice roast duck again.

613
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:30,759
You...

614
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,960
Use someone when you need them, discard them when you don't.

615
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,519
What kind of person do you take Boss for?

616
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,160
Isn't this for the good of Peng Le Xuan?

617
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,920
Yes.

618
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,599
You don't worry about anything.

619
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,920
You only know how to be a nice guy.

620
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,559
So when problems arise, don't I have to solve them?

621
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,160
So now I'm the useless one again?

622
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,480
Solve it? You solved it...

623
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,440
You solved it really well.

624
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,480
Really, exceptionally well.

625
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,240
You solved it so well Boss can't even touch a duck now.

626
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,680
Bravo. Just great.

627
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,559
Are you crazy?

628
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,160
There's nothing wrong with you.

629
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,079
Relax, there are no problems at all.

630
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,920
And your health is improving.

631
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,880
I came to have my tongue checked.

632
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,000
This should just be a stress response.

633
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,559
Have you suffered some kind of shock?

634
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,559
Or some psychological trauma?

635
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,759
I can't see any problems either.

636
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,799
Your heart blood is a bit deficient.

637
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,440
Stick out your tongue, let me see.

638
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,960
Right, I think it's mainly my tongue.

639
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,839
There's no problem.

640
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,680
Pay more attention to your diet.

641
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,599
Drink less alcohol.

642
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,319
Exercise more when you can.

643
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,799
At your age,

644
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,480
you're not like a young person anymore.

645
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,960
You went to see the doctor and get medicine...

646
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,240
and you didn't even let me go with you.

647
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,200
I was afraid you'd worry along with me.

648
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,440
Did the doctor say...

649
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,680
if there are side effects from taking anti-nausea medicine all the time?

650
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,279
The doctor said it's fine.

651
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,720
Twenty minutes.

652
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,200
Take it out.

653
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,720
Okay.

654
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,000
No.

655
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,039
No, no, take them all back, take them back.

656
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,200
This still isn't okay?

657
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,480
This smell, this...

658
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,240
Dad, you can't even smell the duck?

659
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,279
How about this? Can you look at it?

660
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,160
What is it?

661
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,920
Take it away, take it away now, I'm telling you.

662
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,160
Jing'er, listen to me.

663
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,920
Later, at home,

664
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,240
anything related to this stuff,

665
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,759
put it all away for me.

666
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,039
Don't let me see it.

667
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,079
No, you can't even look at it now?

668
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,440
Then you definitely need to see a psychologist.

669
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:18,599
See a psychologist for what?

670
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,240
There's nothing wrong with my mind.

671
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,680
Your son is asking you to go.

672
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,319
Just go and see one.

673
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,519
You should go.

674
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,960
No.

675
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,200
I've just been busy with my own stuff.

676
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,920
How about you? How are your studies?

677
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,680
I'm doing alright.

678
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,480
You don't need to worry.

679
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,000
You just focus on

680
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,960
how to get over this mental hurdle of yours.

681
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,000
No, don't worry about it, you go study.

682
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:49,599
No, it's not okay.

683
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,680
There are so many things to eat in this world.

684
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,839
I just won't touch that thing.

685
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:59,440
Turn on our range hood.

686
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,279
Why do I still smell it now?

687
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,680
Alright.

688
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:19,920
Sister-in-law.

689
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:20,920
Thank you.

690
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,440
Thank you.

691
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,000
Where's mine?

692
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,839
Buy your own.

693
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,680
Seeing your Boss like this now,

694
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,519
makes me feel really awful.

695
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,680
Sister-in-law.

696
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,920
You just stay home and take good care of Boss.

697
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
Don't let any other health issues come up.

698
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,519
Leave the competition to me.

699
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,920
Even if I have to risk my life,

700
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,319
I'll find a good chef.

701
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,559
and bring back the championship for this Duck King Competition.

702
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,160
I think

703
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,519
the one we can most count on now is still Boss.

704
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,039
We must do everything we can to help him recover his skills.

705
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,160
I think so too.

706
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,400
I think no matter what,

707
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:55,960
even if we have to force him,

708
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,920
we have to force Dad to make roast duck again.

709
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,960
I say, Feifei,

710
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,079
is that any way to treat your own father?

711
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,720
Peng Le Xuan's century-old craft,

712
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,839
if it really ends like this,

713
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,279
it would truly be a shame.

714
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,720
I also want Boss's skills

715
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,839
to recover quickly.

716
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:10,720
But for this competition,

717
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,000
it's definitely too late.

718
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,759
Registration closes in four days.

719
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,319
With Boss in his current state,

720
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,920
he can't even touch a duck.

721
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,680
If he wants to recover his skills,

722
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,440
it'll take at least three to five months, no less.

723
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:23,559
Sister-in-law.

724
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:24,920
What's your take?

725
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,839
I... I certainly don't want

726
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,720
you all to leave your Boss behind.

727
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,680
But I am truly worried

728
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,440
he'll hold everyone back.

729
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
Here's what I think.

730
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:39,720
Those who believe in Boss, come with me

731
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,759
to persuade him.

732
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,599
As for the others,

733
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,160
if they want to find another chef, go ahead.

734
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,359
I say, Ma Weiguo,

735
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,079
I just started liking you a couple of days ago,

736
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,599
and you're starting to cause trouble again, huh?

737
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,480
So it's me who doesn't believe in Boss?

738
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,920
I'm the one creating conflict?

739
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
I only said you *could* find another chef.

740
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,200
*You're* the one talking about damaging unity.

741
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,240
Alright.

742
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,720
You two, stop picking at such childish wording.

743
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,160
You're acting like kids.

744
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,240
Let's split up and act, a double insurance.

745
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,720
Isn't it all for Peng Le Xuan?

746
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,000
See how well Tongtong speaks?

747
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,199
Learn a thing or two.

748
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,000
You two are a perfect match.

749
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,559
Tongtong really knows how to talk.

750
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,320
Who are you talking about?

751
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,280
You two.

752
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,599
That shop nearby,

753
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,440
the one that was open for many years,

754
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,679
the one that sold roast duck,

755
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,440
just up and closed.

756
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,679
Didn't they say it was being renovated?

757
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,840
Don't listen to that.

758
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,199
Just you wait.

759
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,599
If it reopens,

760
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,119
it definitely won't be the same as before.

761
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,840
I know that shop.

762
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,519
It was open for over a hundred years.

763
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,400
What a pity.

764
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,960
All these good old Beijing things,

765
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,800
are slowly disappearing.

766
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,960
The things our ancestors left behind,

767
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,039
are all being lost now.

768
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,800
You know,

769
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,320
this...

770
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,800
Finally willing to see me.

771
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,760
Had to wait for you to calm down.

772
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,840
So you wouldn't have a foul mouth again.

773
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,920
My fault, my fault.

774
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,400
I lost my composure.

775
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,639
Let me punish myself with a drink first.

776
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,760
But I have to say,

777
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,840
you played a darn good hand.

778
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,840
It's my own fault for not mastering the craft.

779
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,400
I lost the bet, I accept the loss.

780
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,199
This time, I admit defeat.

781
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,360
Li Lianbao.

782
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,239
You have no way out now.

783
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,239
Not necessarily.

784
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,960
Now, there are only

785
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,320
four days left until the registration deadline.

786
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,280
You want to find a capable chef now?

787
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,440
It's definitely too late.

788
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,280
If you miss this Duck King Competition,

789
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,719
you'll miss the biggest wave of traffic.

790
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:25,719
All your original plans will be delayed.

791
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
One wrong step leads to another.

792
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
Including

793
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,039
Kevin's demands on you. You can't meet them now.

794
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,360
So I advise you

795
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,960
to face reality.

796
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,119
Ridiculous.

797
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,800
There's still time

798
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,119
before Kevin's deadline.

799
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,320
Who knows what will happen

800
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,880
during that time?

801
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,920
Me, personally,

802
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,280
I never worry about things that haven't happened yet.

803
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,960
Anyway, my offer still stands.

804
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,400
I'll give you the best terms,

805
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,119
as long as you hand over Peng Le Xuan to me.

806
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,840
As for Kevin,

807
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,039
I'll talk to him myself.

808
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,000
I believe as long as it's a profitable business,

809
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,440
he won't disagree.

810
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,119
No way.

811
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:07,920
Let me tell you again,

812
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:08,960
it's not happening.

813
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,519
I just don't get it.

814
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
Why insist on pushing until

815
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,559
you're battered and bruised?

816
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,920
The price won't be the same then.

817
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,440
You're thinking quite thoroughly for me.

818
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,000
Not just for you,

819
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,639
but also for Boss and Qiu'er.

820
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,880
Whether you're sincere or not,

821
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,400
I thank you.

822
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:35,920
I'll take the heat from Boss and Qiu'er.

823
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,320
And I'll carry my own burden too.

824
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:45,280
Alright, no more work talk today.

825
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,920
Since Director Dong is treating us so generously today,

826
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,440
I won't hold back.

827
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,960
Please, don't be polite. Enjoy.

828
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,320
Your duck here is actually pretty good.

829
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,440
Your mouth isn't bad either.

830
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,559
That jerk.

831
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,880
He even blocked me.

832
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,480
Boss won't see me now.

833
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,519
So I need you two to step in.

834
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:42,960
This...

835
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,239
might boost his sense of honor.

836
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,519
Roast Duck King.

837
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:52,480
Beijing's 8th Folk Roast Duck King Culinary Competition.

838
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Duck King Showdown. Welcome to the challenge.

839
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,519
Okay, I get it.

840
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:58,079
Anyway, when I go back, I need to make him realize

841
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,320
that winning this Roast Duck King title

842
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,679
is a matter of great prestige.

843
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,480
Exactly.

844
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,239
Alright.

845
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,280
I think we could ask Grandpa Tong to help.

846
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,960
Uncle Wang respects Grandpa Tong a lot.

847
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,159
Maybe Grandpa Tong's words will work.

848
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,159
That's also a way.

849
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,559
But...

850
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,280
This might also help.

851
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:19,280
This... my dad lost this!

852
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,559
How did you get it?

853
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,800
Why so many questions?

854
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,639
Some people

855
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,320
really say one thing,

856
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,840
but do another.

857
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,679
Alright.

858
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,199
Now that everyone knows,

859
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,920
let's get moving.

860
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,280
Roger that.

861
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,159
What's wrong?

862
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:03,840
Sorry, sorry.

863
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,079
Sorry, sorry.

864
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:05,639
What are you doing?

865
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:06,280
Sorry, sir.

866
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,920
I just want to talk to Sun Yanhui for a minute.

867
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,079
I won't do anything else.

868
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,039
Sorry, sir.

869
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,800
Kitchen area. No unauthorized personnel.

870
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,440
Our kitchen is not open to the public.

871
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,840
Fine, fine. Then how about this:

872
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,960
you call him out here,

873
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
and I'll talk to him outside.

874
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,079
He's not here.

875
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:19,559
Who are you kidding?

876
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:20,719
Sir, if you're here to eat,

877
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,559
I'll find you a seat.

878
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,480
But please don't disturb

879
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,960
our many other guests, okay?

880
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,119
Dong Qian taught you this, right?

881
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,400
Fine.

882
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,599
Sorry, sorry.

883
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,559
Sorry, everyone.

884
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,400
Uncle Wang, look.

885
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,960
How spirited you were back then.

886
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,519
"In the future,

887
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,639
I will definitely be

888
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,320
the best roast duck chef in all of Beijing."
