Congratulations as well.

15
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,639
Now, next up,

16
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,800
we will take a short break

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,680
before entering the second round's comprehensive roast duck skills competition.

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,039
Let's wait and see.

19
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,479
Are you thirsty?

20
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,439
Here, have some water.

21
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,319
Where's the water?

22
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,120
I... I didn't bring it.

23
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,520
Why didn't you bring it?

24
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Go out and buy some.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,520
I have some.

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,120
You silly kid.

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,360
Chef Sun, how are you feeling?

28
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,439
After the first round,

29
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,879
I feel my condition is just right.

30
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,199
I'm even more confident in my skills now.

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,280
That's excellent.

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,199
President Dong,

33
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,919
in this competition,

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
if Chef Sun gets eliminated,

35
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,800
he's a proud man.

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,400
You shouldn't get too angry either.

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Watch your words.

38
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,400
I think you should go check on your big brother instead.

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,280
Don't play mind games with me here.

40
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,599
That's right, Manager Li.

41
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,280
You've got it backwards.

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,080
You're talking about Master Wang, right?

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,800
My big brother is just warming up now.

44
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,199
He'll turn up the heat for you all later.

45
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,000
Chef Sun,

46
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,199
you don't seem to be in good form today.

47
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,319
You're starting to break out in a cold sweat.

48
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,919
You're absolutely right.

49
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,439
As long as my hands don't falter, it's fine.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,840
Indeed, indeed.

51
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,120
I mean well, you know.

52
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,199
No other intentions.

53
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,439
Alright, you two chat.

54
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,840
Chef Sun,

55
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,479
don't let him get to you.

56
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,599
He's been full of mischief since he was a kid.

57
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,400
President Dong,

58
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,599
with me here, you can rest assured.

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,240
Alright, let's go.

60
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,319
Do you think big brother can make it to the finals?

61
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,319
Stay calm.

62
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,599
Is this okay?

63
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,319
He should at least make the finals, right?

64
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,080
Don't worry.

65
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,879
Based on the comprehensive scores from two rounds,

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,479
the three contestants entering tomorrow's

67
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,639
All-Duck Feast ultimate showdown are:

68
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,120
First place, Chef Sun from Spring River Warms.

69
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,839
Congratulations.

70
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,759
Well done.

71
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Second place,

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,079
from Duck Workshop,

73
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,399
the renowned roast duck chef,

74
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,120
Chef Cao.

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,839
Congratulations.

76
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,839
The final contestant entering tomorrow's finals

77
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,959
is, who could it be?

78
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,120
He is none other than

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,639
Master Wang from Peng Le Xuan.

80
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,639
Congratulations to you.

81
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,120
Dad, go for it!

82
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,519
Come on, brothers, everyone put these on.

83
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,120
Put them on.

84
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,959
Big brother,

85
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,120
you've got the aura of the "Guardian of Baofang" from back in the day.

86
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,560
That's what you said.

87
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,959
Big brother, you mustn't feel any pressure.

88
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,120
Aren't you the one putting pressure on me?

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
The Roast Duck King title is in the bag.

90
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,680
Big brother, congratulations!

91
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,959
You made it to the finals.

92
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,240
Just perform as you normally do.

93
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:11,800
Alright.

94
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,680
See you tomorrow then.

95
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,360
See you tomorrow.

96
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,399
See you tomorrow.

97
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,680
See you tomorrow, sis-in-law.

98
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,240
Jing'er, these are all snacks to go with drinks.

99
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
We should make a couple of meat dishes.

100
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,399
The spare ribs are stewing in the pot.

101
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,040
Second Brother, Qiu'er, we're happy today.

102
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,360
You two should have a few extra drinks.

103
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,639
Hey, what about me?

104
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,639
You can't drink.

105
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,079
Sis, I'm driving today.

106
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,079
I really can't drink.

107
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,600
Let Qiu'er have a drink with Big Brother.

108
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,639
No, I'll have a drink with Qiu'er.

109
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,199
Exactly, exactly, let's be happy.

110
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,920
You still can't drink.

111
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,759
Look at you.

112
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,920
Qiu'er, you drink up.

113
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,199
Got it.

114
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,879
Then get some water for me and your Second Uncle.

115
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,360
Okay.

116
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,639
So I'm drinking alone and getting tipsy.

117
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,199
Doesn't that seem a bit lonely and cold?

118
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,079
Let me tell you.

119
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,759
This liquor is really good.

120
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,600
Really?

121
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,319
Here.

122
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,759
Don't tell your mom.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,600
Here.

124
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,079
The soup's ready!

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,079
Come on, come on.

126
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's start eating!

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Then let me propose the first toast.

128
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,800
We're really happy today.

129
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,199
Happy, happy, happy! Come on, come on.

130
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,079
Come on, come on.

131
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,319
Husband, you worked hard.

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,920
Big Brother really showed

133
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,360
the momentum of the "Guardian of Baofang" today.

134
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,199
Of course.

135
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,319
Here.

136
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,079
Come on, eat, eat, eat the dishes.

137
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,920
Dad, weren't you nervous today?

138
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,800
What nonsense are you talking, kid?

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,920
Would your dad be nervous?

140
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,040
No, no, no.

141
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,319
There are no outsiders here.

142
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,720
I'll speak from the heart.

143
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,480
To give you a thumbs-up,

144
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,600
you were far from me, you know?

145
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,920
Didn't you see my legs were

146
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
shaking like a sieve, you know?

147
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,240
No.

148
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,040
I saw it.

149
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,959
I even filmed it.

150
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,600
But remember this, kid.

151
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,199
No matter what difficulty you face,

152
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,279
this afternoon you felt

153
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
pretty nervous too, right?

154
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
But so what?

155
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,920
Didn't we get through it?

156
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,040
And now we're sitting at the same table drinking, right?

157
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,720
Right.

158
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,600
Nothing is a problem.

159
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
Come on, come on.

160
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,199
Here, here, here.

161
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,040
Qiu'er, you drink more today.

162
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,160
You're the only one drinking.

163
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,399
Then I'll take a big sip, a big sip.

164
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
We two are drinking water.

165
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Let's have one with Qiu'er.

166
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,040
Here.

167
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,759
Burns the throat, burns the throat.

168
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,600
We've already won half the battle today.

169
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Big Brother, just treat tomorrow like going to have fun.

170
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
No matter the result,

171
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,600
we're just aiming for a good time.

172
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,040
No, no, no.

173
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,360
If we want to be happy,

174
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,360
we need a good result.

175
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,279
Don't worry.

176
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,920
Tomorrow, watch Big Brother.

177
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,079
Now that we have this first round today,

178
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,279
the next round,

179
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,839
I'll just treat it as making good food in a different place.

180
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,720
Isn't that all it is?

181
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,240
Yes, exactly.

182
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,680
Here, brothers, well,

183
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,240
you two also worried about Big Brother today.

184
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,120
Not at all.

185
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,040
I toast to you two.

186
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,279
It's what we should do.

187
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:12,959
Should, should do.

188
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,720
You went to a lot of trouble.

189
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,839
Keep drinking.

190
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,720
And wife, here.

191
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,839
You're toasting me too?

192
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,600
You, you also worked hard and achieved a lot today.

193
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Husband worked hard, husband worked hard.

194
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,720
You worked hard, hard, hard today.

195
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,399
Look, my husband is happy today.

196
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,600
Even drinking water tastes like liquor now.

197
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,839
Happy, happy.

198
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,759
Dad.

199
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,399
I also toast to you.

200
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,399
This son is really sensible, I tell you.

201
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,600
Tomorrow, just go for it.

202
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,360
Good.

203
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,039
Good.

204
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,159
This should be no problem.

205
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,519
It can be considered a great success, right?

206
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,360
This is just the beginning.

207
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,279
Tomorrow is the real tough battle.

208
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
Wait a minute.

209
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,960
Weren't you just telling Big Brother

210
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,279
winning or losing wasn't the issue?

211
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,639
Didn't you see?

212
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,279
Big Brother is actually really nervous inside.

213
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,279
Otherwise, why would he keep looking for liquor

214
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,399
and guzzling it down?

215
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,080
That's true.

216
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,720
He finished a cup so quickly.

217
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,320
So what do we do?

218
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,600
You go back first.

219
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,919
I'm going to find Dong Qian.

220
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,720
Why are you looking for Dong Qian now?

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,600
I need to have a word with her.

222
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,480
Doesn't she care about Big Brother's feelings at all?

223
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,399
Then, I'll go with you.

224
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,039
No, no, no.

225
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,720
It's easier if I talk to her myself.

226
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,200
You didn't tell me Big Brother could make it to the finals.

227
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,679
I didn't expect it either.

228
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,440
Wei Guo.

229
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,480
You're not deliberately tricking me, are you?

230
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,559
The more I think about it, the more something feels off.

231
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,799
If you don't trust me enough,

232
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,480
then we have no basis for cooperation.

233
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,919
Think about it carefully.

234
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,519
What good would deceiving you do for me?

235
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,240
You also know the kind of person I am.

236
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,799
Things without benefit,

237
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,039
I won't do.

238
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,360
That's it.

239
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
What are you doing here?

240
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,320
I was about to ask you the same thing.

241
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,240
Get in the car.

242
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,679
We'll talk when we get back.

243
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,639
You'd better explain yourself properly.

244
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,639
You met with Dong Qian privately.

245
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,519
What is the meaning of this?

246
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,519
I don't think I need to explain myself to you.

247
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,600
Not talking, huh?

248
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,519
Fine, I'll go get Big Brother.

249
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,399
You can tell him.

250
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,840
Don't disturb Big Brother.

251
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,600
I went to Dong Qian for a collaboration.

252
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,039
To get her to invest in Peng Le Xuan.

253
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,399
It's hard to guard against a thief in the family.

254
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:24,120
We tried hard to stop Dong Qian from taking Peng Le Xuan.

255
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,840
And you just sold us out like that?

256
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:26,919
No.

257
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,639
The investment I mean isn't what you think.

258
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,440
Go on, keep making things up.

259
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,919
I want her to invest in Peng Le Xuan.

260
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,879
Not so she can buy the brand name.

261
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,519
To package her Spring River Warms.

262
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,519
What I want to do is...

263
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,039
get her to take Spring River Warms...

264
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,399
and merge it into Peng Le Xuan.

265
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,519
Giving all resources to Peng Le Xuan...

266
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,639
for Peng Le Xuan to use.

267
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,759
Are you kidding me?

268
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,159
How could such a good thing happen?

269
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,159
Don't tell me you're serious.

270
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,000
No...

271
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,159
Why would she listen to you?

272
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,399
Wait until Big Brother finishes the competition tomorrow.

273
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,919
We'll see the result then, okay?

274
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,399
You explain this clearly to me.

275
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,879
Why would she listen to you?

276
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,120
Why would she cooperate with you?

277
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,639
Speak up!

278
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,919
The excitement continues. The finals begin!

279
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,879
The three finalists...

280
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,039
have each brought an assistant chef.

281
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,039
Within the allotted time...

282
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,879
they will cook live on site...

283
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,360
designated by the panel of experts...

284
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,519
the roast duck from the All-Duck Feast...

285
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,759
Golden Thread Duck Rolls...

286
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,000
Fire-Singed Duck Hearts, Mustard Duck Webs...

287
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,399
Spicy Braised Duck Liver...

288
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,039
Braised Duck Soup with Taro...

289
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,279
Kung Pao Duck Wings, and other dishes...

290
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,120
to form their respective All-Duck Feast.

291
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,039
Finally, our expert panel of judges...

292
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,080
will give the final scores...

293
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,639
to decide this year's Roast Duck King.

294
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,799
Now I declare...

295
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,039
the finals officially begin!

296
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,200
His performance is quite consistent.

297
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,440
Indeed.

298
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Truly authentic.

299
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,639
Spread it out a bit more.

300
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,840
Cut it more like a fan.

301
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,559
Just focus on your cutting.

302
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,720
Don't be nervous.

303
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,559
The three finalists...

304
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,200
have completed their respective All-Duck Feasts.

305
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,159
Judges, please step forward...

306
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,039
to taste and score.

307
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,919
Please.

308
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,039
Anything is possible.

309
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,799
Now, I will announce...

310
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,559
the final score results.

311
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,039
It also heralds our Roast Duck King champion...

312
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,279
who is about to be revealed.

313
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,279
Chef Sun Yanhui's final score is...

314
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,159
274 points.

315
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,799
Chef Cao Xiao's final score is...

316
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,200
268 points.

317
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,039
Master Wang Chunsheng's final score is...

318
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,440
also 274 points.

319
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,200
Congratulations.

320
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,120
Master Wang and Chef Sun have tied.

321
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,919
Right?

322
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,159
According to our competition rules...

323
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,279
we will enter a tie-breaker round.

324
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,039
Wait a minute.

325
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,000
Chef Sun.

326
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,159
I have a video here.

327
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,919
It has the whole process of my Big Brother cooking.

328
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,440
It can be handed to the organizers for judgment.

329
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,080
Judges...

330
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,200
someone tampered with the brine...

331
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,159
that my Big Brother had prepared.

332
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,679
Fortunately...

333
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,120
I warned my Big Brother's assistant, Xiao Zhang, early on...

334
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,399
to keep a close watch.

335
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,679
I swapped the sauce you added salt to.

336
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,120
What do you mean, added salt?

337
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,039
Don't make false accusations!

338
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,160
The tampering was all recorded.

339
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,799
Chef Sun, do you want to take a look...

340
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,559
to see if it's your apprentice?

341
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,400
This is truly outrageous.

342
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,519
Yeah, what is he doing?

343
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,720
This is just too outrageous.

344
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,200
Come here.

345
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,799
How could you do such a thing?

346
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,319
Who told you to do this?

347
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,000
I did.

348
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,599
I'm sorry, everyone.

349
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,880
This was my idea.

350
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,039
My master didn't know.

351
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,240
Bullshit.

352
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,480
You're not worthy of being my apprentice.

353
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,599
Get out.

354
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,720
Honorable judges,

355
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,119
I apologize.

356
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,880
My subordinate did this.

357
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,440
It's my failure in discipline.

358
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:54,640
Here and now,

359
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,440
I offer my sincere apology to Master Wang.

360
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,799
Enough.

361
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,880
Your word is enough.

362
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,920
Alright.

363
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Then, next,

364
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,559
we proceed to the tiebreaker round.

365
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:12,680
Let's see everyone show their true skills.

366
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:13,440
Fine.

367
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,680
I agree.

368
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,759
So this matter is just over?

369
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,119
There's no evidence to prove

370
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,000
Chef Sun was involved in this.

371
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,799
And it doesn't affect Master Wang's score.

372
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:27,000
Our organizing committee has decided

373
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,240
Please, sit.

374
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,160
Please, sit.

375
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,960
How does it not affect it?

376
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,839
Sit down first.

377
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,200
Second Brother.

378
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,000
Our judging panel's final decision

379
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,200
is that the tiebreaker proceeds as scheduled.

380
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,000
To be the Roast Duck King,

381
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
one must not only know how to make it,

382
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,079
but also how to taste it.

383
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,880
This tests the sensitivity of one's palate

384
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,200
and knowledge of various specialty foods.

385
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,559
Therefore, the organizing committee

386
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,640
has specially selected ten top-tier

387
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,200
roast duck restaurants' ducks.

388
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,359
They are arranged on ten separate plates.

389
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,920
The two contestants

390
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,440
will come forward to taste each one.

391
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,519
You must identify which roast duck restaurant

392
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,559
each duck is from. Write

393
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,160
the name of the restaurant for each duck

394
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,400
on your answer board. Time limit: thirty minutes.

395
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,920
The contestant who correctly identifies

396
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,680
the most restaurants in the shortest time

397
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,160
will win this year's Roast Duck King title.

398
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,000
Using this for the tiebreaker...

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,279
It's his weakest point.

400
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,279
Maybe take some anti-nausea medicine?

401
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,880
Useless. Tried it.

402
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,240
So what?

403
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,720
Master Wang,

404
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,640
you were just lucky before.

405
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:48,759
Now for the tiebreaker, you need real skill.

406
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,160
I heard you've developed a little problem recently.

407
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,319
Good luck to you.

408
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,000
Watch your mouth!

409
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,279
Sun!

410
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,759
You're being a real coward.

411
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,519
Didn't get enough of a beating last time?

412
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,319
You really want a fight, huh?

413
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,039
Second Brother.

414
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,039
Chef Sun, what are you doing?

415
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,880
Big Brother, I'm truly sorry.

416
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,240
I never thought Sun Yanhui

417
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,559
would do such a thing.

418
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,720
President Dong.

419
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,079
Chef Sun.

420
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,559
I want to win,

421
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,680
but not by winning like this.

422
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,279
From this moment on,

423
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,359
you have no further connection to Spring River Warms.

424
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,599
Fine.

425
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,160
Once I win the championship,

426
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,039
everyone will be fighting to hire me.

427
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,720
You'll regret this.

428
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,440
Big Brother.

429
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,039
Then, our Spring River Warms

430
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,559
will withdraw from the competition.

431
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,079
Keep fighting. Good luck.

432
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,759
We're leaving now.

433
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,799
Bye, Sister-in-law.

434
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,240
Sit down and rest for a bit.

435
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,559
I now declare

436
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,519
the tiebreaker round officially begun!

437
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,319
This counts as a forfeit, right?

438
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,759
How are you? Are you okay?

439
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,160
I'm fine.

440
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,319
Let's continue.

441
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,599
I'm sorry.

442
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
This won't do.

443
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,759
Look at Big Brother's condition.

444
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,000
Go check on him properly.

445
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
Go over and see.

446
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,079
Cooking while vomiting like this...

447
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,039
Who would dare eat the duck he makes?

448
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,119
I'll eat it.

449
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,519
Master Wang, don't force yourself.

450
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:57,559
It's alright.

451
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,720
Let's continue.

452
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:31,920
Chunsheng.

453
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,599
Maybe we should just give up.

454
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,319
Big Brother.

455
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,759
Amazing!

456
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,640
He picked it up!

457
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
This is incredible!

458
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,599
Have some candy.

459
00:26:58,839 --> 00:26:59,799
Drink some wine.

460
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,400
Alright!

461
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,240
His eyes are too big. Doesn't look like ours.

462
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,519
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

463
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,000
Don't cry.

464
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,119
Here, here, here.

465
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,160
No more crying, no more, no more.

466
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,359
Such a little rascal.

467
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,039
I have an idea.

468
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,319
Starting tomorrow,

469
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,880
we'll find the twenty most popular,

470
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,640
most distinctive roast duck shops in Beijing online.

471
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,279
Big Brother will go and taste-test them one by one.

472
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,880
After each one, he'll write a tasting review.

473
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,279
Please, take a look, sirs.

474
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,559
This duck emphasizes one horizontal cut,

475
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,200
one vertical cut.

476
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:36,519
My big brother is Beijing's greatest Roast Duck King.

477
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,720
The Guardian of Baofang, the Duck King.

478
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,720
The Guardian of Baofang, the Duck King.

479
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,279
The competition results are out.

480
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:36,359
Chef Sun and Master Wang

481
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:38,599
both completed their tasks

482
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,359
within the allotted time.

483
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,359
We also saw that

484
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,359
Chef Sun

485
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,440
used less time than Master Wang.

486
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,599
Master Wang, within the time limit,

487
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,119
not only answered all questions

488
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,119
but also gave one extra answer.

489
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,640
What exactly happened?

490
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,119
Let the head of our judging panel

491
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,839
reveal the answer for us.

492
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:56,519
Please welcome.

493
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,400
In the final duck meat tasting segment,

494
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,640
the expert panel placed duck meat

495
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,119
from two different roast duck shops in the last plate.

496
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,880
Chef Sun correctly identified one.

497
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:13,359
Master Wang correctly identified both.

498
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,759
I hereby declare

499
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,160
the champion of the Folk Roast Duck King culinary competition

500
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,680
is Wang Chunsheng.

501
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:20,920
Master Wang!

502
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:26,720
The Roast Duck King is back!

503
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,440
Listen to me, everyone.

504
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,359
Big brother, come on.

505
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:30,920
Okay.

506
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,000
Three, two, one, go!

507
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,160
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

508
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,839
Toss him! Toss him! Toss him!

509
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,920
Thank you, thank you.

510
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,920
Chunsheng.

511
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,839
Darn it, it's a good thing you won the Roast Duck King title.

512
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,680
Otherwise, all the preparations Lian Bao and I made would've been for nothing.

513
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,920
Isn't that the truth!

514
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,599
Thank you, Lian Bao.

515
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,599
What did I say all along?

516
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,000
I always said Chunsheng could do it.

517
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,400
And you all didn't believe me.

518
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:52,920
He's amazing!

519
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,839
Thank you, thank you.

520
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:54,279
So, what's up?

521
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,920
We have to record this wonderful moment.

522
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,400
Right, right, right.

523
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,599
Come on, let's take a few snaps.

524
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:58,519
Let's get some group photos.

525
00:33:58,519 --> 00:33:59,839
Come on, come on.

526
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:02,240
Tall people stand in the back.

527
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,440
Come on, come on.

528
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,519
Quick, quick, everyone together.

529
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:05,839
Kids, come here.

530
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,039
Hurry up, hurry up.

531
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,360
Stand in the middle.

532
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,840
Tall ones stand in the back.

533
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,760
Everyone's here, everyone.

534
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,599
Okay, on three, two, one... Roast Duck King!

535
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,039
Three, two, one... Roast Duck King!

536
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,239
What's wrong?

537
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,599
I'm just a little happy.

538
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,519
I know you're feeling proud right now.

539
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,159
Uncle Wang winning the Roast Duck King this time,

540
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,320
you deserve a lot of the credit.

541
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,840
So,

542
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,400
strike while the iron is hot.

543
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,320
You posted my medical record number online.

544
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,079
My address and ID number,

545
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,159
why didn't you post those too?

546
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,599
Don't worry.

547
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,079
I blurred out everything I needed to.

548
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,480
No one knows whose it is.

549
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,440
But that's not the key point.

550
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,599
The key point is there's crucial information on it.

551
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,519
What?

552
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:19,840
Look.

553
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,400
Look at this netizen.

554
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,400
He had the same illness as you.

555
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,079
He sought treatment everywhere in the world.

556
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,400
Everyone said he was probably beyond cure.

557
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,280
That he wouldn't survive.

558
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,000
And then?

559
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,400
With a "last resort" mindset,

560
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,519
he went to see an old Chinese medicine doctor.

561
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:34,880
And he was actually cured.

562
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,639
He just took a bunch of medicine and got better.

563
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,760
He's still very healthy now.

564
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:38,679
Really.

565
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,599
You know what?

566
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,920
You sound exactly like a pyramid scheme promoter right now.

567
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,400
Fine.

568
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,239
Then let's go check it out tomorrow.

569
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,440
Then we'll know if it's true or false.

570
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,079
It's settled then.

571
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,400
See you tomorrow.

572
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,360
See you tomorrow.

573
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,119
Now it's time for individual photos with the Roast Duck King.

574
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,400
Come on, me, me, me first.

575
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,360
Let me get a solo photo with the Roast Duck King first.

576
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,199
Alright.

577
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,360
Three, two, one, go!

578
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,920
Okay, next, next.

579
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,119
I need one with the Roast Duck King.

580
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:19,800
Alright.

581
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,440
It's my turn now.

582
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,320
Okay.

583
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,039
Okay, next, next.

584
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:25,559
Come on, Uncle, come on.

585
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,400
Come on, Uncle, come on.

586
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,320
Come on.

587
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,119
Got it.

588
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,480
Next, next.

589
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,400
Uncle Li.

590
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:36,639
Alright.

591
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,239
Next, next.

592
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:38,599
Come on.

593
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,519
Post it on social media, come on.

594
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,360
Hold this, hold this.

595
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,639
One, two, three... say cheese!

596
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,239
Post it online, the only one in the community.

597
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:52,159
Right, for the family of three, come on.

598
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:54,039
Come on, take a picture of the three of us, come on.

599
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,199
Alright.

600
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:58,039
Three, two, one...

601
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:00,159
Go! Alright.

602
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,159
You should give me an explanation now.

603
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,639
I promised you

604
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,800
I would definitely get Peng Le Xuan for you.

605
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,440
I also told you

606
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,360
that roast duck shop of yours

607
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,920
with the backing of Peng Le Xuan,

608
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,360
would definitely break out.

609
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,440
Neither of those things has changed.

610
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:47,119
What's more,

611
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,719
Big Brother won the Roast Duck King competition.

612
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,159
Now Peng Le Xuan's status has risen with him.

613
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,519
Enough, Weiguo.

614
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,000
Stop beating around the bush with me.

615
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,960
What exactly do you want?

616
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:01,360
I want you to merge Spring River Warms

617
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:03,079
into Peng Le Xuan.

618
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,920
With Big Brother, Sister-in-law,

619
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,880
and Lianbao

620
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,360
as the core trio,

621
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,480
to make Peng Le Xuan grow bigger and bigger.

622
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,199
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

623
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,000
Why?

624
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,320
Don't you realize

625
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,480
this means I have to admit with my own mouth

626
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,800
that all my previous investments

627
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,840
were failures?

628
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,800
All the work I did was pointless

629
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,840
and wrong.

630
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,239
How can I survive in this circle if I do that?

631
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,599
How can I gain the trust of everyone above and below?

632
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,360
You, as long as you succeed once,

633
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,719
people will forget all your past failures.

634
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,400
Understand?

635
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,960
Alright, you don't need to say more.

636
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Get out of the car.

637
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,880
We won't be cooperating anymore in the future.

638
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,639
What a coincidence.

639
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,480
You two are together.

640
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,800
Let me tell you a little secret.

641
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,199
Actually, Weiguo

642
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,519
is a mole planted among you.

643
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,920
All the discord between you these days

644
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,440
was deliberately stirred up by him.

645
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,519
And the matter with Chef Sun

646
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,000
was also arranged by him on purpose.

647
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,679
He even guaranteed me

648
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,599
that he could definitely get Peng Le Xuan for me.

649
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,639
Oh, that thing?

650
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,519
I already knew about that.

651
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,159
He confessed to me yesterday.

652
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,639
I'll get out.

653
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,199
What did I tell you?

654
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,880
If you treat her like this,

655
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,559
how could she cooperate with you?

656
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,800
I've also expressed my stance to Mom and Dad.

657
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,159
It's for your work.

658
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,800
Just stay in Xi'an for one more year.

659
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,679
Once you get promoted to director,

660
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:38,639
you'll be the biggest official in our family.

661
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,760
What?

662
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,599
What kind of official is that?

663
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,000
You're just talking nonsense.

664
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:46,400
Anyway, just go for it with single-minded focus.

665
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,880
I'll support you from behind.

666
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,880
You said Big Brother used to be so laid-back,

667
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,280
but now he's working so hard.

668
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,079
I need to learn from him.

669
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,920
Yes, I also need to learn from Big Brother.

670
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,760
Honey,

671
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,000
look at you brothers.

672
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,679
Third Brother is in charge of major decisions.

673
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,320
Second Brother secures investments.

674
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:07,360
Big Brother recently won the Roast Duck King title.

675
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,519
They're all indispensable to the roast duck shop.

676
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,360
So you also need to think carefully

677
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,920
about your role and position.

678
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,239
Only then can you demonstrate your value.

679
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,800
Yes, yes.
