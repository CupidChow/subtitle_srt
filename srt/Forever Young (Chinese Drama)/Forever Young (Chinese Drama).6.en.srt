1
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,319
Lao Tong

2
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,760
The boss is looking for you.

3
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:51,840
Go on, hurry.

4
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,319
Brother Tong, what's wrong?

5
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,680
It's nothing. I got up too fast.

6
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,639
Have something to eat.

7
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,280
Okay.

8
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,599
Branch Manager.

9
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,080
Tong.

10
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,560
You wanted to see me?

11
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
Tong.

12
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,319
You've finally come to your senses.

13
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,520
Come to your senses.

14
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,560
Here.

15
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,919
So?

16
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,879
You must have closed the deal this time, right?

17
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,319
Closed it, right?

18
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,560
I won't ask for the details.

19
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,919
When the time comes,

20
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,400
just tell me the result.

21
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:29,759
Finish it.

22
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,919
Alright, alright.

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,400
Look who's getting protective now.

24
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,000
He hasn't even drunk half of it.

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,599
Enough.

26
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,840
He's had too much.

27
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,039
Here, sober up.

28
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,879
Getting protective.

29
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,719
So sweet, are we?

30
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,560
Got it, got it.

31
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,080
Out.

32
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,719
Xiao Jia, you come here.

33
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,120
Are you okay, Lao Tong?

34
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,240
Lao Tong.

35
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,160
Are you okay?

36
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,120
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

37
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,439
Honey.

38
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,439
This promotion is probably out of reach again.

39
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,199
The next promotion likely won't happen either.

40
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,000
What a mess this is.

42
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,000
Brother Tong.

43
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,000
Manager Li.

44
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,639
What are you doing here?

45
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,160
Just looking around.

46
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,000
Tom, are you doing okay working here?

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,639
How many times have I told you?

48
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,839
My surname is Li, not Tang.

49
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,000
No.

50
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,079
Is this a place for you to just look around?

51
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,439
This is our office area.

52
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,920
What are you, a foreigner, looking at?

53
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,519
Go on, get out, out, out.

54
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,519
Lianbao, what are you doing? Let go.

55
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,279
This foreigner...

56
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,680
was wandering around our office area. I...

57
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,720
What nonsense are you pulling?

58
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,519
This is the representative from our new investor.

59
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,279
Kevin.

60
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,800
Kevin, I'm so sorry.

61
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,759
Why didn't you let us know you were coming?

62
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,240
So we could have prepared to host you.

63
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:56,879
Right.

64
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,759
I prefer to assess investment targets with my own eyes.

65
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,199
Understood, understood.

66
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,199
In our words, it's an incognito inspection.

67
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,439
Yes, yes, yes.

68
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,560
You invested in our company?

69
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,480
Then why didn't you tell me?

70
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,839
What's going on with you?

71
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,279
Does Kevin need to report his investments to you?

72
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,319
It's fine, it's fine.

73
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,399
Tom and I have a special relationship.

74
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,399
My wife is his ex-wife.

75
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,240
And he is my daughter's biological father.

76
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,920
Lianbao, you're divorced?

77
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,439
Last time we had dinner,

78
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,879
you said your wife found a...

79
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,759
particularly unreliable loser.

80
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,399
Excuse me, everyone.

81
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,279
I need to speak with Tom privately.

82
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,040
Tom.

83
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,439
Yuanyuan came back from your place with a fever last time.

84
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,839
Please, when you take her out in the future,

85
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,360
make sure to take proper precautions.

86
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,240
Is it serious?

87
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,399
Nana is taking care of her.

88
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,920
It shouldn't be a big problem.

89
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,879
Alright, everyone.

90
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,079
Please, show me around.

91
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,399
The honor is ours. Please.

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
Lianbao, Lianbao.

93
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,279
What?

94
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,240
Is Yuanyuan feeling better now?

95
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,959
Just took medicine, she's asleep.

96
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,720
Then let me see her.

97
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,040
Just one look, one look, is that too much?

98
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
What were you doing before the divorce?

99
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,839
How many times?

100
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,040
Jenny was sick,

101
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
and you were still out drinking and socializing.

102
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,879
Now you want to be a good father?

103
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,439
I'm telling you, it's too late.

104
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,519
Wait a second.

105
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,800
What?

106
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,759
Move the camera back a bit.

107
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,160
Yes, yes, there, stop.

108
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
What's wrong with you?

109
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,680
That doll, I asked someone

110
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,040
and finally managed to buy it.

111
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,439
Yuanyuan loved it so much.

112
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,079
How could you just toss it aside?

113
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,199
This one?

114
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,600
Here.

115
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,079
This whole wall of dolls,

116
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,800
they're all from Kevin.

117
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,040
He brought them back from abroad for Jenny.

118
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,480
And they're limited editions.

119
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,159
I just had a dream.

120
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,360
Couldn't get back to sleep, so I came up to sit for a while.

121
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,720
Auntie used to live in my room.

122
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,120
I lived with Grandma and Grandpa in your courtyard.

123
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,799
When we were kids, every year at this time,

124
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,679
Auntie would give me thirty cents a day

125
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,320
to buy chilled soda.

126
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,600
I wouldn't share with Lianbao or Qiu'er.

127
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,080
The soda was just for the two of us.

128
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,960
I just dreamed of Auntie.

129
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,480
She gave me thirty cents again,

130
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,799
telling me to buy soda.

131
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,799
Manager Li.

132
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,000
As soon as Kevin arrived, he wants to push cost reduction and efficiency improvement.

133
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,639
He wants to cut all inefficient positions.

134
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,399
Now the whole company is in a panic.

135
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,200
Everyone's waiting for you to take charge.

136
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,679
I'm so useless.

137
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
So useless.

138
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,799
This is us, the four brothers from Baofang.

139
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,279
On our very first day.

140
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,440
I'm talking.

141
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,320
Then... then you speak.

142
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,600
Go on, speak.

143
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,840
I'm the big brother.

144
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,200
I'm number one.

145
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,320
I'm number two.

146
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,279
You're number two.

147
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:38,720
I'm number four.

148
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,440
Weiguo is number three.

149
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,480
Qiu'er is number four.

150
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,799
I... I'm number one.

151
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,480
Let's have a toast.

152
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,960
Cheers.

153
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,159
Manager Li.

154
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,080
This is my resignation letter.

155
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,679
An identical copy.

156
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,960
I've already emailed it to you.

157
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,960
What are you doing?

158
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,960
The company hasn't said you have to leave.

159
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,919
Given my current situation,

160
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,519
the company will downsize me sooner or later.

161
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,399
Rather than waiting to be laid off,

162
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,120
I'd rather take the initiative.

163
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,600
So little confidence?

164
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,919
I'm almost thirty this year.

165
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,639
The work I do at the company

166
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,080
is all pretty dispensable.

167
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,080
With this cost reduction and efficiency improvement,

168
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,120
whether I'll be cut or not,

169
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,080
I have a pretty good idea.

170
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,559
Manager Li.

171
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,120
Thank you for taking care of me all these years.

172
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,279
Hello, Tech Support?

173
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,600
This is Li Lianbao.

174
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Uh, my computer won't turn on.

175
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,720
What? It's locked?

176
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,360
Why?

177
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,519
Sorry, Manager Li.

178
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,480
I'm just following the layoff list Kevin provided.

179
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,639
That's what I'm executing.

180
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,320
Please cooperate.

181
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,679
Complete the procedures as soon as possible.

182
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,759
Don't worry about the compensation part.

183
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,919
You're deliberately screwing with me, right?

184
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,960
Tom.

185
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,320
I set a few criteria, for the sake of...

186
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,200
What criteria?

187
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,240
Which criteria could possibly put me on the chopping block?

188
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,320
In terms of seniority,

189
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,240
I've been at the company for twelve years.

190
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,600
In terms of performance,

191
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,000
my team was number one in the whole company last year.

192
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,279
In terms of age,

193
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,200
you're not any younger than me.

194
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,799
I'm letting you go

195
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,440
not because of age.

196
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,320
Tom.

197
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,000
For managers at your level,

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,039
I'm actually quite lenient.

199
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,080
Then on what grounds?

200
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,159
Education.

201
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,519
We are about to engage in closer business dealings

202
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:38,679
with Rice.

203
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,720
And as far as I know,

204
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,600
you and Rice's president, Martin,

205
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,919
seem to have some unpleasant history.

206
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,279
Of course, saying this sounds ridiculous,

207
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,559
but for me,

208
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,399
it is indeed an unstable factor.

209
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,399
Furthermore,

210
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,039
your department also needs a new supervisor

211
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,960
with broader vision and more potential for growth.

212
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,639
You barely scraped into university back then,

213
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
and are full of nothing but street-smart habits.

214
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,960
This is not the company's future.

215
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,440
Ma Weiguo.

216
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,200
You really are going to ruin my whole life.

217
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,480
Mr. Ma.

218
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,120
Everything is ready.

219
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,639
We can take the elder home now.

220
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,879
Please sign here.

221
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,159
In fifteen minutes,

222
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,120
we'll depart.

223
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,360
Your wife didn't come.

224
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,519
She said she'd come to see off your aunt,

225
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,879
but today at the shop,

226
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,039
the fire department is coming for an inspection, someone has to stay.

227
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,080
Director Dong.

228
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,679
Uh...

229
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,600
It wasn't convenient to talk at the funeral earlier.

230
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,320
I wanted to ask,

231
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,480
about that thing we discussed last time,

232
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,039
how is it going?

233
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,519
I have a meeting soon.

234
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,400
Let's talk when we're both free.

235
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,759
Actually, you don't need to...

236
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,960
Just give me a brief rundown.

237
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,839
Because my friend,

238
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,880
he wants an update.

239
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,200
So he can feel more at ease.

240
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,359
A brief rundown?

241
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
Recently, I

242
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,000
do indeed plan to invest in a new F&B project.

243
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,599
But I already have a target in mind.

244
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,200
Your friend's conditions

245
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,240
are still a bit lacking.

246
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,039
You have a new target?

247
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,279
Which one?

248
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,720
Big brother

249
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,920
Can we talk?

250
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,839
Go ahead.

251
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,319
I'm planning to invest in Penglexuan.

252
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,880
Invest in Penglexuan.

253
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,599
I happen to have a budget for it.

254
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,680
I thought about it.

255
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,000
Our Penglexuan is a century-old establishment.

256
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,400
Compared to my other investments,

257
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,599
it has more heritage.

258
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,880
Penglexuan is indeed an old shop.

259
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,119
So,

260
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,559
we should cooperate well.

261
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,319
Let's build Penglexuan up.

262
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,480
No, Qianqian.

263
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,720
You should invest in something else.

264
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,559
You know your big brother

265
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,119
isn't one for big ventures.

266
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,000
Big brother, don't worry about that.

267
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,880
On my side,

268
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,519
I have a professional team.

269
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,559
Once we have a proposal ready,

270
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,279
we can discuss it in detail.

271
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:16,839
Okay?

272
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,799
Alright.

273
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,279
Boss Dong.

274
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,799
Are you here to pay respects to your aunt,

275
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,079
or to talk business?

276
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,079
You've been downsized by your company.

277
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,480
Shouldn't you be job hunting,

278
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
instead of criticizing me here?

279
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,359
You were downsized?

280
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,680
How did you get downsized?

281
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,400
No.

282
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,200
I resigned voluntarily.

283
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,799
Right.

284
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,119
I handed in my resignation

285
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,680
before the official notice came.

286
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,160
So, it sort of counts as voluntary.

287
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:48,599
Wait.

288
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,599
Don't you have a meeting?

289
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,400
You should get going.

290
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,440
So talkative.

291
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,359
Seriously, Li Lianbao.

292
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,480
If you really have nowhere to go,

293
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,759
you could beg me.

294
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,240
Maybe I'll soften up

295
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,440
and actually find you a job.

296
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,680
Take care. See you out.

297
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,799
Fine.

298
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,279
I'll head off then.

299
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:06,799
I'm leaving.

300
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,359
Take it easy.

301
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,079
Bye, big brother.

302
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,079
You take care too.

303
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:09,559
Okay.

304
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,079
Hey, what's going on with you?

305
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,200
Don't worry, it's fine.

306
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,480
Didn't I just say?

307
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,599
Voluntary resignation.

308
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,599
Big brother, big brother.

309
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,200
Um, c-congratulations in advance, big brother.

310
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,359
This Penglexuan...

311
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,799
Someone's investing in it.

312
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What's this about?

313
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,440
What's there to congratulate?

314
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
It's a good thing!

315
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,640
How about we hold the thank-you banquet

316
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,279
right at Penglexuan?

317
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,759
Sure.

318
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,720
I'll help arrange things then.

319
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,440
We're all family anyway.

320
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:43,440
Thanks, big brother.

321
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,920
Thank you, thank you, big brother.

322
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,519
No problem, no problem.

323
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,359
Well, we'll be going now.

324
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,079
We have relatives at home for the wake,

325
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,000
we need to attend to them.

326
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,400
Alright, got it. Thanks for your trouble.

327
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,000
You're the one working hard. Let's go.

328
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,000
Leaving, big brother.

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,319
Third brother, let's go.

330
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,039
Take care, Xiaofang.

331
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,960
Let's go to the old spot tomorrow night.

332
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
No time.

333
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,519
You have to go, even if you're busy.

334
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,799
Why should I?

335
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,319
Before Auntie passed,

336
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,240
didn't she want the four of us to reconcile?

337
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,279
Fine.

338
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,039
Let's all go.

339
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,160
Okay.

340
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:33,640
Let's go.

341
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,920
Why is everyone so quiet?

342
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,920
Weren't we supposed to reconcile?

343
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,640
This place is too loud.

344
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
My head is pounding.

345
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,799
I can't even breathe.

346
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,920
Big brother, don't you remember?

347
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,759
You used to bring us to places like this.

348
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,160
You said, "He who hasn't been to the Great Wall is not a true man,"

349
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,079
"and not loving to dance is a real shame."

350
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,920
It's the same kind of place,

351
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,799
but today's nightclubs

352
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,839
are nothing like the old dance halls.

353
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,920
Weiguo.

354
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,039
Don't drink so much.

355
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,160
Weiguo.

356
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:56,720
Weiguo.

357
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,920
Weiguo, I'm so glad you're back.

358
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,359
I've been thinking about you.

359
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,559
Why did you come back?

360
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,319
Are people like him

361
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,799
really popular abroad?

362
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,240
I was the one who set up the meeting with Xue Mazi back then.

363
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,400
The matter is already settled.

364
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,039
Who told you to come?

365
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,119
We were worried about you.

366
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,079
Worried about me?

367
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,920
You rushed out and started a fight without even knowing the facts.

368
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,640
Otherwise, how could that fight have even happened?

369
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,599
We shouldn't have gotten involved for your sake back then.

370
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,359
We should've let Big Mazi finish you off.

371
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,640
Then the whole thing with Liangzi wouldn't have happened.

372
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,920
Shifting the blame, huh?

373
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,519
Young Liangzi is already gone.

374
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,400
I lost my guaranteed university admission.

375
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,960
Big Brother spent two years in prison.

376
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,319
None of these things have anything to do with you.

377
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,599
Why did I go there?

378
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,200
Who did I go there for?

379
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,279
It was all because of you, Li Lianbao.

380
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,640
Who was the one trying to play the hero?

381
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,759
Who insisted on settling scores with those scumbags?

382
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,119
I don't care what you say.

383
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,799
My aunt is gone.

384
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,839
Let's talk about what happened back then.

385
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,319
Fine.

386
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:05,960
Good.

387
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
This is good.

388
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,759
Should've done this long ago.

389
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,400
Sit down.

390
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,079
Before that,

391
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,960
I want you to apologize to me.

392
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,279
What do we have to apologize for?

393
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,759
Back then, I told you guys,

394
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,559
don't pick fights, don't pick fights.

395
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,039
Big Brother, you think two years in prison makes you the victim?

396
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,440
You think losing your spot at Beihang makes you the victim?

397
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,160
Do you think I'm not a victim?

398
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,160
Yes, you're all victims.

399
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,200
Am I not one?

400
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,839
I worked under the table.

401
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:37,920
Lived in a warehouse.

402
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,680
Listened to them curse at me.

403
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,960
Watched them crack jokes I couldn't understand.

404
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,920
And then they fired me.

405
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,039
The year of the financial crisis, I went to Detroit.

406
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,599
The city itself was bankrupt.

407
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,440
No one wanted to go to that godforsaken place.

408
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,079
Why did I go?

409
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,759
Because there, one dollar

410
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,200
could buy you a rundown house.

411
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,079
I was twenty-four that year.

412
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,599
Had to live day in, day out with a mob.

413
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,640
They wanted to tear me apart every second.

414
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,160
To vent their frustration and resentment after losing their jobs.

415
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,799
Did I want to live like that?

416
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,559
Did I deserve that life?

417
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:11,519
No.

418
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,640
Did you ever properly talk about this after you came back?

419
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
You never spoke a single decent word.

420
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,279
Were you ever nice to me?

421
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,319
What did any of you ever show me?

422
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,960
When Auntie was still alive,

423
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,319
couldn't you have said something gentle?

424
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,599
Couldn't you have just said something gentle?

425
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,240
Well, did you ever say anything?

426
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Enough! This is endless! Will it ever end?

427
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,960
Did you ever say anything?

428
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,599
Auntie is gone now.

429
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,079
Nice shot!

430
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,519
Why aren't you kids in school?

431
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,519
You lot, get up here!

432
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,599
A-Auntie.

433
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,519
In this life of mine,

434
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,720
I wasn't a good mother.

435
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,960
Because I was too easygoing.

436
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,039
I wasn't a good daughter either.

437
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,319
Because I was too playful.

438
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Got married,

439
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:19,279
and all those trivial marital squabbles,

440
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,440
the daily grind,

441
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,039
I handled those poorly too.

442
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,880
Because I had no patience.

443
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,880
But isn't it strange,

444
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,279
since you were little, the worry I poured into you kids,

445
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,839
all that unnecessary fretting,

446
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,359
I never complained.

447
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,440
Never found it a bother.

448
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,680
I never expected to get anything in return.

449
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,960
Nor did I know if it was worth it or not.

450
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,119
From now on,

451
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,680
we sever all ties with him.

452
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,640
We're brothers no more.

453
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,559
I know

454
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:16,240
there aren't that many second chances in this world.

455
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,440
Whether it's Xu Liang,

456
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,160
your uncle,

457
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,440
or my own brothers and sisters,

458
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,359
in the end, it all comes down to parting.

459
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,640
Generation after generation of people,

460
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,440
day after day of life,

461
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,160
the joys and sorrows, meetings and partings,

462
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,880
all depend on fate.

463
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,200
You can't force it.

464
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,000
But don't you forget,

465
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,640
for men,

466
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,359
the rarest quality is integrity.

467
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,599
The cheapest thing is that bit of pride.

468
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,240
You guys start eating.

469
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,160
Eat up, all of you.

470
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,200
Sister-in-law

471
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:44,880
Sister-in-law

472
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,599
Big brother

473
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,720
Sister-in-law, sit, sit, sit.

474
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,920
Big brother, I... I must toast you.

475
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,440
You've truly worked hard all these years.

476
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,200
It's my duty, my duty.

477
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,880
To you.

478
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,440
We're all family.

479
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,839
And Auntie?

480
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,440
In my heart, she was like a mother to me.

481
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,640
And then, Xiaofang...

482
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,240
Now that Auntie is gone...

483
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,200
If you need anything in the future,

484
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,319
you can tell me, tell your sister-in-law.

485
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:10,079
Tell us.

486
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:10,640
You should visit often.

487
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,440
Come, you must, must visit often.

488
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,240
Thank you, sister-in-law. Thank you, big brother.

489
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,000
Thank you, big brother.

490
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,119
Here, sister-in-law.

491
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,240
Here, Fang.

492
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,559
Sit, eat.

493
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,039
Alright, you should eat something now.

494
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,000
Let's tidy up.

495
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,400
Everyone.

496
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,720
I'm especially grateful to all my family,

497
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,960
all the elders, for coming.

498
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,319
Especially during this period,

499
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,519
like Third Brother coming from afar,

500
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,119
Second Brother, Qiu, have been a huge help.

501
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,240
I've taken note of it all,

502
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,960
and am deeply moved.

503
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,880
Thank you all.

504
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,880
As for Penglexuan,

505
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,000
all these years,

506
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,160
it's been a burden on my big brother to manage it.

507
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,319
Actually, Fang and I have seen it,

508
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,319
and it really doesn't sit right with us.

509
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,680
It's what we should do.

510
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,200
No, no, no.

511
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,640
There's no "should" or "shouldn't" about it.

512
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,920
There's a responsibility involved.

513
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:01,759
Listen to me.

514
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,400
Big brother, you listen to me first.

515
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,680
So we've made a decision.

516
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,680
Starting today,

517
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,200
Fang and I

518
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,519
want to help our big brother

519
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,200
share the burden.

520
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,759
Everyone knows

521
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,119
that Penglexuan originally

522
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,160
was also the inheritance of Xu Fang's grandfather.

523
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,240
So however you look at it,

524
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,720
we have the responsibility and duty

525
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,599
to help our big brother share it, right?

526
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,680
Fang.

527
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,480
Is he drunk?

528
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,240
A bit.

529
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,000
No, no, that's not it.

530
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,160
No, what are you sharing?

531
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,359
Big brother, listen to me.

532
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,880
Tang, today's occasion isn't suitable.

533
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,960
If you really have something to say,

534
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,720
talk to your big brother privately later.

535
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,039
No, no, no.

536
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:57,759
Sister-in-law is right.

537
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,039
It's suitable, suitable, suitable.

538
00:29:59,039 --> 00:29:59,640
No, no.

539
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,319
It's especially suitable.

540
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,440
Sister-in-law, it's, it's suitable.

541
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,079
Especially suitable.

542
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:04,519
Sister-in-law, it has to be said today, sister-in-law.

543
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,160
It has to be said today.

544
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,119
Tang, Tang, Tang.

545
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,359
Let me say something.

546
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,599
Listen to your big brother, okay?

547
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,240
Today,

548
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,559
we're here for Auntie, right?

549
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,119
We're here to thank everyone.

550
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,279
Whatever it is, we can discuss it ourselves later.

551
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,359
Okay? Fang, keep him in check.

552
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,480
It's precisely because today is about my mom

553
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,880
that it has to be said.

554
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,319
Because this matter is related to my mom.

555
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,279
Sister-in-law, it must be said.

556
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,039
Why?

557
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,680
Because everyone is here today.

558
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,799
If everyone weren't here,

559
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,519
and we agreed on something later,

560
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:29,759
what if someone goes back on their word, right?

561
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,200
I'm afraid someone might renege.

562
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,920
Renege on what?

563
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,880
Weasel out of a deal.

564
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,160
I wondered why you insisted on holding

565
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,519
this thank-you banquet at Penglexuan.

566
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,759
I thought you just wanted to save some money.

567
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,519
Turns out there's this act too.

568
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,680
Alright then.

569
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,160
Since everyone is here,

570
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,039
say what's on your mind today.

571
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,079
Big brother, big brother.

572
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,240
It's actually very simple.

573
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,640
What I mean to say is,

574
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,559
that Penglexuan, for so many years,

575
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,079
under my big brother's management...

576
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,359
Big brother, the money you've...

577
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,160
I think you've made enough.

578
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,240
You should know when to stop.

579
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,039
Even greed has its limits.

580
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,200
What do you mean, "greedy"?

581
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,039
Can you speak properly?

582
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,000
What "what"? What's "what"?

583
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,359
If it's not greed, what is it?

584
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,519
Qiu, Qiu, Qiu.

585
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,519
This has nothing to do with you.

586
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,839
Don't speak, don't speak.

587
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,640
Tang.

588
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,119
A man whose heart is not content is like a snake trying to swallow an elephant.

589
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,519
What the heck does Penglexuan have to do with you?

590
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,839
No, big brother, you can't say that either.

591
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,680
No, Xiaofang, why are you saying that too?

592
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,480
What's wrong? What's wrong?

593
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,359
Can't talk, is that it?

594
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,680
Don't glare. Don't just glare like that.

595
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,119
Come on, sit down. Sit down, sit down.

596
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,480
Don't keep interrogating our Xu Fang.

597
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,559
Emotional blackmail, moral blackmail, right?

598
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,480
Bullying the honest one, aren't you?

599
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,440
He was Xu Fang's grandfather too, wasn't he?

600
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,359
How come it all goes to you alone?

601
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,240
Just because our Xu Fang is a woman, right?

602
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,960
Let me tell you.

603
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,880
The inheritance law stipulates gender equality.

604
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,680
Right on this point.

605
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,200
Our Xu Fang...

606
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
No, no, no, you sit.

607
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:56,000
Xu Fang has the same rights as you.

608
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,759
And I'll be honest with you.

609
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,400
I've already hired a lawyer.

610
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,480
If you keep making trouble like this,

611
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,680
we'll see you in court.

612
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,799
Don't give me that nonsense about

613
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,400
inheritance law or no inheritance law.

614
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,319
When Grandpa was still alive,

615
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,400
in front of my mom,

616
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,559
in front of my uncle,

617
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,799
and in front of my aunt,

618
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,039
he made a written agreement with me.

619
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,519
Grandpa said whoever could inherit his craft

620
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,480
would get the Penglexuan.

621
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,759
It was stated clearly.

622
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,920
And furthermore,

623
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,160
it was my parents who took care of Grandma and Grandpa till the end.

624
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,079
And as for you,

625
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,079
Aunt only has this one daughter.

626
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,359
You, her son-in-law,

627
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:32,359
the financial hole you dug from years of business,

628
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,799
it was us, my wife and I,

629
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,839
who used the Penglexuan to fill it for you.

630
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,599
Aunt remembered this kindness.

631
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,519
That's why Aunt didn't claim the Penglexuan.

632
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,119
If Aunt had said she wanted the Penglexuan,

633
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:44,599
I would have handed it to her with both hands.

634
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,759
And my mom said she didn't want it.

635
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:46,599
There was that written agreement back then.

636
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,880
I never heard of it.

637
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,759
I never heard the old lady say that.

638
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,319
I never heard of it.

639
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,720
How could you not have heard of it?

640
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,400
Are you drunk or something?

641
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,519
No, do you have any proof?

642
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,519
Do you have any proof?

643
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,680
No, there was a written agreement back then!

644
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,400
Have you seen it?

645
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,759
Have you seen the agreement?

646
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:00,440
I haven't seen it.

647
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:00,839
Stop saying that.

648
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:01,440
You've seen it, you produce it.

649
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,880
Brother, produce it.

650
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,200
No, Xiao Tang, let me tell you.

651
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,039
The Penglexuan has been renovated so many times.

652
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,599
The back rooms have been redone over and over.

653
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,759
Done several times.

654
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,319
We've moved how many times?

655
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,599
I really can't find that thing anymore.

656
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,440
Then it doesn't exist.

657
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,079
If you can't produce it, it doesn't exist.

658
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,880
He can't produce it, so it doesn't exist, right?

659
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,039
Xiao Tang, Xiao Tang.

660
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,720
You have to speak with a conscience.

661
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,359
You said it yourself.

662
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,000
We're all family.

663
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
We trust each other.

664
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,599
So we don't need to rewrite it, right?

665
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,079
How can you turn around and deny it?

666
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,039
Besides, the Penglexuan is a matter between the siblings.

667
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,319
To put it bluntly, we're both outsiders.

668
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,000
You shouldn't be saying this here.

669
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,720
It's not appropriate.

670
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,839
Sister-in-law, you shouldn't be the one saying that.

671
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:36,599
Let me tell you.

672
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,039
You can't talk like that.

673
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,160
Don't touch. Don't point.

674
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,880
What? What?

675
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,640
Why can't I point?

676
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,319
What do you mean?

677
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,440
Spouting nonsense here.

678
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,680
Don't act drunk here.

679
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,200
Sorry, sorry.

680
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,160
She makes it sound like we planned this all along,

681
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,240
to swindle their family.

682
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,680
Stop making a scene. You've gone too far.

683
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,000
You're wronging a good person.

684
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:52,559
You're wronging me.

685
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,720
No, how are you talking to your sister-in-law?

686
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,680
What? What?

687
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,640
Why can't I talk to my sister-in-law like this?

688
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,359
He's had a bit too much to drink.

689
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,759
Sorry, had too much, had too much.

690
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:58,200
It's okay.

691
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,039
I'm not talking to him anymore.

692
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,319
He said it. He said it. My word is useless.

693
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,480
Had too much, had too much.

694
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,359
He said it.

695
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,319
He said it, okay?

696
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,079
Sorry.

697
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,240
If I'm no use,

698
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,319
then my mom will be of use.

699
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,680
Come on, come on.

700
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,760
You tell my mom.

701
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,800
You tell my mom.

702
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,199
Xiao Tang, this is not right.

703
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,800
Don't move. Talk to my mom.

704
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,280
No, are you crazy?

705
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,599
What are you doing with Aunt's portrait?

706
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,280
What are you trying to do?

707
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,840
Wang Chunsheng, you...

708
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,880
My mom even said you were a good person.

709
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,119
Is this how you treat us well?

710
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,159
Xiao Tang, what are you... what are you doing?

711
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,719
Aren't you just causing trouble?

712
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,880
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

713
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,920
He's drunk.

714
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,239
Tang Zhixin!

715
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,719
Go ahead, smash another one, I dare you.

716
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,119
He's bleeding.

717
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:50,880
He's bleeding!

718
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,360
Quick, call the police!

719
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,159
Call the police!

720
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,559
Go ahead, call them! What are you gonna do?

721
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,280
Too impulsive.

722
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,480
Call the police!

723
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,039
So much blood. Does it hurt?

724
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:00,960
It hurts.

725
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,519
Hurry, call the police!

726
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,360
Who's calling the police?

727
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
Who's calling the police?

728
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,400
Let me see.

729
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,480
No, Brother, how could you hit someone?

730
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,639
He was trying to kill me!

731
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,400
No matter what, you can't hit someone!

732
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,079
Call the police quickly!

733
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:16,960
Brother...

734
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,559
You two come with us

735
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,199
Let's go

736
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,480
Officer

737
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,039
I really didn't fight back

738
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:31,760
I didn't hit back even once

739
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,840
Get in the car, don't talk

740
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,199
I... I'm not getting in this car

741
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:34,760
Get in

742
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,159
I won't

743
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:35,840
Get in, get in

744
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,000
Hurry up, get in the car

745
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,280
Lao Er

746
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,519
Don't worry

747
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:10,639
Sister-in-law

748
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,320
Lao Er

749
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:14,599
Uncle

750
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,320
Feifei

751
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,639
Go back to your room and study

752
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,920
I'll discuss this with your mom

753
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,920
It's fine, go on

754
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,079
I was thinking I could help figure something out

755
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,760
I can help come up with ideas too

756
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,880
Be good, go

757
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,199
Lao Er

758
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,719
Look at your big brother's age

759
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,639
How can he still be so reckless?

760
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,280
Sister-in-law, you don't need to worry

761
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,599
My friend introduced a lawyer to me

762
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,119
He is very skilled

763
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,880
He's willing to take this case too

764
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,880
If you found him, he must be good

765
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,400
The legal fees... I'll transfer to you

766
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,079
No need

767
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:00,719
Don't worry about the money

768
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,880
It's just the cost of a couple of meals

769
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,679
Is it really serious this time?

770
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,760
Will he be locked up for three to five years?

771
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,280
Rest assured

772
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,480
I'll go contact him right now

773
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,320
Then... then you keep an eye on things

774
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,079
Take care

775
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,320
Our branch

776
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,199
in Wangping Village, Mentougou

777
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,679
has opened a new outlet

778
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,239
We need to send a senior employee

779
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,519
to support them for a while

780
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:46,440
The candidate has already been reported

781
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,159
That's all for today, meeting adjourned

782
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,960
Wangping Village

783
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:05,800
Tong

784
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,320
You stay

785
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,159
The new outlet in Wangping Village, Mentougou is opening

786
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,639
They are short-handed

787
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,280
You go support them for a few months

788
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,119
Manager Liu

789
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:23,639
Is it because of Mr. Qiu?

790
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,840
Don't make wild connections

791
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,440
It has nothing to do with Mr. Qiu

792
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,440
Today let's talk about your issues

793
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,159
Look at this yourself

794
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,039
The performance indicators for the last six months

795
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:34,320
you haven't properly completed any

796
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,000
And your attendance record

797
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,760
In a month, you're late for half of it

798
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,000
The other half, you leave early

799
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,039
You don't even file for leave

800
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,159
You just leave it like that

801
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,639
Yes, I really have some family matters recently

802
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,599
Daily reports, monthly reports, quarterly reports, annual reports

803
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,599
Look at what you wrote yourself

804
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,880
Don't be angry

805
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,239
It... it is my fault

806
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,800
It really is my fault

807
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:58,239
Even Little Zhou, who's only been here a few years, is better than you

808
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,480
If you don't go, who will?

809
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,440
Darn it

810
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:03,440
No, no, no

811
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,079
I recently...

812
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,920
really have a deposit waiting to come in

813
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,760
Just you?

814
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:13,840
If you can really bring it in

815
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,920
I'll transfer you back immediately

816
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,320
Go this afternoon

817
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,679
Who left their cup in the conference room?

818
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,039
Come back and get it

819
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,920
What is this?

820
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:56,280
Lawyer Zhang

821
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,199
That's the situation

822
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,440
The rest is entirely up to your arrangement

823
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,519
Just... the sooner the better

824
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,840
I have a rough idea

825
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:08,239
Lawyer Zhang

826
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:11,119
What do you think are the chances?

827
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,639
It's hard to say

828
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,400
Civil compensation is definitely unavoidable

829
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,159
As for the other party's litigation demands

830
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,920
I have to judge based on the actual situation

831
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,480
Excuse me

832
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,440
Let's stop here for today

833
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
The subsequent procedures

834
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,039
I'll find a time to go over them with you

835
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:30,960
No way

836
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:33,400
He won't really be sentenced, will he?

837
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,199
He used to...

838
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:34,960
Sister-in-law

839
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,800
This court isn't owned by Tang Zhixin's family

840
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,159
It's not like whatever he says goes

841
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,840
Let's listen to the lawyer

842
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,159
Lawyer Zhang, someone is looking for you

843
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,000
Do they have an appointment?

844
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,719
It's Lawyer Liu from Daheng

845
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:56,320
Um, Lawyer Zhang, thank you

846
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,960
No problem, it's my duty

847
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,599
Old Zhang, I'll treat you to a meal later

848
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,519
Okay

849
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:03,679
I won't see you out then

850
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,320
Please, stay

851
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,599
Take care, take care

852
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:04,960
Weiguo

853
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
Leaving so soon?

854
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,079
Why are you here too?

855
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:13,840
Big Zhang, I came uninvited

856
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,239
Senior Brother, I'm honored by your visit

857
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,400
Let me introduce a friend

858
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,679
This is Mr. Martin from the US headquarters

859
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,159
Mr. Martin, nice to meet you

860
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:23,920
If there's anything

861
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,000
let's go inside and talk

862
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,239
Together, in a bit

863
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,800
Okay

864
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,880
Come, come, inside, inside

865
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:28,719
Senior Brother

866
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,280
I found a large conference room for you

867
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,280
Why is he here?

868
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,199
How would I know?

869
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,440
Let's go have a look first
