1
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,040
Just put it right here.

2
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,519
Yangzi, we have movers.

3
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,640
Don't touch our stuff.

4
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,719
You might drop and break something.

5
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,239
It's fine, it's fine.

6
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,640
I know what I'm doing.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,719
While we're moving things...

8
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,239
...let's see what else you don't need.

9
00:01:59,239 --> 00:01:59,719
We need everything.

10
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,400
Chunsheng.

11
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,840
Come visit often.

12
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,079
Auntie, don't worry.

13
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,560
We'll be back every day.

14
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,680
This monk isn't going anywhere.

15
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,800
The temple is right here.

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,400
Peng Le Xuan is here.

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,840
How could he not come back?

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,039
You're so funny.

19
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,800
So, you want all this stuff, right?

20
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,400
That's a stupid question.

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,280
Do you even need this?

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,719
Of course I do.

23
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,159
Put that in the truck for me.

24
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,240
Stop eyeing our things.

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,599
I'm just checking if you need it.

26
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,400
I could take it off your hands.

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,840
Our family doesn't want you.

28
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,520
Even if you did, I wouldn't come.

29
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,599
Hey, don't lift that.

30
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,280
You'll strain your back.

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,599
There are plenty of people here.

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,680
Look, this...

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,919
Alright, alright.

34
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,719
Yangzi, you take...

35
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,080
Here, let me do it.

36
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,319
Okay, okay.

37
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,840
Sis, come visit me sometime.

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,719
You come over often.

39
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,280
Okay.

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,840
Visit often.

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,360
Alright.

42
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,120
Obviously, we want this too.

43
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,280
Here, here.

44
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,360
You can just put it there.

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,919
Easy, easy.

46
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,680
No need to ask, we want this one too.

47
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,719
If you're so strong, do more work.

48
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,280
Third Uncle.

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,719
Uncle, come visit my place when you're free.

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,919
Forget it.

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,719
I don't want to upset your dad.

52
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,719
He actually cares about you in private.

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,120
He often talks about you with my mom.

54
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,240
I've overheard them.

55
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,280
But what he did was really unreliable.

56
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,919
I'd be angry too if I were you.

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,919
Don't be angry.

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,280
Do I look angry to you?

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,400
Yes.

60
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,400
Like someone who's angry but won't admit it.

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,879
Uncle.

62
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,280
Do you think...

63
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,680
...I'll ever see my dad make roast duck again?

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,719
Honestly...

65
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,839
...I'm happy to move into an apartment.

66
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,040
But if he stops making roast duck...

67
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,480
...I'd really miss it.

68
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,959
So, do you want him to keep making it?

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,519
Of course I do.

70
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,079
Maybe...

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,519
...I can think of a way.

72
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,160
Really.

73
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,639
But I can only try.

74
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,199
Most importantly...

75
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,399
...you need to cooperate.

76
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,079
Sure.

77
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,639
I'll do whatever you say.

78
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,360
Your plan must be solid.

79
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,839
Alright, you head back first.

80
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,839
I need to think it over.

81
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,399
Okay, just call me anytime.

82
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,199
Uncle, really.

83
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,519
Come visit me at my place.

84
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,199
I will.

85
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,000
Chunsheng.

86
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,079
Let's go.

87
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:01,920
Let's go.

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,879
Okay, on three.

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,480
So happy.

90
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:07,920
We're off.

91
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,360
Leaving.

92
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,120
Let's go, go, go.

93
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,720
See you tomorrow.

94
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Goodbye.

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
No matter where you go...

96
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,240
...don't forget your old neighbors.

97
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,040
Stop joking around.

98
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,240
We'll be back tomorrow.

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,120
See you tomorrow.

100
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,040
See you tomorrow.

101
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,560
Bye-bye.

102
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,720
Bye-bye.

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,519
Go ahead.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,879
Why should I believe you can help me?

105
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,279
I have a trump card.

106
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,000
What trump card?

107
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,519
Wang Fei.

108
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Wang Fei trusts me completely now.

109
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Through him...

110
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
...I can track those three's movements.

111
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,000
And I can subtly influence them too.

112
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,000
Li Lianbao has always been ambitious but incompetent.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,439
He has little practical experience.

114
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
He just saw a few things online...

115
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,839
...and now wants to start a business.

116
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,920
He thinks starting a business is easy.

117
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,439
They can't afford to make a single mistake.

118
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,040
Otherwise, it'll be fatal.

119
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,839
At that point, Peng Le Xuan's only way out...

120
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,399
...will be to beg capital for a lifeline.

121
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,079
And their most valuable asset...

122
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,199
...is their century-old brand name.

123
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,040
Don't worry.

124
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,399
I'll offer a fair price.

125
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,040
Big Bro won't lose out.

126
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,079
Weiguo.

127
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,560
I have one more question.

128
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,959
You run such a big business overseas.

129
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,920
You're neglecting your real work...

130
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,079
...why bother competing with them...

131
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,759
...over such small potatoes?

132
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,279
What you consider my real work...

133
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,040
...I've already finished.

134
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,680
Now...

135
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,040
...this...

136
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,040
...is my real work.

137
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,279
Qiu'er.

138
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,120
Why did you buy so much stuff?

139
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Where will we put it all?

140
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,160
It's fine, I got a raise.

141
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,240
A raise?

142
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,519
And you bought two of these?

143
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,000
Can we even finish all this?

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,240
One is for Weiguo.

145
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,000
Not bad, not bad. Good.

146
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,600
You even bought one for Weiguo.

147
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,160
This kid.

148
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,160
Still angry, huh?

149
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,680
Ma Weiguo

150
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,680
Ma Weiguo

151
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,439
You had the guts to close the curtains

152
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,079
Have the guts to open the door!

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,439
Ma Weiguo

154
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,160
Ma Ma, Ma Ma

155
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,040
So noisy

156
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,560
You scared me

157
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,839
Still angry?

158
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,120
Come in

159
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,039
What?

160
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,440
You're acting like I'm about to die

161
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,679
Bringing offerings to worship me?

162
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
You're missing an incense stick

163
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,559
No, I bought these for my parents

164
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,639
Just brought you some on the way

165
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,240
Still angry, really

166
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,679
Don't touch my computer

167
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,240
So cold and stern

168
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,240
How about I arrange a get-together?

169
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,720
Invite Big Bro and Second Brother

170
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,840
You guys can have a proper talk

171
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,840
And from now on

172
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,480
Don't always let Big Bro practice on you

173
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,720
Talk properly with Second Brother too

174
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,679
Don't be so stubborn

175
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,440
Peng Le Xuan can come back

176
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,039
I'm the Deputy General Manager now, my words carry weight

177
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,720
No need

178
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,960
I don't know how big your trouble is

179
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,320
My ability is limited

180
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
But I'll help however I can

181
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,120
What's this for?

182
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,960
All these years, you never charged me rent

183
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,480
I've kept track of it all

184
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,120
The rent money is all in this card

185
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,240
If there's any extra

186
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,720
Consider it the difference

187
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,080
made up at market rate

188
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,120
You never raised my rent either

189
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
I'm aware of it all

190
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,240
This card is in my name

191
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
You can use it without worry

192
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,240
There's not much money in it

193
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,360
But enough to get you by for a while

194
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,000
The PIN is your birthday

195
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,080
And also

196
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,240
Whether you think highly of me or not

197
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,360
I've always considered you a brother

198
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,879
Take it back

199
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,240
I'll figure it out myself

200
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,799
All dressed up

201
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,320
The suit from your wedding

202
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
It didn't fit this tight back then

203
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,360
Suck in that belly a bit

204
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,840
Yes, yes, yes

205
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,720
Don't pop the buttons

206
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,080
Right, especially now

207
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,720
You're the Chairman now, right?

208
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
You'll represent the company's image

209
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,559
We have to be mindful

210
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Absolutely

211
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,240
There you go

212
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,559
Feifei

213
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,600
So, how was your first night's sleep?

214
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,320
Not bad

215
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Hand me my shoes

216
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,200
Apartment buildings are great

217
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,480
Getting up in the middle of the night

218
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,960
You just step out one door into another

219
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,960
If you lived in a single-story house

220
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,720
In the dead of winter

221
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,879
If you had a stomach ache

222
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,600
You'd have to put on a heavy coat

223
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,960
and thick pants before going out

224
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,200
You're right

225
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,399
But are we really living here for free?

226
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,600
What do you mean 'for free'?

227
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,080
Our old place

228
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
was converted into commercial space

229
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,000
The company renting us an apartment

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
is normal

231
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,559
Anyway, we're not cooking anymore

232
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,440
So you're not roasting duck anymore either?

233
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,080
Your dad is the Chairman now

234
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,360
Looks like he's admitting defeat to me

235
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,320
What do you mean by giving up?

236
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,960
I've just moved from a technical role

237
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,600
to this management position.

238
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,120
I think it's just fine.

239
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I've smelled the kitchen grease on your dad for over a decade.

240
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,360
I'm long sick of it.

241
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,720
I'm leaving a bit early today.

242
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,240
Second Brother wants me to go with him to the Industry and Commerce Bureau.

243
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,320
Hey, wait, why wasn't I told about this?

244
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,600
So what, you want to go instead?

245
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,200
No.

246
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,960
In the future, for any company matters big or small,

247
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,600
you should give me a heads-up.

248
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,960
Understood, Chairman.

249
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,200
Stop joking.

250
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,240
Have breakfast before you go.

251
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,240
Not eating. I'm on a diet today.

252
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,360
Take care, Chairman.

253
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,720
Bye-bye, Chairman.

254
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,960
Stop joking.

255
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,240
You hurry up and eat, then go to class.

256
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,559
Gone to buy groceries.

257
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,240
Hello, Uncle Wang.

258
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,120
Hello.

259
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,799
Watching the car?

260
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,759
Yes, Uncle Wang.

261
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,879
Lao Wang.

262
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,080
What have you been busy with lately?

263
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,240
Haven't seen you around.

264
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,960
Well, I moved upstairs, didn't I?

265
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,320
We're renovating.

266
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,159
Chairman Wang, Chairman Wang!

267
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,080
What's up?

268
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,600
Come here, come here.

269
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,120
Got something?

270
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,200
Just a couple words, a couple words.

271
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,240
Come on, come on.

272
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,440
What is it?

273
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,840
The aura is just different now.

274
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,120
Chairman, a big shot.

275
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,080
So, what's the matter?

276
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,000
I have a small favor.

277
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,919
It's... it's a bit hard to bring up.

278
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,679
Then don't say it.

279
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,799
No, no, no, I'll say it, I'll say it.

280
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,039
I have to say it, I have to.

281
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,679
Alright, what?

282
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,679
It's like this.

283
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,200
I have a distant relative

284
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,080
who's been doing renovation work in Beijing.

285
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,200
He does good work.

286
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,799
And we're not that distant.

287
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,919
So I was thinking,

288
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,840
since Peng Le Xuan needs renovating,

289
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,200
see if we could, you know, keep it in the family

290
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,320
and consider him first.

291
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,320
Hold on, what has he done before?

292
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,200
Look, here's what you do.

293
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Get me the blueprints from his past projects,

294
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,559
the later design drawings and such.

295
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,320
Let me take a look.

296
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,679
Okay, I'll put together a portfolio later.

297
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,960
You can review the materials.

298
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,200
Alright, alright, I'll glance at it.

299
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
We're all friends here.

300
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,320
Things will be easier to discuss then.

301
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,840
Great! I knew it!

302
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
With our relationship,

303
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,080
it's just a word from you.

304
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,600
So, do you think we still need

305
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,200
to run this by Lianbao?

306
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,440
No need. This place has been renovated a few times.

307
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,200
I know the structure, plumbing, wiring inside out.

308
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,320
My word is enough.

309
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Right, you're the Chairman.

310
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
You just give the final approval.

311
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
We'll decide together.

312
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,960
I say, Chairman Wang,

313
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,720
things are really different now.

314
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,919
Luck is on your side, fortune has turned.

315
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,559
How about this?

316
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,559
Come to my place,

317
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,919
buy a couple of lottery tickets.

318
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,600
I guarantee you'll hit the jackpot.

319
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,559
Five million in your pocket.

320
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,080
Let me tell you,

321
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,080
I really don't need your five million right now.

322
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,440
As for me...

323
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:02,600
Morning.

324
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,279
Big Bro, Brother Dayang.

325
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,600
Weiguo.

326
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,600
Life inevitably has its ups and downs.

327
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,080
Who hasn't hit a ditch or a bump?

328
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,440
So,

329
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
come over to my place,

330
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,320
let's buy a few lottery tickets.

331
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,919
I guarantee you'll get back in the saddle,

332
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,840
charge ahead, and achieve glory again.

333
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,200
Your mouth, I swear.

334
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
I just have to spell things out, don't I?

335
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,120
Alright then,

336
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,879
please put in a good word for my thing.

337
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:38,840
Keep it in mind for me.

338
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,840
Got it.

339
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,360
So the bank manager really begged me for this, right?

340
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,600
And besides, I have a few deals in hand right now.

341
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,360
He's here.

342
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,279
I'm here, Bro.

343
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
The bank is short-staffed right now.

344
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,159
For me to leave at this moment

345
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
wouldn't be appropriate.

346
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,360
After all that talk,

347
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,639
you just haven't quit yet, have you?

348
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,159
I'll resign sooner or later.

349
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,159
I've already made my stance clear

350
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,639
to that deputy bank manager.

351
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,919
Once I finish these few deals at hand,

352
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll leave immediately.

353
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,080
They've now agreed

354
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,639
to transfer me back from Mentougou.

355
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,559
Just think about it.

356
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,600
All our money is at the bank now.

357
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,360
For later accounting procedures and such,

358
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,240
it's easier if I keep an eye on things.

359
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,559
Don't give me these excuses.

360
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,240
Today, in front of Big Bro,

361
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,919
just say whether you'll resign or not.

362
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,000
No, no, no.

363
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,559
Don't resign yet.

364
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
No, Second Brother, what I mean is...

365
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,399
We all know Qiu'er's situation, right?

366
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,080
Right?

367
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,639
Let him earn some extra money while he can.

368
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,080
Besides, we're just starting out.

369
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,320
Right? We're not that busy yet.

370
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,600
When we get busier in the future,

371
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,919
we can talk about it then, okay?

372
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,639
I'm telling you, Big Bro,

373
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,720
stop spoiling him all the time, okay?

374
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
We're running a proper business now.

375
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,160
No, look at you.

376
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
You insisted I be the Chairman.

377
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,920
Right?

378
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,680
Can't I even offer a suggestion

379
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,920
on such a small personnel matter?

380
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,400
See how sensible Big Bro is?

381
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,799
And you're getting carried away?

382
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,319
No, no, look.

383
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,440
If you don't agree to this,

384
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,079
you'll be the one being unreasonable.

385
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,599
I...

386
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,799
Fine, fine, fine.

387
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
For the sake of you being Chairman, okay?

388
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,839
Hey, Second Brother, one more thing.

389
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,640
Uh...

390
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,839
I see Weiguo is down on his luck now.

391
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,000
Should we consider giving him a position

392
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,640
in our shop too?

393
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,160
Stop. Anything else is negotiable.

394
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,680
His matter is off the table.

395
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,640
No, I was just thinking...

396
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,599
Big Bro...

397
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,359
Even if you are the Chairman,

398
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,079
we still have to follow the rules.

399
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,920
Okay?

400
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,160
Alright.

401
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,160
Since you've put it that way,

402
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,079
we'll listen to you.

403
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,319
So my matter is settled then?

404
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,559
Settled, settled, settled.

405
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,240
Good. Now let's move on to the renovation.

406
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,599
Okay.

407
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,640
What are you doing here?

408
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:55,039
Nothing. Just came to see what you're up to.

409
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,160
Want some coffee?

410
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,119
No.

411
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,640
You have no idea how many times you've stood me up.

412
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,759
You have zero credibility left with me.

413
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,839
Is this for an exhibition or a flea market?

414
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,240
How is it? Cool, right?

415
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,599
Originally, all this stuff was

416
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,079
something you promised to help me with.

417
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,559
Now I'm doing it all myself.

418
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,160
Even less reliable than my uncle.

419
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,599
Don't mention that guy.

420
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,839
Since you're already here,

421
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,160
come on, help me out.

422
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,640
Doing what?

423
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,559
Are you trying to kill me?

424
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,680
No.

425
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,400
I was working on something a couple days ago

426
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,839
and accidentally strained my hand.

427
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,839
It doesn't have much strength.

428
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,319
There are a few large pieces of wood

429
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,920
I want you to help me saw into smaller pieces.

430
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,440
I'm making a large picture frame.

431
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,440
What kind of wood can a girl like you saw?

432
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,240
Besides,

433
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,839
can't you just buy a picture frame?

434
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,559
Because this exhibition is for my grandpa,

435
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,559
so I want everything

436
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,839
to be done by my own hands.

437
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,319
That makes it more meaningful.

438
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,160
Alright then, I'll help you.

439
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,640
I heard from Grandpa Tong

440
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,359
he told a lot of stories about you guys before.

441
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,160
I have a new understanding of you.

442
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
What did you say?

443
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,680
I said I heard from Grandpa Tong

444
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,000
about many new stories of you guys recently.

445
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,599
I didn't mean...

446
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,920
Many stories from before.

447
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,640
I have a new understanding of you.

448
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,559
Who said that?

449
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,440
Grandpa Tong.

450
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,359
Said what?

451
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,640
You're the one who said it.

452
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,839
I didn't bring it up.

453
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,160
He talked a lot about you and my uncle.

454
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,240
Also, careful!

455
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,839
What?

456
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27,440
I said among the four of you,

457
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,240
you and my uncle were actually the closest before.

458
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,839
Right?

459
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,039
Looks like I don't need to help you.

460
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,079
I won't say anymore.

461
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,960
I'll shut up, I'll shut up. You work.

462
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,400
Work hard.

463
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,680
Be careful.

464
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:10,960
Uncle.

465
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,880
Aunt.

466
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,599
You two must have met over there by now.

467
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,759
Tell me, what should I do?

468
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,960
You know, me and Weiguo...

469
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,200
I'm really angry with him.

470
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,759
But now, seeing him in trouble,

471
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,039
my heart feels heavy.

472
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,000
I'd rather give up my Peng Le Xuan

473
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,359
than not help him.

474
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,920
Manager Fan.

475
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,880
Brothers and sisters.

476
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,119
Thank you all so much for coming today.

477
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:15,279
I'm so grateful, truly grateful.

478
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,599
Bottoms up!

479
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,759
Manager Fan, about our deposit matter,

480
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,759
let's consider it settled.

481
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,880
And then, brothers and sisters,

482
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,279
when my roast duck restaurant,

483
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,279
Peng Le Xuan, opens later,

484
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,599
you're all welcome to visit.

485
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,039
Please do come.

486
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,599
Of course, of course, we'll definitely come.

487
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,359
Thank you, thank you.

488
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,000
We'll take our leave now.

489
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,359
Alright, alright. Take care on your way.

490
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,240
Take care, take care.

491
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,319
Hello, here is your bill.

492
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,519
The invoice here is electronic, right?

493
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes.

494
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,799
Okay, please issue one for me.

495
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,039
Alright, please wait a moment.

496
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,960
You're already working on it.

497
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,799
Hard work, hard work.

498
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,319
Excuse me

499
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,559
Come on, come on

500
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,759
This is a package, right?

501
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,319
Easy, easy, easy

502
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,759
Geez, if this gets dropped

503
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,519
This cost several hundred yuan

504
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,359
Thanks, thanks

505
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,039
Big Bro, what do you do?

506
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:49,519
I...

507
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,839
This... this shop is mine.

508
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,799
I'm the Chairman here.

509
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,440
You're the Chairman?

510
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,039
No, what's so funny?

511
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,880
Big Bro, don't mess with us.

512
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,000
No, what doesn't look right?

513
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,920
Why would I mess with you?

514
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,279
Go out and ask around.

515
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,839
Peng Le Xuan is a century-old brand.

516
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,599
It was passed down from our ancestors.

517
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:12,720
Never heard of it.

518
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,880
We only know Chairman Li.

519
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,160
Right.

520
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,200
Right, Chairman Li?

521
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,279
Big Bro, Big Bro...

522
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,000
This... this Chairman Li...

523
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
We're working here.

524
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,759
Don't hold up our work.

525
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,680
You... you're saying that...

526
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,400
No, what are you doing?

527
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,000
Just get out, quick.

528
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,640
No, Chairman Li is my brother.

529
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,079
Wh-what's going on?

530
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,039
Chairman Li, look, you came just in time.

531
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,039
This guy insists he's the Chairman.

532
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,640
Look, we told him to leave, but he won't.

533
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,839
Isn't this holding up the work?

534
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,279
Watch your tone.

535
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,680
This is my Big Bro.

536
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,920
That makes him the Chairman here.

537
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,880
No, no, no... I... I didn't know.

538
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,759
He really is the Chairman.

539
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,880
Chairman, I'm so sorry.

540
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,759
Look at me, failing to recognize someone important.

541
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:44,839
It's... it's fine, it's fine.

542
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,759
Let me shake your hand quickly.

543
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,480
Shake hands, come on, shake hands.

544
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,759
Alright then, get back to work.

545
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:50,359
Go on, get busy.

546
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,480
Look sharp.

547
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,279
The Chairman is here.

548
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,359
Let's talk over here.

549
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,799
Don't disturb their work.

550
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,759
They haven't met you.

551
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,759
Don't take it to heart.

552
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,839
It's fine as long as everyone knows you, Chairman Li.

553
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,640
Chairman...

554
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,920
Are you getting jealous?

555
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,799
No more joking around.

556
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,640
Let me tell you something.

557
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,759
This renovation is a big deal.

558
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,279
It sure is.

559
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,680
The other day, that fool Yang

560
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,000
tried to pull strings with me.

561
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,079
I didn't agree to it.

562
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,519
Look, these past couple days I've been around the Beijing market,

563
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,559
checking things out.

564
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,039
I think there are a few styles

565
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,880
Look at this one.

566
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,599
that would really suit our Peng Le Xuan.

567
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,039
Right? Look at this.

568
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,519
This hallway would be perfect for our hallway.

569
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,400
See, big red lacquered pillars.

570
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,680
This private room...

571
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,000
Later, when we clear out the room

572
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,799
your sister-in-law and I use,

573
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,559
we can do this.

574
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,039
Well, Big Bro...

575
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,480
This is too traditional, it won't work.

576
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,880
No, but our Peng Le Xuan *is* a century-old brand.

577
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,799
Shouldn't we go for this traditional vibe then?

578
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,359
No, that still won't do.

579
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
No, take another look.

580
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,319
Take a look at this instead.

581
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,039
Big Bro.

582
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,240
I was just about to talk to you about the renovation.

583
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,759
I know a company

584
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,119
that's renovated lots of restaurants.

585
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,240
Their work is excellent.

586
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
They have a great reputation in the industry.

587
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,240
Most importantly,

588
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,759
they can give us a huge discount.

589
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,839
No, so what are you saying?

590
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,240
It's not that I...

591
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,240
Big Bro!

592
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,559
Second Brother!

593
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,000
Qiu'er!

594
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,759
Quitting time!

595
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,880
Off work, off work, time to go!

596
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Second Brother, I need to talk to you about something.

597
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:11,759
What is it?

598
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:12,839
Well...

599
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,640
Can you reimburse these receipts for me?

600
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,279
What are these?

601
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,119
Look here.

602
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:23,319
Th-this is the meal expense for treating colleagues.

603
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,119
Buying things for colleagues, right? This is the gift expense.

604
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,319
Right? There's so much here.

605
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,039
You have to reimburse me.

606
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,000
No, colleagues?

607
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,119
What colleagues?

608
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:37,000
Colleagues from the Mentougou Bank.

609
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,480
It's not that you...

610
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,759
You're expanding business,

611
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:40,759
but not like this.

612
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:41,759
This Mentougou

613
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,000
is dozens of kilometers from here.

614
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,400
How does expanding there help our Peng Le Xuan?

615
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,400
What good does it do for Peng Le Xuan?

616
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,079
Well, when I treat people to meals,

617
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,319
they post about it on social media.

618
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,119
Doesn't that indirectly promote us too?

619
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:52,759
Right?

620
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,000
No, Qiu'er.

621
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,000
Expanding business is a good thing.

622
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,920
But these colleagues of yours...

623
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,039
Are you discussing bank business

624
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,359
or our restaurant's business?

625
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,079
Can't it be both at once?

626
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:04,880
Besides,

627
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,839
it's all interconnected.

628
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,319
But you can't put it that way.

629
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,119
We're running a proper business now.

630
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,359
So, for reimbursements,

631
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,559
there must be clear rules and regulations.

632
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,599
This matter won't pass with me.

633
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,000
The Chairman won't approve this either.

634
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,240
So, receipts like this...

635
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,680
don't bring them for reimbursement anymore.

636
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You... you...

637
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,559
You... you... then you...

638
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,000
No, Second Brother.

639
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,839
The kid's already spent the money.

640
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,039
Just don't let it happen again.

641
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,559
You're the Chairman now.

642
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:31,480
You can't handle things this way now.

643
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,440
No, then how about this.

644
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,640
I'm not the Chairman right now.

645
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,839
I, I, I... I, Wang Chunsheng...

646
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,839
Qiu'er, this money...

647
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,160
Big Bro will reimburse you.

648
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:40,920
Really.

649
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,279
I'll pay you back personally, okay?

650
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,319
But next time, don't let it happen again.

651
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,640
Don't let it happen again, don't let it happen.

652
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,279
This can't be right.

653
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,160
You mean well, right?

654
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,559
Come on.

655
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,039
Come on, come on.

656
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:56,960
Let me propose the first toast.

657
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,799
Come on, come on.

658
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,640
You've worked hard, really hard.

659
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,240
You're too kind.

660
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,000
Thank you, thank you. Come on.

661
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,400
Eat more. Order more if it's not enough.

662
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,640
It's my treat today.

663
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,759
No, no, Dayong.

664
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,359
Let me tell you.

665
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,519
I'm paying today.

666
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,279
You're all here for my sake.

667
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,519
I'm settling the bill today.

668
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,519
Don't you dare fight me for it.

669
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,319
Dayong fights for it so fiercely every time.

670
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,000
Last time he almost broke my arm.

671
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,119
I'm buying this time.

672
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,519
Great! Old Wang is really impressive, so generous.

673
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,279
Come on, come on.

674
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,759
No wonder he's the Chairman.

675
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,559
Eat the meat, eat up.

676
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,759
What Chairman...

677
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,519
Today we're drinking this fine liquor.

678
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:31,680
Blue Flower Twenty, over three hundred a bottle.

679
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,240
Great.

680
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,920
Drink more.

681
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,759
Drink more, drink up.

682
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:34,519
This is good liquor.

683
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,519
Here, eat the meat, eat up. Come on.

684
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,160
What were you saying just now?

685
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,359
My Brother Wang...

686
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,000
he's no ordinary man.

687
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,960
Look at my Brother Wang's face.

688
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,200
That's not the face of an ordinary man.

689
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,759
Yeah.

690
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,960
Thick brows, big eyes, majestic.

691
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,880
Look at Brother Wang's forehead wrinkles.

692
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,160
You could twist them into the character 'Wang'.

693
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,799
Sister Yan is such a talker.

694
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,000
If a man like him doesn't get rich...

695
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,680
who would?

696
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,440
Exactly.

697
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,519
I just love listening to Sister Yan talk.

698
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:04,920
Come on, come on. Sister Yan, I toast you.

699
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,440
Come on, come on.

700
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,160
I toast you, Brother Wang.

701
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,240
Together, together.

702
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,759
Sister Yan, Sister Yan, you're my sister.

703
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,599
Come on, come on.

704
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,519
Wishing Brother Wang daily riches, a flood of wealth.

705
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,039
Thank you, thank you.

706
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,119
Here, Sister, come on.

707
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:15,839
Here.

708
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:20,839
Old Wang.

709
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,640
I've been supplying vegetables to your family for over a decade.

710
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,119
Your roast duck restaurant is getting bigger and bigger.

711
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,880
Don't forget your old brother now.

712
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,720
Wouldn't dream of it.

713
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,119
Our family's vegetables...

714
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,720
starting today...

715
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,319
will continue to be supplied by all of you.

716
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,200
Mainly because we've known each other so many years.

717
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
I trust you all, right?

718
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Your business is getting bigger, right?

719
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,119
Us brothers and sisters...

720
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,599
you gotta look out for us.

721
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,599
Must look out for you.

722
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,079
But, I have one more thing to say.

723
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,400
I have to say 'but'.

724
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,119
It's that we...

725
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,599
there's this group of people, right?

726
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:56,359
We have to decide this matter together.

727
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,599
There are other shareholders, right?

728
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,319
I know, I know.

729
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,640
I'm all prepared.

730
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,640
These two bottles of fine liquor...

731
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,160
help me give them to Chairman Li.

732
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,440
I can't get a word in with him.

733
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,640
Put in a good word for me.

734
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,519
His word carries weight, doesn't it?

735
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,960
Bro, Bro.

736
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,640
Aren't you about to renovate?

737
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,720
My nephew runs a building materials factory.

738
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,119
I don't know Chairman Li either.

739
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,440
Talk to Chairman Li.

740
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,319
Get his supplies from us.

741
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:20,880
What's this?

742
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,640
Do me a favor.

743
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,640
Manager Wang.

744
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,400
I have a fellow townsman.

745
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,519
He's worked as a chef.

746
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:28,640
I'd like to ask you...

747
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,720
to say a few words to that Chairman Li.

748
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,640
I'd appreciate your trouble.

749
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,400
Brother Wang, Brother Wang.

750
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,880
Does Chairman Li need any waitstaff?

751
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,160
Old Wang.

752
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,880
For plates, bowls, and chopsticks...

753
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,359
I have wholesale channels.

754
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,640
You, please invite Chairman Li to inspect my place anytime.

755
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm counting on you for this.

756
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,400
Brother Wang, I'm counting on you.

757
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,079
Alright.

758
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,319
Come on, come on. A toast to you, a toast.

759
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,079
This liquor is good.

760
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,559
This fine liquor is seven hundred a bottle.

761
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,519
Isn't it because Chairman Li is in charge?

762
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,319
For this liquor...

763
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,960
A toast to you, a toast, a toast.

764
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,839
Come on, come on.

765
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:05,519
Drink, drink up.

766
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,720
Eat the meat, eat up.

767
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,359
Come on, come on.

768
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,519
Eat the meat, eat, eat.

769
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,119
Eat.

770
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:15,960
Eat more.

771
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,920
I'm ready.

772
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Have you decided?

773
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,319
Pleasure doing business.

774
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
How much have you drunk?

775
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,839
Keep your voice down.

776
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:56,599
I need to pee.

777
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:57,319
Shoes, shoes.

778
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,720
I'm going to the bathroom, you...

779
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,519
I told you not to drink, not to drink.

780
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,000
You had to drink so much.

781
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,119
Why didn't you flush after using the toilet?

782
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,720
I didn't pee.

783
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,880
I can't pee.

784
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,319
Keep it down.

785
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:41,400
What's with the drunken tantrum?

786
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,200
Feifei is sleeping here.

787
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,839
What Chairman?

788
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,359
It's just a title in name only.

789
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,319
Now I can't even roast ducks anymore.

790
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,200
I've given up my shops to them too.

791
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,000
When they needed me, they were all over me.

792
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,519
Now they don't need me anymore.

793
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,480
What do they take me for?

794
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,079
Keep your voice down.

795
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,319
If you keep this up, you'll throw up.

796
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,000
You're here, right here.

797
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,960
When I go to the bathroom, it acts up again.

798
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,480
Quiet.

799
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,079
Just stand there a bit longer.

800
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,319
Useless.

801
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,559
Alright.

802
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,559
First, I need to infiltrate Peng Le Xuan.

803
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Get back inside.

804
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,000
A Trojan Horse.

805
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:18,239
Indeed, that's a good move.

806
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,079
My dad, this Chairman...

807
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,599
He's not happy with the position now either.

808
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,679
He was complaining to my mom after drinking yesterday.

809
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,840
Said Second Uncle has sidelined him now.

810
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
No one listens to him.

811
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,519
And no one takes him seriously.

812
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:31,519
When you go back...

813
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,159
Continue to reinforce that feeling for him.

814
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,679
Make him clearly understand...

815
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,519
...that he's just a puppet in Peng Le Xuan.

816
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,159
Let me think.

817
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Go back and tell him this.

818
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay?

819
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,280
Sure.

820
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,559
Good.

821
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,119
Alright.

822
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:49,519
Bye.

823
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,079
Bye.

824
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,360
And then?

825
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,000
To dispel their suspicions...

826
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,440
...I'll spread the word.

827
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,199
Say I've become disheartened.

828
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,719
And will leave Beijing.

829
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,679
Wait, wait a second.

830
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,679
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

831
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,440
I mean...

832
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:10,199
Sold? You sold it just like that?

833
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:11,320
Sold.

834
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,519
How much for?

835
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,519
Fifty thousand.

836
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,000
Fifty thousand? Only fifty thousand?

837
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,519
That was a Taihu Lake stone!

838
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,280
From Taihu Lake.

839
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,159
Wow, just like that...

840
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,800
...you've downgraded from a Mercedes to a minivan.

841
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,400
What a shame.

842
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,400
Anyway, after I leave...

843
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,519
...no one will like that thing anyway.

844
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:27,519
Might as well sell it.

845
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
What are you playing with?

846
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,800
Ants.

847
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,519
Such a huge ant.

848
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:35,519
Does it bite?

849
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:36,360
It bites bad people.

850
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,840
Again.

851
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,000
I need an informant.

852
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:46,400
To keep an eye on their internal movements at all times.

853
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,719
Morning.

854
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:05,480
Morning.

855
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:05,960
Brush your teeth.

856
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,000
I think what you said last time...

857
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,159
...was quite reasonable.

858
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,400
Finally said something sensible.

859
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,320
I want to give them another chance.

860
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,000
Back to talking nonsense.

861
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,159
Then I won't say anything.

862
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,360
Why are you so irritable?

863
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,000
Speak.

864
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,800
I want to rejoin them.

865
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,559
But I can't just join like that.

866
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,039
I want them to invite me back.

867
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,159
What?

868
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,960
So I'd like to ask for your help.

869
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,519
Help me gather some information.

870
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,519
And some of their behind-the-scenes moves.

871
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:45,800
And their future plans.

872
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,960
Why should I help you?

873
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,519
Last time I asked you to help me saw some wood...

874
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,599
...I talked until I was blue in the face.

875
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,280
Just consider it as me owing you a favor.

876
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,519
I've thought it over...

877
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,840
...and only you can help.

878
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,519
Fine.

879
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,400
That's the only pleasant thing you've said.

880
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,559
Thanks.

881
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,119
Have another bowl.

882
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,119
No more.

883
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,760
Drank so much yesterday.

884
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,880
Millet porridge is good for the stomach.

885
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,599
Where'd you go?

886
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,679
Went for a run.

887
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,719
Hurry up and eat.

888
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,559
I'm back.

889
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:38,840
Dad.

890
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,079
Today I heard people in the alley saying...

891
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,719
...that you gave our Peng Le Xuan to Second Uncle for free.

892
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,760
Nonsense! Who said that?

893
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:48,960
Everyone's saying it.

894
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,400
I don't know exactly who.

895
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,159
But basically they're saying...

896
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,639
...the person really running Peng Le Xuan now is Second Uncle.

897
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,400
They say you're just a, you know...

898
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,400
What?

899
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:03,880
A mascot.

900
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,440
Who said that?

901
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,119
Everyone says so.

902
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,079
That's ridiculous.

903
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,559
So what if I'm a mascot?

904
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,599
I've worked hard for so many years.

905
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,920
Shouldn't I take a break?

906
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,599
That's true.

907
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,599
You really can take a good rest now.

908
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,880
But the main thing they say is...

909
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,239
...that Dad is nominally the Big Bro of Peng Le Xuan...

910
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,039
...but in reality, Peng Le Xuan's...

911
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,079
...real Big Bro...

912
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,400
...has always been Second Uncle.

913
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,599
Now, whenever something happens...

914
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,639
...people go to Second Uncle.

915
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,760
They say going to Second Uncle works.

916
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,719
Coming to you is useless.

917
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,599
What do you know, you little brat?

918
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,920
Finish your meal quickly and go study.

919
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,679
Your Second Uncle has listened to me since he was little, right?

920
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,440
His meaning is my meaning.

921
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,079
My meaning is his meaning.

922
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,239
I understand that.

923
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,880
Dad, being this mascot...

924
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,960
...is actually really not easy.

925
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,119
People all say...

926
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,000
...you look bitter and resentful every day.

927
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,159
That's not very auspicious.

928
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,119
You need to practice more, right?

929
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,440
Mom, what do you think?

930
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,800
Such a small matter

931
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,280
I refuse to believe I can't do it well.

932
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,199
Where are you going before finishing your porridge?

933
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,360
I'm just tidying up.

934
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,039
I'm going out for a walk.

935
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,360
Finish eating quickly and go study.

936
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,519
I'm off.

937
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,000
Have you heard?

938
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,320
Weiguo is in trouble.

939
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,679
He's so poor he's started selling off his family assets.

940
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,559
Uncle Sun

941
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,679
Old Sun

942
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,360
Come here.

943
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,199
Have you heard?

944
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:38,639
What is it?

945
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,119
That guy can't stay in Beijing anymore.

946
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,960
He owes several hundred million.

947
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,119
This is quite a spectacle.

948
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,559
Hundreds of millions. A huge sum.

949
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:46,880
You're busy, you're busy.

950
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,639
Have you heard?

951
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,159
What is it?

952
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:51,119
The international police have even issued a Red Notice.

953
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:51,599
Yeah.

954
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,519
They're hunting him all over the world.

955
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:55,559
They say if they can't catch him alive,

956
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,679
they'll take him dead.

957
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:57,599
Then what can he do?

958
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,039
He can't stay in Beijing.

959
00:39:59,039 --> 00:39:59,320
Right.

960
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,199
Go back to the US?

961
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,199
He wouldn't dare.

962
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:01,800
Exactly.

963
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,199
So what then? Where can he run?

964
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,320
I heard

965
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,559
he's planning to flee to Russia.

966
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,639
To Russia?

967
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,440
Yes.

968
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,360
Interpol,

969
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,719
Red Notice,

970
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,480
fleeing to Russia.

971
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,280
If the story is like this,

972
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,760
that's really beyond ridiculous.

973
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,079
Alright, you old folks,

974
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:21,880
stop talking nonsense.

975
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,039
Go do what you're supposed to do.

976
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,199
Old Wang, look around freely.

977
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,800
Everything is fresh.

978
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:29,559
Look how beautiful these tomatoes are.

979
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,119
Just picked.

980
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,159
Just delivered this morning.

981
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,960
Here, this one, this is very fresh.

982
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,639
Let me hold it for you.

983
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,079
No, no, no.

984
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,079
Don't get in the shot.

985
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:40,199
Feel free to film, go ahead.

986
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,639
It's crisp, this one.

987
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:43,719
Look at this, this Chinese toon.

988
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,719
In season.

989
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,559
It's especially delicious when stir-fried.

990
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,400
Not bad, not bad.

991
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,519
The lighting is good here.
