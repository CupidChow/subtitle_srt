1
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,920
Mom

2
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,319
You haven't been sleeping well these past few days either.

3
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,879
Go inside and rest for a bit.

4
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,319
I'm fine, don't worry.

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,079
Your dad's illness...

6
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,840
I've been mentally prepared for it for a long time.

7
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,240
These past few days,

8
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,560
you've all worked so hard.

9
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,759
Running around, busy with everything.

10
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,039
Busy with your dad's funeral arrangements.

11
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,479
Now it's finally all done.

12
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,479
You should all go back and get some rest.

13
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:40,039
It's okay, we'll keep you company.

14
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,039
Xiaoshi,

15
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,080
take Qiu'er back home.

16
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,120
Take him out to get some fresh air.

17
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,960
You all should go.

18
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520
Go on.

19
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,240
Go back home.

20
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
I also need

21
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,280
some peace and quiet.

22
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,639
Later, let's bring Mom over to live with us.

23
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,120
It'll be easier to take care of her.

24
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,960
My mom definitely can't bear to leave my dad.

25
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,199
When we get home, you go up first.

26
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,879
I'm not comfortable leaving her alone either.

27
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,040
Stay with her for a few days.

28
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,839
Okay.

29
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,839
If anything comes up with Mom, let me know anytime.

30
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,439
Rather than saying we, father and son, got this illness,

31
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,439
it's more like fate

32
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,120
gave us a chance to be reborn again.

33
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,120
Uncle Tong is seventy this year, right?

34
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,240
Sixty-nine.

35
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,000
Uncle Tong, let me ask you.

36
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,199
How many complete screenplays can you still write?

37
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
Weiguo, let's not talk about this, let's eat.

38
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,079
But if this story

39
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,199
is the last screenplay you ever write,

40
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,759
would you be content with that?

41
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
Sometimes when your vision is elevated,

42
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,920
you can look down.

43
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,720
But if you're standing at the base of a building,

44
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,160
you don't necessarily have to know

45
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,199
what the top looks like, right?

46
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,959
You think you're all prepared,

47
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
kid.

48
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,839
You're not at that stage yet.

49
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,199
Death

50
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,160
is truly terrifying.

51
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,600
It's better to be alive.

52
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,319
Isn't that right?

53
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,319
These two sentences

54
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,600
are our mutual encouragement, father and son.

55
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,439
Son,

56
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,639
do you remember

57
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,360
that scar on your dad's head?

58
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,040
He said he got it in a fight, right?

59
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,639
He lied to you.

60
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,759
Actually,

61
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,319
when he was little,

62
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,279
your grandpa kicked him.

63
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,399
At that time,

64
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,759
your dad's head

65
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,000
hit the corner of a table.

66
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,759
It made a big gash.

67
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,120
The blood was gushing out.

68
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,039
So when you were little,

69
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,159
no matter how much you acted up,

70
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,840
he never once hit you.

71
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
At most, he'd yell at you a couple times.

72
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,000
He said

73
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,440
he absolutely could not be like your grandpa,

74
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,879
taking his anger out on the child at the drop of a hat.

75
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,840
But there was just one time,

76
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,519
just one time.

77
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,519
That year,

78
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,159
he won a

79
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,639
screenplay award.

80
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,399
After he got the trophy,

81
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,279
he was overjoyed.

82
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,639
Even when sleeping,

83
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,279
he would place it

84
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,960
between the two of us.

85
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,240
Then,

86
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,919
it turned out

87
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,919
you broke it.

88
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,720
He was really angry.

89
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,000
He raised his hand to hit you.

90
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,679
But in the end, he didn't strike.

91
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,000
He told me later,

92
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,519
"What's wrong with me?

93
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,360
Just because of a trophy,

94
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,240
I thought about hitting my child."

95
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,360
From then on,

96
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,360
he put that trophy away.

97
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,960
He never took it out again.

98
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,799
From now on, your symptoms

99
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,639
will definitely become more and more obvious.

100
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,519
Why did you wait until now to come?

101
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,200
You've already missed the optimal time for surgery.

102
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,039
Having surgery now

103
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,919
carries too high a risk.

104
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,200
By the way,

105
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,480
where is your family?

106
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,600
Do you remember what Mom said?

107
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,360
I remember.

108
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,519
Dad.

109
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,440
Yuanyuan!

110
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,039
I missed you so much!

111
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,279
Jenny has had a bit of an upset stomach these past couple days.

112
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,679
Don't let her eat random stuff.

113
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,039
I put her homework in her bag.

114
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,039
Remember to have her finish it.

115
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,200
The piano lesson is at two this afternoon.

116
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,879
It's really hard to park at Teacher Li's place.

117
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,759
Head over there early.

118
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,039
Don't make her late for class.

119
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,039
Alright, do you really need to teach me these things?

120
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,200
Yuanyuan, let's go.

121
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,759
Bye, Mom!

122
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,200
And Uncle Kevin too!

123
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,360
Bye-bye!

124
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:09,720
Get in the car.

125
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,000
Who is it?

126
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,960
You look a bit worn out.

127
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,559
It's nothing.

128
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,960
I want to take two picture frames to the shop to try them out.

129
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,519
This early?

130
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,480
Later, the shop will be crowded.

131
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,559
Then I'll get ready and go with you.

132
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,480
It's fine, take your time.

133
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,720
Darn it, I'll go get them now.

134
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,960
I've been thinking,

135
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,919
it's better to sell the apartment on the Third Ring Road first.

136
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,759
The one on the Fifth Ring is too big.

137
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,679
It won't sell easily.

138
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,039
Brother Liu, keep an eye on this matter.

139
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,080
If you have any news, just tell me.

140
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,279
Alright, alright, no problem.

141
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,960
Dad.

142
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,840
What's up?

143
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,840
I need to use the bathroom.

144
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,360
Then wait a moment.

145
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,399
Let me find a restroom.

146
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,679
Brother Liu, don't hang up yet.

147
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,320
Yuanyuan, come here.

148
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,759
Take it easy.

149
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,000
You're going by yourself?

150
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,200
Brother Liu, go on, please.

151
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,960
This matter can be discussed.

152
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,679
Right now, I have...

153
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,840
...some stocks and investments.

154
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,679
There's no other way.

155
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,679
So we'll just have to take the loss.

156
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,879
We'll earn it back later.

157
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,600
If he asks, you tell him.

158
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,039
If he doesn't ask, don't mention it.

159
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,960
Yuanyuan, hurry.

160
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,679
Close the door yourself.

161
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,440
I'm fine.

162
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,279
Dad, wait for me.

163
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,120
I'll get you a bottle of water.

164
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,919
Dad! Dad!

165
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,279
I think this matter can be discussed.

166
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,840
Alright, Brother Liu.

167
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,639
We should really talk in person.

168
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,679
Let me take Yuanyuan home first.

169
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,159
Yuanyuan, something just came up for Dad.

170
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,559
I need to take you home first.

171
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:02,919
Yuanyuan?

172
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,279
Yuanyuan!

173
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,119
How's it going?

174
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,960
Watch your hands.

175
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,720
It's fine.

176
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,880
What's wrong with you?

177
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,519
You seem a bit off.

178
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:38,839
It's nothing.

179
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,279
I want to help you finish this quickly.

180
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,279
There's still a lot left.

181
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,920
No rush, we can take our time.

182
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,599
What do you mean no rush?

183
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,119
If I don't help you finish in time,

184
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,519
you'll say I went back on my word again.

185
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,839
How could I?

186
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,599
Are you tired?

187
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,400
Take a break, I'll handle it.

188
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,839
No need, you go do your thing.

189
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,519
No, I think it's kind of fun.

190
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,599
I want to give it a try too.

191
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,119
Here, let me do it.

192
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,920
Are you hungry?

193
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,400
Do you want to go eat?

194
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,440
I'm not hungry.

195
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,519
You rest, I'll take over.

196
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,720
Then I'll go buy you something to eat.

197
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:39,640
Yuanyuan?

198
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,839
Dad?

199
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,799
Yuanyuan!

200
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
Where did you go?

201
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,079
Didn't I tell you...

202
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,559
...not to run off?

203
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,480
I'm sorry, Dad.

204
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,319
I wanted to find you a bottle of water in the back.

205
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
I'm sorry.

206
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,440
It's Dad's fault.

207
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,720
It's Dad's fault.

208
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,920
Dad...

209
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,880
I know you're busy with work.

210
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,279
But I knew you'd come back for me.

211
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,200
So I waited right here for you.

212
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,599
I'm sorry.

213
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,839
It's Dad's fault.

214
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,079
I shouldn't have left you behind.

215
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,960
Dad...

216
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,599
I'm sorry.

217
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,240
Auntie Tong, are you home?

218
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,039
Coming!

219
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,519
Oh, Chunsheng.

220
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,000
Auntie.

221
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,640
I made you some dinner.

222
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,039
Eat it while it's hot.

223
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,559
These are groceries I bought for you.

224
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,799
I'll put them in the fridge.

225
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,119
Later on,

226
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,559
if you feel like cooking, go ahead.

227
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,559
If you don't, just let me know.

228
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:48,960
I'll come over and cook for you.

229
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,720
Chunsheng, have some water, rest a bit.

230
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,240
No, no, I should head back.

231
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,559
Everything's alright?

232
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,359
What's wrong? Is something up?

233
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:06,279
Find some time to call Qiu'er.

234
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,920
He's busy all day, who knows with what.

235
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,039
He leaves before dawn.

236
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,240
By night, when I'm asleep,

237
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,920
he still isn't back.

238
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,119
I don't see him all day.

239
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,680
Well... what's he so busy with?

240
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,799
I know what's on his mind.

241
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,759
He's afraid to face people.

242
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,519
That other home of his...

243
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,799
He hasn't been back in a long time.

244
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,799
Xiaoshi came looking for him,

245
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,519
and he hid from her too.

246
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:40,759
It's okay, Auntie.

247
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:41,799
Don't you worry about it.

248
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,799
I'll call him later and ask.

249
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:45,799
Alright.

250
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,160
Okay then, I'm off.

251
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,480
You... you stay inside.

252
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,319
Take care.

253
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,039
It's fine.

254
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,000
Qiu'er, what have you been up to lately?

255
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,559
Come by our place sometime.

256
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,319
I'll fry up some ribbonfish for you.

257
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,519
We'll have a drink.

258
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:07,880
Get back to me.

259
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,039
Hello, the last four digits are...

260
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,279
six-zero-six-six.

261
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,000
Isn't this my brother Tong?

262
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,400
I thought your car looked familiar from a distance.

263
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,119
How come you're driving a ride-hailing car now?

264
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,319
Yeah, that's right.

265
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,559
Just convenient.

266
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,279
Pick up rides to earn some gas money.

267
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,680
You've been picking up quite a few rides, huh?

268
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,759
You've got a lot of free time.

269
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,319
Let's just follow the GPS, okay?

270
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,000
Fine.

271
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,799
We're still fated to meet, aren't we?

272
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,960
You got fired from your job,

273
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,880
and I still run into you when I hail a cab.

274
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,799
Fasten your seatbelt, thank you.

275
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,559
Driver Tong.

276
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,240
Roll the window up.

277
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,039
It's freezing.

278
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,720
I'm cold too.

279
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,359
But the smell on you is too strong.

280
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,680
Watch your mouth.

281
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,039
Mind your service attitude.

282
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,400
I'll file a complaint against you.

283
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,759
Window up.

284
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,559
Driver Tong.

285
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,440
You know, back when you were at the bank,

286
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,480
you were so impressive, right?

287
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,759
Big clients had to suck up to you.

288
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,759
How could you even get fired from the bank?

289
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,000
And now you're driving this ride-hailing car.

290
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,880
Is it hard to find a job?

291
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,119
Please sit properly when you talk.

292
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,240
Alright, I'll sit properly.

293
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,559
And I'll fasten my seatbelt too.

294
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,400
Driver Tong.

295
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,400
Tell me, driving for a month,

296
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,519
how much can you earn?

297
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,119
It must be more than what we made at the bank, right?

298
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,400
Is it enough for your mortgage, to support your family?

299
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,359
That's none of your business.

300
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,799
Speak properly.

301
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,880
Watch your service attitude.

302
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,400
I can complain about this.

303
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,160
Oh, I forgot.

304
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,640
It's Driver Tong.

305
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,799
You own several properties in Beijing, right?

306
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,599
And your wife has a good job.

307
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,519
So you're not short on cash.

308
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,599
You, you...

309
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,319
You've had it easy since birth.

310
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,799
Never had to worry about a thing.

311
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,160
Got everything handed to you, right?

312
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,200
Look at you.

313
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,480
What are you moping about?

314
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,319
Right?

315
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,880
You should smile.

316
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,240
Service with a smile, right?

317
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,599
Fine.

318
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,279
Ignoring me.

319
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,240
You know what I hate most about you?

320
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,799
What I despise the most

321
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,880
is that you always

322
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,559
hide in your own comfort zone.

323
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:11,920
The moment you hit a rough patch,

324
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,160
you just slink away.

325
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,079
And with that, you still think you're my equal?

326
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
What gives you the right?

327
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,920
What did I do?

328
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,720
I spent days and nights with clients,

329
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,680
groveling and sucking up to people.

330
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:28,400
I fought tooth and nail to get where I am today.

331
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,480
And you?

332
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,920
Every step you took was so smooth.

333
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,680
Hit a problem, and you just slink away.

334
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,119
Why?

335
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,000
What gives you the right?

336
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,000
You were born with a house.

337
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,279
And me?

338
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,400
I have to slog away my whole life.

339
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Our family house was sold long ago.

340
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,640
Isn't your wife pregnant?

341
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
Why are you still out here driving?

342
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Hiding from responsibility again, huh?

343
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,400
Unless you messed around with a client,

344
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,440
and your wife found out,

345
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,039
and she kicked you out?

346
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,359
Can you stop pushing your luck?

347
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:26,839
Get out.

348
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,400
What do you mean? I'm not there yet.

349
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,359
I'm not driving anymore. Get out.

350
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,440
Tong Qiu!

351
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,000
I'll report you for refusing service!

352
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,559
Suit yourself.

353
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,400
Get out.

354
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,920
Fine, Tong Qiu.

355
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,640
You're driving a crappy ride-hailing car,

356
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,039
what are you acting so high and mighty for?

357
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,200
You just wait!

358
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,599
You're back.

359
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,960
I'm back.

360
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,680
Why are you back so late?

361
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,799
Yeah.

362
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,440
Wanted to pick up more rides.

363
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,240
Alright, go wash up and eat.

364
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,279
So much food.

365
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,720
All your favorites.

366
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,039
Eat up.

367
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm not hungry either.

368
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,599
The baby and I have been waiting for you all evening.

369
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,920
Let's eat together.

370
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,279
I read a lot of moms sharing today.

371
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,880
They say we need to start nurturing the baby now.

372
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,359
From weeks one to twelve,

373
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,039
it's emotional prenatal education.

374
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Weeks twenty to twenty-three are for language education.

375
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,200
You're so good at telling stories.

376
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,160
From now on,

377
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,000
you can tell the baby a story every day.

378
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,160
I need to discuss something with you.

379
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,240
What is it?

380
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,000
This house and my car,

381
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,480
let's transfer them to your name.

382
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,279
And also my savings,

383
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:12,000
including Weiguo's five hundred thousand,

384
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,720
put it all with you.

385
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,960
You know the bank card PIN too.

386
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,480
What do you mean?

387
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,319
Don't you want to be with me anymore?

388
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,000
No.

389
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,759
No.

390
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:42,599
I'm useless.

391
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,759
I can't provide you any security.

392
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,640
And I can't give the child anything.

393
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,160
I don't even know how I'll be a father.

394
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,119
So I just think,

395
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,680
I should put everything I have

396
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,759
with you.

397
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,319
Maybe then

398
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,119
I can feel

399
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,680
a little more at ease.

400
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,880
Did I put too much pressure on you?

401
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,799
I know you're hurting since Dad passed.

402
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,960
Don't rush.

403
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,200
Let's take it slow.

404
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,200
No.

405
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,119
You've all been more than patient with me.

406
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,519
You... you know what?

407
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:58,480
Today...

408
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,160
It was really coincidental.

409
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,039
While I was driving for fares...

410
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,480
Guess who I ran into?

411
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,440
Jia.

412
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,119
He said something to me.

413
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,119
And I think he was absolutely right.

414
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:15,279
He said, "Tong Qiu...

415
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,799
you're just a loser."

416
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,880
I wanted to argue back right then.

417
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:32,839
But I couldn't.

418
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,720
I think he's right.

419
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,799
I am a loser.

420
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:46,799
A loser.

421
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:52,000
Tong Qiu, you're a loser.

422
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Honey, do you think I...

423
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Tong Qiu.

424
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Mom and I...

425
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,599
...have sorted out the script Dad didn't finish...

426
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,839
...and his earlier notes.

427
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,200
Now we're giving them to you.

428
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,799
Take good care of them.

429
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,240
Dad wanted you to be okay.

430
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,960
You've always listened to him, right?

431
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:24,880
He was falsely accused.

432
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,440
It was probably that Jia guy who did it.

433
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,279
And now he's been bullied by Jia again.

434
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,720
He's been holding in this resentment.

435
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,440
Even though he's stopped talking about the transfer...

436
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,960
...he's still bottling it up, not saying a word.

437
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,279
Big Brother, Sister-in-law...

438
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,119
...please talk to him for me too.

439
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,880
Why isn't this kid answering my calls?

440
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,680
Let me try calling him.

441
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,160
He's not picking up for me either.

442
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:06,000
It's okay, Shi, don't worry just yet.

443
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,519
I'll go find Weiguo.

444
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,679
I'll have him try.

445
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,880
Okay, thank you, Big Brother.

446
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,800
Don't worry.

447
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,920
Let your big brother handle it.

448
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,800
How have you been lately? Doing alright?

449
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,559
I'm managing.

450
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,159
You really mustn't rush things.

451
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,079
Weiguo.

452
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,559
Weiguo.

453
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,400
Weiguo!

454
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
I said, take a break.

455
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,119
Here, have some water. Drink up.

456
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,239
Big Brother, I'm not tired.

457
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,000
I have to finish these few picture frames today.

458
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,880
I have to get them done.

459
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,719
What's going on with him?

460
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,599
Ever since Grandpa Tong passed...

461
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:46,119
...he hasn't been quite himself.

462
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,000
But these past couple days...

463
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,880
...I've been busy with your Uncle Qiu'er's family matters...

464
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,719
...in and out...

465
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,719
...so I didn't notice anything different about him.

466
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,679
He's actually putting on an act.

467
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,880
I think he's really scared.

468
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:03,840
Especially as the surgery gets closer, the more scared he gets.

469
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,119
I'll go over and talk to him.

470
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,320
It's okay, it's okay, Uncle.

471
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,159
Let him have a moment to himself.

472
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,519
I'm here with him, don't you worry.

473
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:14,239
You go ahead and deal with Uncle Qiu'er's stuff.

474
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,360
Alright then. You stay with him a while.

475
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,039
Go on.

476
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,760
Second Brother.

477
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,360
Come see me for a bit.

478
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,000
I have something urgent.

479
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:47,880
Big Brother, I'm a bit tied up here.

480
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,880
I'll come back once I finish this.

481
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,400
Fine, you tend to your business then.

482
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
It'll be done soon.

483
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,719
Do you really plan...

484
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:29,960
...to be a carpenter forever?

485
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,599
If I really do become a carpenter in the future...

486
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,639
...that wouldn't be a bad choice either.

487
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,599
That won't do.

488
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,719
You're so capable.

489
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,039
You can do so many things.

490
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,800
No matter what...

491
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,039
...take your medicine first.

492
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,440
Weren't these just prescribed the day before yesterday?

493
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,840
How come there's not a single pill left?

494
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,199
If you don't want the surgery...

495
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,239
...you don't have to have it.

496
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,480
Isn't that what you wanted?

497
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,119
You saw right through me.

498
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,039
It's not that I don't want it.

499
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,320
It's just that one second...

500
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,199
...I saw Uncle Tong doing fine.

501
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,239
The next second, he was gone.

502
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
You know?

503
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,880
He even helped us pick names.

504
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,239
"Bamboo staff, straw sandals, lighter than a horse."

505
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,280
"In the scent of rice blossoms, speak of a bountiful year."

506
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,000
Qing Nian.

507
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,920
It's a lovely name.

508
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,599
He also told me...

509
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,519
...he still had so many things he wanted to do.

510
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,880
So many people he wanted to see.

511
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,320
Actually, so do I.

512
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,079
I also have many things I want to do.

513
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,320
And many people...

514
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,920
I understand you.

515
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,039
I understand completely.

516
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:55,800
Let's not put so much...

517
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,559
...pressure on ourselves anymore, okay?

518
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,840
And let's not overthink things either.

519
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,679
From now on...

520
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:07,559
...every single day has to be a happy one.

521
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,679
I'll be with you all the way.

522
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,760
No matter the outcome...

523
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,159
Whether it's a year...

524
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,480
...three months...

525
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,199
...or even less time...

526
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,119
...let's not worry.

527
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:29,159
Let's be happy every day.

528
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,239
I promise I'll always be by your side.

529
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,880
Say it.

530
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,599
It'll feel better once you say it.

531
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:57,960
I'm right here.

532
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,239
What's going on here?

533
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:28,320
Weiguo, he...

534
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,920
...doesn't seem right.

535
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,880
What do you mean, not right?

536
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,719
He's wearing his glasses.

537
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,800
This is what the doctor said...

538
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,119
...about something pressing on his...

539
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,239
...optic nerve.

540
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,360
It's pressing on the optic nerve.

541
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,079
What do we do then?
