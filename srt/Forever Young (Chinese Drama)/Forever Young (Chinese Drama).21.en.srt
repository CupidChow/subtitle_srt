1
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,239
You're a girl.

2
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,239
Can't you be a bit more reserved?

3
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,879
I want to help you.

4
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,400
If you want to help me, stay away from me.

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,359
Stop following me around.

6
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,120
Ma Weiguo, you don't have much time.

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
You need to come with me to see a doctor, now.

8
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,400
Do you like me or something?

9
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,079
What? What did you say?

10
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,560
If you're not serious...

11
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,519
...then stay away from me.

12
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,519
Stop following me.

13
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,760
Otherwise, people might get the wrong idea.

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,480
You know?

15
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,199
So what if they misunderstand?

16
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,280
Let them misunderstand.

17
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,360
Just stop following me.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,719
Director Dong came to pick you up personally?

19
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,400
The meeting starts in ten minutes.

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
You still have a chance.

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,759
Do you want me to look over your proposal?

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,120
No.

23
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,639
That confident, huh?

24
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,560
What took you so long?

25
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,959
How did it go?

26
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
It didn't work out.

27
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,519
You...

28
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,000
...are too proud for your own good.

29
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,240
I told you I'd help you.

30
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
But you just had to refuse.

31
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,000
Alright, let's not talk about this.

32
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Let's eat first.

33
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,120
You still have an appetite?

34
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,439
This morning you promised me...

35
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,439
...it was definitely going to work.

36
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,920
You even said we'd come here to celebrate.

37
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,120
And now? Nothing worked out.

38
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,399
Li Lianbao!

39
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,240
Are you... are you messing with me?

40
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,600
You're messing with me, aren't you?

41
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,399
Ow, ow, ow!

42
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,240
What kind of time is this?

43
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
And you have the nerve to mess with me?

44
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,319
I've been worried sick here!

45
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,240
Waiter!

46
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,319
You can serve the meal I ordered.

47
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,000
No, tell me quickly.

48
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,240
How did the talk go?

49
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,759
We're still talking about it?

50
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,439
We talked all afternoon.

51
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,680
Look at this elegant setting.

52
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,519
Such a romantic atmosphere.

53
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,120
Can we not talk about work?

54
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,319
Sir, the red wine you ordered.

55
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,959
To our pleasant cooperation.

56
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,319
Cheers.

57
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,399
Hey, why aren't you drinking?

58
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,600
I have gout, you know.

59
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,680
I better not drink.

60
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,319
I'll toast with water.

61
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,480
To a smooth partnership.

62
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,959
Well, in that case, I won't drink either.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
That won't do.

64
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,160
This is such a day for celebration.

65
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,519
How can you not drink?

66
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,319
Fine, I'll drink.

67
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,759
Bottoms up.

68
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,160
You're only drinking that much?

69
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,439
That's not acceptable.

70
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,800
You should at least finish that.

71
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,519
Wait a minute.

72
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,879
You're drinking water, I'm drinking wine.

73
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,600
Why should I have to finish mine right away?

74
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,399
It's different.

75
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,240
Isn't this a happy occasion?

76
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,879
So I think your first glass...

77
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,120
...must be finished.

78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,160
I see you're quite the smooth talker.

79
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,839
Down the hatch, down the hatch.

80
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,600
That's more like it.

81
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
Here, let me pour you another.

82
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,160
Slow down, don't pour so much.

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,240
You're not even drinking.

84
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,120
Just pour it first.

85
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,800
Hey, you...

86
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,959
...you're not up to something again, are you?

87
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,439
Me?

88
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,439
What could I possibly be up to?

89
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,759
Come on, eat something.

90
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,480
What did you want to tell me?

91
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,439
Nothing.

92
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,480
I just wanted to tell you...

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,160
...that I like you.

94
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,680
And...

95
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,560
...I've liked you since the first time I saw you.

96
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,279
I never thought I'd see you again.

97
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,159
Even though you've said nothing...

98
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,759
...I can see it in your eyes.

99
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,919
You must have many stories about Beijing.

100
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,799
And I can also feel...

101
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,720
...that you like me too.

102
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,399
You still don't understand men.

103
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,200
You're the one who's not being honest.

104
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,759
You're not facing your own feelings.

105
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,440
You always pretend to be so strong.

106
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,919
But in my eyes...

107
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,600
...you've always been a coward.

108
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,039
Over twenty years ago...

109
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,399
...you had a falling out with your brothers.

110
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,919
So you ran off abroad.

111
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,240
More than twenty years later...

112
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,039
...you got sick and ran back here.

113
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,840
Pretending...

114
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,919
...you're above fighting the illness.

115
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,320
And right now, at this moment...

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,039
...you still want to run away.

117
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,159
I think you overestimate yourself.

118
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,919
Don't kid yourself so much.

119
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,519
Is that so?

120
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,080
Yes.

121
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I said...

122
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,200
...starting tonight...

123
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,279
...I won't care about you anymore.

124
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,600
Do whatever you want.

125
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,200
And me saying I'm going back is a lie too.

126
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,039
I won't...

127
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,840
...run away just because my confession failed.

128
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,639
Chinese.

129
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,080
Chinese.

130
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,440
What a coincidence, running into you again.

131
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,759
Over twenty years ago...

132
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,360
...you had a falling out with your brothers.

133
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,840
So you ran off abroad.

134
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,360
And right now, at this moment...

135
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,120
...you still want to run away.

136
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,159
Give it to me.

137
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,000
What?

138
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,200
Your car keys.

139
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,960
I'll drive you.

140
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,960
No need, I'll just get a designated driver.

141
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
That won't do.

142
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
You've been drinking, and you're a woman.

143
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,720
It's not safe.

144
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,600
Really, it's fine.

145
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,720
I can just get a driver and go home.

146
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,080
No, no, no, give them to me.

147
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,519
I'll take you.

148
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,960
Get in the car, quick.

149
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,600
I should be more wary of you than anyone else.

150
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,639
Get in. Take it easy.

151
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:32,799
Let me do it.

152
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,320
I remember one time when we were kids.

153
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,480
We went to Houhai together to play.

154
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,200
Big Brother and I...

155
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,360
Weiguo and Qiu'er were having a water fight.

156
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,639
They thought because you were a girl...

157
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,720
They wouldn't let you play.

158
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,080
I saw you...

159
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,720
Crying out of anger on the shore.

160
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,039
I couldn't bring myself to go comfort you then.

161
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,320
Later, I noticed there were lotus flowers on the water.

162
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,480
So I thought, behind the guys' backs...

163
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,639
I'd secretly pick one to give to you.

164
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,840
But you have no idea what happened.

165
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
The surface of the water looked fine.

166
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,600
But underneath, it was full of water weeds.

167
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,480
I had just swum halfway...

168
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,200
When I got tangled in those weeds.

169
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,320
The more I struggled, the deeper I sank.

170
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,000
I was scared to death at the time.

171
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,200
But later on...

172
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,679
When I presented that lotus flower to you...

173
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,120
And I looked at you...

174
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,200
You were smiling so happily.

175
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,840
Then I felt that...

176
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Taking that bit of risk was worth it.

177
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,639
Thinking about it now...

178
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,679
I really must have liked you back then.

179
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,559
So you started having a crush on me when you were little.

180
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,320
You said the first time was an accident.

181
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,840
This time doesn't count, right?

182
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,080
So from now on, can we...

183
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,200
Just be how we were before...

184
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,600
And stay that way in the future?

185
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
What do you mean?

186
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,639
Just like before?

187
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,080
Let's not mention what happened anymore.

188
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,960
You know we're both already quite tired.

189
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,639
I don't want the relationship between us...

190
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,720
To become more complicated.

191
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,480
No, you were the one who initiated it this time.

192
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,480
Then just pretend I was drunk.

193
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,080
But you were sober at the time.

194
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,639
You don't actually want me to take responsibility, do you?

195
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:52,480
I am not that kind of...

196
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,720
Irresponsible scumbag.

197
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,720
Look...

198
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,279
The misunderstanding about the love letter is cleared up.

199
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,639
And now, regarding Peng Le Xuan and your company...

200
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,840
The cooperation deal...

201
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,960
I've resolved that too.

202
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,840
So about the two of us...

203
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
Can't we seriously consider it?

204
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,200
Lianbao.

205
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,960
We've all grown up now.

206
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,960
I think...

207
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,720
The Dong Qian you like...

208
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,960
Is the me from childhood.

209
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,720
Not the me of today.

210
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,679
I can't go back.

211
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,279
And you can't go back either.

212
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,480
It's okay.

213
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,559
These accounts are actually pretty good.

214
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
This kind of video is the hottest right now.

215
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,839
If we want to run this account...

216
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,839
And want it to take off quickly...

217
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,960
Besides combining it with your Duck King persona...

218
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,079
We have to do what they do.

219
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,960
We need to weave in some fun plots.

220
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,640
No, this is too scripted.

221
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,519
Look at this getup...

222
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,480
And the content they're making...

223
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,440
It's just like acting in a skit.

224
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,240
I still want to just honestly...

225
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,079
Record the life inside the Hutongs.

226
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,480
I get that.

227
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,240
But...

228
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,839
If you want to purely record life...

229
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,480
And also want to be like them...

230
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,200
Attracting lots of likes and comments...

231
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,480
That's very hard.

232
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:48,920
No...

233
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,960
The main thing is I really don't like this style, you know?

234
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,599
Understood.

235
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,559
Doesn't Second Uncle know a bit about this?

236
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,160
Ask him.

237
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,359
No, no, asking your Second Uncle is useless.

238
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:56,960
Let me tell you...

239
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,359
Once you mention this to your Second Uncle...

240
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,359
He'll just talk to you about...

241
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,799
How to gain followers...

242
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,799
How to beg for follows...

243
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,000
And begging for likes.

244
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,200
His mind is full of that stuff.

245
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,000
He'll end up brainwashing me, I'm telling you.

246
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,559
Then ask Uncle Qiu'er.

247
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,240
Uncle Qiu'er...

248
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
I'll ask your Uncle Qiu'er.

249
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
He's quite fashionable.

250
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,079
It's not a matter of being fashionable.

251
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,480
It's mainly that if he chats with me...

252
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,200
I can remember a lot of things from the past.

253
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,720
He has some good story points...

254
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,440
Or if we talk about something...

255
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,480
I might recall something useful.

256
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,960
Qiu'er, what are you doing? Are you busy?

257
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,079
If you're not busy...

258
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,720
I'll come over and chat for a bit.

259
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,440
Instant reply.

260
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,000
One word: Busy.

261
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,920
I'll go chat with your Third Uncle then.

262
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,839
Okay.

263
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,480
Go to bed early.

264
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,200
Okay, okay.

265
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,039
You're going now?

266
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,079
I'm going right now.

267
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,720
Alright. I'll do some more research.

268
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Still haven't rested?

269
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,480
I know...

270
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,200
You've always wanted to hold a photography exhibition.

271
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,200
This is a friend of mine.

272
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,319
You can contact him.

273
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,559
He will help you arrange it.

274
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,480
I don't need it.

275
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,599
What is this supposed to be?

276
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,720
You feel sorry for me? Afraid of hurting me?

277
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,839
Want to compensate me?

278
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,440
I don't care what you think.

279
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,039
I just want to help you.

280
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,599
I said, I don't need it.

281
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,680
Don't think just because you're a patient...

282
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
That I won't dare to scold you.

283
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,920
If you really feel guilty...

284
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,200
Then go get treated properly.

285
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,119
I know my own body very well.

286
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,920
Is this illness of mine a common one?

287
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,960
This is cancer. It's brain cancer.

288
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,319
Is it that easy to cure?

289
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,440
All said and done...

290
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,559
You just want to wait for death here.

291
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,720
I am not waiting for death.

292
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,119
Since I came back...

293
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,079
The things I should do, the things I wanted to do...

294
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,039
I have already done them.

295
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,839
It's best to just let nature take its course.

296
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,200
I thank you for your kindness.

297
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,319
But I don't have much time left.

298
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,359
I don't want to live in a pathetic state.

299
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,000
And I don't want others to pity me.

300
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,519
Do you understand what I mean?

301
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,240
I don't understand

302
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:57,960
Wang Esq.

303
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,480
Martin

304
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,720
There's progress on the fund unfreezing.

305
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,680
You need to come back personally to handle it.

306
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,079
When can you come back?

307
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,079
I should be able to return in a few days.

308
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:09,079
Great.

309
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,079
I was afraid you'd say things weren't finished yet

310
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,359
and didn't want to come back.

311
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,359
Things aren't finished.

312
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,680
But

313
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,000
it might not be convenient for me to stay here anymore.

314
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,359
Alright, I'll make arrangements for you.

315
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,440
Thanks.

316
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,559
This Penglexuan is really gaining momentum.

317
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,240
Look at this area.

318
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,720
Is there any chance for us to collaborate?

319
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,319
I gave you a chance before, you didn't want it.

320
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,200
Now it's not so easy.

321
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
A great man doesn't bear grudges against lesser men.

322
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,240
Come on.

323
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:31,839
Come on.

324
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,680
Let's have a drink.

325
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,480
Li Lianbao.

326
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,359
It really is you.

327
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,720
You are?

328
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,960
I'm Xiao Wu, used to follow Brother Ma.

329
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,720
You had a run-in with me before.

330
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,960
What's up?

331
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,559
Want to revisit old scores?

332
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,599
If you say so.

333
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,559
I'll revisit those old scores with you.

334
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,240
People in this world are wicked.

335
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,759
It's really different from when we were kids.

336
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,200
Back then, things were straightforward.

337
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
There weren't so many ill intentions.

338
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,319
That was all just horseplay.

339
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,480
But I lost a brother.

340
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,480
Lianbao.

341
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,519
Let me state upfront,

342
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,920
that day, right off the bat, I got knocked out.

343
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,039
It had nothing to do with me.

344
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,000
Hey, Lianbao.

345
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:30,559
What about that guy, Ma Weiguo?

346
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:33,200
That guy really had your back.

347
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,039
Pretty righteous.

348
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
What do you mean?

349
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:37,799
You...

350
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,319
Back then, Brother Ma liked Dong Qian, right?

351
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,079
Darn it, you had to get so close to Dong Qian.

352
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,759
Brother Ma was determined to find you, you know?

353
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,279
Later, Ma Weiguo

354
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,759
somehow got wind of it.

355
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,359
The guy came by himself.

356
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,000
He came looking for Brother Ma.

357
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,680
Said he wanted to mediate between you.

358
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,400
So that fight was because of me.

359
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,759
Definitely because of you.

360
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,000
That fight happened because of you.

361
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,920
Think about it, he came to see Brother Ma.

362
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,680
Brother Ma was such a jerk.

363
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,119
Grabbed a bottle and smashed it on his head.

364
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,640
This Ma Weiguo,

365
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,000
the guy just took it.

366
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,000
Didn't even blink.

367
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,079
Stunned Brother Ma on the spot.

368
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,279
Then you guys showed up, right?

369
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,079
Darn it, then everyone started brawling.

370
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,839
No one knew who hit who.

371
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,279
To this day, I took that hit

372
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,640
and I don't even know who to blame.

373
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,799
Lianbao, Lianbao.

374
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,759
Look.

375
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,319
Someday when you see your brothers,

376
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,160
let's all get together

377
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,799
and have a proper drink, okay?

378
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:40,519
My treat.

379
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,000
Ma Weiguo,

380
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,279
Big Brother, Lianbao, Qiu'er.

381
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,000
Let's find some time to go out together.

382
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,559
Consider it a team-building trip.

383
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,119
Brothers, I'm sorry.

384
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,519
It seems in this lifetime, I can never face you directly.

385
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,960
Can't be as optimistic as you.

386
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,160
Can't see through everything early like you did.

387
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,599
Accept that I was meant to be ordinary.

388
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,880
Even today,

389
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,599
you're still willing to indulge my affectations.

390
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,640
Even without stopping your complaints.

391
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,920
Thank you.

392
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,960
Qiu'er.

393
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:49,920
Uh, hey.

394
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,359
You, you sit in the front.

395
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,880
I'll sit in the back with Weiguo.

396
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,200
You, sit over there.

397
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,200
Second Brother, don't drive yet.

398
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,119
Here, Weiguo.

399
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,119
Uh, drink this soup first.

400
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,119
No, but...

401
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,200
Big Brother, I've had breakfast.

402
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,880
I can't drink it.

403
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,960
Just drink it if I tell you to.

404
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,599
No, this... I'll give it to the restaurant.

405
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,680
It's a newly developed health tonic soup.

406
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,079
Just consider it taste-testing.

407
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,720
Come on, drink it all.

408
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,119
Alright, I really can't drink anymore.

409
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,160
Don't leave any.

410
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,559
You, drink it all, all of it.

411
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,039
Yeah, just drink it.

412
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,640
See how much Big Brother favors you?

413
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,680
I want to drink it but can't even get any.

414
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,880
You want some? Here, you drink it.

415
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,559
No, no, no.

416
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,200
Stop messing around, will you?

417
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,319
No, if you want to drink it,

418
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,279
I'll make another pot for you later.

419
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,880
This suits his constitution.

420
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,200
Drink it all.

421
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,279
Wait, where are we going?

422
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Drive east, I'll give you directions.

423
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,680
I can't drink anymore, Big Brother.

424
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,440
No, just drink it.

425
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
I made such a big pot.

426
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,039
It was the last batch.

427
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,400
This is all the essence. Hurry up.

428
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,440
Taste-testing this early? My goodness.

429
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,640
Drink it quickly.

430
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,920
Let's leave early. Come on.

431
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,680
Alright, he's drinking too much. Later,

432
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,039
there'll be nowhere to use the bathroom.

433
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,920
That's enough now. It's fine.

434
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Is that okay, Big Brother?

435
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,640
Let's go. Let's get going.

436
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,359
There's still so much left.

437
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,559
That's enough, Big Brother.

438
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,000
Let me help you.

439
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,079
It's fine, I can manage.

440
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,200
Hey, Weiguo.

441
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,640
Let me take that.

442
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:02,960
It's fine.

443
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,079
Why'd you come all the way out here?

444
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:04,680
Not bad.

445
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:06,839
Alright.

446
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,119
Since we're already here.

447
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,119
Penglexuan is about to open too.

448
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,440
Let's just treat it as a team-building event.

449
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:10,759
No, give it to me.

450
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:11,519
And to build up this...

451
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,599
It's fine, we can.

452
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,440
Team spirit.

453
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,000
If it's team-building, couldn't we go to a proper place?

454
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:19,240
What can we even do out here in the middle of nowhere?

455
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,119
No, look, Weiguo's overseas.

456
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,839
He's got a family and a career there, right?

457
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,440
He's taking the time to be with us.

458
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,119
Just go along with what he wants.

459
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,640
Look at that little duckling over there.

460
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,880
Is that a duck? That's a goose.

461
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,920
Stewed goose in an iron pot.

462
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,519
Give me the stuff.

463
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,319
Do you know something?

464
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,759
Weiguo.

465
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
I know you.

466
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,000
No, you're on your own?

467
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Don't tell them.

468
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,839
Keep it a secret for me, okay?

469
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,279
You know, the environment here isn't bad.

470
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,279
Isn't it though?

471
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,480
Weiguo, what's the plan?

472
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,039
Remember?

473
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,440
We all came here when we were kids.

474
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,359
We did?

475
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,440
There used to be a pulley on this well.

476
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:05,960
Right.

477
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:09,079
And there was a swing here, I think.

478
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,440
Remember?

479
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,200
Gouya.

480
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,519
I'm a bit hungry, actually. I'll have some first.

481
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,000
Don't eat it all.

482
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,200
It's for tomorrow.

483
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,359
It won't tear open.

484
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,519
Make some room.

485
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:26,960
Still got some strength.

486
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:27,920
Not bad.

487
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,000
I won't kill you with it.

488
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,079
Let me assign tasks.

489
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,680
Big Brother brings the meat tomorrow.

490
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,720
Weiguo is in charge of drinks.

491
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,559
I'll handle the main food and snacks.

492
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,319
As for the grill and charcoal...

493
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,319
Qiu'er, you can do it.

494
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:41,920
Can do.

495
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,720
Can do.

496
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,440
No, this grill is super heavy.

497
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,599
Qiu'er, can you even carry it?

498
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,160
I can.

499
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,079
Big Brother.

500
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,599
Why do you always side with Qiu'er?

501
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,359
No, he has to carry it.

502
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,839
Fine, I'll carry it.

503
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,519
Big Brother, leave it to me.

504
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,240
You're really something.

505
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,880
Alright.

506
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:55,960
Take it.

507
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,480
Here.

508
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,079
To our spring outing tomorrow.

509
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:00,640
Cheers.

510
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,359
Cheers.

511
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,000
Cheers.

512
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,880
The Four Brothers of Baofang.

513
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,599
The Four Brothers of Baofang.

514
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,720
Invincible throughout the universe.

515
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,720
You're so slow.

516
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,160
Overtaking on the curve.

517
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,279
Where are we?

518
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,799
Is this the place?

519
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,240
How is it?

520
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,400
Nice environment, right?

521
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,000
Darn it.

522
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,440
What's wrong?

523
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,200
What happened?

524
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,720
I mistook the bag with my dad's...

525
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,759
...the board for propping up flowerpots...

526
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:40,920
...for the bag with the grill.

527
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,759
The charcoal?

528
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,000
Didn't bring that either.

529
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,880
You're such an idiot.

530
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,759
You can't even handle such a simple task.

531
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,200
Just stop scolding him.

532
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,240
You too.

533
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,640
You knew he was unreliable.

534
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,839
Yet you still made him carry the grill.

535
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,920
Now you're blaming me?

536
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,160
His stupidity has nothing to do with me.

537
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Your task assignment was unreasonable.

538
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,720
Yesterday you were the one who wanted Qiu'er to carry it.

539
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,480
You said it yourself.

540
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,160
Alright, alright, alright.

541
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,880
We shouldn't have let Qiu'er carry this grill.

542
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,119
Okay, fine, fine.

543
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:02,920
It's fine, it's fine.

544
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,759
Big Brother, why do you always side with Qiu'er?

545
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,200
I don't.

546
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,839
Exactly, he made a mistake and you won't even let us criticize him.

547
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,599
Enough, enough.

548
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,640
I brought barbecue skewers.

549
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,759
Let's head over first.

550
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:11,440
I'll figure out a way to grill them for us later.

551
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,160
Problem solved, right?

552
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,720
Let's go.

553
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,720
It's fine.

554
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,759
Why didn't you bring it?

555
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:16,480
Don't ask me.

556
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:20,160
Why didn't you bring it?

557
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,240
Why ask me? Couldn't you bring it yourself?

558
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,160
It's fine.

559
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,599
Back in the day, you were the clumsy one, the most unreliable.

560
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,640
You have the nerve to talk.

561
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,119
My clumsiness back then, wasn't it because you hit me?

562
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,519
So what if I hit you?

563
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,119
If I hadn't hit you, would you have grown up this big?

564
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:33,680
Satisfied?

565
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,119
But I remember that meal back then...

566
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,240
...we ate it with great relish.

567
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,759
Yeah, it turned out fine in the end.

568
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,079
Let's see who can throw the farthest.

569
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,920
Alright.

570
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,880
Here goes.

571
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,519
Still trying to scare people.

572
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,880
Still warming up.

573
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,680
Let me try.

574
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,480
Come on, one by one.

575
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,519
How about we build a stove with stones?

576
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,960
That's a great idea!

577
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,240
I'll go find some stones.

578
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,240
Then we'll light it with wood.

579
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,920
Big Bro, is this big enough?

580
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,680
No problem.

581
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,680
Is that good?

582
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,799
It's lit! It's lit! It's lit!

583
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,319
Perfect.

584
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,480
Let's put some skewers on first.

585
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,960
Grab something and fan it.

586
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,519
Here, here, here.

587
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,759
Here, take this.

588
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,680
Watch your hands! Watch your hands, Weiguo!

589
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,079
Dig in.

590
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,400
Here.

591
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,519
Here.

592
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,759
You know, this time...

593
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:53,599
This team-building event Weiguo organized is really good.

594
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,920
Qiu'er gathered the firewood.

595
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,000
A few of us built the stone stove.

596
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,359
And Weiguo prepared everything so meticulously.

597
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,599
That's why when the four of us brothers are together...

598
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,440
No matter how big the difficulty...

599
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,359
It's not a problem, you know?

600
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:09,079
Big Bro, what are you doing? What's wrong?

601
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,480
Big Bro, you...

602
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,519
It's just the smoke getting to my eyes.

603
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,639
You... this...

604
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,000
Look, hurry, hurry! Quick, quick!

605
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,320
Let's... let's not just eat.

606
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,360
What do you want to drink?

607
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,440
I brought drinks.

608
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,000
Left them in the car, forgot to bring them.

609
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,440
Alright.

610
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,199
I'll go get them.

611
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,960
Um, I... I'll help you.

612
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,239
Don't you go, I'll go.

613
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,360
When were you planning to tell me?

614
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,960
Were you going to take it to your grave?

615
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,480
So you know too.

616
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,239
I saw Xiao Wu last night.

617
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,079
The former underling of Xue Damazi.

618
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,199
He told me everything.

619
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,880
Oh, it's about that.

620
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,079
What did you think it was?

621
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,440
Nothing.

622
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,679
All these years...

623
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,760
Why couldn't you have told me sooner?

624
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,800
I'm sorry.

625
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,119
Let's not talk about this.

626
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,239
These past years...

627
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,719
I should be the one apologizing to you first.

628
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,199
I... I never knew, really.

629
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,679
We've been competing since we were kids.

630
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,400
No...

631
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,199
It wasn't really a fight.

632
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,320
We just never wanted to lose to the other.

633
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,840
Whether it was grades or playing games...

634
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,079
We always wanted to beat each other.

635
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,159
Including...

636
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,400
That incident with the failed recommendation.

637
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:40,920
I hated you for so many years because of it.

638
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,719
Why... why wouldn't you tell me?

639
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,239
It's my fault too.

640
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,920
I never gave you a chance to explain.

641
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,440
Lianbao.

642
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,880
We cleared the air that day we had dumplings.

643
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,840
It's all in the past.

644
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,960
We're doing fine now.

645
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,400
No need to bring that up.

646
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,679
Don't tell Big Brother or Qiu'er either.

647
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,760
It's over, it's fine.

648
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,280
Alright, enough talking.

649
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,440
Hurry back.

650
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:07,880
Coming!

651
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,480
Coming!

652
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:10,800
Let's go.

653
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,440
You dressed pretty stylishly as a kid.

654
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,719
This is Weiguo.

655
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,280
I searched forever to find this photo.

656
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,039
He was only about three or four then.

657
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,880
Once we open for business tomorrow...

658
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,800
And get the restaurant running smoothly...

659
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,360
I'll have Second Brother keep an eye on things there.

660
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,400
I'll take Weiguo out to see the sights.

661
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,719
He hasn't been back in over twenty years.

662
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:07,840
Alright.

663
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,880
Later, once Weiguo's overseas lawsuit is settled...

664
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,599
Try to persuade him to come back, okay?

665
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,199
No matter how good it is out there...

666
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,719
Can it compare to home?

667
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,880
Your hair...

668
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,679
I need to give you another perm soon.

669
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,159
Look here, here... the top, it's almost gone.

670
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,679
Go to sleep.

671
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,960
Go to sleep.

672
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,119
Hey...

673
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,119
Shouldn't we find Weiguo...

674
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,480
A wife?

675
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,719
He's a grown man now.

676
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,440
He can't stay single forever, right?

677
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,239
Look...

678
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:58,840
His wife is pregnant again, right?

679
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,400
In the future, I'll watch their next generation grow up strong.

680
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,360
And enjoy the happiness of family.

681
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,440
Don't worry about other people's business.

682
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,000
Maybe he already has kids overseas.

683
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,119
Just didn't tell us.

684
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,639
I mean, this kid...

685
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,360
I went to see Auntie.

686
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,920
She said we should resolve our grievances.

687
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:00,800
I was thinking...

688
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,079
We could put on a little act.

689
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,079
It's been so many years...

690
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,159
I...

691
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,320
We're finally all together again.

692
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,480
I... I thought in this lifetime...

693
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,440
I wouldn't get to see it.

694
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:18,159
Auntie, look what you're saying.

695
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,639
But you're seeing it now, we're all together.

696
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:23,079
I want to bring Auntie back home.

697
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,440
And stay with her properly for a while.

698
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,639
You and Uncle Tong, Auntie Tong, move out.

699
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:27,760
Vacate the house.

700
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,400
I just want to ask you...

701
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,920
Do you genuinely want to help Feifei?

702
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,880
The issue isn't about...

703
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,360
No, no, no.

704
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,920
Don't give me that useless talk.

705
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,159
This kid...

706
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,280
Wants your help now.

707
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,440
I just want to know if you're sincere.

708
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,800
I sincerely want to help him.

709
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,119
I think it's best like this.

710
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,960
Don't look for outside money anymore.

711
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,599
I'll invest in Penglexuan.

712
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,280
Today, with a bit of drink in me...

713
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,920
I want to say to Big Brother...

714
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,039
Previously, when I removed you as Chairman...

715
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,760
I was too willful, it was my mistake.

716
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,480
Don't...

717
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,760
I really feel Big Brother has grown.

718
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,119
Big Brother is very different now.
