1
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,319
Honey

2
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,599
Look at you brothers.

3
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,319
Third Brother makes the big decisions.

4
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,840
Second Brother secures investments.

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,840
Big Brother just won the Duck King championship again.

6
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,200
They're all indispensable to the roast duck restaurant.

7
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,959
So you need to think carefully

8
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,480
about your role and position.

9
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,840
Only then can you show your value.

10
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,480
Right, right.

11
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,080
Let's go, let's go.

12
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,639
What now?

13
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,879
Weren't we supposed to see the doctor?

14
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,479
I'm not going.

15
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,000
Ma Weiguo, my friend.

16
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,599
Being scared won't solve the problem.

17
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,919
Keeping a calm mindset is important.

18
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,159
Besides, I'm here with you.

19
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,919
What are you afraid of?

20
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,599
I'm not afraid, I really have something to do.

21
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,719
What's more important than this?

22
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,039
Hurry up, you need to go.

23
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,879
If you don't go,

24
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,560
I'll run up to the roof and shout.

25
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,360
I'll say Ma Weiguo has a terminal illness!

26
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,560
Fine, go ahead and shout.

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,319
Shout!

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,400
Ma Weiguo has...

29
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,120
Aren't you going to stop me?

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,080
You want me to stop you, is that it?

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,120
Ma Wei...

32
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,719
Stop!

33
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
Hurry, let's go, we're running late!

34
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:53,879
Wait for me a moment.

35
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,560
Hurry up.

36
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,319
Come on, time is limited.

37
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,360
There'll be traffic soon.

38
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,639
Hurry.

39
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,039
We're out of time!

40
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Stop rushing me.

41
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,439
Where is he?

42
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,759
Coming!

43
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,319
Let's go.

44
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,639
Go.

45
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,879
Let me see your tongue coating.

46
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,080
Doctor.

47
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,639
His condition can definitely be treated, right?

48
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,599
Traditional Chinese medicine is, after all, vast and profound.

49
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,639
Mr. Ma's situation

50
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,360
still requires surgery as soon as possible.

51
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,680
Post-surgery, combine it with TCM

52
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,280
to balance yang and resolve dampness.

53
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,400
This way,

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,680
it can also have an auxiliary therapeutic effect.

55
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,599
Did you hear that?

56
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Thank you, Doctor.

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,680
Wait.

58
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,159
Since we're already here,

59
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
ask about how the auxiliary treatment works.

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,879
Then you keep learning about it.

61
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,840
I'll wait for you outside.

62
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,759
Doctor.

63
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,959
Could you tell me more specifically about this

64
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,879
treatment plan?

65
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,279
How exactly should it be implemented for best results?

66
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,079
Well...

67
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,199
What are you doing here?

68
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,000
Same as you, to see her.

69
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,920
No, you just got rejected by her yesterday.

70
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,480
Coming back for more punishment so soon?

71
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,120
I... I still have something to discuss with her.

72
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,399
Save your breath.

73
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,879
She's really angry right now.

74
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,279
She doesn't want to see us at all.

75
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,199
I've been waiting here for over an hour,

76
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,399
let alone you.

77
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,120
Mr. Ma, Director Dong will see you now.

78
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:06,920
Okay.

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Wait, what about me?

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
Director Dong says

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,759
if you really have nothing better to do,

82
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,040
you can keep waiting.

83
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,439
No, there should be an order, first come first served!

84
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,480
I remember making myself very clear to you yesterday.

85
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,639
I won't be cooperating with you.

86
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,399
I just want to explain my actions and reasoning

87
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,439
to you clearly.

88
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,399
We're both smart people.

89
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,759
You've also said

90
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,040
business requires sufficient rationality,

91
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,920
unaffected by any emotions.

92
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,319
So please, after you hear me out,

93
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,639
then make your decision.

94
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
The reason I did this

95
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
is to tell you

96
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,879
that the most valuable thing about Peng Le Xuan

97
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,639
isn't just this

98
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,480
time-honored golden signboard.

99
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,319
It's more likely

100
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,079
to be every person at Peng Le Xuan.

101
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,879
At first, I was like you.

102
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,680
I didn't trust them either.

103
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,680
Wang Chunsheng was lazy, lacking drive.

104
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,800
As for Li Lianbao,

105
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,240
he was all talk, no action.

106
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,639
Unwilling to do real work.

107
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,120
Tong Qiu, needless to say,

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,839
he just stayed in his comfort zone.

109
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,560
He never made an effort.

110
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,120
Tying these three together to do something

111
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720
was simply nonsense.

112
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,160
Child's play.

113
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,120
When they first joined forces to oppose me,

114
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,720
kicking me out of the picture,

115
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
I was indeed extremely, extremely angry.

116
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,720
That's why I sought cooperation with you.

117
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,839
It was just to vent my anger,

118
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,439
to get back at them hard.

119
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,839
But later, one action by Tong Qiu

120
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,519
completely changed my mind.

121
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,519
What's this for?

122
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
All these years you never charged me rent.

123
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,839
I've kept track of it.

124
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,519
The rent money is all in this card.

125
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,680
If there's any extra,

126
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
consider it making up the difference

127
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,439
based on market rates.

128
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,680
You never raised my rent either.

129
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,720
I'm aware of all this.

130
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
I still remember when I first returned to the country,

131
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,519
I wanted to buy him a villa.

132
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,680
But he refused me.

133
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,560
That was the first time

134
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,199
I was surprised by his actions.

135
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,600
What's wrong?

136
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,480
I'm not buying the house, not buying it.

137
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,120
What did you say?

138
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,560
You're not buying it?

139
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,759
I think I'm still a coward.

140
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,639
And I think

141
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,160
taking care of Auntie is what I should do.

142
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,079
Right?

143
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,040
For that, to take a house from you...

144
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,319
I feel I wouldn't sleep soundly at night.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,040
At first,

146
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,279
I thought he was just cowardly, timid and weak.

147
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,000
But after getting to know him gradually, I realized

148
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
he is someone with principles

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,600
and a moral compass.

150
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,199
He can control his inner desires

151
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,759
and resist huge temptations.

152
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,240
That is incredibly difficult.

153
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,199
I've seen too many successful people

154
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,000
who all failed because they couldn't resist temptation

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,639
and ended up bankrupting themselves.

156
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,920
So I discovered

157
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,200
this strength of Tong Qiu's

158
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,320
truly has the potential for success.

159
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,200
Later, I thought,

160
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,039
what should I do?

161
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,000
Getting revenge on them would vent my anger,

162
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,559
but it would also mean

163
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,000
the bet I made with them

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,240
would be a complete failure.

165
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,039
So I carefully recalled

166
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,200
the process of interacting with the three of them.

167
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,240
Later, I found

168
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,840
Haven't you always wanted

169
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,360
shares in Fengchao Tech?

170
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,240
Yes.

171
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,000
Tom, you've finally come around.

172
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,759
But I have one condition.

173
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,240
Go ahead.

174
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,919
You must invest in Peng Le Xuan.

175
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,799
Li Lianbao has resilience.

176
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,679
He doesn't accept defeat and never gives up.

177
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,600
He's an excellent team leader.

178
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,080
Listen up, you little brats.

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,279
I don't care what you think of me.

180
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,879
I will always consider myself your big brother.

181
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,559
If the sky falls,

182
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,759
even if this big brother gets a skull smashed to pieces,

183
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,480
I'll still hold it up for you.

184
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,320
If you keep vomiting like this,

185
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,759
you'll damage your stomach lining.

186
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,120
Right.

187
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,919
Maybe we should call it a day.

188
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,879
Yeah, Dad, let's just stop for today.

189
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,080
Let's take a break.

190
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,799
Let's quit for today, okay?

191
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,720
The competition is in just a few days.

192
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,600
Even if I vomit bile today,

193
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,679
I have to keep tasting.

194
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,919
Wang Chunsheng is responsible and loyal.

195
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,480
He's the spiritual pillar that unites the team members.

196
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,120
Actually, I have

197
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,360
some good news I haven't told you.

198
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,480
What? What is it?

199
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,559
I...

200
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,919
got promoted to Assistant Manager.

201
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,799
If you can't drink, then don't!

202
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,480
What about our assignment then?

203
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,159
I'll talk to Manager Chen about the assignment.

204
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,519
No one drinks anymore! Stop drinking!

205
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,399
Stop it, stop drinking!

206
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,919
Tong Qiu values relationships.

207
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,600
He knows how to consider others.

208
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,159
He's the soothing balm that stabilizes the team's emotions.

209
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,039
Therefore,

210
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,879
when I came to you again,

211
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,320
my strategy had already changed.

212
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,919
I wanted to use your strength

213
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,039
to make Peng Le Xuan succeed.

214
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,159
Why did you come to me?

215
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,200
There are many people around you who want to cooperate.

216
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,320
Why not use them?

217
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,480
Because I only trust you.

218
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,720
Many people, after getting the Peng Le Xuan brand,

219
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,080
would only try to cash out as fast as possible.

220
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
But you're different.

221
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,919
You would invest effort and time,

222
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,600
to accompany those three in their growth,

223
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,360
and make Peng Le Xuan stronger.

224
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,279
So only by handing Peng Le Xuan to you

225
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,799
can I be at ease.

226
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,200
So you tricked me hard, just once,

227
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,639
leading me around by the nose.

228
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,960
Why didn't you just tell me the truth from the start?

229
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,799
Because you simply didn't believe

230
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,919
they could change.

231
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,440
So,

232
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,360
I had to create an opportunity

233
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
for them to change,

234
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,559
and for you to see it.

235
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,080
Only then would you have confidence.

236
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,639
Now, Big Brother has won the Duck King title.

237
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,000
With your resources,

238
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,879
plus Li Lianbao's platform,

239
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,879
they have enough strength and selling points.

240
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,600
They will definitely have more potential for success

241
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,440
than your current restaurant.

242
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,840
I'll say it again:

243
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,039
As long as you succeed once,

244
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,279
people will forget all your failures.

245
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,919
I trust your judgment.

246
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,399
You will definitely make

247
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,399
the decision most beneficial to you.

248
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,039
Right?

249
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,720
You're still here.

250
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,039
So? No luck, right?

251
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
There's plenty of drama.

252
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,480
She's already agreed to cooperate with me.

253
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,559
Just wait patiently.

254
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,080
Wait, Manager Li...

255
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,200
Director Dong didn't let you in?

256
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,679
You really agreed to work with him?

257
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,919
Yes, I did.

258
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,159
Why?

259
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,080
He tricked you so badly, led you on a wild goose chase.

260
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,360
And you're still willing to cooperate with him?

261
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,279
If you're so curious, go ask him yourself.

262
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,639
No, it's...

263
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,360
I pleaded with you sincerely for so long.

264
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Won't you consider cooperating with me?

265
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Am I that unreliable in your eyes?

266
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,159
You really want to know?

267
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,720
Yes.

268
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
What's this?

269
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,320
Open it and see for yourself.

270
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,240
My dear Qianqian,

271
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
When you smile,

272
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,480
I feel all the flowers in the world bloom.

273
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,600
The sea also surges,

274
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,279
and everything in my heart is drawn to you.

275
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,480
You are the gentle wind in the mountain clouds,

276
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,759
the blazing fire on the winter prairie.

277
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,399
You are the beautiful dream of all my years.

278
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,200
This is way too mushy.

279
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,799
You've kept this love letter all this time?

280
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Who wrote it for you?

281
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,440
Who do you think wrote it?

282
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,759
Li Lianbao

283
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,639
Me?

284
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,320
I went to the time and place in the letter

285
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,440
right on time.

286
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,320
You really went?

287
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,759
And I was there

288
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,480
waiting for you a full three hours.

289
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,039
You never showed up in the end.

290
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,879
I mean, we were getting along so well.

291
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,639
How could you suddenly turn so cold?

292
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,320
You never gave me a kind look again.

293
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,679
Can someone who does that be reliable?

294
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,440
So because of this

295
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,919
you hated me for so long?

296
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,120
Not hate.

297
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,039
Disdain.

298
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,519
But I didn't write this at all.

299
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,159
Don't you recognize my handwriting?

300
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,879
Li Lianbao, are you serious?

301
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,519
Still trying to deny it now?

302
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,039
No.

303
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,039
It's not like I can do anything to you.

304
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,039
I swear

305
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,399
it really wasn't me.

306
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,200
I genuinely liked you back then.

307
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,679
Fine.

308
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,960
Okay, then who wrote it?

309
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,039
I...

310
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,440
That jerk.

311
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,399
Who?

312
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,759
Ma Weiguo.

313
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,320
He wrote this with his left hand.

314
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,919
When we were kids, we watched "The Legend of the Condor Heroes."

315
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,759
There was a character called Zhou Botong.

316
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,519
Remember?

317
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,039
Ambidextrous fighting.

318
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,519
He idolized it.

319
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,639
He'd practice writing with his left hand for fun.

320
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,080
Said it could develop the right brain.

321
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,240
Let me see.

322
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,000
Yep, that's his writing.

323
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,600
No way.

324
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Let's go settle this with him.

325
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,759
Li Lianbao!

326
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,279
Weiguo wrote it?

327
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,919
Ma Weiguo!

328
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,559
Ma Weiguo!

329
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,919
What's up? Done with the doctor?

330
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,200
You have the nerve to ask?

331
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,639
I had appointments with other departments.

332
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,000
You just left without a word.

333
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,440
Forget it, I won't argue with you.

334
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,279
Tell me, when's the surgery?

335
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,279
I won't waste my time on

336
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,720
meaningless things.

337
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,480
Fine, you said it.

338
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,920
I'm calling Uncle Wang right now.

339
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,640
Go ahead.

340
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,400
I'm calling.

341
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,119
I'm really calling.

342
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,920
You're really calling?

343
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm really calling.

344
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,400
Hang up.

345
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,480
Hello? Hello?

346
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,799
Hang up.

347
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,160
Uncle Wang?

348
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,279
Ma Weiguo!

349
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm settling all scores with you today.

350
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,599
Uncle, it's not what you think, we...

351
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,960
Not your business, go inside.

352
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,359
Go back for now.

353
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,079
Did you write this?

354
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,319
What did I ever do to you?

355
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,960
Tripping me up everywhere?

356
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,599
Tell me, did you write it?

357
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,400
I wrote it.

358
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Good, as long as you admit it.

359
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm gonna teach you a lesson today.

360
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,880
No, no, wait, wait, wait!

361
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,319
Ph-phone! Phone! Phone!

362
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,400
Big Brother is calling.

363
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,680
Big Brother?

364
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,599
Big Brother won't help you.

365
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,319
It really is Big Brother.

366
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,440
It's really him. Big Brother!

367
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,359
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

368
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,079
You talk to Big Brother.

369
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,359
Hello?

370
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,319
Lianbao's there too?

371
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,400
Perfect.

372
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,319
You all come over to our place for dinner.

373
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,359
Hurry up.

374
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:04,880
Okay.

375
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,200
What did he say?

376
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,400
Big Brother wants us at his place.

377
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,680
I'll deal with you later.

378
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,759
If you're willing

379
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,559
After school

380
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,519
Meet me at the corner by the gate.

381
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,960
"At the corner," huh?

382
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,480
I hope to see you.

383
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,240
Alright, alright, stop reading it.

384
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,200
We could go to the... library

385
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,079
Library?

386
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,359
What would we do at the library?

387
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,599
Go read books?

388
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,759
Or just walk together.

389
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:39,400
Don't, don't...

390
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,079
Finish it.

391
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:40,880
I haven't heard it all yet.

392
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,119
Honestly.

393
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,960
Or just take a walk together.

394
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,680
I think, time like this would be our

395
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,519
I think

396
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,720
time like this

397
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,519
would be our precious memory.

398
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,960
Signed, Yours, Li Lianbao.

399
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,359
You...

400
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,319
That's so mean of you.

401
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
That's really low.

402
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,160
Tell me, guys.

403
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,240
Should I beat him up?

404
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,319
No, no, no.

405
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,119
You should hear Weiguo's explanation too.

406
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,119
What happened back then?

407
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,799
Does that even need explaining?

408
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,200
No, big brother.

409
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,319
Back then, I...

410
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,279
just saw him and Qianqian getting closer.

411
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,880
But I couldn't bear to break that thin barrier.

412
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,920
So I gave him a little push.

413
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,200
But I told you, right?

414
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,720
Wait at the alley entrance after school, right?

415
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,559
I was in a hurry to go home and do homework.

416
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,359
When would I have time to wait for you?

417
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,279
Cut the crap.

418
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,720
You said back then you played every day.

419
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,079
I...

420
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,559
How could I?

421
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,839
He was just lulling his classmates.

422
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,440
Exactly.

423
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,319
He told everyone

424
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,920
he only watched TV at home, never studied.

425
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,200
But he spent more time reviewing than anyone.

426
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Why are we talking about me now?

427
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,039
We're talking about Ma Weiguo now.

428
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,279
Well, what's done is done.

429
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,440
What do you say we do?

430
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,640
Yeah, what should we do?

431
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,440
You ruined my happiness for most of my life.

432
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,920
And you act like nothing happened.

433
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,640
No.

434
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Are you so sure Qianqian would have been with you?

435
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:54,920
Right.

436
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,039
Besides, being with you

437
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,400
might not have been happy either, right?

438
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,039
He didn't just ruin my happiness.

439
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,559
He ruined Qianqian's happiness too.

440
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,200
Made Qianqian meet the wrong person and suffer.

441
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,079
Fine.

442
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,319
I was wrong, I apologize, okay?

443
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,400
Hit me, curse me, do whatever you want.

444
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,200
Alright?

445
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,480
A very good attitude of admitting guilt.

446
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,000
Alright, let's not talk about this now.

447
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,319
Let me tell you guys something.

448
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,119
Ma Weiguo teamed up with this Qianqian

449
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,240
to plot something.

450
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,720
There's, there's actually this twist.

451
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,880
Don't talk nonsense.

452
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,599
Isn't it?

453
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,880
I made it clear to you.

454
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
I had Qianqian give up Chun Jiang Shui Nuan

455
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,720
and transfer into Peng Le Xuan.

456
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,480
To bring all the backing funds and resources

457
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,000
entirely into Peng Le Xuan.

458
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,880
See? See?

459
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,440
Isn't this plotting behind our backs?

460
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,759
Say whatever you want.

461
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:44,000
Anyway, she's already agreed.

462
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,039
To merge Chun Jiang Shui Nuan into Peng Le Xuan.

463
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:47,960
Really?

464
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,400
Really.

465
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,200
No, you need to explain this clearly to me.

466
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,559
How did you convince Qianqian?

467
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,880
Actually,

468
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,599
I didn't convince her.

469
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:01,880
It was you guys.

470
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,000
She saw your growth.

471
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,319
And she saw your value.

472
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,160
She saw Peng Le Xuan's potential even more.

473
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,680
So it'd be weird if she didn't invest, right?

474
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,559
Right?

475
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,480
Here, dumplings.

476
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,079
Super hot.

477
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:32,720
Put it in the middle, in the middle.

478
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,559
Thanks for your hard work, sis-in-law.

479
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,880
The dumpling filling today

480
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,559
was mixed by your big brother himself.

481
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,319
Hurry up and try it.

482
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:38,799
Authentic.

483
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,319
Come on, come on, eat.

484
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,640
Let me say something, bro.

485
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,240
I think our Peng Le Xuan

486
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,759
has never been so

487
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,480
prosperous and thriving as it is now.

488
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,799
We should toast to big brother.

489
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,119
No, no, no, not me.

490
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,480
Brothers, don't toast to me.

491
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,599
The reason I called everyone here today

492
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
is that I feel

493
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,599
us four brothers are together again.

494
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,799
That makes me so happy.

495
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,960
Come on, cheers.

496
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
Come on, come on.

497
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,799
Here.

498
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,119
Hurry up.

499
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,279
Less talking, more eating.

500
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,839
Come on, eat dumplings, eat dumplings.

501
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:14,799
Come on, come on.

502
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,400
Eat them while they're hot.

503
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,279
Got it.

504
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,640
Try your dad's filling.

505
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,160
I can taste it.

506
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,599
This

507
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Back then,

508
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,680
was Auntie's favorite to make for everyone.

509
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,799
Originally, it was because Xiao Liangzi loved them.

510
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,240
But Auntie, every time she made them,

511
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
she had to make a hundred and fifty, sixty.

512
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,119
Because us brothers could eat so much.

513
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,799
Each of us would eat thirty, forty.

514
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,039
Back then, we'd fight over the dumplings,

515
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,319
and even broke Auntie's plate.

516
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,119
Right?

517
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,200
Ever since Xiao Liangzi passed,

518
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,400
we never had them again.

519
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,920
Later, I learned from Auntie.

520
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,680
Speaking of which,

521
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,599
my first memory of Beijing

522
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,400
was in '82,

523
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,640
when our Peng Le Xuan reopened.

524
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,319
My dad, my mom, and I

525
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,920
all came back.

526
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,559
No high-speed trains back then.

527
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,160
Took a whole day on that old green train.

528
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,519
Later, when I was about to start school,

529
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,039
Auntie told my mom,

530
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,039
"Don't let this kid stay in the Shanxi countryside.

531
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,559
Come back to Beijing for school."

532
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
She took care of me.

533
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:52,839
But I was just

534
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,720
a little kid then.

535
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,640
Crying all day, wanting my mom.

536
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,119
Auntie would hug and comfort me every day.

537
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,119
Back then, Auntie told me,

538
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,759
"You have to be a man.

539
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,200
Don't cry all the time.

540
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,400
Be a

541
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,920
real man who stands tall."

542
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,559
So since I was little,

543
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,279
I've been pretty tough.

544
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,440
When people called me "Zhen Bao Fang",

545
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,039
I felt so proud.

546
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,039
But after what happened to Xiao Liangzi,

547
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,519
I started to be afraid.

548
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,920
Once afraid, I just...

549
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,839
I've been afraid all these years.

550
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,039
What I'm afraid of now is...

551
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,480
You know, me,

552
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,559
a dad with little schooling,

553
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
will my son respect me?

554
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,279
And also, all these years,

555
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,440
these brothers...

556
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,559
I'm afraid I haven't taken good care of them.

557
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,519
Furthermore,

558
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,519
times have changed.

559
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,319
Can I keep up with the times?

560
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,599
Has my craft fallen behind?

561
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,519
But honestly,

562
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,000
I...

563
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,759
thank you brothers.

564
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,759
You guys

565
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,920
pushed me forward,

566
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
to enter the Duck King competition.

567
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,559
I never thought

568
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,359
I, Wang Chunsheng, could make a comeback.

569
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,400
Here,

570
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,279
Second Brother,

571
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,640
Weiguo,

572
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,599
Qiu'er,

573
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,079
thank you.

574
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,000
Come on, eat the dumplings.

575
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,000
It's been years since I tasted this flavor.

576
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,240
Truly.

577
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,599
Talking about Auntie reminds me.

578
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,880
Weiguo and I were really naughty back then.

579
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,480
Remember?

580
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,960
Once, we were playing chess with Old Man Sun.

581
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,559
We were about to lose,

582
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,720
so I just swept the chessboard clean.

583
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,839
Old Man Sun scolded me a bit.

584
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,240
I wasn't having it.

585
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,720
So I egged Weiguo on

586
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,319
to pull the valve cores from Old Man Sun's bike tires.

587
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,119
When Auntie found out,

588
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,920
she gave us a good beating.

589
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,480
After the beating,

590
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:30,079
she also made us these watermelon rind dumplings.

591
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,480
I was actually really happy then.

592
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,279
Because Auntie didn't treat us as outsiders.

593
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,599
She wasn't polite with us.

594
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,880
I still remember,

595
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,359
she said while hitting us,

596
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,960
"A real man

597
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,759
isn't afraid to lose.

598
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,839
A real man can take a loss.

599
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,839
Cheating, welshing, not owning up,

600
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,200
makes you a coward.

601
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,440
If you lose, win it back fair and square.

602
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,880
Harming people behind their backs

603
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,599
makes you the lowest of the low."

604
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,039
Here, Qiu'er.

605
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:13,720
Here.

606
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,640
Actually, I think...

607
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,359
Auntie was really good to me too.

608
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,599
You three,

609
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,599
you always made fun of me as kids.

610
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,079
Said I cried a lot, right?

611
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,240
Big Brother would get in a fight,

612
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,680
I'd cry seeing his bruised face.

613
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,000
You,

614
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,240
I'd cry when you got your "Three Goods Student" award.

615
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,279
And you,

616
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,720
you were always fooling around as a kid.

617
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,799
People said you were aimless, wouldn't amount to anything.

618
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,279
Then one year,

619
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,079
you scored higher than him on a test.

620
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,160
I... I cried then too.

621
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,680
Only Auntie didn't laugh at me.

622
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,319
Auntie said my crying showed I valued relationships.

623
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,440
Few could compare.

624
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,839
I also remember,

625
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,480
when I was little,

626
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,119
my parents worked abroad.

627
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,519
Whenever I missed them,

628
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,160
I'd go out to play.

629
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,440
Lots of people at home would complain,

630
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,200
telling Auntie,

631
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,799
"You spoil him too much."

632
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:40,519
But

633
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,240
she never

634
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,400
cared what others said.

635
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,039
She always protected me.

636
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,359
In my heart,

637
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,119
she was like another mother to me.

638
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,599
Actually, Auntie

639
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,240
was another mother to all of us.

640
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,680
So you all need to live well even more.

641
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,559
Back then, I...

642
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,799
When I saw that digital camcorder,

643
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,079
I really envied your bond.

644
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,559
I think when Great-Aunt passed away,

645
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,599
she probably didn't want past events

646
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,319
to affect you all for a lifetime.

647
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,119
Auntie wanted us to be well.

648
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,759
We should listen to her.

649
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,960
Otherwise, she won't rest in peace over there.

650
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,279
Auntie over there

651
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,839
must have met Xiao Liangzi.

652
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,720
Come on, brothers.

653
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,559
Here's to Auntie,

654
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,079
and also to Xiao Liangzi.

655
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,720
Us four brothers,

656
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,519
let's live well in this world.

657
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,039
Cheers.

658
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:09,599
Cheers.

659
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,319
Live well.

660
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,759
Come on, live well.

661
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,160
Come on, come on.

662
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,079
Come on, let's eat the dumplings.

663
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:19,960
They'll get cold soon.

664
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,920
Come on, come on, come on.

665
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,000
Sis.

666
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,200
You put a coin in the dumpling?

667
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,240
You're gonna get rich!

668
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,039
I got it!

669
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,319
You're gonna strike it rich!

670
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,240
I'll go buy a lottery ticket from Big Fool Yang later.

671
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,359
I'm definitely gonna win five million.

672
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,680
Come on, come on.

673
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,799
Here, bro, have a drink.

674
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,720
Come on, come on.

675
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,960
It's not like counting other people's money at the bank.

676
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,799
This time, we're counting our own money.

677
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,039
Sister Tongtong, they made up.

678
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,039
Look at the photo.

679
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,880
Come on, bro.

680
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:20,680
Bottoms up.

681
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,359
Down it goes.

682
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,799
These dumplings are so satisfying.

683
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,440
We four brothers are no good.

684
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,160
Four of us only drank three bottles.

685
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,880
We should at least drink four.

686
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,079
One bottle per person.

687
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,599
Weiguo, you drank too little today.

688
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,920
Big bro, I drank a lot for me today.

689
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,440
Today, while I'm a bit tipsy,

690
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,079
let me tell you something, big bro.

691
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:51,279
Before, when I removed you as chairman,

692
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,000
I was too willful. It was my fault.

693
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,720
No...

694
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,000
I really think you've grown, big bro.

695
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,200
You're very different now.

696
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,759
You should still be the chairman.

697
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,960
No, no, no, don't sweet-talk me.

698
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,799
Let me tell you,

699
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:05,799
I never wanted to be chairman from the start.

700
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,720
If you all hadn't talked me into it,

701
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,920
I wouldn't have done it these past few days.

702
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,680
To be honest,

703
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,200
I still want to be the head chef.

704
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:19,839
This skill passed down from Grandpa,

705
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,400
I'll keep using it at Peng Le Xuan.

706
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,440
I'll make Peng Le Xuan successful.

707
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,160
Good, good, good.

708
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,440
Alright, no problem.

709
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,759
But then who will be chairman?

710
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,240
Second brother.

711
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,960
You be the chairman.

712
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,960
Big bro, it has to be you.

713
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,519
Peng Le Xuan is your brainchild.

714
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,680
The chairman position is yours.

715
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,279
Well, I won't do it.

716
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:51,200
Qiu'er, Qiu'er, you do it.

717
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,640
Cut it out.

718
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,240
As if you'd listen to me if I were chairman.

719
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,519
Don't set me up.

720
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm not falling for that.

721
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,680
Hey, Weiguo, Weiguo, come on.

722
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,359
Right, how about you, Weiguo?

723
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,960
I won't, I won't.

724
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,680
Well, I have another idea.

725
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,400
I want to give half of my shares

726
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,000
to you.

727
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,960
Then you'll be the biggest shareholder

728
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,200
and become chairman again.

729
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
You have management experience, right?

730
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,440
Besides, Peng Le Xuan

731
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,839
originally belonged to your Ma family.

732
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,960
Let Peng Le Xuan keep the Ma name, okay?

733
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,680
Big bro, it's not like that.

734
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,440
Really.

735
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,319
I think Peng Le Xuan needs your skill

736
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,319
to have a future.

737
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:30,920
Alright.

738
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,759
I really don't want the shares.

739
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:36,039
No, just be the chairman.

740
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,519
Big bro.

741
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,920
Brothers, let's stop deferring to each other, okay?

742
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,720
The chairman is still you.

743
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,240
Let's follow the rules.

744
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,960
Now we brothers are united.

745
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,000
We'll make Peng Le Xuan flourish in the future.

746
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:50,960
Deal?

747
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,359
Absolutely.

748
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,880
Then it's settled.

749
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,599
All four of us

750
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,920
are chairmen, okay?

751
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,880
I think Second Brother is right.

752
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,880
Big Brother is even more right.

753
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,359
Now that Big Brother

754
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,320
has also earned the Duck King title,

755
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,800
I think I should also contribute

756
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,760
to our Peng Le Xuan.

757
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,480
From now on,

758
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,719
Peng Le Xuan's clients

759
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,639
are my responsibility.

760
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,440
You're just bragging.

761
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,679
Jing'er, cut up a watermelon, please.

762
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,159
Sure thing, wait a sec.

763
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,760
Sis, I want grapes.

764
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,119
We really don't have any.

765
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:32,960
What grapes?

766
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,880
None.

767
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,320
Sis.

768
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,239
Bring me that half bottle of liquor again.

769
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,440
Let's have a bit more with the watermelon.

770
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,960
Top it up.

771
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,840
Or how about we have some beer?

772
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,599
Even without the painkillers and patches,

773
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,719
my body doesn't seem to hurt as much.

774
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:58,639
This is truly a miracle.

775
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,559
Selfishly thinking,

776
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,039
if every day were like this,

777
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:04,679
a few months from now,

778
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,719
my life would be considered complete.

779
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,400
No, no.

780
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,880
Their futures are still full of hope.

781
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,920
How can I just spend days drinking and chatting?

782
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:35,239
President Liu, this will definitely work.

783
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,320
President Hu will surely be fine too.

784
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,039
President Zhao...

785
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:41,719
You're probably a long shot.

786
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,119
It's just five, right?

787
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,360
I've worked at the bank for ten years.

788
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,440
I've served so many clients.

789
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,719
What's so difficult about this?

790
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,400
Hello, President Song. This is Tong Qiu.

791
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,760
Xiao Tong. Got a new product?

792
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,320
No, I'm not here to talk about the bank.

793
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,199
It's like this.

794
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:00,880
My buddies and I recently started a roast duck restaurant.

795
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
The Buddies Roast Duck place.

796
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,280
We can discuss it. Is tomorrow afternoon okay?

797
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,440
Sure, no problem.

798
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,719
I'll come see you tomorrow afternoon.

799
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:07,000
Alright, see you tomorrow afternoon.

800
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Great. See you tomorrow.

801
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:09,800
See you tomorrow.

802
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,119
Why haven't you given up yet?

803
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,719
This...

804
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,880
You sure you want me to say it standing at the door?

805
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,039
Retreat, retreat, retreat.

806
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,480
It's like this.

807
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,199
I booked the best in all of Beijing.

808
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,880
The expert with the most surgical experience.

809
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
You need to come with me right now.

810
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,119
Otherwise, we'll hit traffic soon.

811
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,280
Do you know what this is?

812
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,199
Glioma. Commonly known as a brain tumor.

813
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,119
Then do you know what my situation is now?

814
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,199
If the surgery is successful...

815
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:13,840
Then...

816
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,719
Live two more months?

817
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,480
Or live two more years?

818
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,280
You've looked it up online.

819
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,440
You should know.

820
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,639
Even if I'm lucky enough to walk out of the operating room...

821
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,280
There will be all sorts of complications.

822
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,920
Declining vision, declining intelligence.

823
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,960
Epilepsy, paralysis.

824
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,679
And the brain cancer can recur at any time.

825
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,400
Do you think, with all this...

826
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,920
I should still just muddle through living?

827
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,920
My grandpa said...

828
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,960
As long as a person is alive, there is hope.

829
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,639
I don't believe that.

830
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:48,800
Ma Weiguo!

831
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,159
If you keep acting like this...

832
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,400
What? You want to make a scene, is that it?

833
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,719
Fine. Uncle Tong and the others are over there.

834
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,480
Go tell them.

835
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,360
I don't care.

836
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,400
Look at this brat.

837
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,199
He's offended the girl, hasn't he?

838
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,400
Really. Not a gentleman at all, this guy.

839
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,639
Lately, this Tongtong...

840
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,440
They've been interacting a bit too frequently.

841
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,840
If it were kids, it'd be understandable.

842
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,119
But this Weiguo, he's an elder.

843
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,599
An elder.

844
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,320
Should avoid any impropriety.

845
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,079
Avoid what impropriety? What era is this?

846
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,840
You're such an old fuddy-duddy.

847
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,599
Alright, stop talking.

848
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,199
Stop talking. Let's go.

849
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:36,840
Gently.

850
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,239
Remember, gently.

851
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:40,960
Stop talking.

852
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,480
Honestly. So annoying.

853
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Worrywart. Come on, come on.

854
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,400
Honestly. You... you'll just...

855
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,199
That's a foul!

856
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,239
Dad.

857
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,840
Don't laugh yet.

858
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:31,960
You can't laugh with a face mask on.

859
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,199
It's easy to get wrinkles.

860
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:35,800
Is this okay?

861
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,320
Okay.

862
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:37,719
Then pack this up.

863
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,280
Alright.

864
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,719
Let's settle the bill.

865
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:39,239
Okay.

866
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:39,960
Okay, bro.

867
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,440
Careful, Dad!

868
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,079
That monkey is heading your way!

869
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,199
I'm done for.

870
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,480
Shoot him! Shoot him!

871
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,199
Nice.

872
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,679
Little monkey.

873
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,760
Our company has quite a lot of business banquets normally.

874
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,519
There's a need in that area.

875
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,679
However...

876
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:10,079
This year's contract has already been signed.

877
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,119
Next year.

878
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:13,599
We'll give Peng Le Xuan priority consideration.

879
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,920
That's much appreciated.

880
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,719
So it's settled then.

881
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,000
We'll definitely cooperate next year.

882
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,360
Good. Let's leave it at that for now.

883
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:19,840
Okay.

884
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:21,639
Alright.

885
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,440
Well, thank you.

886
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Take care.

887
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,719
First battle, first victory.

888
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,760
Booked a client.

889
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Agreed. Cooperation next year.

890
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,760
Keep it up! Keep it up!
