1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I turn around and escape?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Love is a game of playing games

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm curious about it

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm willing to hate you, I'm willing to hate you

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How can I hold you tight?

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will wake up the memories

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What's the point of dreaming?

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The End

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Episode 4

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Miss, they're bullying me

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Who bullied you?

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm the fairy

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We went to the old lady to get married

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
She's been gone for days

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Now the kitchen wants to cut our money

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How can we not give it to people?

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That rumor is not your fault

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And that young master

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He didn't come here without a reason

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He doesn't believe Miss

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He doesn't want you to leave the fairy hospital?

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Cang Wei

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If he doesn't send people to see us

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Maybe one day

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
we'll be able to tell our own story

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Miss, let's leave Pei Fu

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's easy to talk

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Pei Congzhi

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You sent people to watch the nurse

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't die

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But I don't have any help

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're waiting for me

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Go to save me first

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Cang Wei

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to match a man

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Who can sleep peacefully

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Do you have any spare time?

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, I have a lot

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then I'll use all the money

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Cang Wei

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Tie them up

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and release them

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That means

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
our fairy hospital is already

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
accompanied by the parents

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
of the master

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Cang Wei

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Cang Wei

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Cang Wei

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Cang Wei

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Cang Wei

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Cang Wei

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Cang Wei

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Cang Wei

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Cang Wei

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I've been abandoned by Pei Fu

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
by the parents

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't come in

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What are you doing?

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Luo

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Luo

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Miss

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Luo, what are you doing?

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How dare you

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,120
You're just a

71
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,000
useless evil

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
My reputation

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You can teach me

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm Pei Fu's girl

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're so cruel

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You've been avoiding me

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and you've been so stupid

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You still treat yourself

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
as a Miss

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
A flower pot

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
for the guests

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I think you

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
just want to be with Pei Fu

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and use your money

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
to seduce a few men

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Pei Jingling is willing to

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
do something for me

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
when I'm out of the frame

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's her

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Whether it's your man

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
or yours

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I won't leave

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You won't leave

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Then I'll send you off

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What do you want?

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Shen Qingtang

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Today

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I designed a good show for you

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Pei Fu's daughter

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
is a flower pot

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and is a broken shoe

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
She's been so shy

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and Namelet.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's like

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
she got an external wound

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
She can know

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
what's happening

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Dad

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,280
I'm Watchmaking!

110
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,740
I'm here today in my wife's birthday month.

111
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,520
Can't wait to accompany you.

112
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,240
Don't yell.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,400
She secretly planned to dethrone you.

114
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
But awh radish hard and flexible

115
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,520
has their own advantages and disadvantages.

116
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,480
Mrs. Shen,

117
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,840
go live in the court.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
Mr. Shen!

119
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,560
Mrs. Shen!

120
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,440
Miss has gone.

121
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,920
Doctor told notions ofвин Majesty.

122
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,080
It happened one day,

123
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:31,880
so please, round him up.

124
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,080
Please, don't 모or the court.

125
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,720
Go!

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,160
Be patient with me.

127
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,840
Give me some time,

128
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,760
to take care of the letter.

129
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,600
If you really did.

130
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,840
I'm not gonna let you know

131
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
what we can have done.

132
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,600
I'm gonna

133
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,720
let them have a look

134
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,840
into my hidden videos.

135
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,040
What are you doing?

136
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,960
Pei Congzhi!

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,320
You're not going to pretend?

138
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,080
You're using the fake death to leave me.

139
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,600
This is your choice.

140
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,040
It came about while we were all trapped

141
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,440
by the lanterns and we rebound.

142
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,840
Boasting makes the world a thing again.

143
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,600
We're not treated for being true human beings,

144
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,880
or letting the gods to give us death.

145
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,120
Just Easy.

146
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,200
Do you mind if I try?

147
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,120
Your family lives in thisgary land.

148
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,960
It's full of mud all day.

149
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,760
As long as you are here,

150
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,200
please maintain your dignity.

151
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,120
Even areated herself by

152
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,840
a triangular body targets death.

153
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,440
Swallow the dead medicines

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,520
to the dead ones.

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
How can you let me go?

156
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Remember the fear of the last time.

157
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,240
Shen Qingtang.

158
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,000
Once I find out that you're trying to escape from me,

159
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
even if you're really dead,

160
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
I won't let you go.

161
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
You know that.

162
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
I can do anything.

163
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Let go of me.

164
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Why did you go to find her?

165
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
You're going to kill me.

166
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I... I'm wrong.

167
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I beg you.

168
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I shouldn't have done that to you.

169
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I beg you.

170
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
I beg you.

171
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Please let me go.

172
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
I beg you.

173
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
The one who's holding the pot

174
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
is the right hand.

175
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Press the hand of the water.

176
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
What hand is it?

177
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Stop it.

178
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
You're a bastard.

179
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Are you trying to pay for your crime?

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
You're going to kill me if you're willing to.

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Kill me if you want to.

182
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
He's going to kill Shen Qingtang.

183
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
It's not just one life.

184
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
It's fair.

185
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I'm going to kill him.

186
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm going to kill him.

187
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm going to kill him.

188
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
It's fair.

189
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Isn't Shen Qingtang a good man?

190
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
You said you wanted to make a contribution for him.

191
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
I'll do anything for you.

192
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
From now on,

193
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
no one in the family

194
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
should mention about the matter of the water.

195
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,600
No one will be in trouble with him.

196
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Are you satisfied with that?

197
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Fine.

198
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
I'll do as you say.

199
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
But

200
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,320
the road is a road of

201
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
murder.

202
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Pei Jingming is a man who is responsible for the crime.

203
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
He's the most responsible.

204
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
From now on,

205
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
you'll be in the family.

206
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
You'll have to die.

207
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
You can't be in the family.

208
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
You...

209
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
You're not a person who wants to die.

210
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Why don't you take good care of him?

211
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
The transaction before brother's death is not over yet.

212
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
As long as I promise to be your woman,

213
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
you can fulfill all my demands.

214
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Everything?

215
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm not a woman who wants to die.

216
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
I'm not a woman who wants to die.

217
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I want to go.

218
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Everything.

219
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

220
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

221
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

222
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

223
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

224
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

225
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

226
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

227
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

228
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

229
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

230
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

231
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

232
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

233
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

234
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

235
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

236
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Even if I can't get away from him,

237
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
I still have to do the same thing.

238
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
In my dreams,

239
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
you are being gentle.

240
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm afraid

241
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
that I'll be in trouble.

242
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Crazy man,
