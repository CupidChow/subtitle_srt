1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've never seen myself before.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How can I stay in this dream?

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How can I turn around and get out of it?

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Or is it just a game of game?

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm so curious.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you're willing to be with me,

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
how can I let you go?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so curious.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you're willing to hate me,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
how can I let you go?

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm so curious.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If I can let you go,

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
how can I turn around and get out of it?

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Story of My Life

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Episode 1

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Shen Qingtang, Princess Zhao He.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're also a prince in the Peking Opera.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're also a brother in the Rengou Palace.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How dare you come to the palace?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Today, I'll punish you for being a nuisance.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Shen Qingtang,

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
if I destroy your face and tear your disguise,

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll see if he'll treat you like a treasure.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He'll help you and trust you.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're so selfish.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How long can you keep me alive?

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're ridiculous.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What's your identity?

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm a princess.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How about killing you?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't be afraid.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm here.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll kill him.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Zhao He,

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,000
how dare you hurt him?

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,600
I did hurt him.

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
I still want you to punish him.

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm afraid that His Majesty is at a loss now.

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,400
The Yuan army is coming to rebel.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
His Majesty is in a state of conflict.

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,800
The best way is to send you to the He Jin.

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
You're so arrogant.

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
It's impossible for you to let me

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
go to the He Jin with that old man.

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
You're the princess of the Yi State.

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,000
You're thinking of getting into the Ronghua Palace.

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,400
You should bear the responsibility you should take.

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Responsibility?

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,400
It's just an excuse to avoid the Emperor.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Pei Congzhi,

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
you're taking me here for a Shen Qingtang.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
He's just a slave.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
In my eyes,

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
he's the treasure of the Western World.

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,600
You don't even remember him.

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,200
I'm here to help you.

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,200
It might hurt a little.

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Bear it.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,800
You're here to save me?

61
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,600
I'm really sorry.

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,400
I promised to protect you.

65
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,600
Naturally, I won't let you down.

66
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
You really want to

67
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
stay in the Princess' marriage for me?

68
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,000
I promise to give you the future.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,200
I'm serious.

70
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Shen Qingtang.

71
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
I've been through it.

72
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
It's not just a joke.

73
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
It's also a confession.

74
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,080
Today,

75
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,720
when you went to see His Majesty,

76
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,320
Ziqi told me a lot.

77
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,000
He said,

78
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,400
you really hurt me.

79
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,360
Let's just ignore it.

80
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,480
I have always planned

81
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,680
the future of always waiting gradually.

82
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,160
Why are you asking?

83
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,120
The ?

84
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,640
I still believe in what you said

85
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,560
and what you arranged.

86
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,160
I believe in what he said.

87
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
You love me.

88
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,200
And this

89
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,760
is the only revenge

90
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,960
I can win you.

91
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,120
Xiao Jie.

92
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,720
Are you really going to see Madam?

93
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,600
She's not a good person.

94
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
She should be your partner.

95
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,200
Since I chose to be with Pei Cong Zhi,

96
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,640
she's the one I must face.

97
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,560
Cai Wei.

98
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,240
I have no other choice.

99
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,480
Today is Father's birthday.

100
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,760
Even if you hate her again,

101
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,680
you should think about her well.

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,720
Pei Yu is a hundred times more than you.

103
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,280
He doesn't even want to take revenge on me.

104
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,360
How could I remember him?

105
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,560
You're not willing to hate her

106
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,240
or you feel guilty and can't face her?

107
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,960
You're also helping her

108
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,840
to kill her own father.

109
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,200
How dare you admit this crime?

110
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,360
Why are you so right?

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Why?

112
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
I've already cleared everything for you.

113
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,640
Why do you want Pei Zi to kill that bastard

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,320
and let me go?

115
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Why?

116
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,160
Say it. Say it.

117
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,760
Why are you so rude?

118
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,760
You're going to kill that bastard's father?

119
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,520
I'm going to let you taste

120
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
the taste of death.

121
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Kill him.

122
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Kill him.

123
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,880
Kill him.

124
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Father.

125
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,000
Get away.

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Will you get out?

127
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
Father!

128
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,400
Father.

129
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,040
Father!

130
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,680
Father!

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,480
Father!

132
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,400
Father!

133
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,520
Father!

134
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,840
Father!

135
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,320
Father!

136
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
I can't let anyone know all this.

137
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Otherwise, I'll be with you for 50,000 years.

138
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
I can't bear to die.

139
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

140
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Your Majesty!

141
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Your Majesty!

142
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Your Majesty!

143
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Your Majesty!

144
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Your Majesty!

145
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
I can't let anyone know all this.

146
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Otherwise, I'll be with you for 50,000 years.

147
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
I can't bear to die.

148
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,760
So, I've been wronged for so many years.

149
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
The general of the First River

150
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,760
died in the battlefield of the city of Shishou.

151
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
But he died in the hands of the one who loves him.

152
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
He was the one who forced me to do it.

153
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
He died in the battle.

154
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
You forced him?

155
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
You wanted him to die long ago.

156
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,760
You poisoned him in his food.

157
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
You thought you could hide the hatred.

158
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Jiang Wan!

159
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
You're a human.

160
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
You're not qualified enough to be a mother.

161
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
If you still want your life,

162
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,760
you'd better take the money from your father.

163
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
You can take it back.

164
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
You'll use him to threaten me.

165
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,760
But you're not as stubborn and soft-hearted.

166
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
You think

167
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,760
you can hide the hatred of Shen Qingtang.

168
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
His secret

169
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
has been kept secret for a long time.

170
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
I'll protect him as much as I can.

171
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Even if his identity is exposed,

172
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
I can still do everything

173
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
to take him away from the world.

174
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,760
What's the secret of my hatred?

175
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
To destroy the whole Bai family?

176
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
But your favorite life

177
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
is between my eyes.

178
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,760
You came here for Jiang Wan, right?

179
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm a little nervous.

180
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
I'm not afraid of anything.

181
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
I'm just a little nervous.

182
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
I'm just a little nervous.

183
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
I'm just a little nervous.

184
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
I'm just a little nervous.

185
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
I'm just a little nervous.

186
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
I'm just a little nervous.

187
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
I'm just a little nervous.

188
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
I'm just a little nervous.

189
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
