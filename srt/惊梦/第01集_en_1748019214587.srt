1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've never seen myself before.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How can I stay in this dream?

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How can I turn around and escape?

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Love is a game of light and shadow.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm so excited.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No wonder you're willing to hate me.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How can I let you go?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm so happy.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm so happy.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm so mad.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How can I web you?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You can put a little bit of love inасlem on my mind.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,500
And it can awaken my memories.

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
What will I achieve through my dream?

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,200
You Sung by 高小红

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,400
Episode 12

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,680
That dream again

18
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,820
www

19
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,240
The night breeze blows

20
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,800
Is like aター投影

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,240
The truth is

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,440
I won't let you scream.

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,720
Please.

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
I won't go.

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,360
I'm afraid I can't take it

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,200
but I will see the girl

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,320
and take her home.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,860
How can you die?

29
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,740
그렇지 between them.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,560
Wu Zi, you're...

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,580
a bad man?

32
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,200
It's...

33
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,000
though!

34
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,460
Huiliang Brine...

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,760
got into a cold muck.

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,800
The Mengsheng fights...

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:40,060
and

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,800
Miss, you have a nightmare again?

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
Miss, you are in a state of anxiety and worry.

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,600
You can't sleep after you come back.

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll go to report to Old Madam.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll find a doctor to see Miss.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Cai Wei.

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm a little bit confused.

45
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,800
I should at least be a little bit more cautious.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,600
In a few days, I'll be fine.

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,000
Sister Qing Tang.

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
I brought some snacks for you.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,600
Second Young Master.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Thank you for coming to visit me.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,200
It's just that the spirit knowledge is too precious.

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,800
Qing Tang shouldn't be taken.

53
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,200
Cai Wei, have some tea.

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,400
Second Young Master personally sent the medicine.

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Who are you looking at to make the bridge for?

56
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Hurry and go to the medicine.

57
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,800
But...

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Hurry and go.

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Sister, you are not in good health.

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,400
I am in good health.

61
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,600
How about I...

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,000
give you a look?

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,400
Brother Jing Ming is dead.

64
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
It's not appropriate to be in such a state of anxiety.

65
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,000
Sister Qing Tang, I've been in the heart of you for a long time.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
Don't be angry with me.

67
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,200
Brother Jing Ming.

68
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
Madam.

69
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
Second Young Master has to go to the medicine again.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
Please help me recall it now.

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,400
I'm really sorry.

72
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Please help me.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm begging you.

75
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,000
It's been a long time.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's time to open the Begonia Flower.

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,200
Don't be so shameless.

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,000
I've already had my own flesh in the path.

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,400
But I was only able to make the right choice.

80
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
I was in a bad mood.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,800
I was just able to find you a proper person in the Western Courtyard.

82
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I was willing to beg for it, but no one was willing to take it.

83
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Sister, you have to marry into the Western Courtyard sooner or later.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why don't you learn to go back to the palace and know?

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,800
You and your sister are together.

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Isn't it beautiful?

87
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,200
If you do this, aren't you afraid that I will be punished?

88
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm afraid that I will be able to choose a happy life for you.

89
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,000
I won't marry you.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,400
What are you doing?

91
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,600
What are you doing?

92
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Let me tell you. Your clothes and body are all flesh.

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,400
Which one of you is not given by the Pei Fu clan?

94
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,600
Even if you give me your heart,

95
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,000
I will still be able to give you the reward.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,800
Let me go.

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Young Master, stop!

98
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,200
We are going back to the palace!

99
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,200
Young Master.

100
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Shen Qing Tang, you can't escape.

101
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,600
No one can save you in the Pei Fu clan.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
Xiao'e.

103
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,400
Young Master, are you okay?

104
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Young Master, don't be sad.

105
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
There must be a good place to return to.

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,600
Cai Wei.

107
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Young Master, is he really back?

108
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
Young Master, you are back.

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The road is very steep.

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
Young Master, come and wash the dishes.

111
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,800
The door is open.

112
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,600
Open the light.

113
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Young Master, hello.

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Young Master, hello.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
Young Master.

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
Young Master.

118
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,200
Young Master.

119
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,600
Young Master, you must go find Miss Shen.

120
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,200
Yuan Lian said that Second Master went to see Miss Shen in the daytime.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
She is not in a hurry to learn the behavior.

122
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,400
I will go get changed and get changed.

123
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,800
Yes.

124
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
Young Master.

125
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,700
Eldest Brother, you are back.

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,300
Why don't you wear shoes again?

127
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,000
SisterINAUDIBLE and Sisterorrow, set out tochlossen of the Wonderful Rebel of the Human race

128
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:15,000
Brother, why you...

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm in a hurry.

130
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,560
I'm right.

131
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
I can walk on my own.

132
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
It's a heavy night.

133
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,560
You're weak.

134
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,320
Be careful not to catch a cold.

135
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,880
It's still cold.

136
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,280
You all are young and rich.

137
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,240
You were young and coisas more.

138
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,200
You believed in yourself and arranged everything.

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,880
Even you wereja emotions were kulOSS.

140
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,280
Qingtang has nothing to help you.

141
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,200
The'?

142
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,440

143
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,400
is so happy.

144
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,720
It's alright.

145
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,920
to attend in the wedding hall in the second night

146
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,960
who's really busy today?

147
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:26,520
After Lu Yu

148
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,000
brought you from a useless family

149
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,100
Land Patriarch

150
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,000
I lie to myself

151
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,960
угat me

152
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,120
Nan Meng

153
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,020
Mr. Lu

154
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,720
Today

155
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,080
Ugly

156
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,280
Concubine

157
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:55,680
Just for brother

158
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,320
she can help you

159
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,860
Do you understand?

160
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,700
I understand

161
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,380
brother Fan has put him up as soon as he can

162
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
I'm not a woman.

163
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,180
What are you laughing at?

164
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,380
I'm never joking.

165
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,980
But in my heart,

166
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,380
you've always been my brother.

167
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,380
Can we change our ways?

168
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,380
What else can you change?

169
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,980
Shen Qiantang,

170
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,580
don't forget

171
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,380
that you were eight years old.

172
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,380
You've changed

173
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,980
and saved my life.

174
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,780
Say it!

175
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,180
How dare you come to the Edo?

176
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,180
I don't have an Edo.

177
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,980
I've always been afraid of the evil.

178
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,380
My family has been in trouble.

179
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,980
Please forgive me.

180
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,380
Open the door!

181
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,380
Let me go!

182
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,980
Be careful.

183
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,380
I can sell you a good man.

184
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Let me go!

185
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,380
Let me go!

186
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,380
Let me go!

187
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,380
What are you doing?

188
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,380
Mr. Pei,

189
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,380
my daughter is not obedient.

190
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,380
I'll teach her a lesson.

191
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,380
Let's go!

192
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,380
Let's go!

193
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,380
Let me go!

194
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,380
I'm not a woman!

195
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,380
I'm a family!

196
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,380
Let's go!

197
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,380
Please save me, Brother Cheng!

198
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,380
Let me go!

199
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,380
Let me go!

200
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,380
Get out!

201
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,380
I've never been useless.

202
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,380
I'll save you.

203
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,380
What can you do?

204
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,380
Everything.

205
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,380
I'll do anything.

206
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,380
From now on,

207
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,380
you're my sister.

208
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,380
I'll protect you.

209
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,380
You can only be loyal to me.

210
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,380
Unless you're dead,

211
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,380
you won't be afraid.

212
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,380
You won't leave me.

213
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,380
Shen Qingtang,

214
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,380
you're so stubborn.

215
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,380
I've never heard of it.

216
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,380
Shen Qingtang,

217
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,380
you've lost everything.

218
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,380
Even your life is mine.

219
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,380
Where else do you want to go?

220
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,380
I don't know.

221
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,380
Where else do you want to go?

222
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,380
Where else do you want to go?

223
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,380
No way.

224
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,380
That's just a dream.

225
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,380
There's still half a month left

226
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,380
before the final date.

227
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,380
That's the risk.

228
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,380
If you make a decision,

229
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,380
I'll continue to put up with

230
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,380
all the difficulties for you.

231
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
As for you,

232
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
you're the same as all these years.

233
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,380
If you don't want to,

234
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,380
I won't let you

235
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,380
interfere

236
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,380
in your wedding to Xi Yuan.

237
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,380
You're so stubborn.

238
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,380
Miss,

239
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,380
Young Master is kind to you, too.

240
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,380
It might be a good thing.

241
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
But in my opinion,

242
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,380
it's not just another spark.

243
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
I won't agree to it

244
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,380
and I won't marry Xi Yuan.

245
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,380
Miss Xinglu,

246
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,380
why didn't I see Brother Jingming

247
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,380
with you today?

248
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,380
What?

249
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,380
You're so anxious to seduce Brother Jingming?

250
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,380
Don't forget that you're a coward

251
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,380
to be a mother.

252
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,380
Even if you marry Xi Yuan,

253
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
you can only be a wedding wine maid.

254
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
You're just a child

255
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
who's in the belly

256
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,380
and can only be a maid

257
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,380
in Xi Yuan.

258
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,380
But those

259
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,380
who are beautiful and beautiful,

260
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,380
who are in the dark and gloomy world,

261
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
and who can't even

262
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,380
be a maid in the yard.

263
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,380
I'm a maid who's been raised by Pei's family,

264
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,380
but I want to be your mother.

265
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,380
I have a way.

266
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,380
What do you want to do?

267
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
You dare to harm my child

268
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
and the child in my belly?

269
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,380
I'm telling you,

270
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,380
I'm a maid.

271
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
I'm a maid who's been raised by Pei's family,

272
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,380
but I want to be your mother.

273
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,380
I'm a maid who's been raised by Pei's family,

274
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,380
but I want to be your mother.

275

I'm a maid who's been raised by Pei's family,

but I want to be your mother.

281
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
I'm telling you,

282
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,380
I'm a maid who's been raised by Pei's family,

283
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,380
but I want to be your mother.

284
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,380
I'm telling you,

285
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,380
I'm a maid who's been raised by Pei's family,

286
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,380
but I want to be your mother.

287

but I want to be your mother.

293
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,380
I'm telling you,

294

I'm a maid who's been raised by Pei's family,

I'm telling you,

297
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,380
