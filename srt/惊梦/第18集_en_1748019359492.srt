1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My Amazing Boyfriend

2
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,320
Episode 16

3
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Cut Me Out

4
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,880
Let me out!

5
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,280
I want to see the emperor!

6
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,680
He won't let me marry him!

7
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
He won't let me marry him!

8
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,680
I'm going to marry Pei Zongzhi!

9
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Your Highness,

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
stop thinking about Lord Pei.

11
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
He has already engaged with that woman.

12
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,680
He will be married to the emperor.

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
I'm in the city.

14
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,680
It's hard to maintain my life.

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,680
Please rest assured.

16
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,680
It's impossible. I don't believe it.

17
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,680
I don't believe it.

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,680
I don't believe it.

19
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
Pei Zongzhi,

20
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
you must not have thought about it.

21
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,680
The marriage you came back with so much effort,

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,680
you sent me to leave Pei's Mansion.

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
It's a real deal.

24
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
The marriage is here.

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Put it there.

26
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Zhao He?

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Shen Qingtang,

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,680
why did you come to love me?

29
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,680
You took Pei Zongzhi and ruined my life.

30
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
If it weren't for you,

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
how could I have been able to marry her?

32
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,680
I didn't think about marrying Pei Zongzhi.

33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,680
I didn't think that you were still in hate

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
until today.

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
Don't you understand?

36
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
Pei Zongzhi treats me like

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
a living hell to you.

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,680
We can't resist our fate.

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Even without me,

40
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,680
you can't marry Pei Zongzhi.

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
How is that possible?

42
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,680
I'm the princess of Hengguo.

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,680
I'll get what I want.

44
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Do you really think you can't live up to your own fate?

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
Do you really think that

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,680
by talking about the number of Pei Zongzhi,

47
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
you can have a marriage with a princess?

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
The one who decides is never her.

49
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
When there's no enemy,

50
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,680
you're the emperor who took the throne of Longle.

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
If there's an enemy,

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,680
you're the sacrifice that protects the court.

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
In front of their He Shan,

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,680
you're just a person who can be abandoned

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,680
and killed by the family.

56
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,680
How is that possible?

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
He's the most loyal to me.

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,680
He said he would always be loyal to me.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
How is that possible?

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
How is that possible?

61
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
He's the most loyal to me.

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
He said he would always be my witness.

63
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
That's impossible.

64
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
The so-called loyalty

65
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,680
is just a dream come true.

66
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Zhao He, you should wake up.

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
If you put all your hopes

68
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,680
on someone else,

69
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,680
and wait for a man to love you,

70
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,680
you'll only be able to accept such fate.

71
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Do you really think that?

72
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
You and I

73
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
are the pitiful people who are together.

74
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
You shouldn't hate me.

75
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
How is that possible?

76
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
It hurts.

77
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
It hurts.

78
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
You're pregnant.

79
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
No way.

80
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
I just drank a bottle of soup.

81
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
How is that possible?

82
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Let's go.

83
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Let's go.

84
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Let's go.

85
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
How is that possible?

86
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
Princess Zhao He left the palace without permission

87
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
and hurt my wife.

88
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
I will not let this go easily.

89
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
Qingtang.

90
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Your Highness.

91
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Qingtang.

92
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Qingtang.

93
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Qingtang.

94
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Qingtang.

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Qingtang.

96
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Shan Qingtang.

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
Go back, Your Highness.

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Go back.

99
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Qingtang.

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Let's go.

101
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Qingtang.

102
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Qingtang, you're scared.

103
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Qingtang.

104
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
Qingtang.

105
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
Don't make any more mistakes.

107
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Your Highness.

108
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Your Highness.

109
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Qingtang.

110
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Hurry up.

111
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Here's the water.

112
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Here's the water.

113
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Hurry up.

114
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Give me this.

115
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
I'll wash it.

116
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
How can you wash it?

117
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Go and change it.

118
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,680
Hurry up.

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
I'll wash it.

120
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Your Highness.

121
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Your Highness.

122
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
I don't want to leave you.

123
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
I'm so scared.

124
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Don't cry.

125
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Leave here.

126
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
I'm so scared.

127
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Remember.

128
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Live well.

129
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
If you find a chance,

130
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
you'll be in trouble.

131
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
I really can't.

132
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
The baby didn't protect me.

133
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Qingtang.

134
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
My lady is too worried.

135
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
I can take the medicine on fire.

136
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Your Highness.

137
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Fortunately, Miss Shen is alive.

138
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Why don't you go and see her?

139
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Qingtang.

140
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
I know you don't want to see me.

141
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
But you don't want to see me either.

142
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
I know you don't want to see me.

143
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
But you don't have to

144
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
treat yourself like this.

145
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
It's you.

146
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
You know

147
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,680
I've been drinking the soup with the nose in the dark.

148
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
So you changed the medicine on purpose.

149
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
You changed the medicine.

150
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
What?

151
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Yes.

152
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Anyway,

153
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
if you didn't do this,

154
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
I wouldn't have changed your baby.

155
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
It's impossible that

156
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,680
I lost my baby.

157
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
But what should I do?

158
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
I feel so bad.

159
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
You're so stubborn.

160
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
You want to take me in.

161
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,680
You want to kill me.

162
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
You said you'd hurt me.

163
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
You hurt me.

164
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Why do you still keep your word?

165
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
How much

166
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
is your true heart?

167
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
Because I don't want to

168
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
be in this deep grudge.

169
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
I want to give birth to

170
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
the baby that will repeat your life.

171
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Shen Qingtang.

172
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
This gate is locked by you.

173
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,680
You're here to lock me up again.

174
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Now this evil power

175
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
is all because of you.

176
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
I have no choice.

177
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
I'll never forgive you.

178
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
I'll never forgive you.

179
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
I'll never forgive you.

180
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Who's voice?

181
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,680
The sound of the lake.

182
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,680
The heart that is conquered by the light.

183
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,680
The heart that is so beautiful.

184
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,680
How can I get out of this dream

185
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,680
and run away from it?

186
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
I want to start a game

187
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,680
with the fire and the fire.

188
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
I'm not good at this.

189
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
If you're willing to

190
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
love me, how can you

191
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
hug me?

192
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
I'm not afraid of the rain and the wind.

193
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,680
I'm so happy.

194
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,680
I can't live without you.

195
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,680
How can I get out of this dream

196
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,680
and run away from it?

197
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
I want to start a game

198
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,680
with the fire and the fire.

199
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
I'm not good at this.

200
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
If you're willing to

201
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
love me, how can you

202
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
hug me?

203
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
I'm not afraid of the rain and the wind.

204
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,680
I'm so happy.

205
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,680
I can't live without you.

206
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,680
I'm not good at this.

207
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
If you're willing to love me, how can you

208
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,680
hug me?

209
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,680
I'm not good at this.

210
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
If you're willing to love me, how can you

211
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
hug me?

212
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
I'm not good at this.

213
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
If you're willing to love me, how can you

214
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
hug me?

215
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
I'm not good at this.

216
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
If you're willing to love me, how can you

217
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680
hug me?

218
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,680
I'm not good at this.
