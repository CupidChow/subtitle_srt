1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have never seen myself before.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How can I stay in this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How can I turn around and escape?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Or is it a game of ice and fire?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm curious.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How can I blame you? I'm willing to be your lover.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How can I hold you tight?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will clear my memories.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What's the point of dreaming?

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The Story of the Phoenix

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Episode 19

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thank you for coming to the mansion to celebrate my birthday.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
From now on, you and Congzhi will be married.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You will live in the mansion and be a family.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's so great.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If you marry from now on,

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Congzhi's elder sister will be my elder sister.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I will take her to my princess' mansion to celebrate.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you for your concern.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Congzhi's filial piety will be your sister.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I always think that I should arrange everything for my sister.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's why I'm willing to marry her.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Madam, although sister Qingtang is wronged by the Yan City Prince,

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
she should have arranged the next marriage for her.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Who said that?

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But the Prince loves her very much.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The noble ladies in the upper court can't even look at her.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why don't I arrange it?

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let the emperor give her a good marriage for her.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Miss, the Yan City Prince is here.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sister Qingtang, I'm not the one who should be married.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I know that you are insulted and have a hard time at night.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You said that you are lucky.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Tonight, you need to be in the palace.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We will be in the capital.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
From now on, we will be in the high seas.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We will not be in the hands of others.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What are you doing?

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This piece of paper is a good thing.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
When I drew the lantern, I didn't notice that my hand got infected with ink.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The paper is not finished yet.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If you have time, you can help her to draw the paper.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can take you to the hospital.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It seems that you are not in my shoes.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Today is the birthday banquet of the old lady.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Qingtang is not that kind of person.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't like the words on the lantern.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Mr. Tai, you are crazy.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You should know that this is my mind.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't have a big heart.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You can't do what I ask.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Besides,

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
the wedding of you and Zhao He is coming soon.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Your wish is to make a living.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will seriously consider these days.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I will do my best to fulfill all your wishes.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Whether it is to marry Zhao He or to return to Lingchun.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But,

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
you need some time.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Are you willing to wait for me?

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's it.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is the promise between us.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Qingtang,

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
you must keep it.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Although I can't go back to Lingchun with you now,

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I will return to Lingchun.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But this hairpin

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
is what I found from Lingchun.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It belongs to your mother.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Look at my hairpin.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It looks good.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's my favorite.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's so good.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Look at it.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's flying up.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's so high.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Isn't this the palace of Princess of Wanyi?

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What a good friend.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Pei Congzhi,

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I came to your mansion to see you

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and the show of love and respect with the broken glass.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's a game of fighting with one another.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's not fighting with one another.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I will turn it into a great honor.

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What do you mean?

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Before this day,

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I already asked His Majesty to cancel our engagement.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What?

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
How dare you?

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Impossible.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The court is talking about Princess of Wanyi.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Brother,

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
it's impossible for you to make such a living.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do you think

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
your own money and salt can be worth a few thousand?

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's more than the money spent on me.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You are here to help me

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
to repair the army.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You are just a royal family.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You want to make me your wife?

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you don't believe me,

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
let's wait and see.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Then it depends on your retirement.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Or the emperor will give you a wedding gift.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Sister Qingtang,

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I thought you wouldn't come.

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You and I were engaged before.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The water was like salt.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I didn't protect you.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I deserve to die.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I know.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Brother Yan Cheng is not in a good mood.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
How could he blame you?

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
When I left,

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I avoided the company of the people and the people.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I shouldn't have been noticed.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Take me away.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's leave here together.

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We avoid the mortal world.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I will accompany you in the future.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I won't let you suffer.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Congzhi,

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
we have known each other for a long time.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Can we be friends in the future?

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let me take Qingtang away.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I will treat her well.

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I won't let you down.

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Prince Yan Cheng,

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
my sister is not young.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But as a brother,

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I can't let her do anything

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that makes her so stubborn.

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Shen Qingtang

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
is not here yet.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
She is my master.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's none of Qingtang's business.

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's hard for Prince Yan Cheng to be so affectionate.

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Sister,

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I should think about

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
this real life for a while.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You should think it over.

148
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you really leave,

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
you will never see

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
someone else.

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I made a mistake.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's a pity.

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We are destined to be together.

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We have been together for a long time.

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We are destined to be together.

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Qingtang,

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
don't be afraid.

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Come with me.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Prince Yan Cheng,

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Qingtang has been sincere to you

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
since I was born.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I am just a servant

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
of Prince Pingnan's Mansion.

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He is just a rich man.

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Qingtang,

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't believe

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
why you suddenly said

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
this kind of thing.

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Then what is the meaning

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
of our previous relationship?

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Because I am a bad girl,

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I just want to be the noble master of the high school.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I want to marry you.

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Marry someone else.

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's the same.

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I am afraid that

177
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I will be in trouble

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
if I don't marry you.

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I am afraid that

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I will be in trouble

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
if I don't marry you.

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Anyway,

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
why don't you let me go?

184
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You won't have a baby anymore.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Shen Qingtang.

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Long time no see,

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I have been with you for a long time.

188
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
My heart is in pain.

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Is it soft or delicate?

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Whose voice is it?

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's a lake.

192
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
My heart is in pain.

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't see myself.

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
How can I be more willing

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
to be in this dream?

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
How can I be more willing to be in this dream?

197
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Or should I just

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
follow the game?

199
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I am afraid that

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I will be in trouble

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
if I don't marry you.

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
How can I be more willing

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
to be in this dream?

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
How can I be more willing

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
to be in this dream?

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I am afraid that

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I will be in trouble

208
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
if I don't marry you.

209
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can't see myself.

210
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
How can I be more willing to be in this dream?

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
How can I be more willing to be in this dream?

212
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Or should I just follow the game?

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I am afraid that

214
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I will be in trouble if I don't marry you.

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The End
