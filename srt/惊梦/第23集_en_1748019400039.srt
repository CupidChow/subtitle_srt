1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I turn around and escape?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or do I have to play games with the fire?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm so curious!

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How can I blame you for being cruel?

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How can I hug you?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will wake up the memories

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I dreamt of you, so I'm sad

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Episode 1

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Qingtang and I have made an appointment.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why are you here again?

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm a doctor from Xuanhu.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I know some magic tricks.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why can't I come?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay, then Dr. Pei.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
When I see someone, I feel that the mood is not good.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Can you show me what the real problem is?

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a small and fierce fight.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's not a big deal.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mr. Yan, please take care of yourself.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You...

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Be careful!

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How is it?

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
His injury is serious.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If he doesn't hurry up and pack,

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
it's hard to find a clinic.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hurry up and cure him.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hurry up. I have medicine here.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hold on.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Dr. Pei!

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If...

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
we come back again...

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If...

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
we come back again...

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
if we come back again...

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When I got lost,

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
he really didn't come to see me.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He really didn't come to see me.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He was with Yan Cheng.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Mr. Yan,

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
my lady and Mr. Yan

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
are close friends.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You should give up.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's good for each other.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Mr. Yan Cheng!

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Mr. Yan Cheng!

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You finally came.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
My lady is waiting in the room.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Come with me.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Here.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It turns out...

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
he can live better

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
without me.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I lost.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Qing Tao.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You are here.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I saw you were not in a good mood yesterday.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This warm bath can nourish your mind.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Here.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Here.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm 17 years old.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He was in high school and was in the Hanlin.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
His Majesty gave him a hot bath.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Pei and I

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
didn't want to give him a bath.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But we gave him to you.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why didn't you let him go?

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You accepted him.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You saw his goodness.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't you like him?

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll find you some other treasures next time.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm just tired.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll go get you some tea.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Qing Tao.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You remember it long ago, right?

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I remember it.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I saw it too.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I thought

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I would never see it again.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You were worried about him that day.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Even if you don't remember anything,

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
you still keep it in your mind.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
In the past,

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I always thought I hated him.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I wanted to leave him for a long time.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But until today,

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I realized

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we were the two most indomitable people in the world.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I have a lot of love for him.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Love

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
has no much.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry, Yan Cheng.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
During this time,

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
you misunderstood our relationship.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You don't need to apologize.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Qing Tao.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm more than happy with you.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I just want to do my best to treat you well.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But I can't have

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
any feelings for you.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Right?

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Do you still remember when you first met him?

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I promised you to go see the light of the desert.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You will come to see it in the future.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
With Zi Yu's help,

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you will come to me.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Qing Tao.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If I met you first,

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I would be more than happy with you.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I will be more than happy with you.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I will be more than happy with you.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I will be more than happy with you.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I met you first.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Will the person you love be me?

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yan Cheng.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Stop.

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I was so closing to her.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Mr. Pei.

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I have something to say to you.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I still have something to tell you.

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,640
Because of what?

131
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,440
Fairyrapa,

132
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,320
I am here to indicate myself to you,

133
00:08:46,840 --> 00:09:07,000
and may I recall yourлиnd

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,200
Victory,

135
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,960
how can you leave me

136
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,160
to a profession in the Black Split Talisman?

137
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,680
But to forget me

138
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,520
is meant to help you.

139
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,080
That's good.

140
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,200
But Green Weasel

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,440
is just like Childe Pei

142
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,920
who on the way back to the Capital,

143
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,400
can quit his life

144
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,040
for good.

145
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,880
The past is what I yearn of.

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,420
Perhaps now is the day

147
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,660
Who's voice

148
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:54,620
Suddenly

149
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,780
I also wish you and Yanzhu

150
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,840
Presto

151
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,040
I want to live a game

152
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,720
How to get rid of the hatred

153
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,360
How to get rid of the hatred

154
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,000
How to get rid of the hatred

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,240
How to get rid of the hatred

156
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will wake up the memories

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,400
I dream that there is no trace

158
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,240
leaves

159
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,040
flying

160
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,280
Make go through andよう

161
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,320
You

162
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,640
In your heart

163
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,280
When my heart is silent

164
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,140
Whose voice

165
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,480
sweeter and sweeter

166
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,440
My inanimate heart
