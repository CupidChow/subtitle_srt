1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have never seen myself before.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How can I get out of this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How can I get out of this dream?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Love is a game of playing games.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm so curious.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How can I get out of this dream?

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If I can't, how can I forget my old days?

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
See each other again.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Only You

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Episode 10

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
Where's everyone who

13
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,240
knows Chun Chao's dead body?

14
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,320
Master,

15
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,520
this wound is painful.

16
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,240
Wu An.

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,440
Master,

18
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,080
why are you

19
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,440
so affectionate to her?

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
You ese usmå¸ƒ,

21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,480
with those

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,360
Your Highness,

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,520
why didn't you take back

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,840
the girl from Yan City

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
with your true heart?

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
This time,

27
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,960
I don't want to force her.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,440
If this is her wish,

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
as long as she is happy,

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,320
and content,

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,040
that's good.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,800
Miss.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,680
What's wrong?

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,520
Aren't you

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,840
visiting Mr. Yan today?

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,680
He is gone.

37
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,680
He is gone?

38
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,160
Where did he go?

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,200
He went back to the Tombkeeper Master alone.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,080
Miss.

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Have you remembered it all?

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,440
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
My lady.

44
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,760
You remember everything.

45
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,760
Well.

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,200
What about you and Lord Yan Cheng?

47
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,280
I went to see

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,920
Pei Congzhi today.

49
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,600
What happened?

50
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,680
I wanted to tell him

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,240
that I've decided to let go of my past

52
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,720
and start over with him.

53
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
But he told me

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,360
he would return to the imperial court

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,320
and be the prime minister of the high court.

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,160
Then everything

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,760
will be back to normal.

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,640
I definitely think about it.

59
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,560
Is there really nothing for me to do?

60
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,100
The arrow Prince Pingnan used

61
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,040
to shoot Pei during was dont' give in.

62
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,640
I have no medicine for now.

63
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,240
I can only use the medicine to suppress it.

64
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,520
But if I continue like this,

65
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,400
I'm afraid I'll die.

66
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,680
I should take you back to the palace

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,160
and find a doctor.

68
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,640
Miss Shen, why are you here?

69
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,840
Where's your young master?

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
My young master is not well.

71
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,440
He doesn't want to see you.

72
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,040
But Yan Shu, do you want to see him die?

73
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
I don't want to.

74
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,440
I used to be gentle, but I don't want to be.

75
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,440
My blood may be useful.

76
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,480
I made him use this.

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,440
Aren't you a coincidence?

78
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
Can you tell me who it is?

79
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,160
The medicine is quite effective.

80
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,080
It's just that it can spread blood all over.

81
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,600
Really?

82
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Maybe it was Doctor Zhao who referred to it as a Fiiga disease.

83
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,400
That's it.

84
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
You can only cure your illness.

85
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,040
You are my master's savior.

86
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Why do you still keep it from me?

87
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Why?

88
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
You didn't want to come here to save my life.

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
But you left without saying goodbye.

90
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,040
Qingtang only wants to repay your kindness.

91
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
I am a person who has no friends.

92
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
I don't want to have money or connections.

93
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,040
We meet each other and say goodbye.

94
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
You want to go back to Lingchuan?

95
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
To get married in Yan City?

96
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Can you marry him?

97
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Since you came back to the city,

98
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,040
you chose to be your master.

99
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Why do you still remember my hometown?

100
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
I don't want to be the mother of the house in the yard.

101
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I don't want to be trapped in that cage.

102
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
If the world is closed,

103
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
it's not what I want.

104
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
You want to go back to Lingchuan,

105
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,040
enjoy yourself and live a peaceful life.

106
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
That's the freedom that you can get from paying for it.

107
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
I shouldn't have any money.

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
But Qingtang,

109
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
I can't bear it.

110
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
I can't bear it.

111
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
But why?

112
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
But why?

113
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
You always said that everything must start from the beginning.

114
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
But you never saw me

115
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,040
at the door of the mansion.

116
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
You...

117
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
remember everything?

118
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Yes.

119
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
I remember everything.

120
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
And everything that you did to me.

121
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
It's my fault.

123
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
I didn't have the right

124
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
to beg for your forgiveness.

125
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
You should leave.

126
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Since you've chosen Yan Cheng,

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
I'll let you go freely.

128
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,040
I'll be your slave.

129
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Yan Cheng has gone back to the desert.

130
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
I've never had a marriage

131
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
between him and me.

132
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
I'll leave.

133
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Anyway,

134
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
from the beginning of the promise of the God,

135
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
we are the brothers who love each other.

136
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
We are the rivals of the wishful side.

137
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
You are the love of Qiuxiu Palace.

138
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
All the happiness and coldness in my life

139
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
are because of you.

140
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
How can we

141
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
break up now?

142
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,040
That's what we should be like.

143
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Life and death are complicated.

144
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Love is like death.

145
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
You are...

146
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
you are...

147
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
You are willing to start over

148
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
with me.

149
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
I'm willing to...

150
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
my life.

151
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Since I was Th eased,

152
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
I hope

153
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
to go on like this.

154
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm afraid I'll be late.

155
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
I'll go to the hotel.

156
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
I'll go to the hotel.

157
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
I'll go to the hotel.

158
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
I'll go to the hotel.

159
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
I'll go to the hotel.

160
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
I'll go to the hotel.

161
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
I'll go to the hotel.

162
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
I'll go to the hotel.

163
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
I'll go to the hotel.

164
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
I'll go to the hotel.

165
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
I'll go to the hotel.

166
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
I'll go to the hotel.

167
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
I'll go to the hotel.

168
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
I'll go to the hotel.

169
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
I'll go to the hotel.

170
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
I'll go to the hotel.

171
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
I'll go to the hotel.

172
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
I'll go to the hotel.

173
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
I'll go to the hotel.

174
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
I'll go to the hotel.

175
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
I'll go to the hotel.

176
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
I'll go to the hotel.

177
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
I'll go to the hotel.

178
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
I'll go to the hotel.

179
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
I'll go to the hotel.

180
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
I'll go to the hotel.

181
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
I'll go to the hotel.

182
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
I'll go to the hotel.

183
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
I'll go to the hotel.

184
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
I'll go to the hotel.

185
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
I'll go to the hotel.

186
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
I'll go to the hotel.

187
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
I'll go to the hotel.

188
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
I'll go to the hotel.

189
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
