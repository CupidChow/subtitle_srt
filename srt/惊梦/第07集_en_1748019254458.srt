1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I get out of this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I get out of this dream?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Love is a game of light and light

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm curious about it

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm willing to hate you, I'm willing to hug you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and memories

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and memories

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The dream is over, why do I have to leave?

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The Dreamer

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Episode 19

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But Shen Xingtang, don't forget

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You were 15 years old

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You helped me destroy the Qing Dynasty

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You helped me to kill the Qing Dynasty

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You helped me to kill the Qing Dynasty

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm your help

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But that's my instinct

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's because you clearly killed me

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If I don't do that

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Can I still survive?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm a daughter of a family

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I can't live without anyone

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have to be a little man

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
To find out who is the best person in the family

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I know who you are

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But I'm afraid of cowardice and helplessness

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can only be a good sister who can do anything

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've been enough to live a life like this

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I thought you were a pain in the neck

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're the one who made me lose my sight

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can take me with you

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
15 years ago, we were together

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You were no longer a sister to me

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But now you tell me

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How could you hate me?

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Shen Xingtang

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You could have lied to me for a lifetime

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why did you tell me to die?

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you make a mistake in this matter

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Then I won't tell you clearly

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We will never be in love

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Shen Xingtang

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You are the one who made me beg you

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
How many times do I have to give you a chance?

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You are still alive

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You have long been in love with me

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And I have been so helpless all the way

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
People like us

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Are destined to be in love with each other

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Can I let go of my hand?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't you think you still have the right to marry me?

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The taste of the sea and the sea

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Do you still love the taste of the sea and the sea?

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why?

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you remember

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
When did I start to appear in your dreams?

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A month ago, on the way to Wang'an Temple

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We lived together for a whole family

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Miss, this incense house is very deep

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm afraid there will be many people

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Send some of the incense from the Quwen's house

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can go to bed after you finish your work

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll be fine when I get home

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What you don't know is

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
In your encounter with the door

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
My mother is in a relationship with her father-in-law

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I also asked for a incense from the inn

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What's this?

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't help it

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That night, I sent the incense to the wrong room

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Sir, what do you want?

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I thought that you would find out something

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That you wouldn't be in trouble

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't want to investigate the ugly things of my mother

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I did find out that you did

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The incense was poisoned

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I know

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Please come in

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Please come in

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll help you

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Help me

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Help me

87
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Help me

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You took the medicine?

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The medicine was too heavy

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I was not sober

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I took it wrong

92
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I was a dream

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then we...

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We won't...

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You are so clever

96
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Why don't you guess it yourself?

97
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm not a dreamer

98
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm a dreamer

99
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm a dreamer

100
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm a dreamer

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm a dreamer

102
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm a dreamer

103
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm a dreamer

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm a dreamer

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm a dreamer

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm a dreamer

107
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm a dreamer

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm a dreamer

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm a dreamer

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm a dreamer

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm a dreamer

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm a dreamer

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
In order to benefit your mother

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You aren't afraid to kill a dream

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If there is something hidden somewhere

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm not afraid of life

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Where did you get this?

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I drew it

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
on the pretext of a hero

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
A modern artist

121
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
who's the most important reason

122
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,500
I don't want to see you again.

123
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,100
My Lady,

124
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,000
she asked me to bring this to you.

125
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,900
I hope you can start and

126
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,380
stop persecuting her.

127
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,780
Shui,

128
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:51,860
get you a broom.

129
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,560
I dare to come here to fight with you.

130
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,480
A gold lock

131
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,640
is called a lock for life.

132
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,920
Brother, please let me out.

133
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,080
It's all Qingtang's fault.

134
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,880
I dare not go out of the mansion.

135
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,600
I sneaked out of the mansion

136
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,600
and was swallowed by the snake.

137
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,320
I won't give you any trouble.

138
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,720
You will be lucky.

139
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,960
If Brotherfician can't get hold of me,

140
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,560
I won't mastery.

141
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,920
Trick treated

142
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:44,060
Agriculture

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,720
Sisters

144
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,120
Sister

145
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,280
I asked her to give it to you.

146
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,920
She was so heartless

147
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,920
and made you feel guilty.

148
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,680
Don't blame her.

149
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,600
This is a natural thing.

150
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,240
How could I blame you?

151
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,920
The crown prince came to the mansion today.

152
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,320
I believe that there are still

153
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,960
some things that can be broken.

154
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,040
As long as you are sincere,

155
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,360
there will be good cause and effect.

156
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,440
Let's go.

157
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
I thought that

158
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,840
even if it's a good cause and effect,

159
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,760
why bother to ask for these anti-signals?

160
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,880
My wife has always treated you

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,480
as her own granddaughter.

162
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,480
The anti-signals

163
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,320
will never belong to any family.

164
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,200
Qingtang is in my eyes.

165
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,920
She is the only woman in the world.

166
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,640
If she is not married into the palace,

167
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,600
why not

168
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,160
make the marriage between the crown prince and you

169
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,080
be the same?

170
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,400
We will be together for a long time.

171
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,280
I am willing to do that.

172
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,480
But I don't know...

173
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,080
Good boy.

174
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,280
I finally have a day.

175
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,040
If your own grandmother is still alive,

176
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,120
how happy would she be?

177
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,720
The marriage is a big deal.

178
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,600
Although the grandmother and the crown prince are meaningful,

179
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,080
I am the master of the Pei family now.

180
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:28,180
という

181
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

182
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

183
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

184
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

185
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

186
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

187
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

188
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

189
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

190
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

191
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

192
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

193
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

194
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.

195
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Because...

196
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,280
I and I have never met.

197
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,280
If I had known...

198
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,660
On my own back...

199
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,660
That I've been lost in that time...

200
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,460
But I...

201
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:39,180
Can never forget this and the novel of me never changed.

202
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,420
I'm afraid that...

203
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,260
On my own back...

204
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,760
Can never forget this and the novel of me never changed.

205
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm afraid that I'll be lost again.
