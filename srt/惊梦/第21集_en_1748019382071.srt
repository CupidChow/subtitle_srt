1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have never seen myself before.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How can I get out of this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How can I get out of this dream?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Or is it just a game?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm so curious.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How can I blame you? I'm willing to hate you.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How can I hold you back?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and memories.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't have any regrets in my dream.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Love by the River

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Episode 19

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You knew my identity. You would bring me a secret weapon.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why did you have to protect me?

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I only want you to know who you are.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But I don't know you hate me so much.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Even if I'm close to you, you must get out of here.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Go!

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He Zongzhi!

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He Zongzhi!

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He Zongzhi!

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He Zongzhi!

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I...

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I...

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I regret it.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I used to be a living hell.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I shouldn't have forced you.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're leaving.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm afraid of the wind and memories.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't have any regrets in my dream.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The love by the river

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't have any regrets in my dream.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm afraid of the wind and memories.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't know you hate me so much.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Even if I'm close to you, you must get out of here.

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The flowers are falling gently.

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They're falling slowly in my heart.

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm afraid of the wind and memories.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm afraid of the wind and memories.

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The moon is shining.

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The sky is shining.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The sky is shining.

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The sky is shining.

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The sky is shining.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Can you forgive me?

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll take you away.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll take you away.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't go.

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll take you away.

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I won't go back.

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll take you away.

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Pei Tengzhi.

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Pei Tengzhi.

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The wind and memories.

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Miss. Miss.

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Are you awake?

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Where are we?

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Miss, you forgot again.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is your home, Lingchuan.

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm your maid, Caiwei.

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You don't remember?

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I forgot again.

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
When we were in the mountains,

72
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
we had to pick herbs and herbs.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You didn't fall down the mountain.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The doctor said it was a blood pressure.

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's possible that you lost your memory.

76
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You really don't remember anything now?

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Caiwei.

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I fell down the cliff that day.

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Was it only me?

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Did I go there at the same time?

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Did I have a...

82
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
a young master with me?

83
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No.

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I went to the mountain with you that day.

85
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Miss.

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You should rest for a while.

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll go get the medicine for you.

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.

89
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm here.

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
A few days ago,

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I got a few herbs.

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Your master was laughing when he drank them.

95
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The herbs you gave me are all good.

96
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
My lady is awake now.

97
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Except...

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
he forgot everything.

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I really don't remember anything.

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The doctor said

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
people who suffer a lot

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
will forget the past and force themselves.

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Some people may never remember it again.

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There are still a few herbs.

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Go back and give it to him on time.

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Your master.

107
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
My lady has already forgotten everything.

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If you really love him,

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
please let him go.

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's forget about him.

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He hates me.

112
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He doesn't want to remember me.

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If he wants to sacrifice himself,

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
he has to sacrifice himself.

115
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can also not be a companion.

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If this time,

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
we come back to the palace,

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
he still can't accept me.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I will

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
let him go completely.

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Mr. An,

122
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I have done everything.

123
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I caught a snake

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and put it on the way to Miss Qingtang's front.

125
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
When she is scared,

126
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
don't worry, she is not poisonous.

127
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
When that time comes,

128
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
you'll just get out of there.

129
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
My lady,

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I won't leave you alone.

131
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I will.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
My lady.

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I will.

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I will.

135
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
My lady.

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I will.

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Mr. An,

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
you know my lady

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
doesn't like you the most.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You are just a fool.

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I was born to be like this.

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I will do this only.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
According to what you said,

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the mind of a woman

145
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
is still the same as the magic of a hero.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Is it really useful?

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mr. An, believe me.

148
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
These are all the words of the people.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Hurry, hurry.

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
She is just like the one in the big flower shop.

151
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Miss Da Xun.

152
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Are you all right?

153
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm fine.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I just have to slip all the time.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you for your help.

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I am so sorry to take your place.

157
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You don't need to be so polite.

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,960
I'll help you.

159
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,240
You don't need to thank me for your help.

160
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,520
You'll come here

161
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,800
to marry me, right?

162
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm a master of the Escort.

163
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,120
I live in Lingchuan Town.

164
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,520
Are you really okay with your foot?

165
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,920
I'm fine.

166
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,840
But...

167
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,960
Sir,

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,200
have we met before?

169
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,560
Maybe.

170
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,240
I think you're also familiar with

171
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,600
the fate of the Escort.

172
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,560
You're so close to me.

173
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,080
Let's go.

174
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,840
You're the Crown Prince of Yan City.

175
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
I think

176
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,720
you two are more suitable for each other.

177
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,160
It's him again.

178
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,760
Why is there him everywhere?
