1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I get through this?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or is it just a game?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm curious about it

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm willing to be with you

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How can I hold you tight?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will wake up the memories

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What's the point of dreaming?

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Look. Nothing's got to happen

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hurry up

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't try to fool me

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I already have my life

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I lose my life

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't want to marry the smooth man

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,820
What's worse, the old dragon

18
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,840
Dad Hall didn't like my dreams

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,320
if I don't return back to normal?

20
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,240
Li Bu's仇 is Rhode Island and

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,640
the four Andrews are like the hua hometown.

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,440
Brother keeps saying that

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,880
she's returned to my home

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,560
and she wants to regionswipen for me

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
and I'm so sorry.

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,860
I'm

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,440
the one who said that.

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,720
You really think

29
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,840
I will use those unloved means.

30
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,000
All the battles

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
in your eyes

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,120
are so ridiculous.

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,600
How could I think you are ridiculous?

34
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,360
You are a smart girl.

35
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,400
If you don't hit a hard wall,

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,640
you will never be happy.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,720
She...

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,560
She,

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,000
is not even naked.

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,760
Why do you take care of it alone?

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,480
She was not falling.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,320
Why not我很清楚?

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,880
If I tell you something,

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,800
you will be happy.

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,720
Be happy.

46
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
How could she die like this?

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
But in my opinion,

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
the woman who ruined my life

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
is the only one who died.

50
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Am I not your retreat?

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
Since I was little,

52
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
I've been a little bit worried.

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
I've been a little worried.

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
I've been a little worried.

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
I've been a little worried.

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
I've been worried that you would be happy.

57
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
I want to win.

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
I have to be far away

59
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
from what you've done.

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
I should have known that.

61
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
What you want

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
is always my support.

63
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
I'm so happy.

64
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Just like now,

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
I'll stay as long as you want.

66
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
I'll stay as long as you want.

67
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
I have to keep my promise.

68
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
I'll keep my promise.

69
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
I'll keep my promise.

70
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
I'll keep my promise.

71
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
I'm done.

72
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,960
Just tell me where you are.

73
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,760
You are my fault,

74
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,040
I do not dare to despise you.

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Help brother

76
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,580
Ohhproducts

77
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,100
in flight

78
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
and

79
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,600
Prai Zi

80
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,780
A long years time

81
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,580
were really long ago

82
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,580
I will win

83
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,580
if I have to.

84
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,380
I have to be far away from you.

85
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,180
But it's always like this.

86
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,180
But I'm not a bird.

87
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,380
I'm a person who is free,

88
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,380
who has dignity,

89
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,580
and who is alive.

90
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,180
I want to control my own destiny.

91
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,180
And I'm not a toy

92
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,580
in this world.

93
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,180
I'm a person who is free,

94
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,380
who has dignity,

95
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,380
and who is alive.

96
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,180
I'm a person who is free,

97
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,180
who has dignity,

98
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,180
and who is alive.

99
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,580
I want to be the leader.

100
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,180
Even so,

101
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,180
I will take your strength

102
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,580
and take it with me.

103
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,580
I will take your pride

104
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,580
and take your punishment.

105
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,580
Da Songzhi.

106
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
Da Songzhi.

107
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,380
You really want to die?

108
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,180
You don't want to win me?

109
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,180
I thought

110
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,180
everything was in your control.

111
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,180
But in this world,

112
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,580
even if something happens,

113
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,180
death won't be as good as you.

114
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,180
Shi Qingtang.

115
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,180
You can take care of everyone.

116
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,180
Why don't you want to follow me

117
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,580
and love me?

118
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,580
Maybe because

119
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,780
I'm the same person as you.

120
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,980
I'm the same bad guy.

121
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,980
I'm the same person.

122
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,780
I'm the same person.

123
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,380
How can a person like us

124
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,380
be loved?

125
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,780
So,

126
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,580
from the beginning,

127
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,580
I was wrong, right?

128
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,580
From the beginning to the end,

129
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,580
we were all wrong.

130
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,380
I know you are cold-hearted.

131
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,780
But in this world,

132
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,580
you are not as wild as before.

133
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,380
If one day you really dare to die,

134
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,780
the person you care about,

135
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,580
Pei Ziqi,

136
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,980
Cai Wei,

137
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:32,580
and your heart-to-heart

138
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,580
will be buried for you.

139
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,580
You...

140
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,580
Even if I'm wrong,

141
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,780
I will keep you by my side.

142
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:52,980
I will never forget you.

143
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,180
What's wrong with you?

144
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,180
Nothing.

145
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,780
Miss Shi Qingtang?

146
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,580
You haven't told her yet.

147
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,180
You didn't tell her the message in the daytime.

148
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,980
You even had a big fight with Mrs. Lao

149
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,780
for her.

150
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,980
The enemy has arranged it.

151
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,180
They promise to get married today.

152
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,180
They can't do anything about it.

153
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,380
Okay.

154
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,780
Today,

155
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,180
about Miss Liuluo's case,

156
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,580
I don't know who told her.

157
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,380
In the room,

158
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,180
Liu Chuan said something bad.

159
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,580
It seems

160
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,380
I don't want to get married today.

161
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,780
It's not worth it.

162
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,380
The enemy sent such a bad thing that day.

163
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,780
Even if they are getting married,

164
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,980
how can I repay them?

165
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,980
Even if they die today,

166
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,380
they won't allow me to be with them.

167
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,380
Mother.

168
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,780
No matter who I am,

169
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,180
they are all my people.

170
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,780
They are also my people.

171
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,380
You and Niezhang

172
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,980
have lost your identity

173
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,780
for a adopted daughter.

174
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,380
Put the Li away.

175
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,780
Take her away.

176
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,180
Go.

177
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,580
No.

178
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,180
You are a hard worker.

179
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,580
Why didn't you let her know?

180
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,980
You even gave birth to a baby.

181
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,180
In her eyes,

182
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,580
I am so beautiful.

183
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,780
Why did you let her know me?

184
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,380
It's just that

185
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,580
after Miss Shen's death,

186
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,380
she might have been more miserable.

187
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,780
You are right.

188
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,780
Go and check

189
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,180
whether it's true or not.

190
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,180
Yes.

191
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,580
Ke Shui.

192
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,380
The day is long.

193
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,780
The husband is capable of doing things.

194
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,380
For a woman,

195
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,580
he is a man of the heart.

196
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,780
What's the point?

197
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,180
What's the point?

198
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,580
What's the point?

199
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,980
If I go to the border,

200
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,380
I will be in trouble for three years.

201
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,580
How can I ever see Qingtang again?

202
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,980
I think you are a coward.

203
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,180
You have been in the army for more than ten years.

204
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,580
The Sun Ziping method

205
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
is thirty-sixth level.

206
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,180
Eighth level.

207
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,380
Ready.

208
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,580
I...

209
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,380
Mingxiu is here.

210
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,180
The secret passage is hidden.

211
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,180
Father,

212
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,380
you are the four of you and me.

213
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,180
All right.

214
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
Don't be anxious.

215
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,780
Your mother is watching you closely.

216
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,380
You have to go through some time

217
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,380
to come back.

218
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,180
Yes, father.
