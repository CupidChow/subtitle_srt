1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I have never seen myself before.

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How can I stay in this dream?

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How can I get out of this dream?

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Or is it just a game?

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm curious.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How can I hold you in my arms?

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will wake up the memories.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't know what to do in my dream.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Episode 1

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You didn't.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Why did you...

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Even that day,

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I didn't do anything.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But until now,

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
we are still in love.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why not?

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If you don't care about my feelings for Yiyuan,

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
you can let us never get back together.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But you didn't do anything.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Isn't that right?

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Anyway,

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
even if I become the wife of Lei Yancheng,

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I will still use my sister's identity

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to truly pray for you.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm afraid that you can find someone who can live a life.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's let everything return to normal, okay?

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Shen Qitao!

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I just want to know

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
if you ever had any feelings for me

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
in your heart.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Get out of here!

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Get out!

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was also totally convinced.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I trusted you.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
what exactly is there to talk to you?

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Are you a toy controlled by me?

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Or do you want to be a tool for killing?

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Even if we have feelings,

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
how can we deal with the family problems?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We will meet again.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We will never be apart.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Get out of here!

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Get out of here!

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Get out of here!

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I have never had any feelings for you.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can't even talk about love.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Even if you don't love me,

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I will try my best to keep you company.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I will be at home

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
waiting for you to come back.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Caiwei, how long will it take?

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Soon.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This way is for the King of the South.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It will be smooth.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The bride is here!

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Where is the King?

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Caiwei.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Miss, don't worry.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I will go and see what's going on.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Miss,

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I will go and see what's going on.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you really want to be with me,

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
you must go.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's go.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The King of the South is getting married.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No way.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The King of the South has sent a letter to me.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He wants my daughter to marry him.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why should the King of the South be so stubborn?

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We want to see the King.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Miss Shen, you don't know anything.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You are like a woman who is like a sweet water.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How can you be with the King?

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hurry up.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's go.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Miss,

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
they don't let us talk about it.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They want to get married.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Miss Shen, please go back.

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The wedding invitation will be sent to the mansion.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I have made an appointment with Prince Yan Cheng.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He wants to marry me today.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He wants to marry me.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Even if he doesn't marry me,

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I will wait for him to come out.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He will explain to me.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mother, the time has come.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Qingtang is still waiting for me outside.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let me out.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
How can you keep it from me?

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Mother, I didn't.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like the day,

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I saved Qingtang by myself.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can prove that she is innocent.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Besides, she is also a helpless person.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I was afraid that you would be heartless.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You are afraid that I will be heartless?

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You are afraid that I will be heartless?

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You can't let this man marry you.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I will be heartless today.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's impossible for you to marry a prince like him.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Lock him up in the hall.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Mother.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can't come out.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Father, please help me.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Mother, don't let me blame you.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Mother.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You want to blame me forever.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You don't want to spend your life in others' filial piety.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What?

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You still think it's a waste of time?

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You should have listened to me at the beginning.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You are a member of the guard of the Chen'er School.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You won't have any trouble today.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
How could you...

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
How could you tell me?

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
From now on, if he still doesn't stop,

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Tianji will be able to accompany his daughter

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
to take her back to the border.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's better for him to stop his thoughts.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Please.

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Nothing was the choice

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,960
At this event,

127
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,640
we have to get to visit the King of sicher.

128
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,800
Instead, I must cultivate love.

129
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,640
If the public

130
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,120
dares to forget it any more,

131
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,480
they'll all probably just

132
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,000
calm down the wound

133
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,300
and Dan Zi's firing

134
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,440
to Å¾ear my arms into it.

135
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Go home.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to return to my home.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
How can I stay in this dream?

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How can I turn around and run away?

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Or should I go through the fire and become a game?

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How can I get up and get up?

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How can I blame you for being cruel to you?

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
How can I hug you?

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to return to my home in a flash.

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't want to be cruel to you.

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The days are flying,

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the leaves are falling,

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the night is in my heart.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,800
Is it gentleness or

149
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
who's voice?

150
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:59,800
The heart that is shared by the audience can be seen by the reflection.

151
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,800
How can I stay in this dream?

152
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,800
How can I turn around and run away?

153
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,600
Or should I go through the fire and become a game?

154
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
How can I get up and get up?

155
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
How can I blame you for being cruel to you?

156
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,600
How can I hug you?

157
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm afraid that I'll be able to return to my home in a flash.

158
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I don't want to be cruel to you.
