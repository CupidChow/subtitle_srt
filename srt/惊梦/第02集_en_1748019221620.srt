1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why I have never seen myself before

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How to get out of this dream

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How to turn around

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Love is a game of ice and fire

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm curious about it

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you are willing to be with me

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How to hold you tight

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will wake up the memories

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What's the point of dreaming about the past

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Episode 1

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Episode 2

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Speak!

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Who's the one who's going to talk to Master?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Speak!

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Your wife and daughter are in my hands

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is the last chance for you to beg for mercy

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You little disciple

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You can't die

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Every word you say now

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Your wife and daughter will be broken into pieces

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
King of Pingnan

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The one who sent me to assassinate you is King of Pingnan

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He said you are the late emperor of the imperial court

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You will be in danger one day

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Go away

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My lord

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This person has been in a hurry since the imperial court

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I have killed myself

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's bad to work here

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There is water in the house

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Miss Shen has been in trouble

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
She's gone

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
She's gone

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
She's gone

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She's gone

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't worry about her

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't worry about her

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't worry about her

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Go

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Shen Qingtang

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Qingtang

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Qingtang

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Qingtang

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Qingtang

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Xiaoqian

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Xiaoqian

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What's going on?

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Qingtang

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She's been in a bad mood

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
She's been in a bad mood

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It must be Xinglu

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It must be Xinglu

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
She was the one who sent you to the bad mood

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
She was the one who sent you to the bad mood

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You guys go away

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't touch her

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I saw it

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's Miss Xinglu

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I went to the imperial court today

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's all your fault

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You went through the bad mood

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I saw Miss Qingtang

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
She was pushed into the bad mood

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
She was Xinglu

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
She was forced to go out

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
She was forced to go out

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
She was forced to go out

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's not too late

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The bad mood suddenly started to get worse

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's not me

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
She locked herself up

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's not me

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
My Miss is not stupid

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How could she lock herself in?

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It must be Ji Yinshi

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
She was in the house

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She said she wanted my Miss to marry into the Western Courtyard

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She was the one who planned to marry my Miss

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She was deliberately trying to fire her

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Please let me and the eldest son

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
be the master of my Miss

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My lady

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You all deceived her

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
She was so weak-willed

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She deceived all of you

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
She

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
She was a lunatic

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
She would have killed Peifu

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think it's a bit scary

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
She still risked her life to be long

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
She dared to take the risk

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
when she was in the air

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
She was so selfish

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This kind of person

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
can't be kept

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's go

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Xiaoman

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There's a drum in the prison

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is a small matter

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not worth making trouble

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Shen Qingtang was the one who

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
personally brought Peifu in

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
She is the daughter of

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the most famous and most noble lady

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
She is the one I sent to her

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In the future

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If someone

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
wants me to stay here

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and dare to take care of her

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You all know the consequences

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Today, Suoxing

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
is in a big mess

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Take Qingtang to the execution

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There's a reason for this

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's not the end yet

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Pei Jingming and her maid

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
will be in the court

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and be in charge of the court

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I have no choice

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
but to leave here

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I just went to wait

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I barely have time

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Zheshan looking a little sick

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
don't know if she is going to stay

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
My Lady

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have already taken those beers

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why the fire fire is still so big?

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Zheshan

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
is my peculiarity

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Live, make roles

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
fire burns such a huge amount

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
so others can realize

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
it works too heavily

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,160
I can't help you.

139
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,480
I will remember

140
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,800
the past of Pei Jingming.

141
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,680
I dare not force you

142
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,280
to do this in the short time.

143
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,720
Madam,

144
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
Second Young Master has been in the palace for half a night.

145
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,880
He hasn't been able to speak.

146
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,280
It's all because of the bad news.

147
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,960
Even if you love Miss Shen again,

148
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,880
she won't be able to see you clearly.

149
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Now that such a thing happened,

150
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm afraid she will be tongue-tied.

151
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,420
I didn't think I would

152
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,840
have such a favored daughter.

153
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,120
Miss Shen always keeps talking one's private matter.

154
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,280
If I make things too impatient,

155
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,120
I am afraid it'd be even more difficult to help you with this.

156
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,800
are you hurt?

157
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,820
Is it painful?

158
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,600
It doesn't matter.

159
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,340
Let me see.

160
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,240
It's nothing.

161
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,440
Not even a sense of relief will distress me.

162
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,440
I don't care

163
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,360
Thank you for saving my brother.

164
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,680
Sister, my sister's genuine heart

165
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,400
is not to understand people'sなん anymore.

166
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,880
This is

167
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,600
what Sister Chu suggested.

168
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,480
when you disappeared.

169
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,000
I know

170
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,960
what I did.

171
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,480
How stupid

172
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,200
you are.

173
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,560
I didn't expect you

175
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,800
to be so cruel to yourself.

176
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,040
If you want to kill me next time,

177
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,720
then you should take the same path as yourself.

178
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,000
That's all I can do.

179
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,720
Shen Qingtang.

180
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
Since you were eight years old,

181
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,640
you've been my only one

182
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,480
who promised me.

183
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,720
Your body hasierDetector

184
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,440
has just the same plant as mine.

185
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,760
How dare you doubt my consent

186
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,960
and give up your life.

187
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,800
Qingtang is far away from the監管

188
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,360
and only knows the truth.

189
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,920
So, she has to help me,

190
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,800
so as to stop the fun and suffer for you.

191
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,160
But between us,

192
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,360
I'm not afraid of you.

193
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
I'm not afraid of you.

194
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
What are you doing?

195
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Pei Congzhi.

196
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,760
You're not afraid of me.

197
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,560
But I'm not afraid of you

198
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,960
because I love you.

199
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,160
Even what you do

200
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,760
is what you do.

201
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,160
You have to bear the consequences.

202
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,560
Pei Congzhi.

203
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,160
Let me go.

204
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Pei Congzhi.

205
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,560
I can't play through this game in his life.

206
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,360
Now that I still have half a moon

207
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,400
I...

208
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,760
will think about it for the last time.

209
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Okay.

210
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,360
Then I'll just wait

211
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
for my junior Ruɛge

212
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,760
to give me the Russian sentence.

213
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,060
It's powerful enough to gather together.

214
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Go.

215
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,620
Looks like only Bon Der projector

216
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,060
must be able to gain freedom.

217
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,160
Why do I get the heartaches now?

218
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,620
You were the only man came before.

219
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,620
How could he become so terrible now?

220
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,620
He was the most terrible one.

221
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,620
It's the 15th year of the imperial family.

222
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,620
Only I can see it.

223
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,620
The one who was killed by the thief in the message.

224
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,620
Who is the traitor?

225
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,620
I'm afraid you won't be able to see it.

226
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,620
I won't say.

227
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,620
Trust me.

228
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
I won't betray you.

229
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,620
Everyone is just a pawn with the intelligence.

230
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,620
I can't trust you.

231
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,620
I'm afraid you won't be able to see it.

232
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,620
I won't say.

233
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,620
I won't say.

234
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
I won't say.

235
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,620
I won't say.

236
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,620
I won't say.

237
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,620
I won't say.

238
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,620
I won't say.

239
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
I won't say.

240
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,620
I won't say.

241
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,620
I won't say.

242
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,620
I won't say.

243
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
I won't say.

244
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,620
I won't say.

245
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,620
I won't say.

246
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,620
What about Li Y disciplined Zha?

247
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,620
It's still the same.

248
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,620
He was a human.

249
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,620
Evenимость,

250
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,620
Your general strength,

251
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
Encouraging from the past.

252
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,620
Before you can say the fact,

253
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,620
Exactly like this.

254
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,820
Maybe he can't understand what the past meant to him.

255
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,620
The 4th year of the imperial family,

256
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,620
Shi current solider,

257
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,620
himself also didn't let us get away.

258
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,620
Are you here for an organized attack to see Hu Chuan?
