1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I get through this?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Love is a game of light and shadow

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so curious about it

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm willing to hate you, I'm willing to let you go

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will gently blow away my memories

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't want to lose my memories

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're so determined to let Caiwei take Yan City to the capital

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You even took advantage of the time to show your love to your wife

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You're so good at it

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm too old-fashioned

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not good at the way you are

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Qingtang is not as good as you are

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But you were not a smart girl before

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't like such a sister

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're so good at it

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yan City is so naive

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I hope you don't involve him in my conflict

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So naive

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How much do you know about Yan City?

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Not much, but enough to convince the gods

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're still naive

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I believe that the love of the horse and the flower will be perfect

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How about you burning this lamp?

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He will never force me, torture me, insult me

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He's more than a hundred times better than you

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Shen Qingtang

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let me go

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You call this force, torture or not

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is not a torture

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You sent him away

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You even hurt my power

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
As long as I don't die

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't forget to marry him

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Miss

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Even if you're close to someone, you'll feed yourself to Sister Yin

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You'll be fortunate

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Stop eating things

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's why I think you're giving the gods some room

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll go with you out

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
May you have a rest.

45
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,080
Young Mistress, these are...

46
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,760
These are...

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,060
I'm going to the Palace of Heavenly Mentors and report to Zixuan Hall to take over.

48
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,020
It seems that tomorrow,

49
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:14,340
someone must have accidentally failed� Until Zixuan King опас过死人

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
As long as you cooperate,

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
you'll lose your life.

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why should I have to let you get the grudge?

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You've always wanted to protect her in your youth.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You wanted her to grow up without any worries.

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If she knows that

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
you've secretly given birth to a niece,

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you think she'll live a better life?

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's not a big deal.

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If this is the end of the world,

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
what will you be like?

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're just like your short-lived father.

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're shameless and shameless.

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
A single father like you

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
is not suitable for us.

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Do you think

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm still that little...

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
useless and heartless person

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
who only wants to see me die?

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If it wasn't for Pei Yu who took the good from me,

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
how could I have a divorce with my lover?

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If it wasn't for you,

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
how could I have been trapped in this prison?

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You've done me a great favor.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't think too much!

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If you're with me,

76
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
no one can be cold-hearted.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Then Pei Ziqi has the right to be alone.

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's better to die than to be tortured.

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Isn't that what you're good at?

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Now, it's just a hug.

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You think you've done so much for her.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
She'll thank you for loving you.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She's so hard-working and hard-working.

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
She'll only hate you.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I think she's the next me!

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Mother, don't worry.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm not a father.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And she

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
will never be you.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Mother!

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Mother!

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Mother!

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mother!

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I saw you leaving the house from Jiangwan.

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You heard it?

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't know who I am today.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
As a exchange,

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't interfere with my future.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Shen Qingtang.

100
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,400
Why do you choose an outsider?

101
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,600
You don't love me.

102
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,000
Because I can't fall in love with a evil demon master.

103
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm afraid of being a good demon.

104
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,600
Shen Qingtang.

105
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,000
You must have forgotten.

106
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,200
15 years ago.

107
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,200
Who attacked me?

108
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,600
Let me be a evil demon.

109
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll help you.

110
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,600
Shen Qingtang.

111
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Let go of me.

112
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Don't move.

113
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Hurry up.

114
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Come out.

115
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Help.

116
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Help.

117
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Come out.

118
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Come out.

119
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Come out.

120
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Hurry up.

121
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Hurry up.

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,400
Charliestell
