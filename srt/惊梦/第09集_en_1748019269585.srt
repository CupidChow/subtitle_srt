1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I get out of this dream?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Love is a game of playing games

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm so excited!

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How can I blame you? I'm willing to hate you

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How can I hug you?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will gently blow away my memories

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I dreamt that I would have a chance to be together

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Qingtao!

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Master!

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm here!

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's all my fault.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was so unlucky.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Master Yan Cheng

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You and Mo Yao came to me again

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You've never known me before

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You blamed me for not protecting you

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's why you suffered this wrong

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm in a bad mood today

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Qingyu will be ruined

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can't be with you

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You should be a girl who can't be with you

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
In my eyes

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You are the girl who can't be with you

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Qingyu is never under this ruse

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yan Cheng

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's okay

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you don't want to say it today

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I won't ask you

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But I have one thing to say

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
As long as you have me in your heart

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I will never marry you

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's okay

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's okay

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's okay

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's okay

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's okay

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's okay

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm so sorry

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm really sorry

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's okay

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You saved me in my hands.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're doing this for me.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I want you to be killed!

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I dare to do it again.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You will be the one who killed Yong Shi.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You should change your mind.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You can marry the crown prince of Yan City.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He's a woman who can't bear to see the world.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He'll cherish you.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't be so sad.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Don't be so sad.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I heard you went to Tang Wan An Temple.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Where did you go?

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Did you go to Feng Han?

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm fine.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You should take care of yourself.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can't get married.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I really feel sorry for you.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But the manor is the military family.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They don't care about your status.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They're just family.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They're just a few of them.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No one can know that

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I was forced to marry the crown prince of Yan City.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I was forced to marry the manor.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's not just a good manor.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can't help but beg for mercy.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I saw it first.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I agreed to marry a foreigner.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why?

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why?

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're really worthy of that little bitch.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why do you treat me like that?

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You bastard.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's the point?

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You dare to hit me?

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You dare to hit me?

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll kill you, you crazy woman.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You little bitch.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're going to marry a foreigner and still keep Peijing Ming?

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I must take this opportunity to go.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
My husband was a servant under the guard of the crown prince of Yan City.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He told me about the secret.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
In the picture of the girl in our house,

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
she was buried in the flower building of the Tian Shui River.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Or was it the prince of Yan City who saved her?

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't talk nonsense.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If the girl was really buried in that place,

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
how could the manor in the Pingnan Manor still come to the house?

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Maybe the prince was snatched by her.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's not certain.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Someone sent snow to Lingchuan.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The mother of Qingtong's daughter is not dead in the plague.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
She was hit by a blow from the ancient books.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She is broken.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The plague is just a sign of her death.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Moreover,

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Shen found this hairpin on her.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's really what the former court knows.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's said that it was the princess of the former court.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's only a sign.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If the former court is sick,

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
tell the princess about the secret.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why did the king of Pingnan investigate Qingtang in secret?

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why did he take Yan City to Qingtang?

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I have an answer.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Qingtang's body

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
must have a hidden clue.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Caiwei, help me wipe the body.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What do you want?

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What do I want?

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Feng Nanzhi.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Nanzhi.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Bai Congzhi,

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hualong,

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Jinye.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can not help you.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But if you have to sell this place,

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I will do it.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I will do it.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I will do it.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But if you have to sell this place,

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I will share the food with you.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Tomorrow,

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
my father-in-law will be Yan City.

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Not you.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Your father-in-law,

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
but you and I will be close.

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Like me,

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I will hide a secret from you.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Hide?

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You said hide?

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I have a little self-love.

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If we really had a father-in-law,

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
how could we have noticed it at this moment?

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Bai Congzhi,

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you lied to me.

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Now you know

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
it's not a good thing.

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I...

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Shen Qingtang,

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that night,

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
you were hit by something.

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But the truth is,

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
you saw it clearly.

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I tried.

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Bai Congzhi,

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
help me.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Help me.

155
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Qingtang,

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

164
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

172
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I want to have a day when I have no proof.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Why do I have to be like this?
