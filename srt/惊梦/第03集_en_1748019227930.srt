1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I turn around?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Love is a game of playing games

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so curious

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm willing to be with you

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How can I hug you?

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will wake up my memories

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What's the point of dreaming?

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Sister!

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Sister!

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You're so worried about me

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I spent the days in the house with my mother

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I went to Wang An Temple to help

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I couldn't even look after you

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Are you okay?

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm fine

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I've been taking care of you for days

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's great

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There's a Mid-autumn Festival in the palace tonight

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Please come with me

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I rarely go out

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Forget it

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Sister, please go

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This palace is a great place for the noble family

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There are many good children in the palace

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Many women want to be in the family

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But I don't know any other than the crown prince

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The eldest brother is a dead face

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He only cares about rest and happiness

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Please come with me

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Tell me which of the noble princes will come

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let me think about it

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yan Cheng, the crown prince of the Pingnan Mansion

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is really a great person

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Except for the Pei Da Manor in Pei Manor

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No one can replace Li Chao

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's Yan

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yan Cheng is back from the palace

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You crazy little horse

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let me see who you are

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're so greedy

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,880
Your mean girl

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yan Cheng, you're back too

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,700
Yes

48
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,700
Sister, slow down

49
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
Yan Cheng

50
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,600
Ziqi

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,960
What's going on?

52
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
This is...

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,080
Why did you go to the camp to hide?

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,800
Even Sister Qingtang doesn't know you.

55
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,560
When I caught the bugs,

56
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,960
I was scared to cry.

57
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,760
Have you forgotten?

58
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,800
I saw you, Prince Yan Cheng.

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,800
I remember now.

60
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,800
I followed the bug behind my back when I was a kid.

61
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,640
I was scared to cry.

62
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,840
I didn't expect

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
it would be as beautiful as the fairy.

64
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,800
I didn't know anything when I was a kid.

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,720
I was scared to scare you.

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,120
And don't be so nervous.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,240
Prince Yan is serious.

68
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,320
The palace is open.

69
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Let's go in.

70
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,360
Let's go.

71
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,360
I'll go with you.

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,080
Please.

73
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,360
I've hit you.

74
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,280
I should go.

75
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,560
I'm angry.

76
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,360
You can leave.

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,160
Yes.

78
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,840
Prince Yan,

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,400
you're being beaten to death.

80
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,240
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,680
Prince Yan.

82
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,480
Sister Qingtang, don't say that.

83
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
You should change me to Yan Cheng

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,760
just like I did.

85
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,000
Yan Cheng,

86
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,200
it's been hard

87
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,000
to come to the border these years.

88
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,480
You're not good at math.

89
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,920
You're not good at acting.

90
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Besides,

91
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,800
border is more interesting than the capital.

92
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,120
The scenery is more beautiful.

93
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,960
Really?

94
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,000
I rarely go out.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
I don't want to say that I'm going to the border.

96
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,360
I think I'm still the king.

97
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,400
If you like it,

98
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,280
I'll go with you

99
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,440
when I'm free.

100
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,360
I'll talk to you more.

101
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,080
How is it?

102
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,120
Okay.

103
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,200
I've made a dirty sister's cloth.

104
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,240
I should wash it clean.

105
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,400
I'll return it to you next time.

106
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,480
I'll keep my word.

107
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,760
Okay.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,080
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,040
Sorry.

110
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,160
I'm off.

111
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,440
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,200
I can't afford

113
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,520
to stay here

114
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,080
and take my sistemas.

115
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,840
My son,

116
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,200
have you come to reinforce the decision?

117
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,440
So far so good.

118
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,400
Minister Chu,

119
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,160
I don't know

120
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,100
what to do to you.

121
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,600
Actually,

122
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,160
Jordan hasãƒŸology.

123
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,000
And so,

124
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
she said,

125
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,400
she can give you attention,

126
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,960
as long as Your Highness

127
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,180
defends your sister.

128
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,120
I will be happy.

129
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,320
This is the family affair of Pei Manor.

130
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,880
Please don't worry about it.

131
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,440
I have been bullied by the people I don't know.

132
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,640
I have to admit it.

133
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,400
How can you take me?

134
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,200
My sister will be happy

135
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,080
if I am the brother.

136
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,200
You can protect her for a while.

137
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,760
Do you think you can protect her for a lifetime?

138
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,320
Then try it.

139
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,960
Mr. Pei.

140
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,560
Are you afraid that you forgot

141
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,880
that my father married our fiancee?

142
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,880
The broken household of Lingchuan City

143
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,240
is still a family affair.

144
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,360
Are you afraid that

145
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,480
you can't tell the truth now?

146
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm afraid

147
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,360
it's the princess who can't tell the truth.

148
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
I have something to do.

149
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
I'll leave first.

150
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,840
Sister Qingtang.

151
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,480
It's a little bit tight here.

152
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,880
Why don't we go to the garden to save her?

153
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,680
I can tell you about the great magic.

154
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,520
Okay.

155
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,800
I'll wait for you in the garden.

156
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,000
It's not a long way

157
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,480
to go to the garden.

158
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
It's not a long way to get out of the house.

159
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,000
What are you doing?

160
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,000
Sheng Qingtang,

161
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,480
your plan

162
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,040
is to seduce thinking

163
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,680
of how people can be approachable.

164
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,360
Zhang Zhou has a lot to be afraid of you.

165
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,200
You have a crush on people.

166
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,320
So...

167
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,720
You'd rather beg and trust others

168
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,640
than to be soft to me.

169
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,920
What are you asking for?

170
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,760
I've been a dowry man.

171
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,000
What else can I ask for?

172
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,240
But I want to ask for a valuable person.

173
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,120
A dowry man?

174
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,160
Am I far away?

175
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,160
When will I find someone else?

176
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
How can I not be?

177
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,000
Are you going to

178
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,000
cancel the marriage with Princess Zhao He for me?

179
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,560
Look.

180
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,320
I can't even get my marriage ready.

181
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,080
Why bother to force me?

182
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
If I force you,

183
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,880
Shen Qingtang,

184
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm willing to

185
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,880
marry you.

186
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,640
So,

187
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,640
you said you'd love me,

188
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,240
but you didn't want to give me a title.

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,920
Is that so?

190
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,800
Do you care?

191
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
I don't care.

192
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,920
I've never

193
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,120
cared about you.

194
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,060
It's alright.

195
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,040
Give me my bag.

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,760
Say,

197
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,400
he doesn't want to hear your name

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,440
and you don't want his wife to know it.

199
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
I'm not the one who's going to marry him.

200
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
I need to remember this from the beginning.

201
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
And

202
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
the crown prince of Yan City is not a good match.

203
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
From now on,

204
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
you don't need to come to him.

205
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
Lord Pingnan has been back to the capital recently.

206
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
He said he would make a good marriage

207
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
for me in the capital.

208
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Lord Pingnan is a poor man.

209
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
It's not that simple.

210
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
I'm going to marry

211
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
the crown prince of Yan City.

212
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I'm going to marry him.

213
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Shen Qingtang,

214
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
why don't you say something else?

215
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
Tell me the crown prince of Yan City

216
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
of Yan City of Yan City.

217
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
What's your problem?

218
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Go back.

219
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Go back.

220
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
I'm going to marry him.

221
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
I'm not the one who's going to marry him.
