1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I get out of this dream?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or is it just a game?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm so curious!

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How can I let you hate me?

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How can I hug you?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that I'll wake up in the spring breeze

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't want to miss you

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What do you want?

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want all the people who hurt me to pay the price

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The punishment is not enough

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Why don't we add the child in his house

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and give him two lives?

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why do you have to pretend to be kind?

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I know that you want me to die

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But you have someone else

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm so naive

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can only be a family with the blood of the same person

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No matter how good you say it, I can't do anything I want

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
From now on, I'll use other things to make up for you

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No need

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Because what I want is something you can never give

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Shen Qingtang!

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you really want to make me suffer?

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes!

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You put me in the garden

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How dare you tell me to love you?

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm so happy for you!

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're hurt

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Go find me some healer

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't be here

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If you want to die, go to another place to die

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I can't die with these wounds

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Miss!

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Madam is here to see you

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go!

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can't let the ancestors see you!

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I won't!

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go!

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Qingtang, I've seen your grandmother

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I know that Congzhi is protecting you

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But Xi Yuan has also been punished

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You should persuade Congzhi to stop pursuing the family

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What's wrong?

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Qingtang is fine

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I was cold yesterday

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have a little pain in my leg

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But I'm fine now

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You should rest early

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll ask the doctor in the palace to check on you

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Qingtang, thank you, grandmother

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Go out

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The wound is serious and the action is not necessary

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll stay here tonight

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Pei Congzhi

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't move

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's all

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Just stay here for a night

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Even if we are in the same palace

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and we are apart from each other

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
what's the use of being apart from each other?

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Leave as soon as you wake up

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't be sad

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I still want it

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It seems that the wound is still hurt

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What do you want to do?

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I said I had a lot of promises last night

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't want to lose the family that is still alive

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What else do you want?

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If you think it over

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
tell me anytime

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want to go back to Lingchuan

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Before I passed 8 years old

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I didn't come to the imperial city

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
that day with no worries

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm willing to have you and you

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I can't do it again

82
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Forget it

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You should go

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let me think about it

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Uncle Yan

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You said if I quit one day

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and went to the unruly life in the wild

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
what do you think?

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No, sir

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You won't be laughing anymore, right?

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The court can't afford to have such an ancient palace

93
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Pei Manor still depends on you to be a new employee

94
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
How can you leave?

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Just kidding

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How is the order you made?

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The water is already done

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
As you expected

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Although King of Pingnan has left

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
but in the city

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
there are a lot of people

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
who are involved in Pei Manor

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They have all been dealt with

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
They won't let King of Pingnan be suspicious

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
King of Pingnan is a brave man

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and a wolf

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
His goal is to find the treasure on Shen Qingtang's body

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Find someone who can help him

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't let him leave here

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
At least in this mansion

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can protect him

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
God is kind

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm so happy now

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What's wrong?

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The flower of the new flower is coming

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's said that his appearance is very similar to yours

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Now everyone is saying

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that someone was wrong

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and recognized you

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Now the people of the Miss can finally be happy

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The rumors of Man Tian are going to be clear

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's his own business

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It was made by the Young Master?

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It seems that the Young Master is also

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
concerned and caring about you

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No matter what

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Young Master is in charge of the water

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You don't have to worry about it

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's a good thing

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Miss

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Aren't you happy?

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm happy

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Anyway

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm just a toy in your hand

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Even a dead body can be in your eyes

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How can I escape from Shen Tian?

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's rare that the ancestors are born

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's been a long time since I last saw you

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How are you doing in the palace today?

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're still thinking about me?

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I heard that you were a son of the Yan City

143
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
because you lost your good fortune

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Today

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I especially asked the Lord for love

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
so I can go home and get married

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and talk to you

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're really nice

149
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But you have to write more than others

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
when you get married

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Feicong Zhi

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
These years

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You've been so mean to me

154
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If you only had me

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
How much would you love me?

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Miss

157
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm afraid that after I pass away,

158
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'll be able to understand the pain.

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
In my dream,

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm the face of a lost person.

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm afraid that

162
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'll be left with no one to protect me.

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm afraid that

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll be left with no one to protect me.

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm afraid that I'll be left with no one to protect me.

166
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Won't waste another moment in my life

167
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and keep on running toward myils and herions
