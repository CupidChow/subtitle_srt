1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I turn around and escape?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or do I just watch a game?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm curious about how to get close to you

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm willing to hate you, I'm willing to hug you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will clear my memories

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't want to leave my dream behind

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Do you know that I'm here?

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
In my decision, to be the future wife of you and me

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I have to do everything for you

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Not to be shy or hide

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
These secrets are in your hands

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Be it to be a shield or sword

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't care anymore

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You just trust me like this

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You have promised me to confess to me, right?

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm just reading

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Do you have any true feelings for me?

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then I will drink the wine and we will be together again

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Congratulations to you and me for re-creating a new life

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Since that, what secrets do I have in my life?

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What is the love I have for you?

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Qingtang, you ask me anything

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I know nothing

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But without this, I can't tell you for now

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This matter is too much

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If I don't have the full power

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I will put you in danger

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Give me some more time

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm late

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If I knew this earlier

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Maybe I won't make it to today

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You and I

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Have gone the wrong way

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And got sick

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How can I think about it?

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Between us

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There is no more victory

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And there is no more death

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What?

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You are not fully recovered yet

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You are going to come to me and take Yang Wei

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Mrs. Jiang has killed me

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You already knew my purpose

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You still want to escape?

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You and Pei Congzhi are under the wife's skin

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You are so stubborn

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You are hiding under the wife's skin

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is it true?

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There are too many fake houses

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Everyone wants to settle

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No one can really be happy

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So I don't want to stay

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But Pei Congzhi is so stubborn

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You still want to leave

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is her revenge

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You want to leave

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why do you want to leave?

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I know

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
She locked your lover in there

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Mrs. Jiang probably forgot

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How did you treat me before?

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No matter what you ask

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I can satisfy you

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You are wrong

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I am not exchangeable

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But it's dangerous

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Mrs. Jiang is thinking

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
How to cooperate with me

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you still dare to be selfish

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I will use this token

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let it disappear from this world

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I see it

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You are more powerful than I thought

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You are not Xia Yigeng

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You are another him

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
After the trial

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will release your lover

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This token

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is a mistake

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Now it's covered by the fox's fur

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No one will know

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a secret

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What secret is a token?

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I am afraid it's me who is the real culprit

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Sometimes because of a warm-hearted and emotional death

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
After the war

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't forget the past

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Only the token left by the grandmother

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Can be satisfied

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I am thinking

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If at that time

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I didn't take me to the mansion

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What will happen?

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sister will regret

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I have a past

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't regret

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I always want to ask you

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Every time you see me struggle

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What are you thinking about?

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In order to make me lose my mind

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I want to be grateful

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I want to be grateful

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I want to be grateful

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I want to be grateful

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I remember your bad

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I remember it clearly

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What about your good?

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Since childhood

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I have no problem

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
For me

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
My sister is better than my own sister

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Good

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But you shouldn't be so worried

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's more important to us

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I promise you

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
From now on

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I won't be a burden to you

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I will do everything

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Only you

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
My identity

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It seems to be a secret

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm afraid

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The Grandfather won't be implicated

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You won't be in trouble

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
In the future

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I will make up for the relationship between us

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Your identity

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Will be sealed forever

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
In the future, people will know

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You are my wife

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I promise you

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
From now on

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I will try to accept you

142
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I will love you

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I will be with you

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Please

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I promise you

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I will love you

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I will be with you

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I will be with you

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I will be with you

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will be with you

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I will be with you

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I will be with you

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I will be with you

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I will be with you

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I will be with you

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I will be with you

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will be with you

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will be with you

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I will be with you

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Even so

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I will not be your wife

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
In this life

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I want to be your wife

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
As your brother

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I want to get married secretly

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But I still have half a reason to stay

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This marriage is impossible

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I have been raising you for a long time

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You are so serious

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Get out of my way

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Who dares

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I am here today

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Not to discuss with my grandmother

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I am here to tell you

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I have decided

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Are you going to do this

178
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
For a woman

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
To make the whole family

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Have you lost your mind

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
For a woman

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
For twenty years

183
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I have been very busy

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I have never missed a chance

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
To accompany my mother

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
To accompany the family

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
To close all

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Now

189
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I just want to get a new moon

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Why is my grandmother

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Can't let me go to the hospital

192
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Even if my grandmother

193
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Can't agree

194
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Qingtang

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Qingtang

196
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I have decided

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
From now on

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
For her

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't be a grandmother

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's grandmother

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Don't give up

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Don't give up

203
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
People are ordinary

204
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Steal the gold

205
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The light is crazy

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I will look back

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The world is red

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's a black and white

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's a turning point

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm afraid

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
After the end

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It turns out that the drama

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Is also wrong

214
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Fe 집

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,640
Villain

216
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,000
Silence

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Are you there

218
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
TheW앜

219
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,160
Please

220
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,000
ów crayfish

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,200
Quiet
