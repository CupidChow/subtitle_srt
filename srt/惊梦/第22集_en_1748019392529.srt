1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Why I never see myself before

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I get out of this dream

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Or is it a game of ice and fire

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so curious

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm willing to be with you, I'm willing to hug you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will wake up the memories

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What's the point of dreaming about the past

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Episode 1

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Episode 1

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Caiwei

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The young man who brought me back today

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
is very similar to the man in my dream

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Really?

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's great

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Maybe this is the day and night

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The sky and the earth

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Miss, you are getting married

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You have to take this chance

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If so, I should be able to be friends with you

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Miss, why don't you take this chance

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to give this gift to him

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and thank him

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
From

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Master

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why are you here?

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Aren't you here too?

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It seems that

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the idea of coming to this place

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
is the same

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
King of Pingnan sold the army to rebel

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and committed a great crime

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
as the only one who survived

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
King of Pingnan's blood

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
shouldn't be at ease

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Master Shoufu's words

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
are only my identity

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and Qingtang's sensitive identity

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Shouldn't we see each other again?

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The crime of my father

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
was enough to make a long family

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If it weren't for the clear nature of you

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to help the Qin

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
King of Pingnan sold the army

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and it was already broken

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I couldn't stand here

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and talk to you like I did in the daytime

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Anyway

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
In this world

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I will always owe you a favor

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I will never give up

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
the favor

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
because of this favor

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Now

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I am not a common person

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I will never be a part of the court

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Qingtang's identity

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I believe that under your protection

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I will always hide

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am going to be a member of Qingtang

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
in fact, I am more than you

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
to be a good person

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't you think

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
you are looking for death?

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If I die

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you can get the true heart of Qingtang

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's okay

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But from now on

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
you know

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
you have been too selfish

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and you don't know

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
how to love someone

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You hurt her before

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I will never

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
push her away

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
from you

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I will never

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
understand

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
how to truly love someone

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and who taught me

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Shen Qingtang

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Young Master, do you recognize me?

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Young Master, do you...

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I am the new neighbor

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
from your next door

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Xin Pei

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was so rude

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Please forgive me

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I heard Cai Wei told you

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
that the medicine I take

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
is all from you

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Many of them

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
haven't taken our money

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's a debt from Qingtang

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you very much

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I need some herbs

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know how much

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I heard that

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Miss Shen's condition is very bad

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Take some herbs

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and send some to the countryside

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will use this

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
to help you

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Then

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I will give you two

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Young Master Pei

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Young Master Pei

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Is Miss Shen here?

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is that person from the garden

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
a ghost?

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ask him

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Is he...

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I said he's not here

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I want to ask you

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to be honest

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You are just getting married

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't worry about

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Miss Shen and Mr. Yan Cheng

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Mr. Pei

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This is...

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I got a few more herbs

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
when I was on the mountain

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I thought that the herbs

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
would be useful

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
so I brought them here

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Wait a moment

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you, Mr. Pei

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know if you heard

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that there is no need to be so rude

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I read it

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't know

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
if you are a good person

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
or not

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't know

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I read it

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mr. Pei has a wonderful

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and brilliant figure

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I think

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
you should know it

151
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Mr. Yan looks like

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
a martial arts master

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How can he know

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
how to kill a pig?

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You...

156
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yan Cheng's mouth

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
is really not that bright

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I have never seen my young master

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
like this

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He is called Chizi

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He is not like your young master

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He doesn't even

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
have a sharp eye

164
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
My young master's head

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I...

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I heard that you are good

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
when I am cold

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's almost done

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Thank you for your concern

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You left it

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
last night

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I said

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I couldn't find it

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It was in your place

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What do you want

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
to thank me for?

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No need to thank me

178
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I think

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I should be older than you

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I should call him

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
as my brother

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
OK

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Brother Chizi

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Sister

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Brother

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Brother Chizi

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Sister Qingtang

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't care about other people's things

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I just want to report to you

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
There are many herbs

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
on the mountain

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I will bring you to pick them tomorrow

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
OK

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How many Yan Gongzi do you have?

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Brother Cangzhi

196
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's wrong?

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Brother Cangzhi

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yan Gongzi must be the last one

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Brother Cangzhi

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Sister

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's strange

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why do I always think of him

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
when I think of him?

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Miss

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What's wrong?

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Caiwei

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You said

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Mr. Pei and Mr. Yan

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
are better than each other

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Miss

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why are you still picking them?

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Of course

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
it's better to protect your Yan Cheng

214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
than to be the one who's better

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Caiwei

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think

217
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
you don't seem to like Mr. Pei

218
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But he's good to me

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Miss

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Some people in the world

221
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
are good to you

222
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and don't ask for anything to report

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
For example, Mr. Yan Cheng

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
the love of a man like him

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
is a love

227
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
for a man like him

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Mr. Pei is a talent

229
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
but he's always

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
so generous

231
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
for you

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So you mean this

233
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes

234
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He does have a lot of points

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But I always want to

236
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
give him back

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
every time

238
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's strange

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Miss

240
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You don't owe him anything

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Just listen to me

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Mr. Yan Cheng

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
is the best

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm sorry

245
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm sorry

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry

247
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm sorry

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry

249
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm sorry

250
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm sorry

251
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry

253
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm sorry

255
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm sorry

256
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sorry

257
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm sorry

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm sorry

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry

261
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm sorry

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm sorry

264
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sorry

265
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm sorry

266
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry

267
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm sorry

268
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry

269
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sorry

270
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry

271
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sorry

272
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm sorry

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry

275
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry
