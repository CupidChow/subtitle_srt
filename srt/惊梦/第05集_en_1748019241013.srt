1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I get out of this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I get out of this dream?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Love is a game of light and light

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so curious about it

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm willing to hate you, I'm willing to hug you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will wake up the memories

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I dreamt of all the memories

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Love is a game of light and light

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm so curious about it

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Episode 1

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sister, please wait

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I was wrong today

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I was wrong in my studies

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I have a good medicine for the wound

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll treat it

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're a liar

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't want him to see our Feng Yue

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Brother Yan Cheng

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Jin Tang is fine, you go back first

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Take care

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll go to the manor to visit you another day

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you feel uncomfortable, why don't you

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
let me take your medicine

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sister

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sister, you're so strong

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm willing to die

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't want to let you go

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm so happy for Yan Cheng

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I won't let him go

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Shen Qing Tang, I can't let you go today

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But remember

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can only marry me in this life

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We're brothers and sisters

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How can you

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We're going to be together

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Miss

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Goodbye

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Miss, don't scare me

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What did the master do to you?

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Anyway

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you willing to be with Ming Ke and the child?

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I must leave the manor

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Leave your master

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Master

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The person sent out is here

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Miss Qing Tang is as good as she said

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's indeed the marriage of Lin Chuan

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
My parents are dead in Wen Yi

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If that's the case

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Why did King Ping Nan investigate her

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
in the case of the three-fold murder

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and let her be with Yan Cheng

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Even if she's dead

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and she's looking for the truth

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
she can't let anyone

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
get close to her

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've met Princess Zhao He

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I heard that Sister Qing Tang

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
was in the competition yesterday

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and was in the capital

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She was still in the body

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I was really worried

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I had to leave her to the palace

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Thank you for your concern

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's a minor injury

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Qing Tang is already in love

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why is it a minor injury?

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The girl's body is still in the body

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But she's a big girl

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
She's a big girl

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She's a big girl

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She's a big girl

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She's a big girl

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But it's a big thing

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's so hard to see

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I've got a batch of flowers recently

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I heard that the flower's path

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
is very similar to the wound on the bracelet

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But the flower path is broken

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and it's gone

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How about I give you a try?

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Princess

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The girl's injury is really gone

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Princess

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It will hurt a bit

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But for the sake of the whole jade

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll bear it

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Princess

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Princess

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay, get up

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, sister

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The flower path is very similar to the wound on the bracelet

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Qing Tang

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Thank you, princess

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Maid

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Maid

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Zhou He suddenly sent a letter

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
He can't see anyone

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You did it

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I need to thank you

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
for ten days

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,300
andcelln

107
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,240
The wound worth a thousand{\clapping mor ways of

108
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,000
air dieta,</jieat

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You know that Zhao He

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is not the規 Awak into thesal Deng

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,280
Mm

112
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,000
actually

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,640
How many heads are lost in the city?

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You've just met her

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,800
Not just 1000

116
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,440
What I have done was more dissequicable than what I did.

117
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,840
If only because I am the門口.

118
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,780
I'm humble indeed.

119
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,500
She can make me look like me.

120
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,820
If I can't rush to be lateral and handsome,

121
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,180
then I won't be sherbet.

122
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,280
It's such a shame as long as I know

123
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,900
that even I had to return home.

124
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,900
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

125
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,900
I'm not willing to pay you back

126
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,500
for your help.

127
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,100
As long as you're willing to make a promise,

128
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,100
I'll do anything for you.

129
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,900
I can do anything for you.

130
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
But Brother,

131
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,900
you don't understand.

132
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
I'm not your daughter-in-law.

133
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,300
What I want is to achieve it by myself,

134
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,500
not by someone else's help.

135
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,900
Are you okay?

136
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,900
Where's your leg? Where's your foot?

137
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,500
I'm fine.

138
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:52,900
Let me see.

139
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,300
Brother Yan Cheng,

140
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,900
I'm really fine.

141
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,900
Brother Yan Cheng,

142
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
I'm really fine.

143
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
My wound is healed.

144
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,900
It's good that you're fine.

145
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
It's all my fault that I caused you

146
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
to be in danger and fear.

147
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
I...

148
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,500
I...

149
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,900
I don't blame you for not being kind.

150
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
Brother Yan Cheng, you don't have to blame yourself.

151
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,900
You really don't blame me?

152
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
That's good.

153
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
I've been unable to sleep recently.

154
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
I've been thinking about coming to you.

155
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Last time,

156
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
you said that you liked the silent and silent scenery.

157
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,900
I asked someone to do this.

158
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
He's with you.

159
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,900
Maybe you can be happy.

160
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Come.

161
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,900
The wind and the stars are falling.

162
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,900
The double-body bamboo store is going to be gone.

163
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,900
If I can be free like them,

164
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
how good would it be?

165
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
Brother Yan Cheng, thank you.

166
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,900
I like this lamp very much.

167
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
It's good that you like it.

168
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
As long as you like it,

169
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
I'll learn it all for you.

170
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
requests

171
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
I only remember that

172
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,900
you only attended princess's princess's wedding.

173
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
I didn't expect

174
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,900
that Miss Shen

175
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,900
would be different than before.

176
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,900
I understand

177
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,900
what kind of girl

178
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,900
that I fed you.

179
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
Heavenly Candy

180
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,900
really tried and fooled the dad.

181
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,900
They said

182
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
that you could marry them.

183
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
It's even better

184
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
that I would have known

185
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
such a бо.

186
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,900
But Miss Shen's family affairs can't be changed.

187
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,900
Prince of Pinan really agrees?

188
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
From now on, we're still in the past.

189
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
We've been moving around.

190
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,900
Now that Prince Yan is back in the capital,

191
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,900
it's time to continue our relationship.

192
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,900
We'll get married soon.

193
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,900
My father also made up his mind.

194
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
So, you've been in a lot of trouble lately.

195
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,900
Don't mind me, Old Madam.

196
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,900
The capital is a small town.

197
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,900
Qingtang is the most obedient.

198
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
You're getting older.

199
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,900
You're making up your mind.

200
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
You should take a big role.

201
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,900
You should be a good person.

202
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Grandmother.

203
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Old Madam, why do you need someone else?

204
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,900
I've been willing to protect her for a long time.

205
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,900
I'm not asking my parents to come to my house.

206
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,900
I'm asking them to come to my house.

207
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,900
I'm so worried about you.

208
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,900
You're so kind.

209
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,900
What do you think of Qingtang?

210
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,900
I'll arrange for the wedding.

211
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Brother Yan Cheng,

212
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,900
what you just said is true.

213
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Of course it's true.

214
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
Since the day we met,

215
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,900
I've been clear about my sister.

216
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,900
I'll be honest with myself

217
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
and be honest with you.

218
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,900
As long as you have this kind of intention,

219
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,900
I'll do everything I can.

220
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Grandmother means Qingtang.

221
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Really?

222
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,900
Qingtang,

223
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,900
I won't let you down.

224
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
Young Master,

225
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,900
Prince Yan Cheng is here to see Miss Shen again.

226
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,900
Wushan is still using it on Old Madam.

227
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
What's wrong with her?

228
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,900
Old Madam is planning to remember Miss Shen

229
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
and be your sister-in-law.

230
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,900
She's going to marry Miss Shen and Prince Yan Cheng.

231
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,900
You always love Miss Qingtang the most.

232
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,900
She can even marry a noble man like Prince Yan Cheng.

233
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
It's just a matter of luck.

234
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
Qingtang,

235
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,900
you don't need to marry someone else.

236
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
I'll marry her.

237
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
But Miss Shen

238
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,900
seems to have agreed to this arrangement.

239
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
I'm afraid that

240
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
after I leave,

241
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,900
I'll be as sure as I can.

242
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,900
In the dream,

243
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,900
I see your face.

244
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,900
I'm afraid that

245
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,900
I'll be lost in my dream.

246
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
I'm afraid that

247
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,900
I'll be lost in my dream.

248
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,900
Why do you hide from me?
