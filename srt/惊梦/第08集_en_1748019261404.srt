1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I turn around and escape?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Love is a game of ice and fire

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The game of the world is so exciting

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm willing to hate you, I'm willing to hug you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of the spring breeze, I'm afraid of the memories

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What's the point of dreaming?

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The End

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Episode 4

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I have to ask the cause of Qingtang first

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Since you are here, you should express your love

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Qingtang

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Prince

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Since the day we met again in the Palace of Justice

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I have already recognized you

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Now you are not married

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If I'm in a bad mood

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you want to be with me forever

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I will be good to you forever

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will never marry you

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Love is a game of the world

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Prince doesn't have to give her such a big promise

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I still have to think about it

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No matter what choice I make

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I am your brother

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I am your retreat

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's wrong?

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Prince, you are back

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I have to go back to my home

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Qingtang

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Sister

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's wrong?

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Qingtang

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Qingtang

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Sister

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What are you doing?

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Qingtang

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Sister

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Sister

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What's wrong?

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Qingtang

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Sister

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What's wrong?

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Qingtang

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Sister

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sister

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sister

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What are you doing?

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Qingtang has a low status

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Before her death

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
She was entrusted with the title of

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the enemy woman

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
For a few love

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But she ruined the two generations

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Qingtang doesn't want to be burdened with such a negative life

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's better to be burdened with such a life

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's just sit here

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Prince

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I am sorry

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Prince Xiang has a dream

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The god and the woman are in love

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Qingtang has made a choice

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Prince should choose another woman

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I am willing to be with you

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How can I let you go

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I am afraid that the spring breeze will be gentle

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Anyway

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I am willing to be with Qingtang

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
She told me today

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
She must have suffered a lot

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
She must have suffered a lot

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
She must have suffered a lot

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What the prince meant is

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The girl I am with

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
She could be bullied by outsiders

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's not possible for the person in the manor

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to be the family member of my company

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
How can I let the outsiders know

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I didn't hear what you said

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I hope the prince will be more careful

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yan Shu

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Send the guest

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You are already a good girl

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let me go

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why is this so irrelevant

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Bai Zhongzhi

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You must completely wipe out my life

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Will you be happy with me

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't love you at all

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I love you, it doesn't matter

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Life and death

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because it's hard to be willing to die

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There is a life and death

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I am willing to die

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There is a life and death

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I am willing to die

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There is a life and death

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I am willing to die

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There is a life and death

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I am willing to die

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There is a life and death

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I am willing to die

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There is a life and death

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I am willing to die

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Can't I get rid of

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
her husband in my life

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The smell of the perfume

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
is the scent of the perfume

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's it

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let's go

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's go

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Jiang Wen

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I have nothing to do with her

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Why did she have to kill me

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I want to thank her

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
for giving me a chance to escape from the heaven.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Madam only because she's been living in the southernå¹³ for half her life,

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
she wants to drag me down the water together.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This hairpin

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
is given to me by Madam

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
by Ziqi.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But it's hidden in the box of women's unhappiness.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Ziqi is naive.

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The person who wants to do this

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
can only be Madam.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I've been with you for a long time.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why do you need to do this?

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Madam has been with Pei Congzhi for many years.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
She's been a mother for many years.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
She's been a father for many years.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why do you want to deal with Pei Congzhi

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and do such a thing

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
to me, the innocent person?

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why do you have to take a clear and innocent look?

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're a fool in front of Pei's family.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Just take it away in front of me.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You and Pei Congzhi hide the secret from Pei's family

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and secretly steal from Pei's family.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Why do you have to

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
come to me?

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm different from the man

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
who's with Madam and the man outside.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Qingtang is a brother.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She's the only one who can't be with him.

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
She can't be with him.

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You're mistaken.

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was trapped in this house

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and wanted to help you.

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If Madam doesn't want to

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
reveal the real identity of my sister

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
in front of the world,

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
you'd better help me.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
She even told you this.

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're the same as the way you did for the Xie people.

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's ridiculous that Pei Congzhi

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
wanted to keep you

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
for hundreds of years.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You wanted to leave

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
with a heart-to-heart.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Pei Congzhi

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
doesn't deserve the truth.

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Fine.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll help you leave Pei's family.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll send someone to the city tomorrow

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
to pray for the temple.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You'll be with them

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
in the army.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You'll never leave Pei's family.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Who's there?

174
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't worry.

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The fresh goods I just sent

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
are all in the water.

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Who's there?

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Pei Congzhi

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Pei Congzhi

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Pei Congzhi

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What are you doing?

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Let me go.

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm Pei Congzhi's miss.

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Miss?

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You're the heir to the flower building.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Please take care of the marriage.

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll take care of it.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let me go.

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You can't be so mean.

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let me go.

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who's there?

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I saved you,

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
but I'm sure

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you're different.

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm Pei's miss.

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If you beg for money

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and save me,

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I never thought

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'd have to suffer

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
for the rest of my life.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ya Jianxu

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's really you.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're the heir to the flower building

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and the heir to the marriage?

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why?

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You dare to do it but you don't?

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You're wrong.

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You only make me feel bad.

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Go away.

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Even if you're in the mud,

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
you don't have to

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
come to save me.

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's not me.

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Qingtao.

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry.
