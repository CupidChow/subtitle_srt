1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why didn't I see myself before?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream?

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I get out of this dream?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Love is a game of light and shadow

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so curious about it

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm willing to hate you, I'm willing to hug you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and memories

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm so curious about it

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Love is a game of light and shadow

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm so curious about it

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Love is a game of light and shadow

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm so curious about it

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let me go

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let me go, what do you want?

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Shen Qingtong

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why do you want to escape?

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why do you want to lie to me?

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Why do you want to betray me?

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let me go

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
When you and her were together

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You have thought of me

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't touch me

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You hate me so much

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes, I hate you

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If it wasn't for you

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I would have been jealous with Yan Cheng

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I would have gone to the high place

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Then you love her so much

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
People like you

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Never know what love is

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
As long as I have a chance

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I will always be with her

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Until I leave you forever

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Shen Qingtong

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I have been thinking about it

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I have to give you the best

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You are not satisfied

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If I didn't bring you to the funeral

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You think what you are now?

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There are so many places in this world

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where you can't beg for life and death

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You want to go there?

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Like the life of a wretch

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No dignity and freedom

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'd rather die than be with you

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You are the one who is heartless

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why are you here to blame me?

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let me go

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If the light of ten years

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Can't change the love of my sister

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Then my sister's hatred

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Is the medicine for the wound

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Nanyang

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It seems like she is crazy

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
She is completely crazy

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Maybe I was wrong

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I shouldn't be in that language

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I should be with her

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I know her existence

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Is the wish I can't leave in this life

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But why would I bring

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Countless daily marriages

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The one who is hard to avoid

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Shen Qingtong

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can't help myself

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
As long as I am safe

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I can take care of my illness

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
She is stubborn to ask me if I love her

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But love is good

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Love is good

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If I don't have freedom

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What's the point?

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I know from now on

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I will definitely

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let you lose completely

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You hate me

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But your reaction can't lie to others

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Qingtong

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Tell me

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Do you have any

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Even a little bit of love for me

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I have a little bit of love for you

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But I have known since I was a child

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Between you and me

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
As if we were in the same boat

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She is always there

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
With this little bit of love

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You change your mind

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Qingtong

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You dare to step out of this

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The rest of the Red Dog Mountain

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I will be the one to take care of it

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Ok

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The End

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I hurt you last night

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Pei Congzhi, shut up

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you get angry

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It won't be like this

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I want you to go into the palace

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
To study

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I have already affected you

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All of you are my little money

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You can go

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Ok, ok, ok

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let me go

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's go, sister

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't let the grandmother be in a hurry

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
To you

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Take a seat

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Miss Qingtong

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What's wrong with your wishes

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It was i he destroying last night

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Now all the things, the poison

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Spare brothers

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,800
I have to be more careful.

118
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Young Master, you are...

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,400
The cat in the house was caught.

120
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
It's safe.

121
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,400
N comrade?

122
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
You're getting so?

123
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Your Highness,

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,600
just meet Zinven this time.

125
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,600
I wasted time.

126
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,600
Zinven was like a iked thief.

127
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm asking you.

128
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,040
I'll take you to see someone.

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,760
As long as you're happy.

130
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,360
Pei Congzhi.

131
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,000
You seem to be different.

132
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,800
What's the difference?

133
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,200
I'm not sure.

134
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,360
But compared to before,

135
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,760
you seem to have more blood.

136
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,440
You're different.

137
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,920
Is this in the palace?

138
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
I think I've blocked your way.

139
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,560
Elder Brother.

140
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,640
Sister Qingtang.

141
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,400
I have a question for you.

142
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,240
How long have you been with Brother Congzhi?

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,280
You saw it just now.

144
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,400
Don't misunderstand.

145
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,280
We...

146
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,840
We are just...

147
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,160
Now that I'm married,

148
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,840
how can I not know about men and women?

149
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,480
Brother, he looks at you.

150
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,640
He's not clear.

151
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,400
That's good.

152
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,560
This is hard for a woman.

153
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I used to know

154
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,040
you and Lord Yan Cheng's engagement was very thoughtful.

155
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,640
But now,

156
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,040
if I have you,

157
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
I believe that

158
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,160
you will be happy in the future.

159
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,960
Ziqi.

160
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,320
Don't you think it's strange?

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,280
Brother and I are brothers.

162
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,320
You have nothing to do with the company.

163
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,400
Why do you have to go there?

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,760
Besides, I used to think

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,160
that you are always

166
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,600
a liar.

167
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,520
Now I think

168
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
that this love

169
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,200
is not a brotherly love.

170
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,360
It's a proof that he loves you.

171
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,560
Those liars

172
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,440
are better said

173
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,880
because he's in control of the company.

174
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,320
Brother was only 17 years old when he was in the royal family.

175
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,720
He was willing to marry into Hanlin High School.

176
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,200
His Majesty gave him a piece of firewood jade.

177
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,280
I and Pei Jinming

178
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,760
didn't want to give it to you,

179
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,800
but gave it to you.

180
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,000
So I thought

181
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,080
that you'd give it to His Majesty first,

182
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,000
and give it to him after you've done that.

183
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,040
I'm afraid

184
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,360
you will have to wait long

185
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,840
toaffen to get disqualified soon.

186
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,120
You are trying to audition your baobas.

187
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,400
Right?

188
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,640
That's right.

189
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,520
Besides,

190
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,160
he filzed through Yongzhou.

191
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,500
You know what?

192
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,060
I know he came back

193
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,920
to bring me

194
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
the jade formally sent out.

195
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,920
He lost his horse.

196
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,920
He lost his horse, too.

197
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,920
No wonder

198
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,480
the whole Pei Manor

199
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,720
went to the Imperial Courtyard.

200
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,120
I thought it was his wishful thinking.

201
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,480
It's just that

202
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,840
it's too embarrassing.

203
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,000
He's too happy.

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,720
I can't mention it to you.

205
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,160
You're more important

206
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
to him than many things.

207
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,360
If he doesn't have you in his heart,

208
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,440
how could he refuse so many family rules?

209
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,440
Sister,

210
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,800
why don't you stay with him

211
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,960
in the heart

212
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,080
to try to take it?

213
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,440
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the world.

214
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,440
It's better to leave the past behind.

215
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,440
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the world.

216
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,440
It's better to leave the past behind.

217
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,440
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the world.

218
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,440
It's better to leave the past behind.

219
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the world.

220
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
It's better to leave the past behind.

221
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:53,440
The face that I used to see in the night.

222
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,440
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the dream.

223
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,440
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the world.
