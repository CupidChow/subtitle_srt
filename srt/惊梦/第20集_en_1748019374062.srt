1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have never seen myself before.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How can I stay in this dream?

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How can I turn around and escape?

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Or is it just a game of game?

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm so curious.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I be happy?

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm so curious.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How can I be happy?

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm so curious.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How can I be happy?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm so curious.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How can I hug you?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will clear my memories.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have no regrets in my dream.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The Love by the Sea

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Episode 19

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Your Highness, you and my mother are really old friends.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Child, we finally meet.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Your mother is the former emperor and consort.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm the former emperor and the old woman.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You are the former emperor and the bloodline of the late emperor.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm the former emperor and the bloodline of the late emperor?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Child, as for your mother,

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
why did you come to look for me?

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You came to help me to help you.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We have been together for years.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We have never been together.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We have been close to each other.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now that the Four Seas are safe,

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I only want to be a peaceful and peaceful person.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't want to be separated anymore.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm afraid that I can't have you anymore.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Take her away.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Your Highness, are you still not saying?

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you continue to be a criminal,

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you will lose your life.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I was arrested and imprisoned by the Chao Lu.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm a criminal.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm just a prince.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I've been like a criminal for a long time.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's okay.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Now that you are in my hands,

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
even if you don't want to show up,

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I will still be able to count the three armies.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Tell me where the Royal Guard of the Front.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How would I know when I was born?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't be ridiculous.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You are the royal bloodline of the front.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Your mother must have entrusted you with the money.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You still have a little bit of pain

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
after you left the He Pan today.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now that the Yihu Die is in danger,

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
no one will know that

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you have left a shadow.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I will definitely be responsible for anything you ask me.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But I can't tell you about this for now.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There are too many involved.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If I don't keep it safe,

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I will definitely make you feel better.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's no use to ask me again.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I have patience.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want to see

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
whether it's your hard work or your life.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I have already left my words in my heart.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I am just trying to prove my innocence.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's really a good thing to see.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I said this.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Do you really think

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I will use those dirty tricks?

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You will have his threat.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Then you won't be able to do anything.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You will be so weak.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You can hide Shen Qing Tao's identity.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
His secret

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
will be kept in the whole country.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I will do my best to protect him.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Even if his identity is exposed,

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will take him to the world

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
at the age of 70,000.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Pei Cong Zhi,

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
you made me stay away from Yan City

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and joined the Prince of the South again.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's to protect you.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You let me stay in the capital today.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I was wrong about you.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But why?

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You never changed.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Could it be that in your eyes,

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I am so weak and helpless

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that I can't fight with you?

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Qing Tao.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yan Cheng, why are you back?

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry, Qing Tao.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Until now,

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I only know that my father

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
has been so mean to you.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I didn't expect that I would beg for your sincerity

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and take the blame for his treacherous plan.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's none of your business.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's our fault.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll take you away.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Go.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Be careful.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Pei Cong Zhi,

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I will never let you stop me again.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The Prince of the South wants to rebel

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and try to rebel.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He has already been a traitor.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
As the son of the rebel,

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
you can't escape from the sin.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If you take away Shen Qing Tao,

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
what will you protect him for the rest of your life?

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Qing Tao.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I didn't expect that I would still be able to take you away.

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I still can't take you away.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If anything happens,

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I will come to find you sooner.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yan Cheng.

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Pei Cong Zhi.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
From now on,

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
whether he is your confidant,

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
or your beloved,

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
don't let him down.

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Allow him to be the best father

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
in the world.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I will do my best.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I will do my best.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I will do my best.

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Allow him to be the best future.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Take care.

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I will do my best.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The flowers are falling gently.

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
They are falling slowly in my heart.

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I am looking for you.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I am not afraid of the dark.

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I am a man.

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I am a man.

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I am a man.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I am a man.

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I am a man.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I am a man.

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's dark and fresh.

155
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's a good thing to turn around.

156
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I am afraid that I will disappear.

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I am going to make mistakes.

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I am going to make mistakes.

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
In the dream,

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I can see your face.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I am afraid that I will be alone.

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I am afraid that I will be alone.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The flowers are falling gently.

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They are falling slowly in my heart.
