1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have never seen myself before

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why I have never seen myself before

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I stay in this dream

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I turn around

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Love is a game of ice and fire

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so excited

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you are willing to be with me

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How can I hold you tight

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that the spring breeze will wake up the memories

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What's the point of dreaming

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The End

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Episode 19

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Qingtang, I've seen Princess Zhao He

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What's this on your neck?

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Maybe the traces of the poison left by Wen Chong

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Is it?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's not the big deal between the two countries

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Qingtang, you are coming to attend

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I think you and Yan Cheng are friends

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You come to play together

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Princess, I'm here to see you

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll take my leave

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Shen Qingtang

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll make you regret

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
for disturbing her

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm so worried about you

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You smile

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yan Cheng is the most beautiful

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But I haven't seen this smile for a long time

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I forgot that you are a heartless girl

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wan'er, you are a pure girl.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You are also a girl from Pei Manor.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why do you need to be here?

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I am here.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I can make you feel better.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But I can't rely on you all my life.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
One day, I will leave Pei Manor and be more and more independent.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Leave?

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know when my sister has such a heart.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I will be here.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When did you start to have such a heart?

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's not mine.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I know how to be independent and free

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
when I am free.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I know how to be free.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Free?

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't leave me.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You are mine. You are mine.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Pei Congzhi, let me go.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We are brothers.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't want you to be my sister.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I want you to be my woman.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't think about it.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You can only be in my palm.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What is the meaning of death?

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No matter when I am free,

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I must leave here.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I will stay here.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I will stay here.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
My sister Qingtang.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yancheng.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I waited for you in the yard for long last night,

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
but I didn't see you here.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I thought you were angry with me.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,720
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,600
Don't be so rude to Brother Yan Cheng.

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
How could I be rude?

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
As long as Sister Qingtang

75
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,280
is willing to be my friend.

76
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,040
You can wear this embroidery sword with me.

77
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,840
When I'm not around,

78
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,800
you can help me protect you.

79
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,440
Thank you, Brother Yan Cheng.

80
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,800
I will wear it every day.

81
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,180
Like the emperor

82
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,140
I don't think he will kidnap me again.

83
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,540
Maybe

84
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,440
that'sway of Peijia's daughter,

85
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,960
Jin 했 للSming Rose.

86
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,480
Indeed you are very humble.

87
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,200
It's no wonder you two tighten your fairowie knot.

88
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,520
King of Pingnan

89
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,960
learnt how to Whoever is a Wei Er from the ancient 1939 Toucheен purple tighter case.

90
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,120
is known as a love cannabis,

91
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,640
enrich or improve自己.

92
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
I agree.

93
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,800
As long as I'm godfather,

94
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,680
I'll be aremos.

95
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,240
As you wish.

96
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,840
I'll do everything for Xun Yiman inner court.

97
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,520
No one need to engage with people like you.

98
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,920
Thank you.

99
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,040
Thanks, My Lord.

100
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,520
nicotineتى tavam echo!

101
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,520
OK.

102
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,360
Good.

103
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,600
Your Majesty,

104
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,640
you were the best move

105
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,120
you made just now.

106
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,600
Do you dare to compare

107
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,600
your courage

108
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,800
with our Yunguan move?

109
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,960
The Heart-to-Heart.

110
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,080
Heart-to-Heart?

111
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Brother Hong,

112
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,760
the Heart-to-Heart is

113
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,000
the most important thing

114
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,240
for the head of the people.

115
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,360
It's called the high-heeled.

116
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,800
After hearing that

117
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,960
the Crown Prince of Yan City is good at the long-term,

118
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,480
it's good to take the opportunity

119
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,600
to shake the country's prestige.

120
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,040
The new person of the Crown Prince of Yan City

121
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,400
is also at the scene.

122
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,000
Qingtang,

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,520
you must accompany the Yan City Prince

124
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,840
to participate in the competition.

125
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
I'm willing to.

126
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,520
Lord Pei,

127
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,640
do you want to ask for a favor from me?

128
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,520
No.

129
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,720
It seems that he is not

130
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,680
that kind of person in Lord Pei's heart.

131
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,160
Qingtang,

132
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,440
do you trust me?

133
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,360
I do.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,720
For you,

135
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,640
I must win.

136
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,960
Gui,

137
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,840
there's fire.

138
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,280
Go.

139
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,000
Sister Qingtang,

140
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,960
are you okay?

141
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,400
Lord Yan City Prince,

142
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,440
this is your fault.

143
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,880
If you can't do anything,

144
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,160
please stay away from him.

145
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,680
Qingtang,

146
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,720
Qingtang.

147
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,080
Your Majesty,

148
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,960
there's fire in my heart.

149
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,240
I'm afraid that someone who has a heart

150
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
wants to do this.

151
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,920
It's a matter of breaking the relationship between the two countries.

152
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,480
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

153
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,920
I'll finish the competition

154
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,880
and find the behind-the-scenes master.

155
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,000
Stop it.

156
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,560
I'll take you away.

157
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,640
Qingtang,

158
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,080
I...

159
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,560
Leave...

160
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,800
my hand.

161
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,600
I can manage it myself.

162
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,600
Give it to me.

163
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,240
And so you suffer the same.

164
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,880
You know

165
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,000
that's why,

166
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,960
even you sell your beauty

167
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,280
I will no consorts vote.

168
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,400
But you know

169
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,720
that princess Zhao He created this situation.

170
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,240
And you knelt down at me, right?

171
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,760
They could expect us

172
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,120
even if we're not like this.

173
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,800
But she's already in defending activity!

174
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,200
Princess Zhao He trained me

175
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,520
because you were his spiel.

176
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,320
I'd rather stay away from her

177
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,040
and be a brother and sister of Xun Chang

178
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,840
and marry Princess Zhao He.

179
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,200
I won't be her father.

180
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,160
You're so eager to marry someone else?

181
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm in the royal family

182
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,520
because of the marriage between princess and you.

183
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,360
I can't get married in Qingtang.

184
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,880
But she treats me like a child.

185
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,200
If I don't marry her soon,

186
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,760
I'll be considered as her enemy.

187
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,320
That way, I'll be more and more beautiful.

188
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,320
I said

189
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,120
you're the only one I want.

190
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,520
If you agree,

191
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,400
even if it's a marriage between the two of us,

192
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,080
I'll be punished for it.

193
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,560
Qingtang.

194
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,640
Are you okay?

195
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,000
Go away. Don't touch me.

196
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,560
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,840
Li Fan Zhao

198
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,440
must have broken something else.

199
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,640
It seems

200
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,880
he didn't just hurt me,

201
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,160
but also hurt my uncle.

202
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,040
He's a suspect.

203
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,840
Don't touch me.

204
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,760
Sister Qingtang.

205
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,240
Sister Qingtang, stay.

206
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,080
Your Highness.

207
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,280
What?

208
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,920
I can do it.

209
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,280
But I can't.

210
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm afraid of the future.

211
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,840
I'm afraid of the future.

212
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,440
I'm afraid of the future.

213
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,080
I'm afraid of the future.

214
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,920
I'm afraid of the future.

215
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,440
I'm afraid of the future.

216
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,040
I'm afraid of the future.

217
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm afraid of the future.

218
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,280
I'm afraid of the future.

219
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,080
I'm afraid of the future.

220
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,600
I'm afraid of the future.

221
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm afraid of the future.

222
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,440
I'm afraid of the future.

223
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,400
I'm afraid of the future.

224
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
I'm afraid of the future.

225
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,560
I'm afraid of the future.

226
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I'm afraid of the future.

227
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm afraid of the future.

228
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,880
I'm afraid of the future.
