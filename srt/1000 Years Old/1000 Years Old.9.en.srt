1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:04,633
I thought you said one week.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,400
Wow! Did Janja gave you that much time?

3
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:11,533
Master Pun?

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,033
Come to think about it, I don’t think it’s just one week though.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,866
I gave you just one week.

6
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:26,166
For you to live your life however you want it with master Yoh…

7
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:31,466
And that nonsense you’re doing on that rooftop.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,300
You don’t have to repeat that.

9
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:38,233
And “All Hail Pork Blood Soup” is not nonsense.

10
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:39,133
You see?

11
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:43,500
It must get much worse if I let you go for too long.

12
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:48,600
Master Pun…

13
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,633
You are a vampire.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,900
I am a vampire.

15
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,633
We are…

16
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,300
We supposed to get married before we reach thousand years old.

17
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:01,366
Is that correct?

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,233
You are a vampire.

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
You should get back to be what you really are.

20
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,200
How long have to been devoid of human’s blood?

21
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:23,966
It must be too long…

22
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:30,933
that you think you’re a human now.

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,966
I know what I am.

24
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,900
You don’t have to lecture me.

25
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,600
Then, I’ll take him from you.

26
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:44,200
I mean master Yoh.

27
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:46,633
Because I’m eyeing him for a while now.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,133
Master Pun.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,700
Can you shut up?

30
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:54,433
Master Pun.

31
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,100
We made a promise.

32
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:59,766
I hope you will not break it.

33
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,433
Come meet me by the end of this week.

I want to help you finish your experiment quickly.

61
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,700
Shall we do it?

00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:44,266
I’m ready.

Erm…

64
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,833
Hit me straight to my heart, master Yoh.

But not too hard.

66
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,966

Let’s skip this one.

103
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:40,066
I can’t do it. I really can’t. Just forget about it.

104
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:01,733
Pun!

105
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,900
It is confirmed now, right?

106
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,933
He really is a vampire.

107
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,566
Vampire does exist in the world…

108
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:28,933
And one is right in front of me.

109
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,100
Oh… what are we doing here?

110
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:40,733
Are you guys flirting?

111
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,700
His wound heals by itself.

112
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,966
Wow! How is that possible?

113
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,333

114
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:12,300
That’s too much.

115
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,866
You’re so divine. Master vampire Pun.

116
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,600
Back then, my wound heals even faster than this.

117
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,133
It’s my honor to serve a vampire.

118
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,566
What’s wrong with you.

119
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,000
Let go of me.

120
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,466
Back off.

121
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:36,666
Let go of me.

122
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,866
You really are a vampire.

123
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,866
I’m so sorry I didn’t believe you at first.

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,466
Please accept me as your apprentice.

125
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,366
Back off.

126
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:48,600
I only allow master Yoh to hug me.

127
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,200
Ouch!

128
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:50,866
No!

129
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,900
(Burn, stand in the sun)

130
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,966
This is the one I fear the most, master Yoh.

131
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:24,933
I don’t like sunlight.

132
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,733
And I didn’t apply my sunblock today.

133
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,033
Will I die, master Yoh?

134
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:35,733
Come on,

135
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,400
it’s just sunlight.

136
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,966
You should be more dead from a stake to your heart,
shouldn’t you, Pun?

137
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,600
True.

138
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,033
Come on.

139
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,766
This one should be easy.

140
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,666
Do we have some shorter walkway?

141
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:55,933
It’s not that far.

142
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,366
You have to walk over there

143
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,700
and walk back here

144
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:00,933
and it’s done.

145
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,400
It’s not that hard.

146
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:08,633
Even normal human wouldn’t want to walk there, master Yoh.

147
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,766
It’s so far away.

148
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,966
It’s not far.

149
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,533
Alright, for this one,

150
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,600
you only have to stand still…

151
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:27,133
But for five minutes.

152
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,100
There’s only thing left to do.

153
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,433
Just do it.

154
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,300
Then we can go back to our restaurant.

155
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
For you, master Yoh.

156
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,466
Alright, go on. You got this.

157
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,666
If I die,

158
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:06,133
I want to be with you again in my next life.

159
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:07,933
What are you talking about?

160
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:10,733
Give me your umbrella.

161
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,333
Ouch!

162
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,766
It’s hot.

163
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:37,433
I’m burning.

164
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:43,300
I don’t like this at all.

165
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:46,233
Ouch!

166
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:50,600
My skin!

167
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:54,666
Ouch!

168
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
My body!

169
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:00,966
It’s too hot!

170
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:02,900
Ouch!

171
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,133
It’s too hot.

172
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,600
Ouch!

173
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:20,966
Ouch!

174
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,866
My goal right now…

175
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:41,100
Is to spend the rest of my life with my friends.

176
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,533
Thank you all so much.

177
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:47,266
Thank you for being my friends.

178
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,533
I want to stay with you all for much longer.

179
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,400
I wish I have more time here.

180
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,300
You can stay. Who’s chasing you out anyway?

181
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,233
Your name is ‘May live long’ anyway.

182
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,766
You can stay, Pun.

183
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,633
Yoh would want to be with you.

184
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:15,866
Umm.

185
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:20,066
But right now, shall we take shelter from the sun first?

186
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,133
Good idea.

187
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,833
Are you alright?

188
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,500
Are you feeling better?

189
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,466
A little coldness can help.

190
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:44,600
But it would be better if I bath in ice water.

191
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,433
You take a bath in ice water?

192
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,333
Yes, I bath in ice water.

193
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,200
Thailand is so hot like this,

194
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,600
who would want to bath in warm water anymore?

195
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:57,966
Yoh does.

196
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,200
He takes hot shower.

197
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:01,866
Wow!

198
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:04,700
I like that you take hot shower.

199
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:07,433
It warms my heart.

200
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,866
It’s so great.

201
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,066
I’m going on a date with master Yoh again.

202
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,633
This ice cream is so good too.

203
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:21,600
Normally,

204
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,366
vampire would die if they’re in contact with sunlight.

205
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:26,800
But you’re kinda nice being this way.

206
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:30,500
You don’t die, just don’t like it.

207
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:32,800
But it will ruin my skin, master Yoh.

208
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,300
It’s hot.

209
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,733
It burns me.

210
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,433
Hey! By the way, what about Somchai?

211
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,433
Somchai doesn’t carry an umbrella.

212
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,833
He doesn’t fear the sun as much as you do.

213
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,233
Because I’m weak, master Yoh.

214
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:56,966
Because I don’t drink human blood,

215
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,200
it’s normal for me to grow weaker.

216
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,200
But at least, I’m happy.

217
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,666
Uncle, do you happen to have a used undertaker’s hoe?

218
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,000
You don’t have to be this hurry to prove yourself.

219
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:15,233
Actually, you can take some rest for now.

220
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,033
I’m in a hurry.

221
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:19,500
What make you hurry?

222
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,766
Thank you, thank you.

223
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,033
(Cut the head off with undertaker’s hoe.)

224
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,366
Cut the head off with undertaker’s hoe.

225
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,300
That’s too extreme, Yoh.

226
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,966
Who would survive a decapitation?

227
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:46,633
What are we doing again?

228
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:52,433
Do it, master Yoh.

229
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:54,933
Hey! Yoh!

230
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,766
Remember my smile, master Yoh.

231
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,966
I’m going for it.

232
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,300
This is ridiculous.

233
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,733
What are we even doing?

234
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,466
I was joking. I would never go through with it.

235
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,933
Come on, Yoh. You scared me.

236
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,033
But I like it.

237
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,366
I like that master Yoh are serious with nonsense.

238
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:38,800
And I like all the nonsense that you’re serious with.

239
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,833
Damn right.

240
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,466
Let’s get back to our restaurant.

241
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,833
I don’t think Shin will survive on his own.

242
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:47,133
That’s right.

243
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,700
The one thing that we can do well now

244
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,800
is…

245
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:54,400
All hail pork blood soup!

246
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,133
That one is no nonsense.

247
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:07,300
I’m returning your hoe, sir.

248
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,266
I almost die because of it.

249
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:11,433
I wouldn’t be cruel enough to kill you, Mr. Pun.

250
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
So… What’s next?

251
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:16,000
Cut my heart out?

252
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:17,466
(Cut the heart out.)

253
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:18,600
I’m not gonna do that.

254
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,733
Why?

255
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,633
I guess your heart is not there with you anymore.

256
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:28,100
How do you know?

257
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:32,266
Because your heart belongs to me.

258
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:34,400
I’m sure that’s what you’re gonna say.

259
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:38,066
You know me by heart.

260
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:42,800
Go ahead. Flirt with each other more.

261
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,166
We’re heading back.

262
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,533

Where are all these people coming from?

268
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,166
From our restaurant’s Tiktok?

269
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,400
Educational vampire?

270
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,733
Or the ‘Dew Dew’ song?

271
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:32,733
I’m here.

272
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,100

00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah.

274
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:39,133
Very handsome. Master Shin is very handsome.

275
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,233
Master Shin cool.

276
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,933

I can’t believe it.

278
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,933
Maybe because I’m handsome?

279

Hey, is the bottle full?

280
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,433

Okay, sure.

394
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,600
Are you ready?

395
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:06,166
Go on.

00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:07,766
Let me hear some of it.

397
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:24,800
Erm...

398
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:27,300

00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:28,000
Um.

400
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:40,433
It’s so beautiful.

401
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,633
Oh, you haven’t started yet?

402
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:46,066
Go on.

403
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,633
I want to hear it too.

404
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:19,400
Are you not surprise…

405
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,533
to learn that I’m a vampire too?

406
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:39,600
Do you think Pun will success with courting Yoh?

407
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,700
He might be.

408
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,400
I think so.

409
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,633
Yoh seems to have feelings for him too.

410
00:26:45,866 --> 00:26:46,600
Right?

411
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:48,433
If that wasn’t the case, Yoh wouldn’t have move here.

412
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,000
Woah! Really?

413
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:52,133
Really.

414
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,533
Erm… but who is Janja?

415
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:58,900
A thorn in Yoh’s side.

416
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Don’t ever let her get near Pun and Yoh ever again!

417
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,700
It’s getting more complicated.

418
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,133
Don’t forget about that guy too.

419
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,700
What guy?

420
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Somchai.

421
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:20,266
You smell so good.

422
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,933
I want to taste you right now.

423
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:39,766
Don’t be afraid, master Yoh.

424
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,600
I’ll take care of it.

425
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,866
Is that all you got?

426
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:53,966
Huh?

427
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:00,833
More! More!

428
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,166
More!

429
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:25,933
Good!

430
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,733
That’s enough, Pun!

431
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:34,266
Pun!

432
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:37,433
Enough!

433
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:49,066
Pun looks so scary when he’s like this.

434
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:52,933
This is not Pun I know.

435
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,333
If you touch master Yoh again, I will kill you!

436
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:18,800
It’s almost a thousand year.

437
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:21,100
We all going to die soon anyway.

438
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,600
I’m not fear death.

439
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:27,333
You’re gonna fucking die before reaching thousand year.

440
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:28,933
Wow!

441
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,400
Master Pun is so angry that he’s seeing red.

442
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:32,900
He even uses curse word against me!

443
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,533
Master Yoh, you have to be careful.

444
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:43,733
When Pun gets angry, he’ll be seeing red.

445
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,200
In that moment, no one can stop him.

446
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:51,566
He will do something violent without realizing it.

447
00:29:58,033 --> 00:29:58,833
I’m so scared.

448
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,066
I’m sorry.

449
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,433
I’ll take my leave for now.

450
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,133
I don’t want to die.

451
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,333
What should I do?

452
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,066
What can I do to calm him down?

453
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,300
This must be the way.

454
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,433
We’re so close together now.
I hope Pun will calm down.

455
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:41,733
I smell great today.

456
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,600
I’ll allow you to smell me all you want.

457
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:50,700
You said it yourself.

458
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,733
Yeah. Today,

459
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,100
you can smell me all you want.

460
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,800
Pun?

461
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:26,700
You’re zoning out.

462
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:29,666
Let’s go to my room.

463
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:32,900
Hey, wait, wait.

464
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,200
Guitar.

465
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:35,533
Your guitar.

466
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:37,033
Forget about it.

467
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,533
- Wait. What is this?
- Hurry.

468
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:39,600
- what are you doing?
- Get to my room.

469
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:42,333
Do you think they’re taking too long now?

470
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:44,566
Yeah.

471
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:47,666
Should we get up there to check?
In case there have problem.

472
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,300
Where are they gone?

473
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:12,733
I guess…

474
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,533
They going out for a date again.

475
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:24,466
Come on. Let’s go to sleep.

476
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,266
Where did they go for a date?

477
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:36,500
I don’t know.

478
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:39,900
They even forgot the guitar.

479
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,233
Can they left their bag and umbrella.

480
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,800
Umm. Yeah.

481
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,766
Thank you for protecting my neck.

482
00:33:58,633 --> 00:33:59,533
I already promise.

483
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:01,866
I will protect you.

484
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:04,566
And your neck…

485
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,233
Is precious to me.

486
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:11,866
Come on, is that so?

487
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:13,533
Yes.

488
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,066
You should take a shower and go to bed.

489
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:22,000
Huh?

490
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,033
But you said you will let me smell you.

491
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,166
Well, you already did that.

492
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,233
But it wasn’t enough.

493
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:32,500
You have to sleep with me.

494
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:37,266
Goodnight then, Mr, Pun.

495
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:38,933
What?

496
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,733
You’re leaving now?

497
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,333
You don’t want me to leave?

498
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,433
Do you want me to bath you?

499
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,500
Bath me…

500
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:56,600
Like you would bath master Tuiye.

501
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,733
I’m joking. See ya.

502
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:01,666
Wait, Master Yoh.

503
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:06,033
I…

504
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,733
I will keep you safe.

505
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,133
Don’t be afraid.

506
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:45,133
Erm…

507
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,066
Nothing happened.

508
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:51,400
I’m going back to my room.

509
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:55,200
Thank you for staying with me.

510
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:56,366
Yeah.

511
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:11,900
Oh, thank you, Kamsai.

512
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:13,233
Goodnight.

513
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,533
Your welcome. Goodnight.

514
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,466
Let’s celebrate Songkran festival.

515
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,433
No, don't take Papa first.

516
00:37:32,866 --> 00:37:34,133
This is it.

517
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:35,266
Sorry.

518
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,700
Are you running out of water?

519
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,733
Are you running out of water?

520
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,166
Look, the water is gone.

521
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:42,833
very sad.

522
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:02,166
Mr. Pun should be like this.

523
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:07,566
Even though, the guy last night can be scary.

524
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:09,533
Hey, it's wet.

525
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:13,000
Crowd.

526
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:15,900
Ouch! cool.

527
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:38,466
Not that way.

528
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:43,066
- May you live long and prosper, young man.
- Amen to that. Granny.

529
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:44,266
May you have good health.

530
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,900
Thank you. May you have good health.

531
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,533
Umm.

532
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,333
And granny is still confused.

533
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,600
What is going on?

534
00:38:57,766 --> 00:39:00,366
It’s time to get back to drink human blood,
Isn’t it, Master Pun?

535
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:06,666
