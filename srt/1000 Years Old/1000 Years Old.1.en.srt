1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,600
Many people are still debating…

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,760
whether or not they are…

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,160
extraordinary beings in this world.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,440
Aliens. Martian.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,920
Mutants.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,240
Those superheroes in the movies
who have power to save the world…

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
Or something like that.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,800
Do they live among humans like us?

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,480
No one can give any clear answer.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,120
Even I myself, who love this kind of thing very much.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,400
But one thing that I’m about to find out…

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,000
And it might exist for real…

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
That is...

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,000

35

Are you sure that we’re gonna see it there?

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,200
There’s… a possibility.

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,640
Of course, we’re gonna see it.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,280
Don’t shut down our dream, Luis.
We’ve been driving for too long now.

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,960
(UFO)

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
Hey! You found something?

41
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,920
I just captured the view.

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,240
As if we’re gonna find something right away.

43
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,040
(Khao Kala, Nakhon Sawan Province, Thailand)
Woah! What a nice scenery.

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,560
It has been 2 nights, Yoh.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,280
I don’t see anything at all.

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,880
Did we come here at a wrong season?

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,440
But from what I checked,

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,600
they say you can come here any times.

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,320
As long as the sky is clear.
There’s nothing to do with season.

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,320
Really? Let me try to communicate.

51
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,080
Come out. I want to see you.
Come out. Let me see you.

52
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,680
The mosquitoes are eating me alive now.

53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,200
Hey!

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,320
Or do we have to use telepathy?

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,520
Put your hands up.

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
What is that for, Pak?

57
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
Put your hands up like this.

58
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,120
That’s right.

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,920
- Very good.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,400
Put your hands up like this.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,040
Are you sure, Pak?

62
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,400
Yeah. That’s really how they do it.

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,000
Ready?

64
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,800
Everyone, head ups.

65
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,640
Close your eyes.

66
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,960
Luis!

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,440
If you don’t close your eyes,
I will poke your eyes out.

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Okay, ready? Close your eyes, everyone.

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,280
Make a wish in your mind together…

70
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,080
Say want to find, to meet, to see.

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,120
May they show themselves in front of us. Amen.

72
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,400
Do we have to say Amen?

73
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,840
Yeah. Together. Come on.

74
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,320
- Amen.
- Amen.

75
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,960
Can I open my eyes now?

76
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,480
Yeah, you can open your eyes.

77
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,960
Did you see that?

78
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,600
It works!

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,200
It works!

80
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,640
That dancing blinking lights.

81
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,080
They say those are lights from unidentified flying object.

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,680
And that can only means...

83
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,960
What are you doing, Pak?

84
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,360
I’m gathering energy.

85
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,280
They came from aliens…

86
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,520
The aliens who come to visit Earth.

87
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,040
That’s settled then.

88
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,280
We will focus on this subject.

89
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,040
Got it.

90
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
Whatever Yoh says.

91
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,400
You guys know what?
There’s nothing in the world…

92
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,120
that pique my interest more than this.

93
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,360
Hey!

94
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,800
Let’s go. We’re being too loud.

95
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,760
(Mr. V’s Pork blood soup the original.)

96
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
Pork blood soup. Extra blood.

97
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,480
- One bowl please.
- Same as usual? Please have a seat.

98
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,920
Same as usual.

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,400
Do you want rice to go with it today?

100
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,600
One rice please.

101
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,760
This guy is kinda weird.

102
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
He’s using an umbrella…

103
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,600
At this time of day?

104
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,760
He’s wearing sunglasses too?

105
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,280
There is barely any sunlight now.

106
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,000
He’s acting so mysterious.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,080
He doesn’t dress like
he’s going out for pork blood soup.

108
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,760
What is that?

109
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,800
Why is his bowl so big?

110
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
Who the hell can eat all that?

111
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,200
Weird.

112
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,080
Erm… Nope. I’m not looking at you.

113
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,480
How can he stomach all that?

114
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,760
Hey, wait a minute.

115
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,560
How can he finish it?

116
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,120
Huh?

117
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,720
Another bowl?

118
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Very weird.

119
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,880
How can a normal person eat that much?

120
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,720
This one is a special regular customer. VVIP.

121
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,160
What? There’s someone more special than me?

122
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,160
Your ranking is dropping.

123
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,880
Huh?

124
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,560
Curse you! You think you’re more special than me?

125
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,840
Sis…

126
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,640
Bring me two of those.

127
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,320
Let’s prove it once and for all.

128
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,840
Between you and me…

129
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,280
Who is the real deal? The real fan of Pork blood soup.

130
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,080
That’s all you can eat and you think you can beat me?

131
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,760
What a rookie.

132
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,360
Who do you think you’re playing with?

133
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Mysterious man.

134
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,520
Are you gonna eat that much?

135
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,120
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Do you want some of these?
I took it home from the cart. I can’t eat anymore.

137
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,680
I don’t like blood like someone here.

138
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,360
I like blood, so what?

139
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,600
Come on, it’s delicious. You don’t know it.

140
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,600
It’s full of iron and protein.

141
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,080
And do you know what iron will help you?

142
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,280
They make me stronger? Since it’s iron?

143
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,800
I don’t know. All I know is it’s delicious.
Is that enough?

144
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,080
It helps prevent anemia.

145
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,120
Don’t talk if you don’t know
what you’re talking about.

146
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,400
Right, Thanks for the knowledge.

147
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,400
Okay.

148
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,520
Speaking of which…

149
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,960
That mysterious man.

150
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,280
There is something attractive about him.

151
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,240
I feel like I want to know more.

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
♪ Do you have any idea… ♪

153
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,000
♪ Do you have any idea… ♪
He’s interesting.

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,840
♪ Do you have any idea… ♪

155
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,480
♪ That you make this world more colorful. ♪

156
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,640
I found someone.

157
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,320
♪ Do you have any idea… ♪

158
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,760
♪ Do you have any idea… ♪
I think we can use him as a case study.

159
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,240
The main character in our documentary.

160
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,080
Who is it?

161
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,520
- Well...
- What are we discussing about again?

162
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,680
So, yesterday, …

163
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,000
I found someone very interesting.

164
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,400
Interesting?

165
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,520
- Huh?
- Hmm?

166
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,040
Well, he is interesting, in a weird way.

167
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,720
I’m interested in how we can study their behavior.

168
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,400
Huh?

169
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,920
What do you mean by that?

170
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,200
Yeah. And who is this person?

171
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,360
Well...

172
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,640
Free water. Self-service.

173
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,160
Come again? Free water or free fuck?

174
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,480
Free water, asshole.

175
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,880
Let’s go.

176
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,840
- Huh?
- Help me bring the water here, go.

177
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,280
Where is he?

178
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,760
Just wait. He will be here.

179
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,560
From what I know…

180
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,640
That guy might be...

181
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,160
Waiting for the sun to go down.

182
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,800
Huh?

183
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,520
Come on. It’s hard to explain.

184
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800
How is it gonna be, dude?

185
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,200
Yeah. I’m wondering too.

186
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,640
Kamsai.

187
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,840
The guy that afraid of sunlight, …

188
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,640
will he be here today?

189
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,520
Afraid of sunlight?

190
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,720
Oh, you mean the VVIP?

191
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,560
Umm.

192
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,120
I usually see him very late in the evening

193
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,280
or at night.

194
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,160
And are we gonna see him today?

195
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,520
I think so, since he come here every day.

196
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,000
Thank you.

197
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,560
There. There he is.

198
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,080
That’s him.

199
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,840
That’s the guy I’m interested in.

200
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,080
His name is Pun.

201
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,280
He’s kinda cute though.

202
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,520
He seems cool.

203
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
He doesn’t seem that weird.

204
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,560
(Free water
Self-service)

205
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,680
How about this?

206
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,560
I will take care of this target.

207
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,080
You want to study him or what?
Just tell me.

208
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,920
Come on, Pak.

209
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,920
What?

210
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,120
He’s actually handsome. Good-looking…

211
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,440
I have no problem with that.
He’s handsome in a weird way. That works for me.

212
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,520
You will only mess things up.

213
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,160
Nope. I’m not looking at you.

214
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,760
What? I can’t look at you now?

215
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,800
Here it comes.

216
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,160
Giant bowl again.

217
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,640
Sis…

218
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,920
Bring me two of those… No, three.

219
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,400
Hey, why did you order so much?
Can we eat all that?

220
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,240
It’s iron.

221
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,360
Iron is good for you. Don’t you know?

222
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Prevent Anemia.

223
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,360
Just eat it. It can help you.
Disease prevention, you know?

224
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,960
You guys don’t know anything.

225
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,080
Did you not pay attention in highschool?

226
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,640
What is it with you?

227
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,240
It’s… It’s iron.

228
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,840
What iron you’re talking about?

229
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,080
When it’s come to pork blood soup,
I’ll never lose.

230
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,200
Does he have Anemia?

231
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,360
I don’t know. All I know is he’s handsome.

232
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,880
Let it be known.

233
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,600
The real VVVIP customer is me.

234
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,640
All hail the pork blood soup! Woo!

235
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,880
You like to consume blood too?

236
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,720
Erm… Yeah.

237
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,240
So what?

238
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,520
So, we are the same kind.

239
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,040
You smell so good.

240
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Why did it become Slowmantic?

241
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,560
Erm… I have to go now.

242
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,280
My name is Pun. What is your name?

243
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,240
My name is Yoh.

244
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,640
All hail the pork blood soup.

245
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,840
All hail the pork blood soup, am I right?

246
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,600
You should go home. It’s getting dark.

247
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,040
Keep it in the fridge.

248
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,080
It will stay good for a long time.

249
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,160
But it’s better to eat fresh.

250
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,880
Sweet and nice aromatic.
It’s so tempting.

251
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,840
Wave goodbye.

252
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,880

Yeah, you’re right. What a weird dude?

258
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,240
I like it. The man from pork blood soup cult.

259
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,800

260
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,160

He said I… smell good.

274
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,560
Huh?

275
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,600
- Yeah, that’s so damn weird.
- What did you say?

276
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,880
Like, very weird.

277
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,600
But I don’t know why I feel familiar with him.

278
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,920
Those eyes…

279
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,720
(SAIFON APARTMENT)

280
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,160
(Room available
Monthly. Very Cheap!!!)

281
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,280
(Contact. 090-4424874)

282
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
I saw you in front of the building.

283
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,080
Why did you make a phone call?

284
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,880
Why don’t you just walk in?
I’m at the reception too.

285
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,800
You’re right.

286
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,360
I saw you were smiling alone. Are you crazy?

287
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,040
Yeah…

288
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,160
I haven’t opened this room for so long.

289
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,960
This is the room. Built in bathroom.

290
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,080
Air-conditioner. It’s still cold. I don’t even turn that on.

291
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,840
There might be a bit dusty.

292
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,240
This room has been vacant for so long.

293
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,880
I will get a broom for you.

294
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,240
Erm, Ma’am?

295
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,080
Hmm?

296
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,840
Do you have…

297
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,800
Erm… My friend…
My friend is happened to live here too.

298
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,720
Do you know if he…

299
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
Who is this friend of you?

300
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,360
Shit! You motherfucker!

301
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,480
I’m not getting this room.

302
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,960
His name is Pun.

303
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,480
That’s a nickname.
Can you give me his first name?

304
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
Who would rent a room with nickname?

305
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,520
Do you have your friend’s name?

306
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,600
You’re his close friend, you should know it, right?

307
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,920
His first name? I... I can’t remember.

308
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,880
It’s long.

309
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,040
Too long. His name is too complicated.
Hard to remember.

310
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,200
Oh, I found it.

311
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,160
Hmm. What is his first name?

312
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,240
Mr. Pun.

313
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,600
See? I told you,
His name is so hard to remember.

314
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,040
What about his last name?

315
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,600
Khongyuuyao (Might stay long.)

316
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,840
Mr. Pun Khongyuuyao?

317
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,680
Yeah, so weird.

318
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,520
Weird in every category.
Even his name is weird.

319
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,880
Let me see, how long will you gonna stay.

320
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,400
And… is the room next to him vacant?

321
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,880
Well, room 412 earlier right there is vacant.

322
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,040
The one I showed you.

323
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,600
I want the room next to his.

324
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,000
The room right next to his room.

325
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,040
Nope. There’s only that room left.

326
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,680
Hey, why don’t you just move in with your friend?

327
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,760
We... we’re that close.

328
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,280
Living next room is enough.

329
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,480
I don’t dare to sleep with him.

330
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,080
Erm… I’m afraid he might steal my stuff.

331
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,080
Hmm, he likes to steal things?

332
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,480
I lose my heart a day ago.

333
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,920
I think he stole my heart.

334
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,200
Sure.

335
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,240
May I put you the right way up, sir?

336
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,920
Please stay there.

337
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,160
I got a room.

338
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
It’s very nice location.

339
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,520
Are you really serious about doing this?

340
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,760
Yeah.

341
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,640
Yeah, right.

342
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,440
What did I get myself into?

343
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,400
Do you want me to go there instead?

344
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,960
Or we can all go together.

345
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,800
Erm, that’s not necessary.

346
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,320
I can deal with it.

347
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
And the room is small too.

348
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,640
You guys can help me researching other part.

349
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,920
Excuse me. This guy…

350
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,000
That guy, he…

351
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,040
Does he have anything to do with our project?

352
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,040
Of course, he does.

353
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,080
Our documentary needs a main character.

354
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,520
And if my judgment was not wrong…

355
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,960
That guy may not be a normal human.

356
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,920
What if that guy is not an ordinary human?

357
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,000
What if he’s a Martian…

358
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,680
Who came to Earth, looking for true love?

359
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,800
Right?

360
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
Nonsense.

361
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,600
But there is a possibility.

362
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,960
Because in the end,
that guy is weirder than normal people.

363
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,800
How is that?

364
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,200
Just because he’s acting weird?

365
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,720
I’ll have to study him first.

366
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,640
Well...

367
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,440
My sense told me there’s something.

368
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,000
People acting weird are quite normal though.

369
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,560
Hey, you don’t
believe in “YOU F O & THE GANG” anymore?

370
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,400
- Hey!
- Scoop it up!

371
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,680
Just keep digging. I’m tired now.

372
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,600
My hand hurts.

373
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,320
Are you guys tired yet?

374
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,840
Hey, wait. What will we name our gang?

375
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,160
Something like this must have a gang name to be cool.

376
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,320
What do you guys think?

377
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,800
UFO

378
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,800
Y O U F and O…

379
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,960
& THE GANG

380
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,160
I like it. YOU FO & THE GANG.

381
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,880
- It’s cute.
- Great.

382
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,840
That’s a fitting name. It makes itself clear.

383
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,960
Very on point.

384
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,040
Because we believe that in this vast universe,

385
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,640
there are other planets and aliens, right?

386
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,520
Yeah.

387
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,480
I will write it down now.

388
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,400
Go ahead.

389
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,320
Does ‘GANG’ need as ‘s’?

390
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,320
I don’t think so.

391
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,000
- Yeah. It’s singular.
- Only one gang.

392
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,000
Sorry.

393
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,440
(YOU F O & THE GANG!)

394
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,680
YOU.

395
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,320
F.

396
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,560
O.

397
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,200
AND THE GANG.

398
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,200
Long live!

399
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,120
Get up and help me.

400
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,200
We believe in it together.

401
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,280
We’re in this together.

402
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,000
We’ve been looking for it all these times.

403
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,760
Yeah, whatever Yoh says.

404
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,480
YOU F O & THE GANG!

405
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,000
Come on. Put your hand ups.

406
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,360
YOU F O & THE GANG!

407
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,400
Keep your voices down, students.

408
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,120
Sorry.

409
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,640
We almost screwed.

410
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,960

00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,400
Huh?

441
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,440
I’m 100 percent positive.

442
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,320
That arms belong to…

443
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,520
Mr. Pun Khongyuuyao.

444
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,320
(412)

445
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,760
You...

446
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,640
Mr. Pun. Erm… I mean, Pun.

447
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,160
You live here? In that room?

448
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,240
Yes, yes. I rented it a long ago…

449
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,160
but I just moved in.

450
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,160
Usually, they leave that room stay vacant…

451
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,360
since that incident…

452
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,640
Erm… let’s not talk about it.

453
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,080
I will lose my sleep.

454
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,440
You live alone, aren’t you afraid of ghost?

455
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,480
So, how long have you been living here?

456
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,160
Very long.

457
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,520
Very… long…

458
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,760
And how much for the rent?

459
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,800
A thousand.

460
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,440
A thousand?

461
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,240
There are still a room in that price?

462
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,880
You don’t pay the same rent?

463
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,040
The 4th floor will be a little expensive.

464
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,400
There’s only one room left

465
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,720
Since the former tenant had gone…

466
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,480
That’s no problem.

467
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,920
By the way, how much is the rent.

468
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,640
It’s close to college, close to motorway, …

469
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,200
not that far away from BTS

470
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,760
So, 9,900.

471
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,880
That’s impossible.

472
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
A thousand?

473
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,160
It should be the same price,
including water and electric bills.

474
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,480
I just pay thousand for everything.

475
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,800
What?! Is your room haunted?
Why is it so cheap?

476
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,120
Don’t worry about my room.

477
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,080
Your room is even more haunted.

478
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,560
Huh?

479
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,880
The same as usual today?

480
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,920
Yes. Extra-large, extra blood.

481
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,240
Just like a VVVIP customer.

482
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,280
Have a seat.

483
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,720
I’ll give you extra special today, for sure.

484
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,320
We’re having a promotion.

485
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,520
For the month of love.

486
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,120
If you order a set with your couple,

487
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,600
You will get 50 percent off.

488
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
Will you use that promotion?

489
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,720
We will use the couple promotion today.

490
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,240
Huh?

491
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,280
What are you doing?

492
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,920
You don’t have to feel enchanted by me.

493
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,680
I don’t think about you in any way more than I have to.

494
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,360
I was just saving my expenses.

495
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,600
So nice. They even let you go on the rooftop.

496
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Come on, get up here.

497
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,760
It’s too high. It’s dangerous.

498
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,400
Are you afraid of heights?

499
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,680
I’m not afraid. But… It’s just not safe.

500
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,040
You really are afraid.

501
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,760
Why did you get up there?

502
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,280
What is your intention with me?

503
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,320
I see you’re interesting in me.

504
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,720
Huh?

505
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,600
You moved into the same place I stay.

506
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,920
Erm...

507
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,880
At first, you seem to scared of me.

508
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,720
But now, you want to get closer to me.

509
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,800
What you’re doing is weird.

510
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,640
Come on, who can be weirder than you, Mr. Pun?

511
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
You are acting weird.

512
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,720
How am I weird?

513
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
Do you think I’m weird?

514
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,840
Hey! You’re normal. Like ordinary people.

515
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,200
Hmm…

516
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,840
I’m not like ordinary people.

517
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
You’re so silly.

518
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,920
Huh? What is it with you?

519
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,080
Do you want to know me?

520
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,400
For what reason?

521
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,800
State your intention. We have to be honest.

522
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Why are you following me?

523
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,040
Because...

524
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,480
I mean… No. I’m not following you.

525
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,200
I remember you.

526
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,320
When I look into your eyes…

527
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,080
Look into my eyes?

528
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,520
We have met each other before.

529
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,880
Huh? What did you say?

530
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,720
Why do I feel so familiar with him all of a sudden?

531
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,160
He seems familiar…

532
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,960
This must be you.

533
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,560
I remember your smell.

534
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,240
In fact, …

535
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,320
You remember me as well, right?

536
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:44,880
Huh?

537
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,120
What? Who remember what? Who remember who?

538
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,200
Hey...

539
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,040
Handsome bro, what is your name?

540
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,400
That man, he looks similar.

541
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,000
I want to taste that ice-cream too.

542
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,720
He just looks similar. Forget it.

543
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,240
Just thinking about it give me headache.

544
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,720
What? Where did he go?

545
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,280
Don’t tell me he is…

546
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,040
An alien that left to his planet on his space ship.

547
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,440
Mr. Pun.

548
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,040
Can you hear me? Are you in the room?

549
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,880
We haven’t done talking yet.

550
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,920
You can’t just disappear just like that.

551
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,640
Mr. Pun.

552
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,920
Mr. Pun.

553
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,840
Actually, …

554
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,840
I can tell you the truth.

555
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,280
My friends and I…

556
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,960
We had been studying about…

557
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,360
Like to consume blood…

558
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,840
Afraid of sunlight…

559
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,600
Like to smell…

560
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,160
I’m not like ordinary people.

561
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
You’re so silly.

562
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,240
And he’s not ordinary people.

563
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
What if that guy is not an ordinary human?

564
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,600
As I said in the beginning…

565
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,840
Many people are still debating…

566
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,720
Whether there is extraordinary life form on Earth?

567
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,280
Like aliens. Martian.

568
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,520
Do they really exist?

569
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,400
But one thing that I’m about to find out.

570
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,520
And it might exist for real…

571
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,360
That is…

572
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,600
