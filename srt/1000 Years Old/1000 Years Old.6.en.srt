If this is a TV-drama,

the hero like me should…

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,820
Kiss him.

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,070
But the hero like me just
wants to smell your scent.

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,080
You smell so good, so
refreshing, master Yoh.

27
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,200
How can I resist?

28
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,460
And for that…

29
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,700
Let’s wait until our relationship
develops further, master Yoh.

30
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,400
Goodnight, master Yoh.

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,750
See you again when you wake up.

32
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,580

42
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,020
Except pork blood soup.

43
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,070

I won’t charge you for that.

49
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,850
Hmm?

50
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,660
I’m doing business here.

51
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,600
Sorry for bothering you.

52
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,530
We have a place called

57
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,540
The restaurant is on the rooftop.

58
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,740
Bye-bye.

59
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,360

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,070
We’ll accept cash.

61
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,420
I’m joking.

62
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,460

If we don’t get more customer
by the end of this month,

86
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,800
I will pay for all the free soup sample
that we gave away.

87
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,160
Are you flirting with me?

88
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,080
Huh?

89
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,830
What are you talking about?

90
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,330
That’s nonsense.

91
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,410
Thank you.

92
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,640
Come on, shall we? Let’s open.

93
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,210
It’s almost evening now.

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,860
Don’t keep the customer waiting.

95
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,360
Yes, let’s go.

96
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,490
You seem agitated.

97
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,360
You’re being evasive.

98
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,540
You’re trying to change the subject
because you’re embarrassed.

99
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:29,860
Come on,

100
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,120
let’s go.

101
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,290
Go,

102
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,660
go.

103
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,030
(You're on the right track. Walk into the elevator.
All hail pork blood soup)

104
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:43,860
Let’s go.

105
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,800
Here you go.

106
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,170
Here you go, here you go.

107
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,520
Next time, I can make the
delivery to your room, Gyoza.

108
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,470
It’s okay. You guys have customers.
You guys must be very busy.

109
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,430
It’s fine. No matter how busy we are,
we will always deliver.

110
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,620
Grandma, what are you doing up here?

111
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,610
I told you, I’ll get it down for you.

112
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,520
Take my hand. Take my hand.

113
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,800
What would you like to order?

114
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,000
What would you like to order?

115
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,150
What would you like to order?

116
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,740
What would you like to order?

117
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,720
What would you like to order?

118
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,450
Why are you shouting, Shin?

119
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,580
I’m practicing it.

120
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,880
In case the customer comes in.

121
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,120
Please have a seat, sir.

122
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,220
Please have a seat.

123
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,760
We provide free ice.

124
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,570
As for the drink, It’s just plain water.

125
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,670
Drink all you want.

126
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,940
It’s super refreshing.

127
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,940
Quiet down, Shin.

128
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,990
Why didn’t you post that promo video yet?

129
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,540
Should I do that?

130
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,120
Yeah. What are you waiting for?

131
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,790
Well… will it turn out alright?

132
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,840
Of course, It will.

133
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,120
Are you sure?

134
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,380
Everyone acted very well.

135
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,550
So natural, so cute.

136
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,230
Except…

137
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,440
Why are you looking at me?

138
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,260
Am I that gorgeous?

139
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:53,700
Just post it.

140
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,210
Let the viewer decide.

141
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,170
At least, it’s better than that…

142
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,500
Pork blood soup. All Hail Pork Blood Soup…
I mean that song.

143
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,200
But that song is kinda catchy though.

144
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,210
It’s not?

145
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,960
I mean… I think…

146
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,160
I think I want blood.

147
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,910
Your blood.

148
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,730
Can I? Please?

149
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,500
Fine.

150
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,800
Fine. Fine. Fine.

151
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,780
Go ahead.

152
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,490
Has anyone complemented
me about my acting yet?

153
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,240
We just uploaded it.

154
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,380
It takes time.

155
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,080
It takes time for people to see it?

156
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,880
It takes time to practice
to be a better actor, Pun.

157
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,990
Your acting was so stiff.

158
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,680
Very stiff.

159
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,960
Let’s have pork blood soup.

160
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,530
What stiff?

161
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,820
It’s my character as a vampire.

162
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,370
You guys don’t know anything.

163
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,660
Bring me one bowl.

164
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,340
Yes, sir.

165
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,740
Has anyone commented about my acting yet?

166
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,860
Has anyone commented
about my acting yet, master Yoh?

167
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,390
I’m impatient.

168
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Anything yet, master Yoh?

169
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,500
Am I a star yet?

170
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,700
Or you can teach me how to login to TikTok.

171
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,040
I will check it myself.

172
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,280
Has anyone commented

173
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,260
Master Yoh?

174
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,610
Hey!

175
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:50,930

What are you guys celebrating?

183
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,670
- Let’s celebrate!
- Let’s celebrate!

184
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,280
How about we close for a day?

185
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
Let’s go eat pork blood
soup at a shopping mall.

186
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,950
At Siam. We’ll take BTS.

187
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,730
Erm…

188
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,370
But our place is better, though.

189
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,340
All Hail Pork Blood Soup restaurant…

190
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,190
is about to rise.

191
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,280
Because we’re the greatest.

192
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,050
It can’t be helped, right?

193
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,360
Super handsome CEO.

194
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,750
Kamsuai. And Redhead.

195
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,380
And my master Yoh.

196
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,260
Let’s celebrate our lovetaurant.

197
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,370
Wait, I mean our restaurant.

198
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,840
You’re too cool.

199
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,780
Of course, I’m the coolest man ever.

200
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,060
Our team is so awesome.

201
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,560
All Hell Pork Blood Soup…
I mean, All Hail Pork Blood Soup…

202
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,270
And I have to like you…

203
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,510
I mean, thank you.

204
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,330
Thank you, everyone…
For sticking with me…

205
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:51,040
And be on the same page
with me, this Pun right here.

206
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,940
And thanks to my handsomeness.

207
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,220
This is so much fun.

208
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,040
Before we end our celebration,

209
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,640
Shall we dance to our pork
blood soup song one more time?

210
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,920

Your pork blood soup is ready.

218
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,040
Thank you.

219
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,580
Where are you guys come from?

220
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,980
Oh, we follow you from the clip about
the vampire who eats pork blood soup.

221
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,000
Can we take pictures with Mr. vampire?

222
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,340
Of course.

223
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,430
You can also take picture with me,
who acted as a pig.

224
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,860
I’m handsome. I’m a good actor.

225
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,280
Pun.

226
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,220
Your fans want to take pictures with you.

227
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,340
You can go ahead.

228
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,110
I don’t like having my picture taken.

229
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,860
Come on.

230
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,320
Just give it a shot, Pun.

231
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,350
I don’t want to.

232
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,320
Will I be able to take a photo?

233
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,670
Turn this way.

234
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,340
What is this?

235
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,400
Come this way.

236
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,110
Mr. Vampire gave it an okay now.

237
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,440
I’m not.

238
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,340
- Can we take pictures with you?
- Can we take pictures with you?

239
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,520
This way, this way.

240
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,260
Feel free to take your
photo with Mr. Vampire.

241
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,760
Master Yoh!

242
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,760
- Come take a photo with Mr. Vampire
- Thank you.

243
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,160
- and then with Mr. Pig.
- Master Yoh, help me.

244
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,340
- Mr. Pig is also good though.
- Geez. Very handsome

245
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,180
You’re a superstar now, Mr. vampire.

246
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,350
See? More people are
starting to love our restaurant.

247
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,140
Because Mr. Pun is our selling point.

248
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,790
With his uniqueness.

249
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,420
Master Yoh, help me.

250
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,000
He’s so cute.

251
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,260
After you got Mr. Vampire’s picture,
you can also take your photo with Mr. Pig.

252
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,340
Congratulation!

253
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,520
- I'll take another photo.
- To our next step forward.

254
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,120
Ooh, cute.

255
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,170
Yoh!

256
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,340
Don’t tell me you just saw a ghost again.

257
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,200
Our view count just reaches 2 million.

258
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,570
What?

259
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,020
2 million?

260
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,060
We got a lot more follower too.

261
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,740
Our ‘All Hail Pork Blood
Soup’ song is now trending.

262
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,020
A lot of people are dancing to it.

263
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,420
Are you serious?

264
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,010
Master Yoh?

265
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,560
You are so fat.

266
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,380
Mr. Pun must feed you very well, huh?

267
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,330
You’re so cute.

268
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,130
Master Tuiye eats everything.

269
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,190
Master Tuiye must be healthy

270
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,920
and live as long as me.

271
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,200
We will be together for a long time and…

272
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,200
Be with master Yoh for a long time too.

273
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,860
Erm… Eat well, master Tuiye.

274
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,890
I’m getting hungry too.

275
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,320
Can you feed me like that as well?

276
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,780
I’m not hungry yet. You guys can eat.

277
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,340
Master Yoh and I,

278
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,360
Just the two of us.

279
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,620
It’s a date.

280
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,300
Huh?

281
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,460
You two can go ahead.

282
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,420
Don’t mind me and Tuiye.

283
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,900
I’ll be right here.

284
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,580
Right in front of my little sister?

285
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,290
What are you waiting for?

286
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,460
Erm…

287
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,500
Okay then.

288
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,800
Why don’t you something
other than pork blood soup?

289
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,110
You might like it.

290
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,200
I will get malnourished, master Yoh.

291
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,320
Eating just one food,

292
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,160
that is how you get malnutrition.

293
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,090
If I don't get to smell pork blood soup,

294
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,930
I might die.

295
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:45,910
That's too much.

296
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,650
You’re exaggerating.

297
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,000
- You’re exaggerating it.
- I’m not exaggerating, master Yoh.

298
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,370
I’m being serious.

299
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,280
Waiter. Take our order, please.

300
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,920
I’ll have this.

301
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,070
But… if I get your smell as a substitute,

302
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,850
I might survive.

303
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,960
I may live on for a long time.

304
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,810
And this one,

305
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,070
that’s all for now.

306
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,550
Can I, master Yoh?

307
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,980
What are you talking?

308
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,780
It’s embarrassing.

309
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,870
What’s so embarrassing about that?

310
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,100
Well, this right there.

311
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,520
That’s not something… we talk about.

312
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,520
Because… it sounded
like I’m flirting with you?

313
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,180
Erm… Well… something like that.

314
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,900
In that case…

315
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,250
Can I smell master Yoh
for the rest of my life?

316
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,390
See? I’m flirting with you again.

317
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,120
Mr. Pun!

318
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,210
What are you talking about?

319
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,060
Here, I’m flirting with you.

320
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,610
What are you talking?
I don’t understand you.

321
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,590
Here, I’m flirting with you.

322
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,880
I’m not asking you to repeat that.

323
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,620
I’m asking, what are you talking about?

324
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,240
Here, I’m flirting with you.

325
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,630
What are you talking about?

326
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,860
Here, I’m flirting with you.

327
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,760
What are you talking about?

328
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,440
Here, I’m flirting with you.

329
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,780
But it smells so nice.

330
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,600
See?

331
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,540
Do you want to give it a taste?

332
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,640
You said it.

333
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,390
Yeah.

334
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,850
What are you doing?

335
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,510
When I said it smell so nice,
I mean your smell, master Yoh.

336
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,160
That’s why I’m going to taste you,

337
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,840
as you said.

338
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,260
Wait a minute.

339
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:56,980
I’m not eating anymore.

340
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,580
Are you a dog?

341
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,720
I’m like master Tuiye.

342
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,240
Just finish your meal. I’m getting hungry.

343
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,080
Just dig in, quick.

344
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,060
I’m getting hungry.

345
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,440
Can you feed me like you
fed master Tuiye earlier?

346
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,700
Can you do that for me?

347
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,410
That’s the way I feed Tuiye earlier.

348
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,490
How am I supposed to
eat like that, master Yoh?

349
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,760
Just eat like a cat.

350
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,640
Do what a cat would do.

351
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,740
You said it.

352
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,540
Yeah, dig in.

353
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,640
Like a cat would do.

354
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,660
Meow! Meow!

355
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,180
Master Tuiye does that do me too.

356
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,960
Master Yoh have to scratch my belly now.

357
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:53,740
Huh?

358
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,220
This is crazy.
Am I scratching his belly right now?

359
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,280
What is happening?

360
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,690
What is that?

361
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,800
Belly scratching.

362
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,730
Huh?

363
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,140
May I have your order, please?

364
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,500
Pun, that’s enough.

365
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,730
Meow!

366
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,400
I’m a cat today.

367
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,620
If he is free, can I
take a picture with him?

368
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,270
Of course.

369
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,440
Mr. Pun.

370
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,080

373
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,540
I’m sleeping.

374
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,820
I should be a cat again tomorrow.

375
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,150
I’m done being a vampire.

376
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,680

Aliens, of course.

443
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,060
Who would pay attention to that vampire?

444
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,140
Who? No one.

445
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,100
I’m just kidding.

446
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,520
You know what my brain only cares about.

447
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,880
How would I know that? I thought you
changed your mind and went after a vampire.

448
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,940
I’m not interested in something like that.

449
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,920
Okay, I will keep doing
my thesis about UFOs.

450
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,630
But Luis, he might
change to something else.

451
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,400
And I haven’t asked Bowie yet.

452
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,130
Um.

453
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,180
And you, tell me when
you decided on your subject.

454
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,680
We still have time to think.

455
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,980
I’m off for now.

456
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,850
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

457
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,340
You’re so hurry to send me off.

458
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,500
Don’t have too much fun.

459
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,970
- I’m jealous.
- Come on, It’s school break.

460
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,300
You went to a meditation retreat too.

461
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,720
Your face is so full of good vibes now.

462
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,610
Bye.

463
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,720
Will you be up on the rooftop today?

464
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,780
Of course.

465
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,260
(Take the elevator up to the 6th floor and
continue. All hell the pork blood soup!)

466
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,860
You want to go to All Hail Pork Blood Soup?

467
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,700
Yes.

468
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,640
Where is Pun, anyway?

469
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,900
Yoh.
You didn’t see him?

470
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,220
He followed me?

471
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,020
Oh, Pun likes to take the stairs.

472
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,760
When he walks down,

473
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,220
I might have taken an elevator up.

474
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,060
Yeah, you’re right,

475
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,540
I think.

476
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,880
He should be back soon.

477
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,900
Here you go, dear customer.

478
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,780
I sent the money.

479
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,820
Thank you so much.

480
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,300
Thank you so much.

481
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,250
Can we really see UFOs in Bangkok, Yoh?

482
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,690
The sky here has too much light pollution.

483
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,800
It would be hard to see.

484
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,420
I never saw anything too.

485
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,400
What’s it gonna be?

486
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,940
Aliens or a vampire?

487
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,000
I’m heading off now.

488
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,800
Okay.

489
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,640
Erm... where is Pun, anyway?

490
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,550
I don’t know either.
Maybe he has gone to bed?

491
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,280
That’s strange.

492
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,010
Where has he gone?

493
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,430
Who would pay attention to
that vampire? Who? No one.

494
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,230
I thought you changed your mind
and went after vampire.

495
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,990
Nope. Not a chance.

496
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,440
- I'm not interested about that.
- Umm.

497
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,190
But actually…
I almost forgot all about UFOs

498
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,120
and aliens,

499
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,040
every time I’m with Pun.

500
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,760
Who is that?

501
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,870
Is that you, Pun?

502
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,420
Don’t tell me, it’s the ghost.

503
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,400
Can I sleep with you tonight?

504
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,730
I’m scared of the ghost in my room.

505
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,330
By the way, early tonight…

506
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,690
No, where have you been this whole evening?

507
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,380
Pun. Are you okay?

508
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,200
Why don’t you talk to me?

509
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,550
What’s up?

510
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,360
Yoh, what are you doing?

511
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,520
Look at what I send
you through LINE.

512
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,480
What is it?

513
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,290
Just look at it. Hurry.
