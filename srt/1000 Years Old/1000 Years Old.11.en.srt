1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,040
Leave people in this apartment alone.

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,880
Why?

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,080
Are you the owner of this place?

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,240
Can you stop doing this?

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,520
I can’t stop.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,280
I am like this for hundreds of years.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,760
I might have become my habit.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,520
What do I have to do…

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,280
To get you out of here?

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,720
I’m not going anywhere.

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,360
You seems a lot angrier lately.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,480
Let me have some fun too, Master Pun.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,760
Please?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,600
I want to see the end of this love tale.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,680
What do you call it?

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,280
PunYoh?

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,440
PunYoh?

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,200
Why not?

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,840
Big brother just…

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,480
Want to attend the wedding ceremony of my beloved little brother, that’s all.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,400
Brother?

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,440
So… Somchai is Pun’s older brother?

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,200
My little brother. How will this story ends?

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,200
Wow!

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,600
I’m just getting hungry.

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,760
Go cook for me…

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Before I...

50
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,240
Drink your blood instead.

51
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,080
Go!

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
That is Mr. Pun’s chair.

53
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,160
How long will it take?

54
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,600
I’m not waiting to eat pork blood anymore.

55
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,640
Then… goodbye, sir.

56
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
See you again.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,760
I’m not say I’m leaving.

58
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,960
I mean I’ll drink other blood instead.

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,520
Why are you getting closer?

60
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,520
Why are you getting closer?

61
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,440
Don’t do it!

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,520
No!

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,840
No!

64
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,320
No!

65
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,400
Just kidding.

66
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,000
I just got some blood yesterday.

67
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,120
But next time, I will come taste your blood.

68
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
You have such good skill.

69
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,880
What a shame.

70
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,080
You’re gonna be close soon.

71
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,160
Our restaurant is famous.

72
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,800
We’re not gonna close, dickhead!

73
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,800
Get back here!

74
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Fight me one on one!

75
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,160
You’re not that scary!

76
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,200
Get back here!

77
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,720
What’s wrong, Shin?

78
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,400
Why are you yelling alone?

79
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,560
You scared me.

80
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,720
Are you hallucinating?

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
You don’t have to cook for Pun anymore.

82
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,640
What? Why not?

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,200
Well, he’s going on a date with Yoh.

84
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,800
A date?

85
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,160
Yeah.

86
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,840
But I feel like...

87
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,240
Pun is acting strange. I don’t know why.

88
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,080
Pun. Are you hungry?

89
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
No need to cook for me.

90
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,400
I’m going out with master Yoh.

91
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,760
Oh, Somchai stopped by earlier.

92
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,320
Huh?

93
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,800
But I took care of him.

94
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,200
I taught him a lesson and he ran away.

95
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,280
Really?

96
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,040
You don’t believe me?

97
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,920
I studied Muay Thai.

98
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,120
Funny.

99
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,640
It’s true.

100
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,280
Let’s brainstorm some idea.

101
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,360
What should we do to get long-term customers?

102
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,320
What?

103
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,400
We don’t have to help master Pun court Yoh anymore?

104
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,680
I don’t think it’s necessary.

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,800
Did he achieve his goal?

106
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,760
I don’t know.

107
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,520
I’m not sure.

108
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,320
They always glue together.

109
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,000
I think he succeeded.

110
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,000
Woah!

111
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
What’s wrong, master Yoh?

112
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,200
No. No.

113
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,360
“Search and found your soulmate.
But the time is just not right.”

114
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,280
How is that a bad thing?

115
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,760
I’m still here.

116
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,720
May you live as long as tortoises…

117
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
And be together for a long time.

118
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,360
Don’t worry.

119
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,320
Me and everyone…
will be with you as long as we can.

120
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,560
Eat more, Mr. tortoise.

121
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
And send your energy back to me.

122
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,160
Make me live long as thousand years.

123
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,400
Thank you, master Yoh.

124
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,840
For wanting to live with me for a long, long time.

125
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,640
You usually don’t go inside a church?

126
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,760
Can you?

127
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,320
What is wrong with vampire and church?

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,600
I don’t mind.

129
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,880
Anything for you.

130
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,080
Anything for me?

131
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,880
So… where are we going next today?

132
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,400
Anything for you.

133
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,560
Hey, today…

134
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,080
You didn’t bring your umbrella.

135
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,400
I’m not sure if he finished it yet.

136
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,200
That bottle of blood.

137
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,200
I’m not hungry anymore.

138
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,920
What did you eat?

139
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,640
Can I have your blood?

140
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,360
I might become strong…

141
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,320
And don’t have to use umbrella anymore.

142
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,480
It’s nothing, Master Yoh.

143
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,560
I’m strong.

144
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,680
I… applied a lot of sunblock.

145
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,040
And the weather is cold lately.

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,640
Cold? How is this cold?

147
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,560
The hottest season in Thailand is in April.

148
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,160
I got stronger.

149
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,520
Let’s go, master Yoh.

150
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Let’s be happy together.

151
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,040

I’m an old-timey vampire.

169
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,600
If we can see them during the day too, that would be great.

170
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Do you know why you like or obsesses about aliens?

171
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,040
Hmm?

172
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,000
Not “Do you know why”.

173
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,400
You have to ask me…

174
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,640
“Why is master Yoh so obsessed about aliens?”
So, I can answer you.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,840
I know, I know.

176
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,960
What is wrong with you, Pun?

177
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,520
I’m so confused.

178
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,920
Maybe you are an alien yourself.

179
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
You came to Earth and live…

180
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,080
And die, and live…

181
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,880
Over and over for many life times.

182
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,960
Erm...

183
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,200
You mean...

184
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,080
I became human in that process?

185
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,320
That might be true.

186
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,240
Pun, the vampire and Yoh, the alien…

187
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,720
Married.

188
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,840
That’s nonsense.

189
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,800
What married are you talking about?

190
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,000
We can, master Yoh.

191
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,560
We can be married.

192
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,360
Me and you.

193
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,480
Wedding ring.

194
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,760
Huh?

195
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,080
Where is it?

196
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,360
Look with your heart…

197
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,000
And you will see it.

198
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
Look with your heart, master Yoh.

199
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,720
Because it’s the ring of love.

200
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,200
I see it now.

201
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,920
That means you love me.

202
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,000
What was that?

203
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,280
Human put engagement ring on their left-hand wedding finger.

204
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,880
Please put this on all the time.

205
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,280
Only us can see it…

206
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,120
And no one else.

207
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,600
Because this is our love.

208
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,560
As long as you and I...

209
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,920
Still love each other.

210
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,000
Where is your ring?

211
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,960
Put it on me too.

212
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,120
Erm… Okay, okay.

213
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,640
Wow!

214
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,960

Is it me who made a first move on Pun?

239
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,600
Not Pun that made a move first.

240
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,200
I’m not that bad.

241
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,160
I left home to follow a man…

242
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,520
And came here.

243
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,320

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,080
Are you gone?
(Chanting)

247
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,760
(Chanting)

248
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,160
This is the last day for PunYoh.

249
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,640
You have to say goodbye now, master Pun.

250
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,160
Do you need some energy?

251
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
Or maybe something fresh…

252
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,040
From someone’s neck.

253
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,800
It can be from master Yoh.

254
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,400
Sweet and aromatic.

255
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,320
Master Yoh is here.

256
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,360
Go ahead, my brother.

257
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,080
I won’t get in your way today.

258
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,120
Ah, but don’t forget.

259
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,560
When your time is over…

260
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,280
My time with master Yoh… will begin.

261
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,400
Pun...

262
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
Are you losing money?

263
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,760
You can cut my paycheck…

264
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,760
In case you’re struggling…

265
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,360
But you didn’t want to tell me.

266
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,480
That’s right.

267
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,920
If you’re losing money…

268
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,160
Then, what are we gonna do?

269
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,560
Pun, you are a vampire.
How come you’re not rich?

270
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,000
You have been living for hundreds of years.

271
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,120
You have to struggle with the sale…

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,400
And living in a cheap apartment.

273
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,160
Let me ask you.

274
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,720
Are you pretending to be poor?

275
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,280
I’m really poor, master Yoh.

276
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,400
This is my first business.

277
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,640
After all...

278
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,200
I had been living my life day-by-day…

279
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,120
Doing nothing.

280
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,720
I lose my money to cat food.

281
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,800
And… everything cat-related.

282
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,200
Then, you can cut my paycheck.

283
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,680
But it’s okay.

284
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,880
Our place still has fans.

285
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,400
We still have regular customers.

286
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,560
Our place is famous.

287
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,120
I don’t understand at all.

288
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,480
Suddenly, all the fans just shown up.

289
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,520
And suddenly, they all went quiet and disappear.

290
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,200
Yeah, that’s true.

291
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,400
I’m still confused. Are we really famous?

292
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,040
All Hail Pork Blood Soup.

293
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,920
I’ll leave it to lady Kamsai to continue.

294
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,840
Huh?

295
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,200
What do you mean by that?

296
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,960
I give this restaurant to lady Kamsai.

297
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,640
Huh?

298
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,560
What are you talking about?

299
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,000
I think lady Kamsai is more suitable than me.

300
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,320
All Hail Pork Blood Soup belongs to all of us.

301
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,720
It is not my dream alone.

302
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,320
You’re talking like you’re not gonna do it anymore.

303
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,320
What’s wrong with you?

304
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Are you okay?

305
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
What happened?

306
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,920
You have changed.

307
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,320
What’s wrong. You can tell me, Pun.

308
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,600
It’s nothing, master Yoh.

309
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,080
It must be something.

310
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,440
It’s really nothing.

311
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,560
How can it be nothing?

312
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,720
If you have something, just say it.

313
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,280
Just in case we can help you.
We’re team, right?

314
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,360
I’m not human like all of you.

315
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,240
You don’t understand me.

316
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,480
My time is over.

317
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,760
Huh?

318
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,760
What do you mean ‘you’re time is over’?
What are you talking about?

319
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,480
I have to go back to be a vampire…

320
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,720
As a vampire should be.

321
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,080
I will stop eating pork blood soup.

322
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,160
Today is the last day...

323
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,400
That I will be here.

324
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,360
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

325
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,680
What happened?

326
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,120
If lady Kamsai doesn’t take over this business…

327
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,760
I’ll have to close it.

328
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,000
Go ahead and close it!

329
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,320
It’s your business after all!

330
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,000
Calm down, Kamsai.

331
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,840
Master Pun.

332
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,440
Are you really gonna close down All hail Pork Blood Soup?

333
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,760
None of your business.

334
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,960
It is my business.

335
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,920
Because I am ‘All Hail Pork Blood Soup’.

336
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,440
I devoted myself, I tried my best.
Everything that I’ve done…

337
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
I did it for our restaurant.

338
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,120
Maybe…

339
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,120
I was into this more than you do, master Pun.

340
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,440
Who told you to do that?

341
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,680
Pun! How can you say that?!

342
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,360
How can you say that?

343
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,840
Why are you behaving like this?

344
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,840
What is wrong with you?!

345
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,640
I will close the All Hail Pork Blood Soup.

346
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,400
Educational Vampire Episode 2
(All Hail Pork Blood Soup, Master Yoh.)

347
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,480
Because the truth is…

348
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,880
I am the CEO of All Hail Pork Blood Soup.

349
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,800
It’s an honor, Mr. CEO!

350
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,880
Kamsai…

351
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,960
I’m so disappointed in you, Pun.

352
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,720
I should have never respect you…

353
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,720
And tried to do everything to please you.

354
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,720
I don’t know what happened to you or what’s wrong with your mind.

355
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,920
But what you did earlier... is fucking awful!

356
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,640
Pun. I thought you are a nice vampire.

357
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,080
I’m so fucking disappointed in you!

358
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,240
You were happy yesterday.

359
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,120
Master Yoh…

360
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,440
Don’t leave me.

361
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,960
My time, my last day with all of you.

362
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,840
Didn’t end well at all.

363
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,080
What is wrong with Pun?

364
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,200
That wasn’t like him at all.

365
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,080
I don’t know what happened.

366
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,440
He is hard to predict lately.

367
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,040
What are we gonna do next?

368
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,360
Has it ended? Our All hail pork blood soup.

369
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,320
I think… let’s wait for everyone to calm down…

370
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,280
Then we will talk, allright?

371
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,920
So, your restaurant is close.

372
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,280
Serves you right.

373
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,880
A place with no customer…

374
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,760
It’s not that strange to go bankrupt.

375
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,560
Pathetic.

376
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,440
We did have customers. What the fuck are you saying?

377
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,880
Fake customers. Did that count?

378
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,560
What fake?

379
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,240
Those guys who came to scream ‘Mr. Pun!’
Scream! Scream!

380
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,560
‘Master Vampire!’ Scream! Scream!

381
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,160
Mr. Shin. Kamsai. Mr. Yoh. Scream!

382
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,360
They were extras.

383
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,440
Extras?

384
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,520
So, you found out.

385
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,080
Those you called extra.

386
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,680
Background performers in films.

387
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,640
What the fuck are you talking about?

388
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,760
You’re so stupid.

389
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,520
Let me enlighten you.

390
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,120
Those who came screaming…

391
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,320
All Hail Pork Blood Soup’s fansclub and all that.

392
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,560
They were all hired by Master vampire Pun.

393
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,920
Hired?

394
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,560
You have fans too, master Yoh. See?

395
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,720
Yeah.

396
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,280
And there are for lady Kamsai and gray hair.

397
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,480
I can’t believe it.

398
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,160
How is this possible?

399
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
You guys don’t know anything.

400
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,200
Yeah.

401
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,880
But don’t tell master Pun that I told you.

402
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,080
I’m afraid master Pun will get mad.

403
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,320
Take it easy, boy.

404
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,600
I… I surrender. I surrender.

405
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,200
Don’t… don’t hurt me.

406
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,880
If you all join force…

407
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,280
I’m so scared.

408
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,280
That was fun.

409
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,760
See you again.

410
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,760
Are you okay, Shin?

411
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,200
(407)

412
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,720
(Saifon Apartment)

413
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,360
There. He really is here.

414
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,640
You didn’t pick up my phone.

415
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,920
You didn’t answer my texts.

416
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,400
Oh, Jam? What are you doing here?

417
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,040
I’m the one who called your sister.

418
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,800
You have been gone all day.

419
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,360
Is there something wrong, Yoh?

420
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,360
You didn’t update me with any news.

421
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,280
Erm...

422
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,000
I mean...

423
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,680
Pun is…

424
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,840
Pun is… what?

425
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,520
Pun wants to...
Close All Hail Pork Blood Soup.

426
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,320
Huh?

427
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,600
He has changed.

428
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,840
How did he change?

429
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,440
I don’t know but he changed.

430
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,040
Maybe because...

431
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,120
Was it Janja?

432
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,560
Don’t tell me…

433
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,040
That Pun and Janja...

434
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,200
And you’re jealous.

435
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,400
Yeah. I’m kidding.

436
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,200
And what are you gonna do?

437
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,520
Well… I may do nothing.

438
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,120
Are you gonna stay put like this?

439
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,280
Maybe.

440
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,240
That’s not like you at all.

441
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,240
When you’re interested in something, you always put your all into it.

442
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,000
What do you want me to do?

443
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,400
You do what you want.

444
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,320
Right now…

445
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,600
I want to lay down and look at the stars.

446
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,120
Are you really quiting?

447
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,960
What a shame.

448
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,960
Hey. You.

449
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,080
Thank you, master Yoh….

450
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,120
For every gifts that you gave me.

451
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,440
I will cherish it as long as I can.

452
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,240
I wish you happy and have pork blood soup to eat for the rest of your life.

453
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,960
What’s wrong?

454
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,520
A gift for your grand opening.

455
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,880
Everything will be the same.

456
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,320
Only me...

457
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,120
That can’t be here anymore.

458
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,200
I got plenty of times…

459
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,760
But our times together...

460
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,160
Was so short, master Yoh.

461
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,160
No one is here.

462
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,040
The cat is gone too.

463
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
I will keep my room like this…

464
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,480
In case you miss me.

465
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,280
Everything that I own belongs to you now.

466
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,120
Including my heart.

467
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,720
(407)

468
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,800
Farewell.

469
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,040
