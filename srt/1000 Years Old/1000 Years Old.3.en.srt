00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,720
Here. Take it.

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,260

79
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,730

81

Take it.

82
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,050

87
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,080

A bunch of garlic?

89
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,850
So, you are not a real vampire, right, Pun?

90
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,050
What a load of nonsense.

91
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,070

Yes,

98

I intended to keep this place just for myself.

99

100
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,600

102
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,570

Who would come up this height to eat?

103

I’m glad that you like it, Pun.

105
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,820
I took a lot of time to choose it.

106
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,660
I picked the best looking one.

107
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,330
These are… beautiful garlics.

108
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,370
Yeah, it’s beautiful.
It goes well with the place.

109
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,040

110
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,850
Then I like all of it.

111
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,880
It goes well.

00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,270
Come on, pork blood soup here are very good.

175
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:41,930
Really?

176
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,780
I can tell you that this place is another good spot.

177
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,250
Very nice view.

178
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,450
But most importantly…

179
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,090
It’s a very great place to look up at the sky.

180
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,010
Why would you look up at the sky?

181
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,010
Because if we look down, we would see only the dirt.

182
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,170
What kind of question is that?

183
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,270
Cool.

184
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,840
This pork blood soup…

185
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,590
can’t compete with the one lady Kamsai made at all.

186
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,450
You know how to make pork blood soup?

187
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,020
Yes. But it’s still not that great.
I’m training.

188
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,530
Not only she knows how to make it,
She actually opening a restaurant.

189
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,240
Cool.
You’re this small but you got so much skills.

190
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,010
I’m just an employee.

191
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,770
He is the owner, the CEO.

192
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,580
But he’s a little bit strange.

193
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,480
That’s not just a little bit.
He is very strange.

194
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,530
He won’t eat anything else in his whole life,
except pork blood soup.

195
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,490
Um...

196
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,500
That’s true.
I’m still wondering that he must be…

197
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,230
some kind of alien.

198
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,400
Oh, that’s not an alien.

199
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,620
I think he must be a vampire.

200
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,140
He only eats blood.

201
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,630
Where is your restaurant?
I might stop by when I’m back in Bangkok.

202
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,310
Oh, it’s up there on a rooftop.

203
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,110
- On a rooftop?
- Yeah.

204
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,880
Ah! On a rooftop?

205
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,690
Ah! Cool.

206
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,580
Uh...

207
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,800
There. There. There it is again.

208
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,640
There it is again.

209
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,380
Was that just an airplane?

210
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,120
That’s not an airplane.

211
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,680
If it’s an airplane, it would have blinking red lights.

212
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,780
Like that.

213
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,100
That one was like a star that can move.

214
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,110
Uh...

215
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,190
I saw one even more up close.

216
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,540
Vimana.

217
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,260
Huh?

218
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,030
Hey…

219
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,590
Vimana? That’s the real deal.

220
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,260
I saw them many hundreds of years ago.

221
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,710
The One who came from the sky.

222
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,330
You saw them with your own eyes,

223
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,900
He’s gone. Your friend is gone.
He’s crazy.

224
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,850
You said you saw them with your own eyes, hundreds of years ago?

225
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,900
Yes.

226
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,840
How old are you?

227
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,090
About 900 years old.

228
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,730
900 years old?

229
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,570
- Cool.
- Cool.

230
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,450
That’s another reason I’m not afraid to tell everyone I’m a vampire.

231
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,370
Because even if I tell them I’m a vampire,…

232
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,240
no one would believe me.

233
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,750
There! There! Here it come. Here it come!

234
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,480
Did you see it?

235
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,340
Did you see it?

236
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,990
There!

237
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,480
But Master Yoh, when will you believe me?

238
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,770
Isn’t that just a satellite?

239
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,200
It’s not a satellite.

240
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,090
If it’s a satellite, we can check it through an App.

241
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,490
That one is not it.

242
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,590
Look. Look how it fly.
Does it look like a satellite to you?

243
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,360
See?

244
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,410
What kind of satellite move like that?

245
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,700
Erm… What is this Vimana you’re talking about?

246
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,220
You’re asking too many questions.

247
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,820
Pun cuts his hair just like I told him to.

248
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,500
Great.
Now I can see his face clearer.

249
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,810
He looks more like a normal guy now.

250
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,250
I’m not late, right?

251
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,740
It’s so… delicious.

252
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,960
Good job, Kamsai.

253
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,510
It’s so much better than before.

254
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,250
With this taste, Pun should love it.

255
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,570
He loves it.

256
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,090
Our favorite pork blood soup cart…

257
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,140
Has return.

258
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,360
Come on, pork blood soup here are very good.

259
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,130
Really?

260
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,420
It’s real, Master Yoh.

261
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,040
I saw it many century ago.

262
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,650
There was a Vimana flying across the sky.

263
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,860
It was really beautiful, Master Yoh.

264
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,820
Even I, a vampire, still want to get up there.

265
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,320
But master Yoh must not tell anyone that I am a vampire.

266
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,470
You’re the one who always snitched on yourself.

267
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,310
How about I let you interview me?

268
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,320
Do I have to change anything?

269
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,910
It’s good. You’re very good.

270
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,710
Please guide me.

271
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,920
Sure.

272
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,790
Mr. Pun Khongyuuyao

273
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,200
Pun Khongyuuyao

274
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,560
(Pun Kongyuuyaaw)

275
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,690
(yo.f.o)

276
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,450
(punkongyuuyaaw)

277
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,890
So much mystery.

278
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,790
What a guy.
How come his name doesn’t show up anywhere?

279
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,890
Usually, there must be where he studied or something like that.

280
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,880
Pun the vampire

281
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,410
Vampire named Pun

282
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,850
How could that be real?

283
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,540
Actually, why or what is it

284
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,190
that drawn me to Mr. Pun’s weirdness that much,

285
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,550
so much so that I brought myself to this place?

286
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,880
Yesterday, I found someone interesting.

287
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:44,310
He’s interesting, in a weird way.

288
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,010
Interesting, like we can study his behavior.

289
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,700
Huh?

290
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,270
What do you mean?

291
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,150
Is that really the reason?

292
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,680
To study his behavior?

293
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,910
Why am I so attracted to him?

294
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,600
Actually, you remember me too, right?

295
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,180
Huh?

296
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,580
Come to think of it…

297
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,230
Master Yoh, you’re zoning out.

298
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,380
Oh, I forgot to feed master Tuiye.

299
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,530
I’ll have to go now. Goodnight.

300
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,300
Huh?

301
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,020
And just like that, he is gone.

302
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,100
Where did he go?

303
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,020
Then, I got older.

304
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,080
Huh?

305
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,060
Or is he…

306
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,190
The same guy?

307
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,130
Why do I suddenly feel familiar with him?

308
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,640
Erm… Would you like to…

309
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,070
Go for some dessert tomorrow?

310
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,390
Tomorrow?

311
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,290
Yeah. Tomorrow…

312
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,590
Tomorrow?

313
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,880
Can you come?

314
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,240
You want to return the favor?

315
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,600
Erm...

316
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,790
So, you do remember me.

317
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,370
Pun was…

318
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,170
the same guy who bought me ice-cream…

319
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,180
back when I was a kid?

320
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,520
Is that true?

321
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,830
How can that be?
How is that possible?

322
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,900
Well…, Erm…

323
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,960
How should I say this?

324
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah, how do I go from here?

325
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,220
Erm…

326
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,390
So…

327
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,910
It has been many years, how come you don’t age at all?

328
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,090
How can I get older?

329
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,630
I’m a vampire, master Yoh.

330
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,300
How can you say that with a straight face?

331
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,860
What kind of crazy vampire

332
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,430
would tell everyone he’s a vampire like it’s not a big deal?

333
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,180
When will you going to believe me?

334
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,230
It’s…

335
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,070
Its’ sound too crazy.

336
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,920
You believe in aliens, right?

337
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,200
Then, what is so strange about vampire?

338
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,260
It’s strange...

339
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,450
Because you… I mean, Pun…

340
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,410
You don’t seem to… afraid of…

341
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,730
This?

342
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,510
Yes, yes!
Vampire should scare of cross, right?

343
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,680
Right!

344
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:08,910
Because... I’m a weak vampire.

345
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,570
I’m a vampire with recessive gene.

346
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,850
And I live in a Buddhist country.

347
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,640
Huh?

348
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,010
But I respect all religions.

349
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,030
I’m not afraid of any religion in particular.

350
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,980
Every religion teaches you to be a good person.

351
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,490
That’s why I’m a good vampire.

352
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,410
Wait a minute. So much digression.

353
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,850
Your story went out to the sea.

354
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,730
If I’ll go to the sea, I’ll have to apply sunscreen.

355
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,080
I don’t like the heat there.

356
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,920
It burns my skin.

357
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,070
Stop! When I said when out to the sea,

358
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,370
You mean Siam Park, Bangkok’s water park?

359
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,680
The artificial sea amusement park, right?

360
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,370
Yeah, just forget the damn sea.

361
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,020
Let me get this straight.
You don’t fear crosses

362
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:12,680
and you don’t fear garlic.

363
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,100
Garlic?
Like my restaurant opening gift, right?

364
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,480
Yeah.

365
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,950
I like it.

366
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,490
Because you gave it to me.

367
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,080
What are you doing?

368
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,790
Where are they? Where are your fangs?

369
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,400
Where is your blood sucking tools?

370
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,320
Well, I...

371
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,450
You what?

372
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,090
How can I say this?

373
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,990
I mean…

374
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,080
I had the dentist took them off.

375
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:54,920
Erm…

376
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,740
I used to wear braces as accessory too.

377
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,320
It was very popular in the 90s.

378
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Everything he said is so unbelievable.

379
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,790
I’m a real vampire.

380
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:21,550
Do you want me to prove it to you more?

381
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,300
How can you prove it?

382
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,920
Hey, hey! Stop! Don’t do it!

383
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,200
Stop! Don’t do it! Don’t!

384
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,070
What was that?

385
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,680
What have you done?

386
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,970
Did he survive?

387
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,020
I don’t want to fall.

388
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,830
Even though, my body can heal itself very fast,

389
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,850
but I still feel pain.

390
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,920
And right now, I just want to live a longer and healthier life.

391
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:15,980
Dammit!

392
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,790
I shouldn’t be worry for a guy like him.

393
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,580
Why are you smiling?

394
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,840
A human like you should never try this.

395
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,270
It’s dangerous.

396
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,590
Thank you for your kindness.
But no thanks.

397
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,240
I’m very hungry.

398
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,480
Can you cook faster, lady Kamsai?

399
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,680
I’m sorry that I’m late.

400
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,600
I got cleaning duty at school today.

401
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,070
Why are you standing over there?

402
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,840
That’s the most frustrating thing in the world.

403
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,740
It’s okay. I can do it by myself.

404
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,370
Then, I should go back to work.

405
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:45,030
Thank you for the best pork blood soup in the world.

406
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,540
But… I’m still the VVVIP customer, right?

407
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,970
Are you leaving already?

408
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,290
Erm, yeah.

409
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,820
Wave goodbye.
See you again tomorrow.

410
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:14,260
(Mr. V’s pork blood soup, the original)

411
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,380
Why don’t we try to open it for business?

412
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,030
But only us eating here is good enough already.

413
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,450
Lady Kamsai doesn’t have to cook for too many people as well.

414
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,680
Apart from us,

415
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,110
I don’t think anyone would be interested
in pork blood soup that much.

416
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,170
Even the previous owner had abandoned it.

417
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,820
But I agree with Kamsai.

418
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,810
I want to talk to you about that too.

419
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,820
About the restaurant.

420
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,860
I think it’s a little selfish to keep this place to yourself.

421
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,560
Am I being selfish?

422
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,280
Yes. You’re being selfish.

423
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,890
You’re being selfish for…

424
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,710
For keeping this place all to yourself

425
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,770
despite in the past,
anyone and come and sit in a place like this.

426
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:33,620
Your being selfish for hiding Kamsai’s skill,…
not showing it to anyone.

427
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,120
You keeping this amazing fragrant,

428
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,830
this heavenly taste all to yourself.

429
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,160
You’re not sharing.

430
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,470
That’s called being selfish.

431
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:04,260
But I always allow master Yoh and Kamsai to eat here too.

432
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,060
Let everyone else know this new pork blood soup too.

433
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,900
But I don’t care about anyone else.

434
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,490
I only care about us, right ‘ere.

435
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,190
Right here, right now.

436
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,480
Really?

437
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,940
If that’s the truth then,…

438
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,230
why you don’t know that opening a pork blood soup place
was always Kamsai’ dream?

439
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,110
And I love this pork blood soup place too.

440
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,010
Pork blood soup. Extra blood.

441
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,100
- one more
- Like usual?

442
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,690
- Yeah.
- Have a seat.

443
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,320
Even if I open it, no one is going to come up here to eat.

444
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,200
I will be your patron.

445
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,330
Me too, me too.

446
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,770
I will come up here. I will come here every day.

447
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,080
How did you get up here?

448
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,870
The smell goes into my room
so, she told me to help her get up here.

449
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,130
So, you relocated the cart here?

450
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,370
Is it still open? I’m so hungry.

451
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,930
You still have some left.
Can I have a bowl of that?

452
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,500
Me too.

453
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,330
- Me too.
- Me too.

454
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,640
Let form the pork blood soup pack together.

455
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,560
I’ve never been a CEO of a pork blood soup place either,

456
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,000
yet here I am.

457
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,560
Who else want the soup?
Can you write it down for me?

458
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,410
- write in here.
- write to one.

459
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,380
That’s more like it.

460
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,090
You’re starting to look like the CEO
of pork blood soup place.

461
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,420
I say chaos is coming my way.

462
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,570
More like happiness. Just wait and see.

463
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,820
Maybe you’re right.

464
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,390
It’s good to have a lot of people too
so you won’t get lonely.

465
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,800
You can celebrate here on your next birthday.

466
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,360
Kamsai…

467
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,980
Bring be one more bowl.

468
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,650
I’m not full yet.

469
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,090
Do you have enough for everyone?

470
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,610
Okay, have a seat, Yoh.

471
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,910
It’s okay. I will help you.

472
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,700
Special for me, as usual.

473
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,750
Hey, you ate a lot already.

474
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,210
You still not full?

475
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,400
You still not full?

476
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,100
You have to cook for me first.

477
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,930
Everyone else can wait.

478
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,930
Stop it, Pun.

479
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,690
Your order will arrive after.

480
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,290
Special.

481
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,770
My goal right now...

482
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,850
Is to spend the rest of my life with my friends…

483
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,700
and make them happy as much as I can.

484
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,930
Master Yoh,

485
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,090
I trust you.

486
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,170
and I will do as you suggest
about the pork blood soup place.

487
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,010
I will name our restaurant…

488
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,640
‘All hail pork blood soup.’

489
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,470
- All hail pork blood soup.
- All hail pork blood soup.

490
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,080
Our favorite pork blood soup place.

491
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,020
Let’s move forward together.

492
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,400
- All hail pork blood soup.
