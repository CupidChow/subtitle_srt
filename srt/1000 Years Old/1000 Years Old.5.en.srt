Should I start recording?

184
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,800
♪Deew Deew Deew Deew♪

185
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,920
Come visit us.

186
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,000
We make fresh every day.

187
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,760
High quality pork liver and blood.

188
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,240
Very nice pork, finely minced.

189
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,280
We’re on the rooftop.

190
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,360
Very easy to access.

191
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,160
It’s not that high up. We also have an elevator.

192
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,840
People in traffic jam, are you hungry?

193
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,560
If you’re hungry, come to our place on the rooftop.

194
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,200
All Hail Pork Blood Soup is now open.

195
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,320
Aunty.

196
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,920
No, no. I’m not good at that.

197
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,640
I saw you snooping around.

198
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,240
Do you want to help us?

199
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
I’m fine. I don’t want to help.

200
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,400
I just want to be nosy.

201
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,360
Oh…

202
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,480
Oh, Pun?

203
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,080
Where are you going?

204
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,440
I ran out of food for Master Tuiye.

205
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,360
I got complained now.

206
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,160
I have to go buy a new batch.

207
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,040
Would you like to come with me?

208
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,400
You asking me?

209
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,920
Yes,

210
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,120
I’m asking you with my sincere heart.

211
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Erm… I was about to… teach aunty our dance.

212
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,640
Just go with him.

213
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,640
Go, go.

214
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,720
I was talking to aunty…

215
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,440
Just go. He already asked you out.

216
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,080
Go.

217
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,080
- Goodbye then.
- Okay.

218
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,720
How do we get there?

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,800
Where do we go?

220
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,520
Shopping mall,

221
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,920
Downtown.

222
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,840
We walk.

223
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,880
Huh?

224
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,600
Walk?

225
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,120
Yes,

226
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,080
I walk around everywhere,

227
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,200
every time.

228
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,040
But it’s very far away.

229
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,640
I got an umbrella.

230
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,960
I applied sunblock.

231
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,760
and I’m fully dressed.

232
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,960
Good to go.

233
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,360
But there is a better way than walking.

234
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,640
Running?

235
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,560
I’m not going with you anymore.

236
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Wait, master…

237
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,680
In that case, how would you travel?

238
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
What do you suggest?

239
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,880
It’s up to you, master Yoh.

240
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,720
Please enlighten me.

241
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,800
I’m ready! Let’s go!

242
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,200
All Hail Pork Blood Soup is now open.

243
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,400
All Hail Pork Blood Soup is now open.

244
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,800
We’re on the rooftop, everyone.
Feel free to visit us

245
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,800
at All Hail Pork Blood Soup.
We’re on the rooftop.

246
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,560
How about BTS?

247
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,960
Convenient, easy,

248
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,360
fast and comfortable.

249
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,840
Wow!

250
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,840
Really?

251
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,680
(Warning :
Do not open umbrellas in the electric train system.)

252
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,800
Don’t be scared.

253
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,960
(Warning :
Do not open umbrellas in the electric train system.)

254
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,760
Here.

255
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,680
For me?

256
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,000
Um.

257
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,800
A gift?

258
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,320
You have to tap it there to get inside.

259
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,160
Wait for me.

260
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,280
Thank you for this thing.

261
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,720
I think I like it.

262
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,200
It’s sturdy.

263
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,520
Nice temperature in here.

264
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,600
Nice and cool just like you said, master Yoh.

265
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,840
Yeah.

266
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,560
I like the coolness in here.

267
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,920
And where can this thing teleport us to?

268
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,000
Siam, I guess?

269
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,920
It can travel back in time to Siamese kingdom era?

270
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,120
I’m just kidding.

271
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,440
Did you enjoy the pun?

272
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,000
Just like how I held on to you back then.

273
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,840
You have to hold on to the railing
not the person in front of you.

274
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,200
Or we both are gonna fall.

275
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,040
If you fall down, I’ll fall with you.

276
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,520
I won’t leave you behind.

277
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,280
Um.

278
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,840
That was kinda romantic, master Yoh.

279
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:56,880
Huh?

280
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,240
To stand beside you in a transport like that.

281
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,840
We should go on a date again sometime.

282
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,600
A date?

283
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,200
What are you talking about?

284
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,880
I’m just speaking my mind, master Yoh.

285
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,400
Master Yoh?

286
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,560
Ouch! Hot! Hot!

287
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,880
Wait for me, master Yoh.

288
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,120
One fresh pork blood soup, please.

289
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
Sure things.

290
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,160
Please have a seat, sir.

291
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,720
Please have a seat.

292
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,400
Water is over there. Self-service.

293
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,360
But if you want to sit on my lap…

294
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,320
Or not, that’s fine too.

295
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,600
I would love to be a regular here.

296
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,560
Don’t.

297
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,640
I don’t see other people here.

298
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,960
You don’t have other customer, except me.

299
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,720
Just eat up and go away.

300
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,840
Why are your restaurant shooing customer away though?

301
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,800
Pun!

302
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,200
Sorry about him.

303
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,480
I’m sorry.

304
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,280
He’s always has bad manner.

305
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,680
When did I have bad manner?

306
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,720
You’re doing it right now.

307
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,680
You pay my bill.

308
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,960
That will be 140.

309
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,880
I said he will pay for me.

310
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,120
Do you accept cash?

311
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,080
You can pay in cash or scan. It’s up to you.

312
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,040
Get out.

313
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,880
Good evening, master Yoh.

314
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,400
Good evening.

315
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,320
Gyoza, don’t.

316
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,280
Don’t hold me back, Gyoza.

317
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,600
Good!

318
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,240
That was fun!

319
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,640
See you later.

320
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
I will come back.

321
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,800
I’m starting to like this place.

322
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,080
What a douchebag.

323
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,520
Are you okay?

324
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,080
Are you alright, Pun?

325
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,120
Can someone come with me?

326
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,280
Alright!

327
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,360
Kamsai, can you go with Gyoza?

328
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,440
Call me if you need anything.

329
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,360
Just ignore him.

330
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,960
By the way, who is this Somchai guy?

331
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Forget about him.

332
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,640
You don’t need to know him.

333
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,040
You don’t seem to like him very much.

334
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,840
I don’t like him.

335
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,760
And why does he want trouble with you anyway?

336
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,720
But don’t worry.
I will keep you safe, Pun.

337
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,960
You want to protect me?

338
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,920
Yes, that’s right, I think?

339
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,000
I’m the one who should be protecting you.

340
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,120

00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:03,280
♪As I look at you, your smell still lingers in my heart.♪

367
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,680
You smell so good.
♪You’re so sensitive in every aspect.♪

368
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,120
Can I smell you?
♪in my heart.♪

369
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,720
Damn! That was unexpected.

370
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,880
You’re getting too close.

371
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
What happen to your neck, Yoh?

372
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,880
Erm… It’s nothing.

373
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,080
I notice it since you came back.

374
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
It’s nothing, really.

375
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,120
True.

376
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,640
So… what about the pork blood soup song?
How is it doing now?

377
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,120
Erm… I haven’t check it yet.

378
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,280
Hey!

379
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,600
What is it, Yoh?

380
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,680
Still nothing.

381
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,440
Nobody dances to it at all.

382
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,040
Come on, Yoh.
Why did you have to scare me like that?

383
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,360
Well, I want to have that reaction
when someone dance to our song though.

384
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,200
But I already asked my friends to help.

385
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,080
Maybe we should find a new way...

386
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,200
How about…

387
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,080
We write another song?

388
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,400
- Come on, Pun. It won’t make any difference.
- Come on. It won’t make any difference.

389
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,720
Really?

390
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,440
Yes. The same.

391
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280
We need to come up with something new.

392
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:40,200
What if…
we sell the weirdness of our pork blood soup brand?

393
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,480
Weirdness?

394
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,360
How weirdness?

395
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,400
Are you calling me weird again?

396
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,240
Hmm…

397
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,720
What is wrong with you, master Yoh?

398
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,280
I’m just a normal human.

399
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,160
If I’m not normal,

400
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,080
what am I?

401
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,480
- A vampire.
- A vampire.

402
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,880
Is that a good idea, master Yoh?

403
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,440
I don’t want to bring attention to what I am…

404
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,280
It’s okay.
Our selling point isn’t about weirdness.

405
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,560
It’s about uniqueness.

406
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,400
Am I that special to master Yoh?

407
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,400
Right?

408
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,320
Am I that special?

409
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,840
Yeah.

410
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,160
VVVVV

411
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,040
VVVVVV

412
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,720
You’re VVV… VIP.

413
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,320
That’s so good.

414
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Now I can die in peace.

415
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,440
But… No, I can’t.

416
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,720
I want to live with master Yoh for much…

417
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,080
much longer.

418
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,880
You smell so good.

419
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,440
Can I…

420
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,280
Hey!

421
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,680
Stop, stop.

422
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,520
What smells so good?

423
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,400
I don’t know.

424
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:10,960
Ready?

425
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,760
Action.

426
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,920
Erm…

427
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,000
I mean…

428
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,440
I think I want blood…

429
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,560
Your blood.

430
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,720
Can I?

431
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,360
Please? Please?

432
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,720
Cut!

433
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,320
Pun, I mean…

434
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,520
Can you be more aggressive?

435
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,720
Right now, you sounded like a kid-friendly vampire.

436
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,840
Be more aggressive.

437
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,400
Let’s practice it.

438
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,680
You want me to say it?

439
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,160
Yeah, try it.

440
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,080
try it.

441
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,040
I…

442
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,240
I want your blood.

443
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,160
More aggressive.

444
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,040
I want your blood.

445
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,400
More aggressive.

446
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,960
I want your blood.

447
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,400
Very aggressive!

448
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,480
I want your blood.

449
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,960
I want your blood.

450
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,840
Yeah, just like that.

451
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,640
That will do.

452
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,680
Let’s go. One more time.

453
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,520
Takes 20.

454
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,440
Ready?

455
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,440
Action.

456
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,000
I want…

457
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,080
I want…

458
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,240
what’s the line again?

459
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,200
I want blood.

460
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,680
Your blood.

461
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,120
Pork blood.

462
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,680
Cut!

463
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,560
When will I get the screen time?

464
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,520
Come on, Pun.

465
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,040
Why can’t you remember your line?

466
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,640
But it’s hard.

467
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,640
I’m not an actor.

468
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,960
It’s okay.

469
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,360
We can try again.

470
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,080
Are you okay, Shin, Kamsai?

471
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,680
We’re fine. Piece of cake.

472
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,880
Pun.

473
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,280
You should have one-on-one acting lesson
with Yoh some time.

474
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,560
This will not do at all.

475
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,000
Okay.

476
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,320
Let’s try again one more time.

477
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,280
Ready?

478
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,960
Yes, master Yoh.

479
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,560
Takes 21.

480
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,480
Hurry up, Pun!

481
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,960
It’s 21 takes already.

482
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,880
Are you ready?

483
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,960
Action!

484
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,560
Erm…

485
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,280
I want…

486
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,120
I want your blood.

487
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,080
Please? Please?

488
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,320
I’m full now.

489
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,800
You haven’t even bite him yet.
How can you be full?

490
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,520
Pun, wait a minute.

491
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,960
Cut!

492
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,880
Are they filming educational video up there?

493
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,080
I think so.

494
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,760
Pan Prue (You think?)

495
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,560
That's it..

496
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,800
-Is that what it is?
-Yeah.

497
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,040
Action!

498
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,560
Where are you going?

499
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,240
We need another take. Pun, come back!

500
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,920
I’m exhausting.

501
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,320
Cut!

502
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,160
Am I good enough to be an actor?

503
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,800
Being just a vampire is good enough for you.

504
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,640
You can teach me, master Yoh

505
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,680
Master Tuiye, will you do a rehearsal with me?

506
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,840
You haven’t slept yet, Master Yoh.

507
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,560
You should rest.

508
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,600
Master Yoh?

509
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,480
Master Yoh?

510

511
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,200
