31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,280
So' you're interested in vampire now.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,040
I mean this trouble might
hit very close to home.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,560
How close? Can you tell me?

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,000
- Well…
- Oh' I get it now.

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,240
You mean that vampire friend of yours.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,320
So' that's why it's close to home.

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,040
Where is he' anyway?

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,920
You haven't brought him home since then.

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm waiting to eat pork blood soup.

40
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,080
Well' it's not necessary to bring him home.

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
- Huh?
- If you want to eat it'

42
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,920
I'll bring some next time.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,920
What?

44
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,200
He's your friend.

45
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,160
Why can't he come here?

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,200
Friends visit friends houses' it's normal.

47
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,160
Unless he's not your friend.

48
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,040
Huh?

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,600
What are you talking about' dad?

50
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Just go out with the
vampire and get it over with.

51
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,920
What?

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
You ran out of water? Come here.

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
- Yeah.
- Come here.

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
Oh' my son.

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,680
You love alien since you were kid.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,960
Now' you're losing to a Thai vampire?

57
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,080
Come on' dad.

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,280
Hey!

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,320
Where is the garlic that I plant?

60
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
How would I know?

61
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,160
Did you steal it?

62
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Damn. In the end' I have to go
to the market and buy pork blood?

63
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Master Yoh's dad made a promise last time.

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,040
It wasn't a pinky promise

65
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,920
but a promise nonetheless.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,760
You shouldn't have said that' dad.

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,920
Oh!

68
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,800
Can I borrow your umbrella?

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,120
Wow.

70
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you.

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,240
I have to go buy pork blood?

72
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Woah! It smells so good.

73
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
It's delicious too.

74
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,600
Kamsai of the All Hail Pork Blood Soup
is the best cook around here.

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
I have to give it a taste then.

76
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Hmm?

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,080
Um.

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,640
Whoa.

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,320
It's really delicious.

80
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,080
You must be selling very well.

81
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,080
Is that why you never
had any left for me to taste?

82
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,320
Actually' we aren't selling that well.

83
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,920
Only for a few days that his fans shown up.

84
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,760

87
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,280

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,320

It's not normal.

180
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,760
All this time' he always
wants to see you.

181
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,960
And he wants to start a fight.

182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,400
There has to be something.

183
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,560
Are there any more
vampires like you out there?

184
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,200
If vampires do exist'

185
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,080
are there vampires that drink human blood?

186
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,160
Somchai is a vampire' isn't he?

187
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Then you must know
how dangerous Somchai is.

188
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,360
That's why you don't want
Somchai to get close to me.

189
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I…

190
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,120
I don't want anyone to
get close to master Yoh.

191
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,640
Lately' a lot of people
got attacked by vampires.

192
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,520
How did you know that?

193
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,000
There has been Hashtag about Thai vampire.

194
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,680
Thai vampire?

195
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,920
Hashtag?

196
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,840
Yes.

197
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,720
Then it must be me.

198
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm the Thai vampire.

199
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,240
I mean the vampire that
really suck people's blood.

200
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,120
They eat people's blood

201
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,440
and kill people!

202
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,760
Can a vampire kill people?

203
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,680
Of course.

204
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,400
I don't even dare to hit master mosquito.

205
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,280
And that mean you're not the culprit?

206
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,560
What are you trying to say' master Yoh?

207
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,320
If Somchai is a vampire?

208
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,920
And if Somchai…

209
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,120
If Somchai does drink human blood…

210
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,600
Everything happened around here.

211
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,320
And Somchai has been here not too long ago.

212
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,520
Is that what you think' master Yoh.

213
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,160
If it wasn't you then' who
else could be that thing...

214
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,760
That thing?

215
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,120
What about it' master Yoh?

216
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,160
No' no. I didn't mean to offense you.

217
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,960
No matter what you are'
we're still on the same team.

218
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,760
I was just so worry about the news.

219
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
It's okay' master Yoh.

220
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,640
But… what are you going to do about it?

221
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,280
Pun… Can you help me?

222
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,400
What do you need help with?

223
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,680
Are you asking me out to see aliens again?

224
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,680
No.

225
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,520
Right now' I'm not interested
in that topic as much as vampire.

226
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,680
Yeah. That's that.

227
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,120
Master Yoh are you more
interested in vampires now?

228
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,200
Wow! I'm so glad.

229
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,280
Master Yoh likes vampires.

230
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,240
Master Yoh loves me.

231
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,640
- And I love…
- Enough…

232
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,600
I'm being serious right now.

233
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,600
And I'm serious with you.

234
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,480
Alright. Speak' master Yoh.

235
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,040
What do you need me to do?

236
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm willing to do anything for love.

237
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,800
Alright' I'll get serious now.

238
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,200
Serious with you' master Yoh.

239
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,600
So serious that I'm gonna marry you.

240
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,920
Alright' I'll stop.

241
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,840
Stop at you and only you' master Yoh.

242
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,160
Go on' what can I help you with?

243
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,600
Help falling in love with you even further?

244
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,800
Please… shut up!

245
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,480
A vampire in love is right in front of you.

246
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,240
You seem very serious about this.

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,360
(What are vampires afraid of?)

248
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,240
Should you get some rest?

249
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,080
I'll help you gather information.

250
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,760
You can go to bed first' Pun.

251
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,120
I'll do the research tonight

252
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,800
and we can help each other tomorrow.

253
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,720
But I'm not sleepy yet' master Yoh.

254
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,000
Just go to bed' Pun.

255
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,120
Goodnight.

256
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,240
I see that humans have these…

257
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,760
To wake you up and feel refreshed.

258
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,400
Where did you get this?

259
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,200
I went out to buy it.

260
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,960
Huh?

261
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,680
Thank you.

262
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,480
I will drink with you.

263
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Wait' wait.

264
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,440
Can vampire drink that?

265
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,240
Of course.

266
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,320
If master Yoh can drink it' I can drink it.

267
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,400
I'll try something new as you suggested.

268
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,560
It's so refreshing.

269
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,840
I'm feeling refreshed' master Yoh.

270
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,280
I'm ready to stay up with you till morning.

271
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,880
Keep fighting' master Yoh.

272
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,440
Woah!

273
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,560
Are you planning to kill me?

274
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,640
No' I mean…
(How to protect against vampires)

275
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,720
I want to make sure what
can we do to protect ourselves.

276
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,120
So' I can warn the other' warn everyone.

277
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,120
Master Yoh has a good heart.

278
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,080
You're very serious
about what you're doing.

279
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,880
Yeah'

280
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,840
what is that' anyway?

281
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,040
Holy water.

282
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,920
I bought it online.

283
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,600
This holy water has been
blessed from 99 temples.

284
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,240
Amen times 99.

285
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,000
Amen times 99.

286
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,600
Pun'

287
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,680
are you ready?

288
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,440
It's not too late to change your mind.

289
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,040
Actually' …

290
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,480
We can just put a
little of it on your skin.

291
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,760
Just do it' master Yoh.

292
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
For you'

293
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,360
I'm not afraid of anything.

294
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,960
(holy water)

295
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,880
Erm… Are you sure you're not going to die?

296
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,640
I won't.

297
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,640
I don't die that easy.

298
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,440
Alright. Are you sure?

299
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,040
- Ready?
- I'm ready' master Yoh.

300
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,200
Are you sure it's real' master Yoh?

301
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,560
What kind of liquid is this?

302
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,840
I don't feel any burn.

303
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,560
But the smell is unbearable.

304
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,680
Come on. They said it's real.

305
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,560
You can just take me to the temple

306
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,080
and ask the monk to
spring me with holy water.

307
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,680
Stop complaining.

308
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,000
Eww! It got in my mouth.

309
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,400
What's so funny' master Yoh?

310
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,000
Nothing.

311
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,680
Thank you for bathing me.

312
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,960
I like it.

313
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,160
I feel clean and happy.

314
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,960
Can you scrub my back?

315
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,040
Harder' master Yoh.

316
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,840
I don't feel a thing yet.

317
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,440
Is this good enough?

318
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,200
I...

319
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,840
- Harder' master Yoh.
- Close your ears' honey.

320
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,240
- I don't feel a thing yet.
- Let's go.

321
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,560
Hurry up.

322
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,240
I can't take it anymore.

323
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,000
Just a little bit more.

324
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,640
I'm having a good time.

325
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,440
Um.

326
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,920
We have been through a lot together.

327
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,520
When will we get married?

328
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,840
Wait. What do you mean been through a lot?

329
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,880
We just know each other for not that long.

330
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,440
It's a lot.

331
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,280
You just don't know it.

332
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,400
That's why you say otherwise.

333
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,120
I've never dreamed of sitting
here doing this for someone.

334
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,800
I want you to do this for me forever.

335
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,760
I will get wet every day.

336
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,400
Yeah.

337
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,760
You should be dry by now.

338
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,080
We had already bathed together.

339
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,880
Shall we… sleep here
together tonight' master Yoh?

340
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,280
Huh?

341
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,120
We have done it together before.

342
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,480
The change of location is exciting.

343
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,600
Huh?

344
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,360
Dad! Yoh is going too far!

345
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,920
Please' master Yoh.

346
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,160
I want to lie with you
and smell your scent.

347
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,040
Think of it as repayment for
what you've done to me today.

348
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,920
Not worth it. And we achieve nothing today.

349
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,640
Scratch my belly.

350
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,960
Please scratch my belly
like you would do with master Tuiye.

351
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,920
Oh'

352
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,240
I totally forgot about master Tuiye.

353
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,520
Can you contact lady
Kamsai via your phone for me?

354
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,920
Tuiye. I'm coming. Don't cry.

355
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,200
You're going to sleep
with me tonight' okay?

356
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,200
Because Pun is…
sleeping with his master Yoh.

357
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,360
I mean at Yoh's house' not here.

358
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,400
I'll come pick you up after I
close the restaurant' okay?

359
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,800
Is Pun with Yoh?

360
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,440
I like this atmosphere'
sleeping in a tent like this…

361
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,280
With you by my side.

362
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,320
Let me ask you.

363
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,560
What is it with you lately?

364
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,720
You're standing out with your flirting.

365
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,160
Standing flirting with you.

366
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,400
Sitting flirting with you.

367
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,360
Standing flirting with you again.

368
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,080
Sitting flirting with you again.

369
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,720
For real though' don't you get tired?

370
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,040
Hello' Yoh.

371
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,640
Hello.

372
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,680
Hey! How did you get here?

373
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,560
What are you doing here?

374
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,720
I intended to come here to see Pun.

375
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,680
Oh…

376
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,400
Oh' did Pun told you?

377
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,320
Did you two agreed to meet?

378
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,000
What are you doing?

379
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,680
Can I join in?

380
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,920
Of course' of course.

381
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,960
We're camping and stargazing.

382
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,600
Stargazing?

383
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,040
Um.

384
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,160
Pun likes to lie down
and looks at the sky too.

385
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,080
Erm… Really? That's great.

386
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,560
What? Why are you hiding?

387
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,840
Who's hiding?

388
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,640
They seem to be having
an important conversation.

389
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,960
We shouldn't get in the way' should we?

390
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,320
Our house' our turf.
We can stay wherever we like.

391
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,760
You have to fight!

392
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Fight what?

393
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Fight for your love. Don't
let anyone steal it from you.

394
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,280
Huh?

395
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,840
Hey! Where are you going?

396
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,320
Erm…

397
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,520
Come sit with me' master Yoh.

398
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,440
Yes. Go ahead' Yoh.
Pun invited you.

399
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,960
Erm'

400
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,040
- okay.
- Just go.

401
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,280
May I sit with you?

402
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,040
So' how did you get to know Pun?

403
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,320
It was a coincidence.

404
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,480
There's no such thing as
coincidence in this world.

405
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,720
Erm...

406
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,840
What about Pun?

407
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,400
How did you find Yoh?

408
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,960
I met Pun first

409
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,360
and I moved to the same place he lives.

410
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,720
So' we get to know each other' I guess?

411
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,840
But what a coincidence?

412
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,520
Janja knows Pun too.

413
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,080
Did you go to the same school?

414
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,480
Or how long have you been friend?

415
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,000
Are you close?

416
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Judging by how long we know each other' …

417
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,920
we're very close.

418
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,320
Oh' so' you know each
other since you were kids?

419
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,160
I know him for a long…

420
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,400
long time.

421
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,800
Hundreds of years.

422
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,320
Huh? Here's another one who talks like Pun.

423
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,840
They know each other for so long' huh?
Does that mean Janja is…

424
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,560
What's wrong' Yoh?

425
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,320
Jam'

426
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,520
we should go to bed.

427
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,520
I'm getting sleepy.

428
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,440
I'm not sleepy yet.

429
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,040
But I do.

430
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,200
What? You're not gonna sleep here anymore?

431
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,200
Erm… Goodnight everyone.

432
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,200
Bye-bye.

433
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,800
Come on' Jam.

434
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,120
Goodnight' Yoh.

435
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,240
Goodnight' Janja.

436
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,160
What is it with you' Yoh?

437
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,240
Come on.

438
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
I'm sleepy. It's getting late now.

439
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Dad's gonna complain again.

440
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,440
I'll take my leave.

441
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,920
Don't forget what we talk about.

442
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,440
Goodnight' master Pun.

443
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,440
Goodnight' master Yoh.
See you again when you wake up.

444
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,600
Lady Kamsai. I'm hungry.

445
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,200
Don't worry.

446
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,280
Kamsai entrusted me with this.

447
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
I will do my best to serve you.

448
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,000
Here you go.

449
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
It is guaranteed to be delicious.

450
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,000
Kamsai trained me well.

451
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,960
Where is lady Kamsai' anyway?

452
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,920
One moment please.

453
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,360
I think she's off to do school
project with her friends.

454
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,000
That's why she called
me in to work in her place.

455
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,760
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

456
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,880
I could have eaten elsewhere.

457
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Come on' Mr. Pun.

458
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,840
But eating here at our place is the best.

459
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,920
It's because of lady Kamsai's skill.

460
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,840
Someday'

461
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,320
I'll make you proud of me.

462
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,120
Aren't you gonna talk about my hair color?

463
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,480
How is it? Do I look good?

464
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,400
You should take your
time changing your color…

465
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,360
to practice making pork blood soup instead

466
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,880
so' we'll get more customers.

467
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,480
Roger that' sir!

468
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,240
Come on.

469
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,440
Get ready.

470
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,200
Let's warm up first.

471
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,920
Everyone lifts one finger up.

472
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's warm up first.

473
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,480
Your other hand touches your finger...

474
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,440
And roll it around.

475
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,360
That's right.

476
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,920
That's right.

477
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,360
Do it ten times.

478
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,240
Good.

479
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,040
1...

480
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,080
What is this' lady Kamsai?

481
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,760
2...

482
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,880
3...

483
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,960
4...

484
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,960
- 5... 6
- It's aerobic dance.

485
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,480
- Aerobic dance?
- 7...

486
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,880
- 8 It's almost there.
- Yes.

487
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,600
9...

488
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,600
- 10
- Shin wants our restaurant.

489
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,120
- Next' turn your ears.
- To include more activities.

490
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,480
Turn your ears.

491
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,600
- To make this a place of happiness.
- Ten times.

492
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
Ten times again' to the back.

493
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,040
- He's out of his mind.
- Ah' we're done warming up.

494
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,040
Next' we will start dancing.

495
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
What a nonsense.

496
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,200
Let's go.

497
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,640
Come on' Pun.

498
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,880
We barely have customer lately.

499
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,160
This is better than being bore.

500
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,560
You agreed with Shin?

501
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,880
Alright' we finished our warm-up.

502
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,960
We're gonna dance for real now.

503
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,200
- Come on.
- Let me put the music on. Music!

504
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,040
- Like this.
- Follow him.

505
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,640
Go!

506
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,240
1

507
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
- Mmm...
- 2

508
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,400
3

509
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,520
4

510
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,480
5

511
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,480
6

512
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,440
7

513
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,440
8

514
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,640
Wider' wider.

515
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,920
7 8

516
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,280
9

517
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,040
10 Good. Now' to the next move.

518
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,800
1

519
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,920
2

520
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
3 Hey' young man.

521
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,320
- Why don't you do it?
- Come on.

522
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,000
Here.

523
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,960
I think he doesn't have an armband yet.

524
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,120
He needs an armband.

525
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,560
Alright'

526
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,480
let's try it.

527
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,520
1

528
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,440
2 See? See?

529
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,360
4

530
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,320
5

531
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,240
6 Look at granny. Look at granny go.

532
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,200
Look at granny. Look at granny go.

533
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,720
- Wearing this give you power.
- You can do it' granny.

534
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,440
2 See?

535
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,560
3 See? See?

536
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,320
4

537
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,240
4

538
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,040
5

539
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,960
5

540
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,640
6

541
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,720
7

542
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,400
8 9 10

543
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,560
Great job' everyone.

544
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,920
That's it?

545
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
I got more tired from walking up here.

546
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,240
Alright. Since everyone is already up here…

547
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,280
Don't forget to support
our pork blood soup place.

548
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,720
Umm.

549
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,120
Promoting their restaurant.

550
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,000
You can take any free table.

551
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,680
That was the dance?

552
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,760
Make yourself at home.

553
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,640
I feel like we baited them
here to buy pork blood soup.

554
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,160
Here you go.

555
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,160
I don't see Yoh at all today.

556
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,120
Master Yoh is spending
time with his family.

557
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,640
Maybe he doesn't come back yet.

558
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,880
Really?

559
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,520
He never gone for this long.

560
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,080
Are you sure you two
don't have any problems?

561
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,880
Problems?

562
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,840
Not from me.

563
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,400
So' Yoh might be busy.

564
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,360
Lady Kamsai!

565
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,360
Can you help me with something?

566
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,840
Help you with what?

567
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,320
You can tell me. Don't worry.

568
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,440
Can you help me…

569
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,400
court master Yoh?

570
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,800
Court him?

571
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,080
Isn't that what you do all the time?

572
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,080
I don't know if I did it right.

573
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,400
I fear that master Yoh
will not get my feelings.

574
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,160
What should I do?

575
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,880
Please help me' lady Kamsai.

576
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,760
Make it faster.

577
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,040
Faster?

578
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,640
I don't want to wait any longer.

579
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,960
I'm afraid it will be too late.

580
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,680
Too late for what?

581
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,080
Human lives can be short' …

582
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,320
unlike vampires who can
live for a very long time.

583
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,960
Therefore'

584
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,640
I don't want to waste our
life while being together.

585
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,000
Are you serious' Pun?

586
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,120
I'm serious.

587
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,000
Do I look not serious?

588
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,240
I'm a serious vampire.

589
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,560
But how can I help you that?

590
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,840
I don't have the experience myself.

591
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Shin!

592
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,960
Yes?

593
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,960
Come here. I need your help with something.

594
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,480
Sure things.

595
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,520
What is it?

596
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,560
This guy wants a boyfriend.

597
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,560
He needs our help.

598
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,520
Huh?!

599
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,320
Mr. Pun wants to do it with me?

600
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,880
By the way' we got a lot of customers today.

601
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,360
We should dance again tomorrow.

602
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,800
Dance with me.

603
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,600
- Sure things.
- Right?

604
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,320
