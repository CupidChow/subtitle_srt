00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,800
Come on. Grandma is confused now, you see?

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,760
Why don’t you tell me? I can’t hear you.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,360
It’s okay, granny. Just stay confused. It’s okay.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,360
Someone sends you a gift, Mr. Pun.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,520
On the occasion of Thai new year.

6
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,160
Human blood.

7
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,360
Somchai.

30
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,440
Mr. Pun.

31
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,000
Hey.

32
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,760
Are you okay, Pun?

33
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,880
I’m fine.

34
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,720
But you seem a bit strange.

35
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,840
I’m perfectly normal, master Yoh.

36
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,480
Anyways, are you hungry?

37
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,680
You said you were hungry earlier downstairs.

38
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,760
I can go buy pork blood soup for you.

39
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
It’s okay, master Yoh.

40
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,480
I’m not hungry anymore.

41
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,480
Hmm? Not anymore?

42
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,760
Yeah.

43
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,600
What did you eat?

44
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,200
Cat food?

45
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,520
Are you sure you’re not hungry?

46
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,200
The smell of pork blood soup…

47
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,640
Sweet and aromatic…

48
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,400
Or do you want Kamsai to cook instead?

49
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,280
It’s okay, master Yoh.

50
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,720
Erm… okay.

51
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,840
Who do you think was the one that send gift to Pun?

52
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Janja.

53
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,240
Janja?

54
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,520
I can’t think of anyone.

55
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,440
Maybe from someone we don’t know.

56
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,840
But I think it was Somchai.

57
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,200
Somchai must be thinking of doing something.

58
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,000
He must be planning something.

59
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,320
Why, Yoh?

60
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,360
I mean...

61
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,840
Somchai was here yesterday.

62
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,280
- Huh?
- When?

63
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,160
But the point is...

64
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,440
Pun, he...

65
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,880
Pun what?

66
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,480
It’s nothing.

67
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,320
What?

68
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,360
Pun was just kick Somchai out.

69
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,240
But then he sends Pun a bottle of wine?

70
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,520
I don’t understand.

71
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,920
Yeah, you’re right.

72
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,800
Or maybe he knew Pun likes to drink wine.

73
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,280
Since vampire are real,…

74
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,360
These are the things that we should beware…

75
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,000
Traveling alone at night.

76
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,000
Because most incident happen at night...

77
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,520
In secluded alleyway.

78
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,120
Thai vampire doesn’t scare of cross.

79
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,760
They don’t fear of garlic.

80
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,360
Don’t fear of holy water.

81
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,480
And they don’t die from sunlight.

82
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,720
#ThaiVampire

83
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,280
Yoh!

84
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,000
Happy Thai New Year, master Yoh.

85
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,720
Erm, what do you want, Somchai?

86
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,680
I just wanna talk.

87
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,280
Do you have just a few minutes?

88
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,480
Erm...

89
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,640
Erm...

90
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,240
Just you.

91
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,600
Erm...

92
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,880
What do you want?

93
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,840
How is master Pun doing?

94
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,160
Pun...

95
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
He is...

96
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,000
He is fine.

97
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,240
There is nothing wrong.

98
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,800
Really?

99
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,120
You never see the other Pun before?

100
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,280
What… what do you mean?

101
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
The vampire Pun.

102
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,800
I’m not sure if he finished it yet.

103
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,880
The gift that I sent him.

104
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,080
That bottle of blood.

105
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Human blood.

106
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,200
Don’t tell me that...

107
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,520
Pun drank that blood.

108
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,720
Vampire.

109
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,360
Erm...

110
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,480
Erm… I think it passed 3 minutes already.

111
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,080
I have to go now.

112
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,480
What’s wrong, Yoh?

113
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,480
Erm...

114
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Jam, you should go home.

115
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,520
I will walk you there.

116
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,040
Why?

117
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,040
I think you’ll be safer at home.

118
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
What’s wrong? I don’t understand.

119
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,080
Just hurry. What items do you have?

120
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,520
Why?

121
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,000
Just go right now.

122
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,200
Really?

123
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,160
Janja?

124
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,800
I can’t believe she knew Pun.

125
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Normally, we rarely talk with Janja in campus.

126
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,960
True. This is getting more complicate.

127
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,720
Not to mention that guy named Somchai.

128
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,320
Somchai. Janja. Pun.

129
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,520
These three are all vampire.

130
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
I’m getting goosebumps.

131
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,560
Oh, and the one that got #Thaivampire.

132
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,880
Do you think which one of them…

133
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,840
Was the one who drank human blood?

134
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,400
I think it’s Somchai.

135
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,560
Eww!

136
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,240
Or maybe it’s Janja.

137
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,280
If we’re certain that Janja is vampire…

138
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,680
And those incidents happened around our college.

139
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,640
Janja studies there.

140
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,960
But why would Janja came to college?

141
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,600
And she happened to study at the same place as us.

142
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,640
She lives for hundreds of years.

143
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,440
Why would she needs study?

144
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,120
I mean Pun is 100 percent vampire.

145
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,600
Somchai is 100 percent vampire too.

146
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,440
And Janja… I think she is, I guess.

147
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,640
She is pretty much like Pun.

148
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,240
And… she said she knew Pun for hundreds of years.

149
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,000
As for the reason
why Janja happened to appeared close to us…

150
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,000
I can’t think of anything.

151
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,320
So, what do we do now?

152
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,920
We have to find out first.

153
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,120
One, what does Janja want?

154
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Two, which vampire was the murderer.

155
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,160
Should we hire a detective?

156
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
What are you saying?

157
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,800
This is a job for the professional.

158
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,280
We’re just college kids.
What the hell can we do?

159
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,360
We do what we can.

160
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,320
Who would believe us if we tell them?

161
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,560
About vampire.

162
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,440
Yeah.

163
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,920
Even when it’s on the news, has hashtag,…

164
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,480
People still think it’s a joke.

165
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,160
Yeah, that’s true.

166
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,160
Okay, let’s go.

167
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,600
Long live You…

168
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,720
F…

169
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,760
O…

170
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,960
- &amp; the gang!
- &amp; the gang!

171
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,840
No, that’s not right.

172
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,720
It has to be...

173
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,640
- Long live vampire &amp; the gang!
- Long live vampire &amp; the gang!

174
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,360
Okay?

175
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,400
Yeah, Luis is still missing.

176
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,120
He totally disappeared.
Probably he gone back to his planet.

177
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,880
Forget about Luis.

178
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,920
(Study Hall)

179
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,280
Do you think Janja will show up today?

180
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,520
I don’t know.

181
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,240
Enough.

182
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,360
It’s not blowing up.

183
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,160
I’m doing this for quite a while now.

184
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,920
You mean him or me?

185
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,280
Try to use your mouth instead.

186
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,120
No.

187
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Hello, Yoh.

188
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,080
Erm… Hello.

189
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,520
Are you here to help too?

190
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,760
Hey. She is here.

191
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,960
Yeah.

192
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,520
Thank you so much, Janja.

193
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,400
Thank you.

194
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,960
Why are they thanking her?

195
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,960
I don’t know.

196
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,160
Erm… why did you thank Janja earlier?

197
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,160
Oh, Janja helps funding for our activities.

198
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,440
Huh?

199
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What? Why don’t you use faculty’s fund?

200
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,800
Yeah.

201
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,800
It wasn’t enough.

202
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,680
How much did Janja gave you?

203
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,920
100 grands.

204
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,040
- Huh?
- Huh?

205
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,840
100 grands?

206
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,200
For real?

207
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,560
But… you need a hundred grands for just this?

208
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,560
Quiet down.

209
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,640
Janja said I should not tell anyone.

210
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,360
Please don’t tell anyone.

211
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,400
She’s so damn rich.

212
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,640
Too generous.

213
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Stop looking.

214
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,840
Yeah, we don’t usually talk to each other at all.

215
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,000
That’s right.

216
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,560
Oh, can I ask you something?

217
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,560
I’m the same kind as master Pun.

218
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,720
I’m what you refer to as vampire.

219
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,080
You don’t seem that surprise.

220
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,240
Perhaps you’re used to it with Pun.

221
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,720
Oh, master Pun.

222
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,240
You’re here too?

223
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,640
This is my place.

224
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,120
I have to be here.

225
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,840
Erm… is this for me?

226
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,280
I bought it for you.

227
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,920
Oh, that’s a lot.

228
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,880
For your friend too.

229
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,640
Did you buy some for me?

230
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,560
No.

231
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,320
That’s because you know…

232
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,920
What I want to eat.

233
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,320
Does that mean Janja primary drink human blood?

234
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,760
I will leave you guys together.

235
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,280
I’ll get going now.

236
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,400
But when the time comes, I will be back.

237
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,160
(Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science)

238
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Do you want to have a seat?

239
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,160
So, how did you get here?

240
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,160
I walk here.

241
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,280
I mean how did you know that I’m here at my college.

242
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,160
I follow your scent.

243
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,400
Again?

244
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,600
So, you mean where I go…

245
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,240
You can follow me?

246
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,520
Yes.

247
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,880
Tuiye must be tired coming out here.

248
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,720
He doesn’t complain.

249
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,560
Master Tuiye wants to go out once in a while.

250
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,800
I already asked.

251
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,040
Master Tuiye wants to see me dating with you.

252
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,960
Master Yoh, can you feed me pork blood soup?

253
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,600
Funny.

254
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,560
Or do you want to eat like cat like that day?

255
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,960
Just eat.

256
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,680
You can go home before me.

257
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,960
In case you have things to do.

258
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,240
Or if you want to play water fight at the apartment.

259
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,080
I only play with you.

260
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,320
After all these hundreds of years…

261
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,160
I never play that with anyone.

262
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,240
You’re so overexaggerating.

263
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,840
I mean it, master Yoh.

264
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,240
Songkran…

265
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,400
Or any festival on that matter…

266
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,240
I never play with anyone.

267
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,440
Only with you.

268
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,880
I’ll get going now.

269
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,000
I’m coming with you.

270
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,240
Come on.

271
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
What? Where are you going?

272
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,480
To play water fight. Let’s go.

273
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,160
It’s okay, master Yoh’s friends.
I’ll take care of master Yoh here.

274
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,800
Erm… I’ll be back.

275
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,680
Where are you going?

276
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,000
To the bathroom.

277
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,280
Do you want me to go with you?

278
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,400
That’s no need.

279
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
It’s just right there.

280
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,920
I’m going now.

281
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,200
And when will you go?

282
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,440
Go where?

283
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,480
Go back.

284
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,680
Back to where?

285
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,920
Hey, you.

286
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,120
What happened to your neck?

287
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,360
Erm… erm… it’s nothing.

288
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,240
I’m allergic to mosquito.

289
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,240
Mosquito?

290
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,160
Erm… I… I should get back to work.

291
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,400
Sure.

292
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,280
Mosquito?

293
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,320
Pun. Can I ask you something?

294
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,320
What is it, master Yoh?

295
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,040
Erm, the mark…

296
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,800
I mean the bite mark...

297
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,200
When we got bit by vampire fangs…

298
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,680
You mean… like when Somchai bit me earlier?

299
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,000
Why, master Yoh?

300
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,880
I’m… I’m just confused.

301
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,480
Maybe I’m thinking too much.

302
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,440
It must be nothing.

303
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,240
Bye-bye. See you.

304
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,520
What’s wrong, master Yoh?

305
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,960
Huh?

306
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,040
Just tell me what happened to you.

307
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,080
Have you got bitten?

308
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,760
Erm… it was mosquito. Mosquito.

309
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,080
That’s not true.

310
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,680
It’s true.

311
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,160
Have you heard the news about Thai vampire?

312
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,000
Are you saying that…

313
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,600
Vampire.

314
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,800
Do you believe in vampire?

315
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,920
Can you take your scarf off for me?

316
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,680
What vampire? They are not real.

317
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,200
Erm… I… I have to go.

318
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,920
My friends are waiting for me.

319
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Goodbye.

320
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,400
Just tell me.

321
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,640
It was vampire.

322
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,360
But recently...

323
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,680
There were news about people getting bit by vampire...

324
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,360
They didn’t die?

325
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
Are you serious?

326
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,160
But you survive.

327
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,760
You still alive.

328
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,440
But… hey!

329
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,920
Shouldn’t you be turning into vampire?

330
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,800
No. I am human.

331
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,600
But please don’t tell anyone about this.

332
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,680
I… I have to go now.

333
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,880
So… it’s not fatal.

334
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,920
I saw the body of a woman…

335
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,840
Lying there motionless.

336
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,080
Huh?

337
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,480
If they die…

338
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,320
It maybe because they didn’t stop the bleeding.

339
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,520
Huh?

340
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,920
When you get bit by vampire…

341
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,880
Blood will pour out.

342
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,760
Usually, the wound will dry up quick.

343
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,720
But for someone…

344
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,560
It doesn’t stop.

345
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,960
If the bleeding doesn’t stop…

346
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,920
They may expire.

347
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
I mean dead.

348
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,640
Wow! That’s a new knowledge.

349
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,840
Actually, they are not as scary as I thought.

350
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,960
That’s why every time it’s on the news,
it went quiet so quick.

351
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,880
Vampire are not that scary, master Yoh.

352
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,040
On the other hand, human can be scarier.

353
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,360
Erm… but when we got bitten.

354
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,440
Won’t we get infected?

355
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,640
I mean won’t we turn into a vampire…

356
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,960
Like in the movies or those tales?

357
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,000
A good vampire…

358
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,840
Should not drink human blood.

359
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,200
Because it will...

360
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,880
It will what?

361
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,400
It will… corrupt our mind.

362
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,080
What do you mean?

363
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,040
They may not be like me, master Yoh.

364
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,200
They won’t be a lovely vampire.

365
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,600
They might turn into a stressed vampire.

366
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Serious…

367
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,560
Scary…

368
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,320
Emotionless…

369
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,840
Lose their sense for a moment.

370
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,800
But why would you drink blood…

371
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
If it doesn’t benefit you?

372
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,920
Vampire have to drink blood.

373
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,560
Otherwise, we will lose our strength.

374
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,640
Stop drinking blood… is like stop breathing.

375
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,040
But you can substitute it with pork blood?

376
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,160
Not entirely.

377
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,440
Because in the end, fresh human blood...

378
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,440
provides more energy.

379
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,880
Huh?

380
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,600
What did you say?

381
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,600
Don’t tell me that...

382
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,080
All these time...

383
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,520
You don’t just eat pork blood soup.

384
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,760
Master Yoh...

385
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,320
Just smelling your scent…

386
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,240
Give me special power.

387
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,800
I don’t fancy human blood.

388
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,200
I fancy you.

389
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,120
Really?

390
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,800
I want to be with you like this...
For as long as I can. Master Yoh.

391
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,600
But why can’t you stay as long as you want?

392
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,400
Since you have this long lifespan.

393
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,360
Huh?

394
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,680
It’s almost a thousand year.

395
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,840
We all going to die soon anyway.

396
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,520
I’m not fear death.

397
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,360
A thousand year.

398
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,120
You can only live for a thousand year, right?

399
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,960
And how old are you right now?

400
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,960
925 years old.

401
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,680
So, we might be gone around the same time.

402
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,960
That’s right, master Yoh.

403
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,440
In this life, we might die around the same time.

404
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,200
Die peacefully.

405
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,720
But if you don’t die too fast.

406
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,720
And live to a hundred year…

407
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,040
You may die at the same time as me.

408
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,880
What are you?
Why are you so proud when talking about death?

409
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,480
In that case, let’s live together…

410
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,000
And die together.

411
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,200
That’s the most romantic thing in the world, master Yoh.

412
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,800
Your lip is so soft…

413
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,600
And so sweet.

414
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,600
Sweeter than blood that is vampire’s favorite.

415
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,280
What did I just do?

416
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,720
Am I have this much feeling to Pun?

417
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Can we do that again, master Yoh?

418
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,680
Enough, enough. What are you doing?

419
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,080
Go to bed already.

420
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,480
Can I sleep on the bed with you?

421
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,160
Because tonight, we might…

422
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,600
Just go to sleep. Go to sleep.

423
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,120
Go to sleep.

424
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,880
Goodnight, master Yoh.

425
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,680
And see you again when you wake up.

426
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,000
Goodnight, Pun.

427
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,200
And… why are you staring at me?

428
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,360
Just go to sleep.

429
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,280
I just want to watch you like this for a long time.

430
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,480
I don’t want time to move this fast.

431
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,600
We still have 75 years to go.

432
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,800
It won’t be that long, master Yoh.

433
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,360
Because I...

434
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,680
Only have so little time with you.

435
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,160
Just 2 more days.

436
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,480
Okay, bye-bye. Kiss-kiss.

437
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,800
You’re not open the restaurant today?

438
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,760
I want blood.

439
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,400
I said… don’t you have blood for me today?

440
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:56,960
No.

441
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,560
Maybe I have to...

442
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,280
I’m just kidding.

443
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,240
But maybe I have to get serious now.

444
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,960
Girl… Run!

445
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,800
What?

446
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,840
Run!

447
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,520
What are you waiting for?

448
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,680
Hey! Security! Security!

449
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,200
Why am I here? I’m leaving!

450
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,680
You like to stick your nose into people business.

451
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,000
That’s not gonna end well for you.

452
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,120
