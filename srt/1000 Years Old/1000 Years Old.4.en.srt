The merchant's own version.

You can write it down right away.

70
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,800
Have you eaten pork blood soup before?

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,960
Of course, I have.

72
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,280
It’s similar to clear
soup with egg tofu, right?

73
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,400
It’s the same thing, right?

74
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,440
That's enough. Then prepare the
machine to prepare the raw materials.

75
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,560
Can you wash the dishes?

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,240

Useless.

82
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,280
Why are you judging him?
He hasn’t show us his skill yet.

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,480

92
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,280
He seems like a determined guy.

93
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,840
But he just took too long.

94
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,440
Just wait for a minute.
I’m doing the best I can.

95
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
What should I do?

96
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,040
Ah!

182
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,640
Lady Jam.

183
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,520
Lady Jam. Help me.

184
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,760
You came right on time
to have a meal with us.

185
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,480
I made a lot of Yo ’s favorite
dishes today. You should try them.

186
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,120
Jam, pour him a glass of water.

187
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,440
Dad. I don’t think Pun would eat it.

188
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,840
Why?

189
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,640
- Do you have blood?
- Huh?

190
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,040
I mean pork blood or something like that.

191
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,800
Oh…

192
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,400
Nope. Why?

193
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,760
Pun likes to eat it.

194
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,640
Really?

195
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,720
Oh, is he the guy you told me about? The
owner of the pork blood soup restaurant?

196
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,440
Erm, yes, he is.

197
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,080
Really? Good, good.

198
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,080
You should bring some
of that for me next time.

199
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,000
And I thought your friend is a vampire.

200
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,400
Right? Since you were asking for blood.

201
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,440
I am a vampire.

202
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
That’s it. I knew it.

203
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,120
He’s funny.

204
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,960
Alright, alright, alright.

205
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,680
I don’t drink human blood.

206
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,000
I like to eat pork blood soup.

207
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,800
Really?

208
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,760
Alright. Come again next time,
I will be preparing that for you.

209
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,360
I thought you said it’s a secret.
You can’t tell anyone.

210
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,000
But you just tell everyone.

211
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,280
- But master Yo ’s dad asked me.
- He was just joking.

212
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,360
But, master Yo ’s dad…
Don’t tell anyone that I’m a vampire.

213
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,040
I don't like when people…

214
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,680
- come to disturb me.
- Come to disturb me.

215
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,680
Okay, I promise I won’t tell anyone.

216
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,320
Vampire.

217
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
You too, lady Jam.

218
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,480
Virepam. Vampire it is.

219
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,240
I won’t tell anyone.

220
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,640
So, what bring you here?

221
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,160
Hey! Never mind that.

222
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,640
How did you know I live here?

223
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,200
I followed your scent.

224
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Oh,

225
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,360
like a dog?

226
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,240
I’m here to watch over you.

227
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,480
Watch over me?

228
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,560
Why?

229
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,880
To make sure that no one followed you.

230
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,600
Someone’s following me?

231
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,480
What do you mean?

232
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,120
I don’t want you to get involved with…

233
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,000
With?

234
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,440
Forget about it.

235
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,360
You’re fine so it’s all good.

236
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
I’m just here to protect you.

237
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
What is it with you?

238
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
You’re making me confused.

239
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,840
Do you need my help washing the dishes?

240
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,680
It’s almost done.
Why are you asking right now?

241
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,840
If I said it earlier, you wouldn’t get
a chance to repay your dad's favor.

242
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,040
You’re so grateful.

243
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,280
You’re a good human.

244
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,520
Sure, Mister good vampire.

245
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,320
Care to help me hang up clothes?

246
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,800
You should keep doing it.

247
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,760
Don’t worry about me.

248
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,880
It’s not that hot. I’m okay.

249
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
Keep going, master Yo .

250
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,680
Hanging your clothes in the sun
will help them get dried naturally.

251
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,720
Let me help.

252
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,760
I’m okay.

253
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,280
Hello. I’m ready.

254
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,120

255
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,840

for me. It’s because my good research.

328
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,600
Shut up, Luis.

329
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,800
Why?

330
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,760
Look who’s talking?

331
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,560
Where should we travel this school break?

332
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,760
Yeah. Where should we go?

333
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Travel around the world?

334
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,160
But we still have to do our thesis.

335
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,800
We’ll think about it in next semester.

336
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,480
Let’s grab something to eat. I’m hungry.

337
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,440
Are we still doing the same subject?

338
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,040
Like I said, we’ll think about it later.

339
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,360
Why don’t you think about
it now and get it over with?

340
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,520
Do whatever you want.

341
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,120
Your thesis is your solo project anyway.

342
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,040
Let’s have lunch.

343
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,000
Any idea for vacation?

344
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,960
I haven’t thought about it yet.

345
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,800
Are you guys gonna eat?

346
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,760
Erm…

347
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,560
Hello.

348
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,920
You smell so good.

349
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,320
Huh? The way he talks is… just like Pun.

350
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,480
Are you in a hurry?

351
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,560
Erm… I’m not in a hurry.

352
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,960
By the way, what do you want from me?

353
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,200
Nothing.

354
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,600
I’m looking for Pun.

355
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,360
Oh, Mr. Pun?
He should be in his room

356
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,200
or on the rooftop.

357
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,560
I’m Somchai.

358
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,960
I’m Yo .

359
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,680
What are you doing here, Master Yo ?

360
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,800
Erm...

361
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,080
I talk to him first.

362
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,440
So what?

363
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,600
Calm down, Pun.

364
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,520
He didn’t do anything to me.

365
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,240
You should get inside, master Yo .

366
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,520
I have something to talk with Somchai.

367
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,240
Okay.

368
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,880
Aunty? Are you okay?

369
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,880
What’s wrong, aunty?

370
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,800
That’s the same guy.

371
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,600
- The same guy?
- Umm.

372
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,120
The same with what guy?

373
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,640
What do you mean?

374
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,720
The guy at the front.

375
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,840
Yes, you mean…
the guy who’s talking with Pun,

376
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,760
that Somchai guy?

377
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,520
He is the same guy.

378
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,360
The same guy as who?

379
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,000
The former tenant of room 407.

380
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,680
Huh?

381
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,320
Umm.

382
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,640
Are you serious?

383
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,160
Im dead serious.

384
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,600
You mean, the guy you
told me about that day?

385
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,800
That’s scary.

386
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Very scary.

387
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,800
- Are you sure about what you saw?
- Yeah.

388
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,280
Erm…

389
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,120
Is that you, Pun?

390
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,280
Yes, it’s me.

391
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Erm… What is happening?

392
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,400
It’s nothing.

393
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,400
You should go to sleep.

394
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,800
I will be protecting you.

395
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,320
Protecting me?

396
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,400
Why are you protecting me?

397
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,320
Protecting from what?

398
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,400
From all danger.

399
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,760
How can I sleep

400
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,960
if someone is staring at me like that?

401
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,560
Usually, when you were sleeping alone…
The ghost in your room were watching you.

402
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,400
Yet you can still sleep.

403
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,760
Huh?

404
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,640
Funny.

405
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,280
You should rest.

406
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,960
I’m not sleepy.

407
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
I will be guarding you.

408
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,760
Guarding from what?

409
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Goodnight then.

410
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,160
And don’t steal anything from my room.

411
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,080
Goodnight, master Yo .

412
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,040
See you again tomorrow.

413
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,240
“I’m not sleepy. I will be guarding you.”

414
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,520
Burn mark?

415
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,960
It’s matches the crucifix shape exactly.

416
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,560
Hey!

417
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,520
You finally awake, master Yo .

418
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,720
Erm...

419
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,000
I’m hungry.

420
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,920
Master Tuiye is hungry too.

421
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,440
You come so early today.

422
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,040
I’m eager for you to taste it.

423
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,800
You cooked it?

424
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,400
It’s delicious.

425
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,240
Where did you buy it, master Yo ?

426
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,920
Should we place our tables like this?

427
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,080
There, there, there…

428
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,320
and over here.

429
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,000
Sure.

430
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,640
Do we have to change the sign?

431
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,560
We should add more
lighting from there to there.

432
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,200
When we open at
night, it will be beautiful.

433
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,960
You should take your time
to improve your soup making skill first.

434
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,120
Roger that, sir.

435
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,480
Before we open,

436
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,600
why don’t we go make merit for good luck?

437
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,560
Sure.

438
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,480
Of course. I’m with you.

439
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,200
By the way, can vampire walk in a temple?

440
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,480
You should ask Pun to go a temple
if you want to keep proving your idea.

441
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,120
Check if he has any reaction.

442
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,240
Wow! I’ve never spent
the night in a temple before.

443
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,280
I’m so excited.

444
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,520
It’s peaceful in here.

445
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,160
Is this your holidays activity?

446
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,680
I thought you would go on a
vacation with Luis and Pak.

447
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
I’m testing if Pun can walk in temples.

448
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,760
Oh…

449
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,440
And I want to make merit too.

450
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,640
Alright.

451
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,560
Can you walk in temples?

452
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,840
I can.

453
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,240
But it’s hot in here.

454
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,160
Do they have air-conditioning?

455
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,280
Nature's air-con.

456
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,720
It’s guaranteed to be cool.

457
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,720
Come on.

458
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,320
Let’s go, everyone.

459
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,200
Hurry up.

460
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,520
I’m hungry.

461
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,280
Lady Kamsai,

462
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,440
I’m so hungry right now.

463
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,960
We can only have a
beverage for this evening.

464
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,400
It is a veggie smoothie.

465
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,000
It’s good for your health.

466
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,880
I need blood.

467
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
Otherwise, I will lose my strength.

468
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,720
Try to eat something else.

469
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,960
Human body need 5 food groups to survive.

470
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,440
My body only need one food.

471
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,960
Blood. Pork blood.

472
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,320
Please?

473
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,160
I will not survive.

474
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,160
And I think everyone is hungry too.

475
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,440
Who’s hungry? Raise your hand.

476
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,360
I asked lady Kamsai to
bring pork blood for us.

477
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,720
You’re so well-prepared.

478
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,440
Why did you let Shin cook?

479
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,560
You have to give him a chance too.

480
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,520
But it won’t be delicious, master Yo .

481
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,120
It will be delicious.

482
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,720
Try to be more open-minded.

483
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,720
How is it?

484
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,400
Am I getting better?

485
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,280
It’s good because of
blood, not because of you.

486
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,440
Well, you can complement
him once in a while.

487
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,120
It’s super delicious.

488
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,920
How is it, Kamsai?
Is my cooking getting better?

489
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,000
Hmm. That’s very, very much better.

490
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,480
Cool.

491
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,320
You’re flattering each other like this,

492
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,000
Who am I to argue?

493
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,560
Alright, everyone.

494
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,520
I will cut you guys some slack for a day.

495
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,560
Tomorrow, we will start from scratch.

496
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,040
We must try harder.

497
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,840
There won’t be down time
to eat dinner like this again.

498
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,440
Master Yo , you can be cruel sometimes.

499
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,920
You want merit but we
can’t fill our stomach.

500
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,440
What did you say?

501
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,440
You… are… so… heartless.

502
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,240
Huh?

503
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,960
Thank you so much for
letting us use your kitchen.

504
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,640
You’re welcome.

505
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,440
Come on, I’ll help you wash the dishes.

506
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,960
Shin, we don’t do it like that.

507
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,200
What? How do we do it then?

508
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,080
Why are we walking in circle?

509
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,240
To practice meditation.

510
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,040
Erm… Can I ask you something?

511
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,520
Of course, master Yo .

512
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,560
The mark on your chest…

513
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,080
Oh, it’s nothing, master Yo .

514
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,040
If you’re allergic to it…

515
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,640
Then you don’t have
to wear it all the time.

516
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,560
It’s your gift to me. I like it.

517
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
How can I be allergic to it?

518
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,040
Maybe you really are a vampire.

519
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,880
You got burn from a cross.

520
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,000
And you feel hot from getting in a temple.
Right?

521
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,520
I have to confess.

522
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,200
I was trying to prove that about you too.

523
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,720
But I’m still confused.

524
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,240
Do I have to believe in vampire…

525
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,480
Just like how I believe in aliens?

526
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,880
The vampire who sell pork blood soup.

527
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,040
That’s right, master Yo .

528
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,640
I open that place just for you.

529
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,320
Because you ask me to do it.

530
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,360
Pun the vampire…

531
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,120
and the restaurant called
‘All Hail Pork Blood Soup’.

532
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,280
All Hail Pork Blood Soup?

533
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,640
You settled on that name?

534
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,520
Are you serious?

535
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,040
That’s right, master Yo .

536
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,000
I’m very serious about
opening this restaurant.

537
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,200
A serious vampire…
Is right in front of you, Master Yo .

538
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,040
Vampire, it is.

539
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,720
All hail pork blood soup!
