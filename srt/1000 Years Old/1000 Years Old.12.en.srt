1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I have found you again… in this life.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is the first time I see someone…

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Using an umbrella while playing tennis.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was giving you the advantage.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And I won, in the end.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You always win over my heart.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You have your way with words.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You look happy.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What should I do? After I waited
for you for many hundreds of years.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Should I keep waiting?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You don’t have to wait for me.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The only man I waited for to love me…

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But he’s so cold to me.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If it wasn’t because my father
wanted me to continue his family…

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
To have children and grand-children…

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I wouldn’t have waited for you.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Who else would love you?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Then you’ll have to
wait until the end of time.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If there’s no love…

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then why would you have to wait this long?

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why don’t you marry me instead?

121

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, he goes to campus…

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Comes home.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And locks himself in his
room. Not talking to anyone.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And… he doesn’t come here anymore.

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000

No, he won’t.

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If he misses it, he should come back by now.

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If he didn’t love All Hail Pork
Blood Soup to begin with…

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Then why did he build it?

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It would have been better to let someone
else buy the business in the first place.

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Pun is so cruel.

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And he said he’s a good vampire.

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Too cruel.

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He fooled us into this…

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Then he destroyed it.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He fooled Yoh to fall in
love and then disappeared.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And to marry someone else?
How could he do that?

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Calm down, Kamsai.

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What is it to calm down? It’s all true.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He should be able to choose his own life.

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But he used force marriage as an excuse?

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is not a drama.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Take it easy, Kamsai.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why should I?

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Pun is a cold-hearted motherfucker.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He hurt All Hail Pork
Blood Soup. He hurt Yoh.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If I find him, I’ll knock
the fuck out of him.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You don’t have to go that far.

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What, Jam? Why didn’t you tell me?

164
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You were the one who kept on talking.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
One bowl of pork blood soup for the VVVVV… V.I.P.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There’s no more. We’re closed.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Where are you going, Kamsai?

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Come on, Jam.

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You’re still here?

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So, you still want to eat it or not?

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
There’s not much left.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Eat while you can.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you don’t want it then,
go buy it somewhere else.

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Of course, I will eat here.

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Lady Kamsai’s cooking is the best.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I need to go grab pork blood first.

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
(All Hail Pork Blood Soup by Mr. Pun
Regular 60, Special 70)

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It’s so delicious.

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You should continue the business.

180
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This place belongs to you.

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Let everyone know about this
pork blood soup restaurant again.

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I have to go now.

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I wish you the best.

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Come back and reopen it together!

185
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Hey!

186
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why are you going?

187
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Come back and pay the bill first!

188
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You can just come here
to eat wherever you want…

189
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And then just leave?

190
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You’re a cruel vampire!

191
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You’re so cruel.

192
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You went back to that place again?

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The smell of pork blood soup…

194
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I can smell it on you.

195
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Why didn’t you buy some for me?

196
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I’ve never tasted it.

197
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I’m telling the truth.

198
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It must be so sweet…

199
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So fragrant…

200
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That’s why it got you hooked like that.

201
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Because it was my place.

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The place that you love.

203
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes.

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why can’t you love me like that?

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You’ll never have my heart.

206
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I only do this for you
because it’s my duty…

207
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That my father…

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And your father made a deal together.

209
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
To master Yoh’s house.

210
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Wherever you go, I’ll go with you.

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I’m going to find some blood.

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You’re only human. Stay out of this.

213
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You can drink my blood again.

214
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You don’t have to drink someone else.
I’m willing to.

215
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You don’t even have
to pay me like last time.

216
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Stupid human.

217
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Master Yoh!

218
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I come in peace.

219
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Can you come back tomorrow morning?

220
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I’m going to bed.

221
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What do you want from me now?

222
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Do you want to know…

223
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
How you died in the past?

224
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Huh?

225
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What do you mean?

226
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Master Yoh smells so good.

227
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Will he still taste the same?

228
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Are you saying...
you have met me before as well?

229
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Bravo, master Yoh.

230
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I was the first one who found you.

231
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So, you remember me?

232
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The mark on your neck
stays the same in all your previous life.

233
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Are you for real?

234
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And… And… What about Pun?

235
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Does Pun meet me in my previous life?

236
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It must be you.

237
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Actually...

238
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You remember me too, right?

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Huh?

240
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Mr. Pun recognized me?

241
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He remembers you well, more than anything.

242
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So… since the first time we met…

243
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
He already know who I am.

244
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Why didn’t he tell me?

245
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Master Pun is just like that.

246
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
He wants you to remember by yourself.

247
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So that master Yoh
can decide to fall in love…

248
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
With your own heart in all of your lives.

249
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What an undying hero.

250
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Do you feel moved?

251
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Why are you telling me this?

252
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Because Pun and Janja have already married.

253
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There’s no point to keep it a secret.

254
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I just want to tell you.

255
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It’s something I kept secret for so long.

256
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I want to vent it out.

257
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But you don’t have to be sad.

258
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Because no matter what,
you’ll never be together.

259
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No matter how much you love each other.

260
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What’s so funny?

261
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So, do you still wanna know?

262
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
How you died in each of your previous lives?

263
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Like this.

264
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Always right on time.

265
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You should let master Yoh go now.

266
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
From now on…

267
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Master Yoh doesn’t belong to you anymore.

268
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I’ll take my leave.

269
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You don’t have to worry, master Yoh.

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I’ll always protect you.

271
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You don’t have to.

272
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
From now on…

273
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I can take care of myself.

274
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The ring I gave you…

275
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You still wearing it.

276
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I see it with my heart.

277
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I still see it on your finger.

278
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It doesn’t matter, Mr. Pun.

279
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Please let me go.

280
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I don’t have any feeling for you...

281
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
In every life.

282
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I never love someone like you.

283
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Wave goodbye.

284
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And next time, let’s not
see each other again.

285
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000

Let alone making a baby.

end in our generation.

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
No more heirs.

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Pun is so true to himself.

339
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
He will never love someone else…

340
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Except master Yoh in this life…

341
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And master Yoh in his previous life.

342
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You’re smiling.

343
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Why?

344
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Maybe I…

345
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Don’t love master Pun anymore.

346
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You can leave.

347
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Okay.

348
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Hello, Janja.

349
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Hello, Yoh.

350
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I gave up.

351
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Even if I kill you again in this life…

352
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Master Pun wouldn’t love me anyway.

353
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
No matter which life…

354
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
No matter how long…

355
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Or how many times you died…

356
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Master Pun will only love you.

357
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Erm… is something wrong, Janja?

358
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Did you had a fight with Pun?

359
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
We didn’t fight.

360
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It’s just...
Master Pun never loved me, that’s all.

361
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I was the one who keep fooling myself…

362
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That one day, I’ll be able to
win over Master Pun’s heart.

363
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That mark...

364
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You have it in every life.

365
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But even if you don’t have it…

366
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Master Pun will find you eventually.

367
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I give master Pun back to you.

368
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
For the time you have left…

369
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
May your love last as long as it can.

370
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But… I already told him goodbye.

371
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So, what’s the point?

372
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Because I never liked Pun.

373
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I don’t have any feeling for you...

374
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
In any life.

375
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I never loved someone like you.

376
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But the truth is...

377
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I love Mr. Pun to death.

378
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Erm… does Pun still live in this church?

379
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Master Pun hasn’t come to the church
for a long time now.

380
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And… do you happen to know where he’s gone?

381
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
How can I contact him?

382
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I don’t know either.

383
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Maybe...

384
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
(Saifon apartment)

385
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
(407)

386
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Mr. Pun.

387
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Alright…

388
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I will tell you the truth.

389
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Thing is… I…

390
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I...

391
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The thing is I...

392
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I love you so much.

393
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I’m sorry…

394
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
That I said it like that.

395
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I lied to you.

396
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I lied to myself.

397
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And I hope…

398
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I never say anything bad to you…

399
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
In my previous life either.

400
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I’m sorry.

401
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Mr. Pun. Where are you?

402
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Will we meet again?

403
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
An honest human…

404
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Is right in front of you.

405
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I’m sorry.

406
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I miss you.

407
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I love.

408
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Is that a hallucination?

409
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
What are you doing?

410
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Master Yoh?

411
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Master Yoh?

412
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Erm… Mr… Mr. Pun?

413
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Are you confessing your
love to a mannequin?

414
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Eh…

415
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
No… no.

416
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I heard everything.

417
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Huh?

418
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Why didn’t you say something?

419
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You… still living in this
room all these time?

420
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yes.

421
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I’m always here.

422
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Where else can I go?

423
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So… you heard me…

424
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I heard everything, master Yoh.

425
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I love you too.

426
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I always love you.

427
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But… Janja.

428
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Janja understands.

429
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
She understands and allows it.

430
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I can never some anyone else…

431
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,000

My hug…

434
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Is a lot warmer than that
mannequin, right, master Yoh?

435
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I’m sorry.

436
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You don’t have to say sorry.

437
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Just say you love me.

438
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Okay..

439
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000

Just take me. I’m ready. Period.

445
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I’ll take this guy.

446
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Mr. Pun finally accepted me.

447
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I will do my best, sir.

448
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000

449
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000

But… we need the ceiling first.

455
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You’re right. We don’t have ceiling.

534
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
No matter who you will born to be…

535
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
No matter what you will look like…

536
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I will always find you.

537
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And I will always love you.

538
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Hurry up and be reborn.

539
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Goodnight, master Yoh.

540
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Wave goodbye.

541
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Until we meet again.

542
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Handsome bro…

543
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
One day, I will grow as tall as you.

544
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I will wait.

545
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
They are all dead.

546
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
There's only us left, as always.

547
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So boring.

548
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
In 20 years, we will be expired.

549
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Will you find master Yoh again?

550
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Right.

551
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What about the song you wrote for master Yoh?

552
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I’ll sing to him in his next life.

553
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
What’s the song called?

554
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
‘Dear Yoh.’

555
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,000
