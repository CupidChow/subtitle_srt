00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,040
Mr. Pun.

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,960
Actually, I can tell you the truth.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,840
My friends and I…
We had been studying about…

4
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,480
Ouch!

5
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,040
Vampire?

6
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,200
Yes,

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,080
I have lived for hundreds of years

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,880
just to drink your pure blood.

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,560
No.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,080
Am I going to be turned into a vampire?

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,720
No, no!

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,920
No, no!

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,720
Why do you have to bite my neck?

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,960
No. I don’t want it.

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,120
Please, don’t hurt me. I’m scared.

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,120
Please let me go.

17
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,280
No. I don’t want it.

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,000
Please, don’t hurt me. I’m scared.

19
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,960
Please let me go.

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
You scared of vampire?

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,800
I’m not scared!

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,640
I’m just messing with you.

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,160
I just want to know whether
you love vampires or not.

24
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,040
Who is gonna love that? Are you crazy?

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,960
What are you playing?

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,320
But I would like you to love us.

27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,200
Nice vampires do exist, you know?

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,440
Are you leaving already?

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
I thought you have something to inform me.

30
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,000
Nothing. I don’t want to talk to a weirdo.

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,760
Who’s a weirdo?

32
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,960
See you again next time, master Yo.

33
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,320
There’s no next time!

34
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:01,440
Fun...

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,680
It's fun.

Do you want to know about me?

59
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,880
It's going to be sad.

60
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440
I'll tell you...

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,960
Will you believe me if I tell you
I have lived on this earth for many centuries?

62
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,440
I lived through many eras.

63
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,880
And that's just it...

64
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:29,040
People around me...
age, suffer, and die with time,

65
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,240
but not me...
I have to face every story alone.

66
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,240
I feel sorrowful,

67
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:47,000
as if I've been cursed to be alone
in this seemingly endless time.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,840
I've just been living day by day.

69
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,680
Eating blood from Namtok noodles

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,760
because the seller won't
sell just the pork blood,

71
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,240
and I have to pick out
the garlic that I don't like

72
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,040
because the seller insists on putting it in,
even though I've repeatedly told her not to.

73
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,120
I'm so tired.

74
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Tired of my own handsome
face that never changes.

75
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,400
Tired of being born and
not aging with anyone.

76
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,000
I can't remember when I was born anymore.

77
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,400
It's been too long...

78
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,600
My life is just empty claims, loneliness.

79
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,760
All I can do is wait...

80
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,520
to leave this world... When?

81
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,400
It's so sad, very, very sad.

82
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,440
The scorching heat

83
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,400
and the umbrella are so far away.

84
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,960
But I hate the heat from the sun.

85
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,800
It’s so hot.

86
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,520
But one day...

87
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,840
Don’t go out today or you will be doomed.

88
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,480
I warn you. Don’t fight with anyone.

89
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,120
Or will this be a chance…
for me to die as I wished.

90
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,840
It's time.

91
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,600
Let's do it.

92
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,080
I'm more than ready.

93
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,680
Goodbye to the thousand
years that I’ve lived.

94
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,680
It’s sad.

95
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,880
In my next life, I want to be a cat.

96
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,600
No, wait, cats have nine lives.

97
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,040
I don't want that.

98
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Goodbye, Sun.

99
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,360
You who have a bright
light that burns skin.

100
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,120
This country is so damn hot.

101
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,040
But I like it here…

102
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,880
Because... sorry, I couldn't continue
the story in time. Because I'm dead.

103
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,400
Hmm?

104
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,000
Smell...

105
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,800
Too fragrant.

147
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,520
Are you a vampire?

Yeah...

149
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,640
Funny.

150
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,440
You have a loose screw in your head?

151

You can talk to psychiatrist
about that, you know?

152
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,320
Yeah.

153
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,560
But you do like to eat blood.

154
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,040
Are you really a vampire?

155
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,280
Yes, I am a vampire.

156
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,440
Funny.

157
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,240
Then Yo must be a vampire too

158
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,560

159
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,000

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,400
I really want to ask.

165
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,640
You seem very obsessed with vampires, Pun.

166
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,440
I’m not obsessed but I am a vampire.

167
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,360
I knew it. As soon as he
got caught acting weird,

168
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
he keeps it cool by pretend to be another weird thing.

169
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,560
He’s so suspicious.

170
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,240
I heard that aliens or Martians
like to blend in with human.

171
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,840
But this guy is so obvious.

172
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,920
And which planet does vampires come from?

173
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,760
Let me see, will he slip up?

174
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,000
Well, this planet, of course... Earth.

175
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,760
It's here.

176
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,120
Planet earth.

177
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,800
Yeah, he’s right.

178
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,080
Some research said that the aliens
are actually originated from our Earth,

179
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
they just live in different era.

180
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,000
Maybe he came back from the future?

181
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,800
But let's smooth things
over and talk about vampires.

182
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,560
And... how many species are they?

183
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,440
How can people suddenly turn into a vampire?

184
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,720
From getting their neck bitten?

185
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,240
I don’t know either.

186
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,160
I was born a vampire,
about thousand years ago.

187
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,400
A thousand years old, huh…?

188
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,760
Because my mother married a vampire

189
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,320
so, I was born with vampire blood.

190
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,440
Or maybe, he’s just crazy?

191
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,960
Oh, that’s why you like blood

192
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,120
and hate sun light?

193
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,240
But don’t tell anyone about this.

194
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,320
It’s a secret.

195
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,840
Okay.

196
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,560
It’s a secret.

197
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,960
I won’t tell anyone.

198
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,800
I have to move a lot.

199
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,600
I can’t stay in one place for too long.

200
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,480
The people around me
will grow older over time

201
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,360
but my face will stay the same.

202
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,880
What's your name?

203
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,720
Big brother... Why do you look so young?

204
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,440
I'm really confused.

205
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,000
I have to forever be alone.

206
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:33,080
When I bond with someone,
they will grow old and leave me.

207
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,320
What a story.

208
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,560
He sure did his homework
researching about vampires.

209
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,360
I almost believe it.

210
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,240
And actually,

211
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,040
I just moved here.

212
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,920
What?

213
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
You said you lived here a long time ago.

214
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,920
So, you lie about your rent fee too?

215
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,720
Come on.

216
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,240
It’s because I didn’t know you
enough to share my secret.

217
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,440
But I think we’re friends now

218
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
since you treated me to pork
blood soup with pure intentions.

219
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,720
Just like that?

220
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,400
Oh… Um.

221
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,320
I’m easy going like that.

222
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Maybe because I’m lonely?

223
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,560
I thought I might get along with you.

224
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,120
At first, I was not going to tell you.

225
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,960
Last night, I saw you afraid

226
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,320
and said you don’t like vampires.

227
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,080
Please, don’t tell anyone about this.

228
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,240
I don't like when people come to disturb me.

229
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,600
Except you.

230
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,280
Except me?

231
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,920
I feel special.

232
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,760
Okay, okay. I won’t tell anyone.

233
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,600
Hey, how’s it going?

234
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,520
I think he’s crazy.
You guys must believe me.

235
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
Are there still vampires in the world?

236
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,200
They are.

237
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,160
In the movies.

238
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,320
- Ergh!
- Oh.

239
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,640
See?

240
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:31,880
Then he’s obviously not a vampire
But an alien.

241
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,320
In conclusion, I think our friend might be going crazy too.

242
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,040
He said he’s a vampire, you say he’s an alien.

243
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,200
But you guys must keep it a secret.
Don’t tell anyone.

244
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,400
- Yeah, yeah.
- Um.

245
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

246
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,840
What?

247
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,960
What?

248
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,160
Hey.

249
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
How did Thai vampire be trending right now?
(#ThaiVampire)

250
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,800
What is it?

251
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,720
I think someone died and their
postmortem condition seem very strange.

252
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,600
How strange?

253
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,680
Pale…

254
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,680
Is he a white person?

255
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,880
Luis, that’s not funny.

256
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,520
He was drained of blood

257
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,920
and…

258
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,240
there was a bite mark on his neck.

259
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,920
On the neck?

260
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,720
Here, take a look.

261
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,320
But they blurred the body though.

262
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,240
Maybe they are real.
The vampires.

263
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,600
People are starting to talk about it.

264
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,760
- What do you say?
- Nonsense.

265
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
But this Pun guy that you tell us about,

266
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,400
- didn’t he say he’s a vampire too?
- He was just talking nonsense.

267
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,360
He was just talking nonsense.

268
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,520
Who in their right mind would admit
that they’re a vampire?

269
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,000
Well, Pun did.

270
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,720
But they shouldn’t be real… I guess?

271
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,040
Right? What do you guys think?

272
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,000
But we still believe
in alien life.

273
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,520
How can’t we believe in such a thing then?

274
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,480
And what if it's not real at all,

275
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,080
- like not real at all?
- Well, it could be true, who knows.

276
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,240
- It's not real at all, understand?
- Well, who knows? Maybe...

277
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,320
Let's just imagine...
Humans as the only species in the universe.

278
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,649
Just think about it, the
only ones in the whole galaxy.

279
00:21:28,673 --> 00:21:30,040
Man, why do you always
have to be a buzzkill?

280
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,560
You don’t believe, then
why are you in our gang?

281
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,960
I’m sorry.

282
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,320
That’s true though.
We still believe in alien

283
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,480
so, why can’t vampire exist, right?

284
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,160
Hey.

285
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,720
What?

286
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Hey, the guy who died
was a student in our college.

287
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,960
- Huh?
- Huh?

288
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,680
- It’s means...
- Shit.

289
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,000
It’s means the incident happened close by.

290
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,280
- Please take a look, check.
- Hey.

291
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,040
Then, should be change our
project into finding vampires?

292
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,600
Seems easier to find
than an alien around here.

293
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,600
I’m kidding.

294
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,480
Or should we prove it?

295
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,280
Prove that vampires exist.

296
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,000
Well...

297
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,840
How?

298
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,560
Will...

299
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,040
Will it work?

300
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,320
Vampires are afraid of crucifixes.

301
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,640
Hey, won’t this be dangerous?

302
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,880
But we’ll have to get into his room.

303
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,880
Nah,

304
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,560
Pun seems like… a nice guy.

305
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Why don’t we just wait downstairs?
There are more people.

306
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,680
If something bad happens,
a bystander might help us.

307
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,840
Um.

308
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,360
Motherfucker won’t
listen to your friend at all.

309
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,960
- Yeah… Don’t get your neck sucked in there.
- Yeah.

310
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,440
(407)

311
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,040
Hey!

312
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,800
Erm…

313
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,720
how can I help you?

314
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,520
Do you know this room?

315
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,480
(407)

316
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,320
Hmm?

317
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,480
I saw you just moved in recently. I guess
you don’t know about this room’s history.

318
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,320
Come here... I'll tell you.

319
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,000
Come here...

320
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,320
There are two haunted room in this floor.

321
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,920
The first one is room.

322
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,160
407

323
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,480
No one can stay in that room for long.
They all moved out in 2 or 3 days, at most.

324
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,480
But that guy…

325
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,680
I don’t know how he managed to stay.
Like he doesn’t afraid of ghost at all.

326
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,800
Hmn...

327
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,440
I’m not sure either.

328
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,560
Hey…

329
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
Do you know how they die?

330
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,680
I don’t know

331
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,320
- and I don’t want to know.
- Hey!

332
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,160
It’s okay. I will tell you.

333
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,120
Yeah.

334
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,480
Many years ago, a guy lived there.

335
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,200
He was tall,

336
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,120
looked like a troublemaker.

337
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,680
I saw him bring pretty women
to his room almost every day.

338
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,760
Sometimes he brought young men too.

339
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,000
But nothing happened.

340
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:07,960
Oh!

341
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,360
Until one day...

342
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,600
What day?

343
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,800
He came out of his room alone.

344
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,320
He came out alone?

345
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,880
What’s so weird about that?

346
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,280
Of course, it’s weird.

347
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,520
I have some kind of sense about this.

348
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,840
And it was true as I thought…

349
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,040
What did you see?

350
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,080
He forgot to turn off
the light in his room.

351
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,560
I knew it.
I knew he doesn’t care about saving energy.

352
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,600
Sit down... sit down.

353
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,240
But I’m not done yet.

354
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,280
Sit comfortably. This one is placed here.
Oh, hold it.

355
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,200
You’re wasting my time, aunty.

356
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,880
Give me back 5 minutes of my life.

357
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,760
Relax, young man. Have a seat.

358
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,560
Can you get to the ending?

359
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:41,240
Well, I saw dead body
of a girl lying there.

360
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,560
Huh?

361
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,800
She was pale, motionless.

362
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,280
Don’t tell me that her neck…

363
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,200
I don’t know if it was a
mosquito bite or something.

364
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,960
Yeah.

365
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,280
Be careful, there are
a lot of insects here.

366
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,720
I've already been bitten.

367
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,280
Um.

368
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,360
Can I go now?

369
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,200
Yeah.

370
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,640
Just like what we saw on the news.

371
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,160
Shit! What do we do?
Things are getting too serious, guys.

372
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,120
So,

373
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,960
what do we do now?

374
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,320
Oh, that's it.

375
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,640
The possibility of vampires
being real is now higher than ever.

376
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,120
- Hey!
- What is it?

377
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,880
Yo. Hello! What is it?

378
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,000
Yo. Hello! Did you hear me?

379
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,960
- Erm… Bow… I…
- What is it?

380
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,720
- I found Pun.
- What? Wait, wait.

381
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,400
You don't have to mess around.

382
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,480
- You stay out of it.
- I’ll call you back.

383
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,720
Hey! Yo!

384
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,160
Mr. Pun...

385
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,880
Vampires are afraid of crucifixes.

386
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,840
(412)

387
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,800
Oh! It’s getting cold.

388
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,040
Thank you.

389
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,760
I’m not going to drink from your neck.

390
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,760
Hmm? What?
That’s not what I thought.

391
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,960
I was just feeling cold.

392
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,600
Sure.

393
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:57,080
Oh… so, he wasn’t a vampire.
He’s not afraid of crucifixes.

394
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,160
This is yours?

395
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,240
Erm...

396
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,920
Are you planning to use it against me?

397
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,640
Erm, well...

398
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,320
I thought it’s pretty
so, I bought it for you.

399
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,440
Yes, do you like it?

400
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,040
Can you wear it for me?

401
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,720
Huh?

402
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,320
Go ahead, wear it.

403
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,600
Fine.

404
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,520
Since you bought it for me as a gift.

405
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,080
Right?

406
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,720
Umm.

407
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,440
Your scent... so fragrant.
It's not allergic to pork blood soup.

408
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,480
Hey!

409
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,160
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

410
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,440
Can I sleep here
and smell your scent all night?

411
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,280
Huh?

412
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,320
No! No!

413
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Of course not!

414
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,600
Why not?

415
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,520
Master Yo lives alone too, don't you?

416
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,960
Except... but... that spirit.

417
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,800
Erm, no, no.

418
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I don’t live alone.

419
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,040
Today, my friends and…

420
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,840
Oh, yes, friends.

421
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,360
My sister will come stay with me.

422
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,760
My sister will come to bed soon.

423
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,600
The room was so... full.

424
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,120
Um...

425
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,000
So, maybe next time.

426
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,480
Umm.

427
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,760
Or if you really don’t have
anyone, you can call me.

428
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,280
They will.

429
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,920
They will, they will.
They will be here later.

430
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,200
Oh, you see?

431
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,880
My sister just called.

432
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,520
Yo, how are you doing?

433
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,080
Long time no see.

434
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,200
Jam, where are you right now?

435
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,560
I’m heading home.

436
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,760
Can you come to see me?

437
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,280
Why?

438
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,800
Just come here.

439
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,400
I miss you.

440
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,560
That’s strange but okay.

441
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,640
Yay!

442
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,840
My sister will be here shortly.

443
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,920
Great.

444
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,000
I’ll get to know your family.

445
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,280
Erm...

446
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,120
Come and eat, master Yo.

447
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,720
Thank you so much

448
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,960
for this necklace.

449
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,560
I will treasure this
birthday gift very dearly.

450
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,320
Birthday?

451
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,280
Yes,

452
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,680
today is my birthday, 900 years ago.

453
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:14,360
I have never received any gift like humans
do, and I never spent it with anyone.

454
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,440
Any gift like humans…

455
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,680
For my birthday every year,

456
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,640
I was alone.

457
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,680
So sad.

458
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,280
- ♪Happy birthday to you. ♪
- ♪Happy birthday to you. ♪

459
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,640

460
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,840
Hey, hold on a sec.

461
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,320
You have to make a wish first.

462
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,520
What am I supposed to do?

463
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,320
Well, you make a wish for
yourself or anything, really.

464
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,120
Like,

465
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
may I be happy

466
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,920
and have pork blood soup to eat for
the rest of my life, Something like that.

467
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,560
So, you can only make a wish for yourself?

468
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah.

469
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,600
For anyone around you.

470
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,640
You can wish they have
good pork blood soup too.

471
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,000
Then, I wish...

472
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:34,800
I will live on for a very long time.

473
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,320
With you, Master Yo.

474
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,840
And I wish Master Yo,

475
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,080
Lady Jam, your family,

476
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,800

have delicious pork blood soup to eat for
the rest of everyone's natural life span.

481
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,960
Why pork blood soup though?

482
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,040
Vampire’s favorite...
I mean, Pun’s favorite food.

483
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,800
May you all live long and prosper.

484
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,200

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,080
Why?

489
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,480
Well... your hair is
completely covering your eyes.

490
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,320
Eat now.

491
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,080

- Eat now.

492
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,680
Eat now, eat now.

493
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,680
Not that much.

494
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:53,728
Eat now, eat now.

495
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
And who bought this cake?

496
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,720
I’m the one who bought it myself.
Yo was the one who told me to buy it.

497
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,840
- Really?
- Yes.

498
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,280
