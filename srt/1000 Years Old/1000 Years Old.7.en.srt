(bowie)

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,840
It was around the same time as…
When Pun disappeared.

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,840
That can only mean…

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,040
What should I do?

31
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,840
Should I go back to my room and
face the ghost? That can’t be good either.

32
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,920
No! No! Don’t bite my neck!

33
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,720
What am I supposed to do?

34
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,200
Yeah, you’re right.

35
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,320
All of a sudden, I feel scared now.

36
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,520
I’m scared too. It’s
happened so close to us.

37
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,800
What if the killer on the
news is actually Pun?

38
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,040
Pun?

39
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,000
Do you think it was him?

40
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,560
Can you come see me?

41
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,800
I’m out of town but I’ll be back asap.

42
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,960
The important thing is
you should go back to your old house.

43
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,440
But… I have to hang my clothes first.

44
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,840
Oi! Get the hell out right now.
You can hang your clothes at your house.

45
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,440
Get out right now. Don’t
hesitate. I’m begging you.

46
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
What happened to you, Yoh?

47
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,320
Suddenly, you came home.

48
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,000
I mean…

49
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,200
I miss home.

50
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,480
You finally saw the ghost in your room?

51
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,440
Huh? No.

52
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,800
Thai vampire?

53
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,640
So? What about it?

54
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,440
You believe in it? Or you just scared?

55
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,040
I have a suspicion that…

56
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,000
Pun might be the one
who drained the woman on the news.

57
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,560
Come on, Yoh.

58
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,360
You are out of your mind.

59
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,840
How can it be Pun?

60
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,600
Don’t tell me you believe that.

61
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,920
You believe that Pun really is a vampire?

62
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
Pun really is a vampire.

63
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,680
He said it himself. Everyone knows that.

64
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,160
Yoh. Vampires aren’t real.

65
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,440
They are real.

66
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,400
But have you ever seen Pun eat blood…

67
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,400
I mean, suck blood from someone’s neck?

68
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,880
The only blood Pun eats is pork blood soup.

69
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,600
But I think… Pun is the same vampire.

70
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,560
Because...

71
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,840
he likes to say…

72
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,880
I smell good.

73
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,520
Huh?

74
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:25,320
And… he likes to put his
nose close to my neck.

75
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,920
Huh?

76
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,840
It’s true.

77
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,880
So sweet.

78
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,360
Huh?

79
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,720
Pun is hitting on you. Can’t you tell?

80
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,640
Huh?

81
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,800
That’s right.

82
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,480
We have schedule to shoot
our vampire educational video.

83
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,160
Where is Mr. Pun, anyway?
He hasn’t show up yet.

84
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,480
I don’t know either.

85
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,680
Should we call him?

86
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,640
Pun doesn’t use phone.

87
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,080
I think there is something strange.

88
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,280
What strange, Shin?

89
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,120
Mr. Pun has been acting weird lately.

90
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,640
Come on. Pun has been weird from the start.

91
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,720
What the hell is he doing?

92
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
That costume…

93
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,720
Alien?

94
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,960
I will be an alien for you.

95
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,880
Why don’t you wear vampire costume?

96
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,920
I want to be an alien.

97
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,520
What’s up with him?

98
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,280
It’s cool in a way.

99
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,560
He was mad at me just yesterday.

100
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,280
Now, he’s smiling?

101
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,160
I can’t read him at all.

102
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Alien?

103
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,120
Wait. Is he trying...

104
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,320
Pretending he’s not a vampire

105
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,520
because of last night…
Is it? I think it is.

106
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,920
Hey, Jam.

107
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,320
- What are you doing?
- Put this on. Trust me.

108
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,560
I don’t want it. It’s hot.

109
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,400
It’s not hot.

110
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,120
- Just put it on.
- But I’m hot.

111
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,000
- Just put it on. Come on.
- No.

112
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,480
- Does master Yoh hates vampire
- But I’m hot.

113
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,360
and scared of me that much?

114
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,080
But it’s hot.

115
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,320
Just wear it. See? We match.

116
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,760
- I don’t wanna, Yoh.
- Alright!

117
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,320
Let’s get started, shall we?

118
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,400
Come on, Yoh. Let’s get to work.

119
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,680
Yeah.

120
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,600
You really can’t tell, aren’t you?

121
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,040
Or you’re just playing stupid?

122
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,560
Huh?

123
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,040
Pun knows that you love alien.

124
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,280
He’s trying to be the thing you love.

125
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,720
He’s hitting on you.

126
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,840
I’m just an outsider and even I know that.

127
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,040
You don’t have to be scared of Pun.

128
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,480
A guy like Pun would never
harm someone he loves.

129
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,440
Come on.

130
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,720
Let’s rehearse.

131
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,000
Let’s go, Pun.

132
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,800
Have you come again?

133
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,200
Already eaten here.

134
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,280
You acted so stiff as usual, Pun.

135
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,280
I'm not a vampire.

136
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,400
Well, I acted as an alien.

137
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,360
I was playing as an alien.

138
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,160
Master alien should
be stiff, just like that.

139
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,640
Yeah.

140
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,400
- It fits the role.
- You can ask.

141
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,120
What about when red-headed pig can’t act?

142
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,120
Why didn’t lady Kamsai comment about him?

143
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,480
Let’s get ready to open our restaurant.

144
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,560
Just wait and see.

145
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,080
If this clip doesn’t go viral,

146
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,600
I will change my hair color.

147
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,640
Come on. It should go viral.

148
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,600
The first one did so
well. Don’t talk ridiculous.

149
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,040
I’ll go help them prepare the restaurant.

150
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,760
You two can start flirting with each other.

151
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,800
Huh?

152
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,760
What? Hey?

153
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,480
Why are you scared of me, master Yoh?

154
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,600
I’m not. I’m not scared.

155
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,720
You really don’t like vampire, do you?

156
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,240
No. It’s not that I don’t like them.

157
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,840
If you can’t open your mind to vampire…

158
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,160
Then, I will become
an alien, which you like.

159
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,480
Er...

160
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,920
Hey. You don’t have to do that.

161
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,760
I have made my decision.

162
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,000
I will do it for you.

163
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,480
Stop being a vampire for a lifetime,

164
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,040
I’m not gonna die.

165
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,920
I don’t want to be a vampire either.

166
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
Do you still have any resentment toward me?

167
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Erm… I mean…

168
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
I mean…

169
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
About last night…

170
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,240
Where have you gone?

171
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,200
Last night?

172
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,200
I was sleeping with you, master Yoh.

173
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,280
No, I mean…

174
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
Before that.

175
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Did you notice that I…

176
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,280
Huh? Is this for real?

177
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,920
- I didn’t mean to.
- Erm…

178
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,400
Pun!

179
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,920
Erm…

180
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,240
How could you do that?

181
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,760
What happened, Yoh?

182
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,440
Hey.

183
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,200
What’s wrong, master Yoh?

184
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,640
Pun.

185
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,840
Please don’t hurt us.

186
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,560
Hurt you?

187
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,320
Don’t… Don’t drink our blood.

188
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,240
Drink blood?

189
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,400
I thought you said you’re a nice vampire.

190
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,840
What kind of nice vampire
would kill a person?

191
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,080
- Kill?!
- Kill?!

192
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,920
Yoh!

193
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,480
Turn yourself in, Pun.

194
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,360
It’s not too late to turn back.

195
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,920
How can I turn myself in, master Yoh?

196
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,200
You should confess to the police.

197
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,480
Serve your sentence like human.

198
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,640
What are you talking about?

199
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,080
I’m telling the truth, Jam.

200
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,480
I mean, if Pun is a nice
vampire like he said he is…

201
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,680
He should feel guilty.

202
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,800
And… he should obey by the same law.

203
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,400
I’m so confused right now.

204
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,280
What do I have to do to make you happy?

205
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,480
I have something to
confess, master officer.

206
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,200
I am a vampire.

207
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,280
Not that one.

208
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,280
And.. What do I have to do next?

209
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,680
Confess what happened last night?

210
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,120
Hurry up!

211
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
You want me to tell master officer?

212
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,960
I can talk to you.

213
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,280
Tell everything to police officer.

214
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,280
I mean I…

215
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,520
Last night, I…

216
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,800
I was the one who knocked
on master Yoh’s door.

217
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,320
I admit it.

218
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,800
Huh?

219
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,000
Who is that?

220
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,520
Is that you, Pun?

221
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,560
I just…

222
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,440
I just want you to invite
me for a sleepover.

223
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Hold on a sec. Hold on a sec.

224
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,840
We need to clear that up.

225
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,520
How could you prank me like that?

226
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,240
But the point is,

227
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,040
last night when you disappeared…

228
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,520
Where have you been?

229
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,360
You mean before that?

230
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,040
Yeah. Since late evening.

231
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,400
I…

232
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,280
I didn’t go anywhere.

233
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,160
I was there, feeling lonely,

234
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,120
with master Tuiye in my room.

235
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,760
What did you say?

236
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,040
I didn’t go out anywhere, master Yoh.

237
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,600
What about when I came
knocking at your room?

238
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,160
Why didn’t you open the door?

239
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,000
Where has he gone?

240
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,600
Master Yoh really doesn't like…

241
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,080
Or care about a vampire like me.

242
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,280
I’m so sad, master Tuiye.

243
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,920
I’m mad at master Yoh.

244
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,360
I won’t be seeing master Yoh for a while.

245
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,920
Maybe 10 minutes.

246
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,200
Then, I’ll go see him.

247
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,920
Who would pay attention to that vampire?

248
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,960
Urgh! No one.

249
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,200
You know what my brain only cares about.

250
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,800
How would I know that? I thought you
changed your mind and went after a vampire.

251
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,880
I’m not interested in something like that.

252
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,880
I’m so miserable.

253
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,040
I want to cry.

254
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,880
Master Yoh loves aliens.

255
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,280
Master Yoh might not like me at all…

256
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,560
Even though, I want master Yoh to like me.

257
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,160
But master Yoh likes master alien.

258
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,440
Can I cry now, master Tuiye?

259
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
Master Yoh loves aliens.

260
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,240
When will master Yoh love me?

261
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,440
I was crying like that, master Yoh.

262
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,160
And I was rolling on the floor.

263
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,960
Then, master Tuiye ran away from me.

264
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,600
I was crawling after Tuiye…

265
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,240
Because I was so lonely.

266
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,720
I was so sad.

267
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,560
I was so alone.

268
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,080
I was hungry for pork blood soup.

269
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
Don’t tell me you were in
your room the whole time?

270
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,000
Why didn’t you open the door?

271
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,400
Come on!

272
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,160
Erm… Mr. officer.

273
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,000
It seems to be a little misunderstanding.

274
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,400
Anyway, I’ll see my way out.

275
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,320
I won’t be wasting your
valuable time anymore.

276
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,880
Goodbye.

277
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:55,920
Come on.

278
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,920
- Let’s go. Hurry.
- Erm...

279
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,920
Hurry.

280
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,440
We need to talk.

281
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,400
Come on.

282
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,520
I’m so sorry.

283
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,840
This way.

284
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Talk to me.

285
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,280
So, you didn’t go out to
suck someone’s blood?

286
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,840
Suck some blood?

287
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,880
Yeah.

288
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,400
I don’t fancy sucking blood.

289
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,400
I don’t have straw.

290
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,240
See, Yoh? I told you.

291
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,640
You’re overreacted.

292
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,800
Make a fuss over nothing.

293
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,560
What happened?

294
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,120
- It’s Yoh. He thought...
- Hey.

295
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,440
What now, Yoh?

296
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
There’s nothing now.
You don’t need to tell him.

297
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,800
There’s nothing, really.

298
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,760
There’s nothing now.

299
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,120
You’re not mad at me?

300
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,800
You’re not scared of me anymore?

301
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,520
Erm…

302
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,720
I did what you told me to do.

303
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,720
I confessed with master officer.

304
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,880
Great. Very great.

305
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,160
I’m cool now.

306
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,640
Um.

307
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
I’m very glad.

308
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,560
I’m glad too.

309
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,080
So… Why did you get mad at me?

310
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,520
Because you don’t like vampires.

311
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,200
When did I tell you that I don’t like it?

312
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,480
You told your friend, master Yoh.

313
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,200
Hmm?

314
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,040
I told my friend?

315
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,360
I overheard everything.

316
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,160
Oh…

317
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,520
you mean what I told Pakwan?

318
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,400
Yes. Lady Pakwan.

319
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,960
I’m sorry.

320
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,320
It’s fine.

321
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,240
It’s your feelings.

322
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,560
You can think whatever you like.

323
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,320
My feelings?

324
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,160
What is it, anyway?

325
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,720
To be frank,

326
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,760
Did I grow more and more
interested in vampires now?

327
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,600
Because of Pun,

328
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,400
I almost forgot all about alien.

329
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,680
Don’t be worry, master Yoh.

330
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,160
I can be whatever you like.

331
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,280
I’ll be an alien.

332
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,760
Yeah. I like alien.

333
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,320
I like the alien today.

334
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,560
A while ago, you were afraid of vampire
biting your neck, my brother.

335
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,920
My brother.

336
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,120
Just laying down and see
master Yoh's face like this…

337
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,920
It’s enough to make an alien like me happy.

338
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,560
Hot! Hot! Hot!

339
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,000
Ouch! I'm hot.

340
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,640
Pun? What’s wrong?

341
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,480
I’m burning.

342
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,120
The sun hurts my skin.

343
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,320
I don’t like heat.

344
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,800
Ouch! Hot! Hot! Hot!

345
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,160
Ouch! Hot! Hot! Hot!

346
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,680
Hot! I’m burning!

347
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,960
The sun hurts my skin.

348
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,320
Ouch! Hot! Hot! Hot!

349
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,000
Are you mocking me, master Yoh?

350
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,240
Nope. I’m hot.

351
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,320
Ouch! Hot! Hot! Hot!

352
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,760
Ouch! Hot! Hot! Hot!

353
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,480
I don’t like heat. It hurts my skin.

354
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,080
I like ice.

355
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,520
I like cold weather.

356
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,480
Ouch! Hot! Hot! Hot!
Can you turn on the fan for me?

357
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Open an umbrella for me too.

358
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,880
Ouch! Hot!

359
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,400
Don’t forget you’re an alien now.

360
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,800
You can’t fear the sun like vampire do.

361
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,640
You’re a terrible human.

362
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,480
You like to mock me.

363
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,440
Ouch! Hot! Hot! Hot!

364
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,280
- Hot! Hot! Hot!
- I’m heading off now.

365
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,640
You guys playing with each other and don’t
care for anyone. It’s like I’m a ghost here.

366
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,920
Wait. Do you need help with that?

367
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Don’t be.

368
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,000
You want me to go with you?

369
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,200
Can I… go with you?

370
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,520
What?

371
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,240
Wait. I’m coming with you.

372
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,960
Wait for me.

373
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,880
I’m coming too.

374
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,160
I want to soak in cold water.

375
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,840
Good morning, master Yoh.

376
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,080
Why are you saying that now?

377
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,600
You only said that to Yoh and not me, Pun.

378
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,120
That’s kinda weird, isn’t it?

379
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,960
Which color, master Tuiye?

380
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,560
I’m going on a date with master Yoh.

381
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,240
Janja?

382
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,400
I miss you so much.

383
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,680
I smell a pet.

384
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,080
This...

385
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,640
Are you still keeping a cat?

386
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,400
Do not touch my belongings.

387
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,800
Your belongings?

388
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,440
Does that include…

389
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,000
The human in that room too?

390
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,440
Janja.

391
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,400
Hello, Yoh.

392
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,720
Oh,

393
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,640
you’re living here too?

394
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,840
Yeah. That’s right.

395
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,240
This is Janja, my friend from class.

396
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,040
Erm… Do you two known each other?

397
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,040
Yeah.

398
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,040
The two of us go way back.

399
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,760
Way… way back.

400
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,600
For many hundreds of years.

401
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,160
Woah!

402
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,240
Small world, isn’t it?

403
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
By the way, I have to go now.

404
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,600
I’ll go grab something
to eat with my sister.

405
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,560
See you later.

406
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,000
I thought you said you’re
gonna invite Pun with us.

407
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,560
I think he’s busy right now.

408
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,880
It’s okay.

409
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,400
We can go, just the two of us.

410
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,200
Is that woman really your friend?

411
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,320
Yeah. Why?

412
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,160
Nothing. It’s just, she
seems to be close to Pun.

413
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,440
Forget about her.

414
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,360
Right when it’s about to get somewhere.

415
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,520
What was that?

416
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,680
Are you gonna be okay about that?

417
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,880
Why would I not be okay?

418
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,760
Keep fighting.

419
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,040
What are you talking about?

420
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,440
Where has everyone gone?

421
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,240
I went to knock on his door.
All I heard was Tuiye.

422
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,320
Maybe they snuck out for a date?

423
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,640
Just the two of them.

424
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,560
It is paid.

425
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,920
Show me the receipt then.

426
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,400
I’m kidding.

427
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,920
Thank you so much.
Feel free to come again.

428
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,120
Please have a seat.

429
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,920
Welcome to All Hail Pork Blood Soup.

430
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,480
Would you like our standard set?
One soup plus rice.

431
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,520
- Yes, 1 please.
- There you go.

432
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,360
Boil one and rice, please.

433
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,840
We don’t sell porridge here, Shin.

434
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,200
I mean boil one soup and serve with rice.

435
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,960
Our secret code.

436
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,120
Okay.

437
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,120
Our place has been quiet lately.

438
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,520
It’s not as popular as before.

439
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,440
Back when we release the first episode.

440
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,480
Did Yoh upload the video clip yet?

441
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,120
He did.

442
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,200
What about the view count?

443
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,160
Hasn’t move at all.

444
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,840
So, when will you change your hair color?

445
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,240
That’s too much.

446
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,800
Give our customer's a full stomach.

447
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,920
Which color will you change it to be?

448
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,200
Colorful.

449
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,240
Hah!

450
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,440
Not funny.

451
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,560
Hah!

452
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,760
I’m not telling the joke yet.

453
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,600
Enough.

454
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,200
So, which color will it be?

455
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,640
I’ll think about it later. I didn’t think
I would have to go through with it.

456
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,400
I thought we would have many views.

457
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,080
But alas…

458
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,160
You have to keep your promise, Shin.

459
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,080
Sure things.

460
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,520
Okay. I’ll wait and see.

461
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,680
Why don’t you get inside the house?

462
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,400
♪ Fly, Fly, Fly up high. Fly up in the air. ♪

463
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,560

Erm… I…

467
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,000
I feel bad for Pun.

468
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,120
I thought he is a bad guy…

469
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,040
I even thought that he
might have hurt someone.

470
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
I’m so terrible.

471
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,160
I’ve been with him for quite some time…

472
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,720
But I still don’t trust him.

473
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,320
Even though,

474
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,880
Pun trusted me.

475
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,000
Pun is a nice guy, I can tell.

476
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,160
Yeah,

477
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,440
he’s a good vampire.

478
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,320
Hypothetically, Jam…

479
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,720
What If Pun turns out to be a real vampire?

480
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,560
No, it’s not that.

481
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,480
I mean, to tell you the truth…
I already believe that he is a vampire.

482
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,800
Even though, it’s hard to believe.

483
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,600
If Pun really is a vampire…

484
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,120
It means vampire are not
as scary as we’ve been told.

485
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,160
A vampire like Pun is really cool.

486
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,880
He eats pork blood,

487
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,880
opened a pork blood soup place.

488
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,480
A vampire with a dream.

489
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,720
He has feelings.

490
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,960
He is kind.

491
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,400
He’s just like human.

492
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,760
Pun the vampire. That’s so cool.

493
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,440
You’re right.

494
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,560
You have no reason to fear him.

495
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,520
That might be true.

496
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,600
Have you ever seen a living alien?

497
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,560
So you don’t go UFO hunting in
the countryside like you did before?

498
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,800
Um. Nope.

499
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,600
Yoh.

500
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,120
Huh?

501
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,920
What’s in your heart right now?

502
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,120
Alien or vampire?

503
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,040
Alien or a vampire?
