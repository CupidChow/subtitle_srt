[The Story of Xing Fu]

00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,760
Mr. Xie,

4
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,519
we are in a rural area

5
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
so don't mind the simple dishes.

6
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,239
If they are not to your liking

7
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,519
and you prefer a more elaborate setup,

8
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,879
we can go to another place.

9
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,079
Didn't I ask you to tell your sister

10
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,920
to prepare the most expensive meal
she can afford?

11
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:10,680
Is this it?

12
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,319
I did tell her.

13
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,359
Mr. Xie,

14
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,400
my sister told me

15
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,240
that you're a VIP

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,159
and asked me

17
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,560
to prepare the most expensive dishes

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,439
for you.

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,840
The dishes here

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,080
represent the local specialties

21
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,479
and all ingredients

22
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,800
are locally sourced.

23
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,360
They are fresh

24
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,319
and healthy.

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,680
This is the most expensive meal we offer here.

26
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,759
Although

27
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,879
they are simple,

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,439
a greatness

29
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,360
hides within.

30
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,120
We put a lot of effort into it.

31
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,599
Why don't you give them a taste first?

32
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:41,879
Yes.

33
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,520
Mr. Xie.

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,080
Come.

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,719
Pick up the chopsticks

36
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,280
and try some.

37
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,319
What vegetable is this?

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,599
Shepherd's Purse.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,719
Shepherd's Purse?

40
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,479
It's not like the ones I used to eat.

41
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,759
This is wild Shepherd's Purse.

42
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,840
I harvested it

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,599
from the mountain half an hour ago.

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,719
I even have a photo of the harvest.

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,759
Do you want to have a look?

46
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,840
If you don't believe it,

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,479
I can bring you to the mountain.

48
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,159
We can eat it

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
as we harvest it.

50
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,319
Am I a bunny now?

51
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,960
How humorous of you, Mr. Xie.

52
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,680
I'm the owner here.

53
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,639
Let me know if you need anything.

54
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,000
Enjoy the meal

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,639
and take your time.

56
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,120
Where is the wine?

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
What are we drinking today?

58
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,919
The wine we brew ourselves, of course.

59
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,520
Sure.

60
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,719
I will adapt.

61
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,639
Okay.

62
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,400
Mr. Xie,

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,199
Mr. Wan arranged

64
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,000
for you an organic and natural meal

65
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,479
to thank you for your hard work

66
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,400
on our products

67
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,840
in the five southern provinces

68
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,520
all these years.

69
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,840
Hold on.

70
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,800
I'll be frank.

71
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,879
I know

72
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,280
this meal

73
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,400
is a meal with an agenda.

74
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,199
The dishes are good,

75
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,280
and so is the wine.

76
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,039
But

77
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,240
I truly have no money.

78
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,639
I know

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,759
what you're trying to do.

80
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,960
You even brought

81
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,439
a beautiful lawyer with you.

82
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,080
This is the calm

83
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,599
before the storm.

84
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:18,520
I have experienced

85
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,240
the calm part.

86
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,080
Now, tell me the storm

87
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,520
you're brewing.

88
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:23,960
Two things.

89
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,199
First,

90
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,600
her look has nothing to do with you.

91
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,439
It's my business.

92
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
She's just a lawyer. That's all.

93
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
And secondly,

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,879
you have to settle

95
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,040
the payment one way or another.

96
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,040
If you won't give me the money back,

97
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,600
my father will give me a hard time.

98
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,879
If that happens,

99
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,959
I'll give everyone a hard time.

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,759
What does that

101
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,279
have anything to do with me?

102
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
I'm in a rough patch too.

103
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,600
I do not doubt your product quality

104
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,319
but they are not in high demand.

105
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,120
The consumers don't want it.

106
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,480
Since the customers aren't paying me,

107
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,160
I can't settle the payment with you.

108
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,120
Low sales are not my problem!

109
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,600
What did our contract say?

110
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,040
Mr. Xie,

111
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,920
the contract mentioned clearly

112
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,759
that you're in charge
of product promotion and visibility.

113
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,720
It's not our responsibility.

114
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,959
Using this excuse

115
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,319
to default on a payment

116
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,720
is illegal.

117
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,519
If you want to talk about laws today,

118
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,519
then let's end it here.

119
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,600
Just start the legal proceedings.

120
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,519
Bring me to court.

121
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,519
Calm down.

122
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,519
Mr. Xie,

123
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,399
you've totally

124
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
misunderstood

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,120
what Ms. He was trying to say.

126
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,240
Initially,

127
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,199
we both

128
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,439
agreed

129
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,079
that our responsibility

130
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,360
was to produce

131
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,879
the best product for the consumers.

132
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,160
Right?

133
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,519
And you know

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
the quality is good.

135
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,959
However,

136
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,079
promotion

137
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:45,839
and visibility

138
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,680
are not our expertise.

139
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,519
You're the expert here.

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,319
If you don't know what went wrong,

141
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,040
what else

142
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,959
should we do then?

143
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,600
I have already launched marketing campaigns,

144
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,399
but to no avail.

145
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,560
The consumers are not enticed.

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,360
Truth be told,

147
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,399
I have no money at the moment.

148
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,040
Mr. Xie.

149
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,240
Wow.

150
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,160
I notice that long scar on your head.

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,519
I'm sure that means you have seen
the seedy side of society.

152
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,600
And you have

153
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:28,879
the audacity to come here.

154
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,800
You're in my territory.

155
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,199
Fine.

156
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,759
No need to start the legal proceedings.

157
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,160
Today,

158
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,639
eat well and drink well.

159
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,079
Have your last meal

160
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:38,839
and find

161
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,759
yourself

162
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,360
a beautiful spot.

163
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,000
I will dig a hole to bury you.

164
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,199
I can show my face here

165
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,199
because I know you can't make a scene.

166
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,160
Wan Chuanjia.

167
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,160
What are you doing?

168
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,480
Why are you smashing my things?

169
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,079
Fine.

170
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,879
If you want to eat, eat.

171
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,959
If not, go back home.

172
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,040
Do not throw tantrums here.

173
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,399
Don't they say friendliness
is conducive to business success?

174
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:13,839
Why are you

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,839
arguing?

176
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,680
Right.

177
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,560
Friendliness is conducive to business success.

178
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,480
Mr. Xie,

179
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,879
friendliness is conducive to business success.

180
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,879
This is the local wine.

181
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:22,680
Come,

182
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,120
Ms. He.

183
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,680
What?

184
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,199
They

185
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,720
shouldn't drink.

186
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm here.

187
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,720
Don't worry.

188
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,240
Mr. Xie.

189
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,519
Enjoy the stunning view

190
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,720
and the good wine.

191
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,680
Oh, the scent.

192
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,720
Try some.

193
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,519
Mr. Xie,

194
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,720
to be honest,

195
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,920
please understand Mr. Wan's situation.

196
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,079
You haven't seen his father.

197
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,959
He's tough on Mr. Wan.

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,879
Let's talk.

199
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Everything can be solved.

200
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,160
You know what?

201
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,199
Let's have a toast.

202
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,199
Come,

203
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,720
Mr. Xie.

204
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,639
Here's a toast to you.

205
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,920
It's okay.

206
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,279
I'll drink up first.

207
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,519
Sorry for what just happened.

208
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,839
Mr. Xie,

209
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,759
I have

210
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,519
a bad temper.

211
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,319
If I

212
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,399
behaved

213
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,240
irrationally just now,

214
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,680
I beg your pardon.

215
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:37,639
If you put it that way,

216
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,879
then we can continue talking.

217
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,480
I don't want you to go bankrupt either.

218
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,480
If you're done for,

219
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,320
so will I.

220
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,279
I came here

221
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,200
to figure out

222
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,720
a solution with you guys.

223
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,200
Perhaps

224
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,039
we might get inspired.

225
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,360
Exactly.

226
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,519
This wine

227
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,720
is delicious.

228
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,919
Right?

229
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,200
It was brewed with the spring water.

230
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,679
When you just arrived,

231
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,720
there was

232
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,000
a water assessment report by the entrance.

233
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,519
It says

234
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,840
that the water here

235
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,679
contains more than 20 minerals.

236
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,639
It's all-natural mineral water.

237
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,720
Is that so?

238
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,600
I can find a heap

239
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,159
of those reports anywhere.

240
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,879
It's real, of course.

241
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,440
We spent more than 7,000 yuan

242
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,519
on that report.

243
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,000
Also, why should I die?

244
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,240
If you don't trust me,

245
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,919
you can hire

246
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,279
a professional team

247
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,440
and test the water.

248
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,120
Mother Nature will not lie.

249
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,480
Mother Nature will not lie.

250
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Well said.

251
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,759
Perhaps

252
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,279
this is our breakthrough.

253
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,080
It is also a good slogan.

254
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,159
I will draw up a plan with it

255
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,000
after going back.

256
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,559
Maybe

257
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,159
it can boost

258
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,000
our sales.

259
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,639
As expected of an expert.

260
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,360
So astute.

261
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,559
Ms. He,

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,879
a toast to you.

263
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,480
Thank you

264
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,120
for inspiring me.

265
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,519
You know what?

266
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,080
To thank you,

267
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,799
I'll bring my team here

268
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,200
at the end of the year for the annual reunion.

269
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,320
What do you think?

270
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,440
I...

271
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:14,840
Sure,

272
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,679
no problem.

273
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,200
But one thing has to be clear.

274
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,279
Yes?

275
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,840
We are a small business.

276
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,679
So no deferred payment.

277
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,720
Of course.

278
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,639
Perhaps I'll mention your inn

279
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,000
when I'm promoting those healthcare products.

280
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,159
Mr. Xie,

281
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,080
we count on you

282
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,960
for the payment.

283
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,279
-Sure.
-Come.

284
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,960
Let's have a toast together.

285
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,919
Come.

286
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,440
Come.

287
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,879
Here.

288
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,480
Come on.

289
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,919
Mr. Wan.

290
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,000
Nice to meet you.

291
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,240
Xiuyu.

292
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,879
-You're back.
-Did you manage to register for the exam?

293
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,639
I'm asking you.

294
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:56,960
I didn't.

295
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,200
You didn't?

296
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,320
What do you mean?

297
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
I couldn't verify myself within the system.

298
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,679
Xiuyu.

299
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,440
You aim too high.

300
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Maybe you're not meant to take the exam.

301
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,759
Just accept it.

302
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,919
You're a girl.

303
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,279
Stop having an unrealistic dream.

304
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:14,919
You'll wear yourself out.

305
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,519
You have earned good money anyway.

306
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,200
Find a good husband.

307
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,440
That's your priority.

308
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,720
Didn't you say

309
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,440
that you

310
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,879
couldn't register online

311
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,279
so you would check on-site?

312
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,279
So what happened?

313
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,480
I checked with my ID number

314
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,639
but it said duplicate registration.

315
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,480
I couldn't register back then

316
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,759
and now, the system

317
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,200
doesn't have my registration record.

318
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,039
Duplicate registration?

319
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:41,919
See?

320
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,799
Xiuyu,

321
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,799
I'll be frank.

322
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,559
You're careless

323
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,120
so you must have messed up somewhere.

324
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,759
It's like your National College Entrance Exam.

325
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,879
You thought you aced it

326
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,480
but...

327
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,720
Perhaps

328
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,120
we can ask Qingzhi?

329
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,799
He works for the government

330
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,039
so he can ask around.

331
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,159
Exactly.

332
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,720
That's easy.

333
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,200
I have a friend working for the Ministry
of Human Resources and Social Security.

334
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,440
I'll ask him to help

335
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
when I go to work tomorrow.

336
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,679
Calm down, Xiuyu.

337
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,320
Perhaps

338
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,399
it's a system error.

339
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,759
I'll ask him to check

340
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,759
tomorrow.

341
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,080
The rain in the mountain can appear so abruptly.

342
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,879
It's so heavy.

343
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,720
Don't worry.

344
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,759
Everything will be prepared.

345
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,200
Sure.

346
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,399
Oh, dear.

347
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,559
What a horrible path.

348
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,320
It's so muddy.

349
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,039
Mr. Wu.

350
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,879
Where were you?

351
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,759
I was looking for inspiration

352
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,440
but then heavy rain descended on me.

353
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,600

00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,770
Oh, no.

531
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:47,740
My child.

532
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,770
Don't touch me!

533
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,260
What's the matter?

534
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,940
Come at me! Come at me!

535
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,290
What's going on?

536
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,020
Why?

537
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,500
They have no right.

538
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,850
Absolutely no right!

539
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,460
How can this be?

540
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,370
What happened?

541
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,290
Who took advantage of you?

542
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,260
Tell us.

543
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,700
I checked the answers afterward.

544
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,290
I aced them.

545
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,370
What?

546
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,370
What answers?

547
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,130
Tell us.

548
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,460
Explain, my dear. What happened?

549
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,570
-Speak slowly.
-When she came out,

550
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,700
I even consoled her.

551
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,660
Who?

552
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,770
What are you on about?

553
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,460
Calm down. Don't...

554
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,130
All this time, you were pretending.

555
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,370
Ten years.

556
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,900
For ten years,

557
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,570
I couldn't get over it.

558
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,260
What, my child?

559
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,290
Can you please explain it more clearly?

560
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,220
I felt guilty.

561
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,260
I thought I was a disgrace.

562
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,810
-Who?
-Who exactly are you talking about?

563
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,500
Why?

564
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,660
What happened?

565
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,610
Don't cry, my child.

566
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,050
-Tell us what happened?
-Tell us.

567
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,940
I passed it.

568
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,660
You passed it?

569
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,500
-Passed what?
-What?

570
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,020
I passed it.

571
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,180
Tell us, what exactly is going on?

572
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,740
You mean the accounting certification?

573
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,180
Passed what?

574
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,420
No!

575
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,260
Then what?

576
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
I got accepted into a university.

577
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,290
You did?

578
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:52,810
Wait.

579
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,810
Ten years ago, you failed.

580
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,900
I did pass the exam.

581
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,290
But someone took my spot.

582
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,460
Someone took your spot?

583
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,220
-How is that possible?
-Who took your spot?

584
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,330
Who did?

585
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,610
Wan Chuanmei.

586
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,660
Wan...

587
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,700
Wan Chuanmei took my name.

588
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,660
Chuanmei?

589
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,460
So many people got accepted.

590
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Why did she have to take your name?

591
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,810
How am I supposed to know?

592
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,020
She just had to take my name.

593
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,770
She did it

594
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,130
because we aren't an established family here.

595
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,610
Because our surname is Wang and not Wan here.

596
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,290
This is outrageous.

597
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,370
Unacceptable.

598
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,610
Are you telling the truth?

599
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,610
Why would I lie to you?

600
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,570
Qingzhi

601
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,660
told me everything.

602
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,020
I'm done with this.

603
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,570
I will fight them with my life.

604
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,500
Dear.

605
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,020
Xiuyu.

606
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,500
Wan Chuanmei,

607
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,810
you're cruel!

608
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,090
Oh, why did this happen?

609
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,770
Why do they always do this to us?

610
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,700
This is serious.

611
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,500
It's about her life.

612
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,940
Why our family?

613
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,740
If you're not good enough, don't go to university.

614
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,460
Why take Xiuyu's spot?

615
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,290
Oh, Xiuyu.

616
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,330
You ruined

617
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,810
my daughter's life.

618
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,020
So unfair.

619
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,050
This is so unfair.

620
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,260
She should be punished.

621
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,940
Bad karma will arrive.

622
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,180
Why would she do that?

623
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,020
It's all my fault.

624
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,050
I'm meek.

625
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,370
I was bullied

626
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,460
and my children will have to be bullied.

627
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,660
Oh, this painful life.

628
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,500
Dad!

629
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,660
Dad!

630
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,090
Why are you hitting yourself?

631
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,180
I'm useless.

632
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,500
So useless.

633
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,090
Mom.

634
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,660
This is not right.

635
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,090
I'm telling you.

636
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,090
If you do not seek justice for me,

637
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,940
if you do not sort this out,

638
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,290
I...

639
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,090
I'll die today.

640
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,420
I'll die in front of their home.

641
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,570
They have to pay for it.

642
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,570
We are here for you.

643
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,700
It's okay, Xiuyu.

644
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,900
It's not the end of the world.

645
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:03,850
There, there.

646
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,180
Xiuyu.

647
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,700
Xiuyu, listen to me.

648
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,130
Mom is here.

649
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,290
I will not let this slide.

650
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,050
You hear me?

651
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,570
You hear me?

652
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,050
Call Qinglai now.

653
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,370
-Ask him to come back.
-Okay.

654
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,460
I'll call him.

655
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,810
I'll call him.

656
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,290
It's okay.

657
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,530
We're still alive. We'll sort this out.

658
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,370
Dad.

659
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,330
Eh?

660
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,500
Eh?

661
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,500
Dad.

662
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,660
Chuanmei.

663
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,260
Am I dreaming?

664
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,660
I thought I was dreaming.

665
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,420
Why are you back?

666
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,090
Come.

667
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,090
Sit down.

668
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,330
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

669
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,090
Oh, my.

670
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,130
I'm so happy.

671
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,700
Look at you.

672
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,130
Not bad, you two.

673
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,770
Wonderful.

674
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,660
My baby daughter.

675
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,420
My dear.

676
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,020
-You lost weight.
-Dad.

677
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,130
What happened?

678
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,610
Are you too happy to see me?

679
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,900
It's all right.

680
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,130
It's okay.

681
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,370
Save me, Dad.

682
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,020
What's the matter?

683
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,810
What happened?

684
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,090
Don't cry.

685
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:14,660
Tell me.

686
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,700
What happened?

687
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,330
What's going on?

688
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,530
There, there.

689
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,130
My child.

690
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,330
Tell me.

691
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,980
Dad.

692
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,770
What happened?

693
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,090
Let me say it.

694
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,770
Don't get too agitated

695
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,090
after you hear what I will say.

696
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,050
The doctor said you

697
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,020
shouldn't be agitated.

698
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,770
Get to the point. What happened?

699
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,610
What are you doing?

700
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,090
Chuanmei

701
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,700
took Xiuyu's slot to attend university.

702
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,050
Back then,

703
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,980
Wang Xiuyu got accepted to the university.

704
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,810
But then the Wangs

705
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,050
kept telling everyone that they hoped

706
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,460
their daughter would never pass.

707
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,570
If she passed, they wouldn't have the money
for the tuition fee.

708
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,700
Chuanmei failed the exam.

709
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,130
When she came home,

710
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,020
she cried for two days straight
without eating or drinking.

711
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,740
As her brother,
I couldn't bear seeing her like that.

712
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,290
You were very occupied

713
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,330
and I couldn't contact you.

714
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,610
Then, I heard

715
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,260
someone knew a way to help

716
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,020
those who failed to get into a university,

717
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,180
as long as there were available spots.

718
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,330
I spent 20,000 yuan on this.

719
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,050
I had a lapse of judgment

720
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,810
and asked him to do it.

721
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,770
We used Xiuyu's name.

722
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,740
So

723
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,050
people outside all call Chuanmei

724
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,420
Wang Xiuyu.

725
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,660
Now,

726
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,900
the Wangs got hold of this.

727
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,220
How dare you?

728
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,700
I'll hit you to death.

729
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,130
Dad.

730
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,330
You're irresponsible!

731
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,180
Immoral!

732
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,700
-I'll hit you.
-Dad, stop hitting Chuanjia.

733
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,660
Bold, aren't you?

734
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,660
Very bold.

735
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,740
Don't touch me.

736
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,810
I will hit you to death.

737
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,740
-Why did you do that?
-Stop hitting him.

738
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,980
How could you do that?

739
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,810
Dad, what happened has happened.

740
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,050
Chuanmei has graduated

741
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,220
and has started working for a few years.

742
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,290
What else can we do?

743
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:35,050
You sure are fearless.

744
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,180
Do you guys even respect the laws?

745
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,180
Why would you do this?

746
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,050
Who did I do this for?

747
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,290
For Chuanmei.

748
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,460
And for you.

749
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,810
Back then,

750
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,610
your biggest wish

751
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,220
was for Chuanmei to get into a good university.

752
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,700
When Chuanmei received the acceptance letter,

753
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,130
you were over the moon.

754
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,570
You were so happy.

755
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,370
I have never seen you

756
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,700
that happy before.

757
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,330
Dad!

758
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,500
Are you my father now?

759
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,420
Shut up now.

760
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,220
Or else, I'll slap you until you're a mute.

761
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,370
Dad!

762
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,810
What should we do
now that the Wangs know about it?

763
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,570
What should we do?

764
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,810
You...

765
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,770
You two grew insolent.

766
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,740
How could you do such a thing?

767
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,980
She got accepted into the university.

768
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,260
Why took her spot?

769
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,220
This is her life.

770
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,370
You ruined her life.

771
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,420
Where's your good conscience?

772
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,020
Where is it?

773
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,850
Dad.

774
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,370
This is not Chuanjia's fault.

775
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,810
I implored Chuanjia to help me

776
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,700
to get into a university.

777
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,610
Chuanjia just wanted to help me.

778
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,770
No, Dad.

779
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,660
It's my fault.

780
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,420
Blame me.

781
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,220
I came up with the idea.

782
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,220
Dad,

783
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,980
I beg of you.

784
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,980
Please help her.

785
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,260
Help Chuanmei, okay?

786
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,850
Dad, if this scandal breaks out,

787
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,810
my life is over.

788
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,220
I would rather die.

789
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,370
There would be no point to live on.

790
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,330
Chuanmei.

791
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,020
For this thing,

792
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,740
we're in the wrong.

793
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,370
We made a huge mistake.

794
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,900
This is evil.

795
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,370
This is inhumane.

796
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,220
Listen to me.

797
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,460
Go visit the Wangs with me.

798
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,980
We'll apologize to them with gifts.

799

They'll decide what to make of you.

800

They will hand you your punishment.

801

And you.

802
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,260
Quit your job.

803
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,420
Come back.

804
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,610
Forget your diploma.

00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,900
Forget your work.

Come back.

Work in Wanjia Group if you want.

If you don't,

stay home.

No!

how am I supposed to live?

Also,

817
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,130
did I come back this time

818
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,050
just because I want everyone

819
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,810
in the village to know I took Wang Xiuyu's spot?

820

No!

If you force me,

I'll die in front of you.

828

00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,750
We need to think it through.

879

If this went out,

880

both our family and Mr. Wan

00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,310

883
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,340
Xiuyu is the victim here.

884
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,860
Why are you defending someone else's interest?

885
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,660
I'm not defending their interest.

886
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,310
I...

887
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:51,580
I'm thinking

888
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,900
for us.

889
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,510
I'm trying my best here.

890
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,900
What I mean

891
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,140
is that if everyone knows this,

892
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,860
the Wans will be exposed.

893
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,510
You will corner them

894
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,750
and leave them with nowhere to run.

895
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,310
Right?

896
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,230
If they retaliate with all they have,

897
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,860
we can't possibly survive that.

898
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,510
Don't you think?

899
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,350

If this had happened earlier,

904
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,990
I would agree with you.

905
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,430
But now, I disagree.

906
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,390
I have worked in a law firm.

907
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,470
I have heard

908
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,580
about legal cases.

909
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,700
The Wans

910
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,260
have obviously violated

911
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,620
the laws.

912
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,260

913

Wan Shantang

914

might be powerful

915
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,870
but he's not above laws.

916
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,300
I have seen
those richer and more powerful than him

917
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,660
lose a legal battle

918
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,990
and have to pay up.

919
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,740
Some violated the rules

920
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,620
and were imprisoned.

921
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,300
This is not something new.

922
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,220
If bringing this to court means Xiuyu
can go to university again,

923

then we'll do it.

Can Xiuyu still go back
to university after the lawsuit?

Let's take an X-ray.

If the bone is affected,

We all want to live with dignity.

1052
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,580
All right.

1053
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,390
Stop overthinking.

1054
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,470
The soil is cold.

1055
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,300
Don't sit here for too long.

1056
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:58,870
Let's go.

1057
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,070
Talk to your wife.

1058
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:01,830
Come.

00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,220
(Shuqin.)

1060
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,660
(You left too early.)

1061
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,350
(You left the children to me)

1062
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,950
(and I failed)

1063
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,740
(as their father.)

1064
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,780
(I didn't educate them properly.)

1065
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,660
(That's why everything happened.)

1066
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,700
(I know you would blame me.)

1067
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,350
(But at this stage,)

1068
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,390
(what else)

1069
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,070
(can we do?)

1070
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,740
(All this time,)

1071
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,030
(I wanted Chuanjia to achieve something)

1072
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,620
(so that he could shoulder
a heavier responsibility.)

1073
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,510
(But now, he committed a grave mistake.)

1074
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,810
(It seems like)

1075
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,370
(I put too high of an expectation)

1076
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,250
