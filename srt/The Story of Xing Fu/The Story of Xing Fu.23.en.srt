[The Story of Xing Fu]

2
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,050
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:40,959
Here.

4
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,040
You guys should check the second clause.

5
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,040
And those below it.

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,319
Mr. Guan and the rest

7
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,359
came all the way here

8
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,599
to resolve this case.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,760
Dear villagers.

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,359
Please listen to Mr. Guan for now.

11
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,599
This case

12
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,000
is clear

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,959
from the start.

14
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,680
Actually,

15
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,519
this is just a contract breach.

16
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,920
Our main issue now

17
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,920
is to provide the court

18
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,319
with solid evidence.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,879
That evidence

20
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,240
will be the contracts you had.

21
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,360
Oh.

22
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,199
And an accurate marker of your losses.

23
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,240
All of these

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,719
can become the base

25
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,319
that we can use to request compensation

26
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,080
from them.

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,879
We cannot guarantee our win.

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,479
However, I think

29
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,319
we have a huge chance of winning.

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,240
Does everyone

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,120
still have the contract?

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,800
Yes.

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,159
I have it.

34
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:31,800
I left it at home.

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,400
I didn't bring it.

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,520
-Mine is gone.
-You didn't bring it?

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,439
-Calm down.
-It's missing.

38
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,199
Those

39
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,120
who have their contracts with them,

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,280
if you're willing,

41
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
you can

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,000
sign

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,599
the letter of attorney with our lawyers here.

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,280
Our lawyers

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,000
will press charges against them

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,080
on our behalf.

47
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,000
As for those without the contract,

48
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,960
you guys can calm down.

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,879
Go home and search for it.

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,400
If you truly can't find it,

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,080
you guys can

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,560
find evidence

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,439
of your cooperation with the other party
for the past few years

54
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,240
and show them to us.

55
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,080
So, what can be considered evidence?

56
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,039
It's

57
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,240
the bank statement

58
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,520
that consists

59
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,479
of your transaction

60
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,840
with

61
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,960
the other party.

62
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,479
It's fine as long it can prove
that you worked together

63
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,280
with the other party.

64
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,439
Okay?

65
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,080
So, first,

66
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,039
let's deal with those

67
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,159
who have the contracts with them.

68
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,759
Next, we'll deal with those

69
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,159
who don't have the contracts with them,

70
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:16,919
okay?

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,840
Okay.

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,800
Alright.

73
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:20,560
So,

74
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,439
is there anything else?

75
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,719
There's one more thing

76
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,199
we need to tell you guys beforehand.

77
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,039
We have

78
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,879
to tell you guys

79
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,919
about our standard rate.

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,719
Next,

81
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,080
let us

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,560
invite Mr. Zhang to speak.

83
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,560
Here.

84
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,719
Dear villagers,

85
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,360
let me tell you guys about our rate.

86
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,159
According to the regulations of our law firm,

87
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,120
we usually

88
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,680
charge at least 2,000 yuan per case

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,360
for contract disputes such as these.

90
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,080
It's that expensive?

91
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,680
However...

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,280
That's too expensive.

93
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,520
However,

94
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,560
we do

95
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,240
take your difficulties

96
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,560
into account.

97
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,000
That's why we've prepared two solutions today.

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,120
First,

99
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,479
if you hand over the contract right now,

100
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,080
we'll charge you

101
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,759
1,500 yuan per case.

102
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,199
That's okay.

103
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,319
1,500 yuan isn't too bad.

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,879
There's a second solution.

105
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,319
Second,

106
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,479
we'll charge

107
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,280
you guys

108
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,159
for

109
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,360
a contingency fee.

110
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,520
What's that?

111
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,439
We'll only take the money

112
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,479
if we win the case.

113
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:15,919
However,

114
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,079
due to the risk,

115
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,279
we have to charge a higher rate.

116
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,199
We'll charge

117
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,480
4,000 yuan per case.

118
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,720
That's why

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,839
you guys

120
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,360
can consider

121
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,800
the two solutions

122
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,560
and pick one.

123
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,600
Okay?

124
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,160
I'll take the 1,500 yuan option.

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,639
Xingfu,

126
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,120
decide for us.

127
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,160
Which solution should we choose?

128
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,639
Yeah.

129
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,240
Xingfu,

130
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,120
you have to help us out.

131
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:42,839
How can

132
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,040
-we afford 4,000 yuan?
-It's like this.

133
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,959
You see,

134
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,079
those established law firms

135
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,160
charge people

136
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,199
tens of thousands of yuan from the start.

137
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,639
No one is willing

138
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,480
to charge a low rate

139
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,439
like Mr. Guan and the rest

140
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,279
in order to help us out.

141
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,920
It's tough for the law firm too.

142
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,959
They came all the way here to help us out.

143
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,560
They need petrol for their vehicles

144
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,439
and food for themselves too, am I right?

145
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,920
All of those cost money.

146
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,759
And, we don't know how long
the court case will last.

147
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,519
[Legal counsel]
We can't just let them make a trip for nothing.

148
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,120
Am I right?

149
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:06,639
She has a point.

150
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,959
You guys should think about it.

151
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:08,839
Xingfu,

152
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,120
if so, we'll follow your advice.

153
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:10,800
I'll hand it over right now!

154
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,839
I'll pay 1,500 yuan.

155
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,560
Me too!

156
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,360
Us too!

157
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,560
Tell us how to pay.

158
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,079
Well...

159
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,800
It's like this.

160
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,040
So,

161
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,160
to my right is Mr. Wang.

162
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,360
Over here.

163
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,519
Those who want to go for the contingency plan

164
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,079
may go to Mr. Wang.

165
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,199
To my left is Mr. Zhang.

166
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,319
Those who want to go for the normal route

167
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,240
may go to him.

168
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,519
Okay.

169
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,600
I'll sign it now.

170
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,399
I'll pay right now.

171
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,680
Remember to read the agreement first.

172
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,519
Okay!

173
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,079
Everyone!

174
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,839
Queue up!

175
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,480
Queue up!

176
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,519
Calm down.

177
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Take your turns.

178
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,879
Dear villagers,

179
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,120
please queue up.

180
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,439
Take your turns.

181
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,519
Don't panic.

182
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,480
Don't panic.

183
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:51,959
It's fine.

184
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
You guys can search for it at home.

185
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,720
If you guys

186
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,319
couldn't find it...

187
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,079
Qinglai?

188
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,680
Qingzhi?

189
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,199
What are you doing here?

190
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:08,800
You...

191
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,879
What are you doing?

192
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,079
I was preparing dinner.

193
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,279
Your sister-in-law

194
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,560
is working in the city.

195
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,439
She's doing great.

196
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
She went on a business trip

197
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,439
with the other lawyers.

198
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,560
I had to cook for myself.

199
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:19,920
Fine.

200
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,240
I bought some takeaways.

201
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,079
You should stop cooking.

202
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,879
Let's eat together.

203
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,360
Not bad, brat.

204
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,120
Sure.

205
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,199
Come on.

206
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:39,800
Qinglai,

207
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:40,879
it's rare for the house to be quiet.

208
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,319
Today,

209
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,199
we have to drink.

210
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,319
Qinglai,

211
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,000
without you,

212
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,279
I wouldn't get to where I am.

213
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
What's wrong with you today?

214
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,360
Did something happen?

215
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,759
Qinglai,

216
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,439
I'm going

217
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,040
to be the secretary

218
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,680
of our city's vice mayor.

219
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,680
You got promoted?

220
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,959
I shouldn't think about it for now.

221
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,639
Even so, it's a fact.

222
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,759
You spent time with the superiors

223
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,720
all day long.

224
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,879
Of course they'll promote you

225
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,800
when you do a good job.

226
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,399
Here.

227
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,199
Let me offer you a toast.

228
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,480
Thank you, Qinglai.

229
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,079
Qingzhi,

230
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,319
I won't need to beg anyone anymore

231
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,560
after you get promoted.

232
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,800
Qinglai,

233
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,519
I just

234
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,360
got promoted.

235
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:42,800
I have

236
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,720
to be extra cautious

237
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,240
and work extra hard.

238
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,079
I will

239
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,279
never have the guts

240
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,920
to go against the law.

241
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,279
I know that.

242
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,079
You...

243
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,759
You don't need to worry.

244
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,920
I won't create trouble

245
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,079
for you

246
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,959
even if I have to starve to death.

247
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,680
It's just that...

248
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,439
It's just that one of my colleagues

249
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,199
begged me

250
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,120
to ask you

251
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,759
so that you could

252
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,319
ask your father-in-law to get a job for him.

253
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,360
That's all.

254
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,040
Qinglai,

255
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,639
I was just planning

256
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,000
to tell you

257
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,600
about that.

258
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,399
Can you stop asking

259
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,279
Yani's father

260
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,800
for help

261
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,600
in the future?

262
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,079
Do you think I dare to ask him for help?

263
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Do you know

264
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:25,959
how

265
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,399
he looked at me when I greeted him?

266
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,800
It was as if

267
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,879
I was dog poo.

268
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,159
Qinglai,

269
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,399
do you know

270
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,279
how I got to be the secretary?

271
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,799
I don't.

272
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,039
How did you get promoted?

273
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,399
First,

274
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,759
I did well in my job.

275
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,799
I was

276
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,759
acknowledged by my superiors.

277
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,279
However, in my opinion,

278
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,639
I wouldn't be promoted

279
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,519
this easily if Yani's father

280
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,519
didn't acknowledge me.

281
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,720
After all,

282
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,519
her father is a member

283
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,120
of the Municipal Council's

284
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,799
Organization Department.

285
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,279
He has the right

286
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,000
to give his opinion

287
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,360
on the appointment of all officers.

288
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:07,600
Qinglai,

289
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,240
to put it bluntly,

290
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,519
if her father

291
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,960
said

292
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,000
something bad

293
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,320
about me,

294
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,960
my future

295
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
would've been ruined.

296
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,600
Okay...

297
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,159
Okay.

298
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,799
If so,

299
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll avoid him in the future.

300
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,399
Qinglai,

301
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,279
I...

302
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,639
Let me offer you a toast.

303
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You've suffered because of me.

304
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,039
Let me offer you a toast instead.

305
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,080
Congratulations.

306
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,840
Come on.

307
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,039
Listen,

308
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,440
after we head back,

309
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,440
we have to win Ms. Liu's case first.

310
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,879
With that,

311
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,360
the rest of the cases

312
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,399
will follow suit

313
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,240
and everything will be easy.

314
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,279
There are over 20 contracts here.

315
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,840
We have over 30,000 yuan here.

316
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,559
And, plenty of people were still queuing up

317
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,960
to sign the contingency plan with us.

318
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,320
Today,

319
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,200
I've taught you guys a proverb.

320
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,799
This is what you call

321
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,519
"Many a little makes a mickle".

322
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:32,879
You better learn it.

323
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,879
Hey,

324
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,240
I have something to discuss with you two.

325
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,519
I've been thinking about this
for the past two days.

326
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,600
We just started our law firm not long ago.

327
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,080
Why are we putting on a facade?

328
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,519
Xingfu is of enormous help to us.

329
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,360
If she wishes to become our receptionist,

330
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,879
we should let her be one.

331
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,360
We should let Xingfu grow together

332
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,480
with our law firm.

333
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,360
What do you guys think?

334
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,720
Of course it's a yes!

335
00:10:58,879 --> 00:10:59,440
You don't say?

336
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,399
-He's hungry.
-It's cold.

337
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:02,879
It got cold.

338
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,759
-Give me a second.
-Is that so?

339
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,519
Let me heat it.

340
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,399
Time to eat.

341
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,120
Mom,

342
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:09,759
Dad.

343
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,120
Xingfu?

344
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,440
When did you come back?

345
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,159
I followed Mr. Guan and his men
to Shiqiao Village for a business trip.

346
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,360
We passed by on our way back to the city.

347
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,399
That's why I applied for leave

348
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,440
to visit you guys

349
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,480
and Little Dou.

350
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,120
Here.

351
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,799
Here's your mother.

352
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,240
Dou.

-Why did you bring so much stuff?
-I bought something for you.

I made a promise to your mother-in-law.

395

it all happened

414

529
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,410
but why did you have to scare me?

530
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,100
Did you strike the lottery?

531
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,500
I'm a receptionist now.

532
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,020
Although I'm still working as a handyman too,

533
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,050
I'll receive 3,500 yuan per month now.

534
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,620
That way,

535
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,740
if we add both of our wages

536
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,260
together,

537
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,610
we'll have at least 6,000 yuan per month.

538
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,570
They're giving you an extra 2,000 yuan per month?

539
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,130
Yeah.

540
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,460
Mr. Liu,

541
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:12,530
I will

542
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,050
have

543
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,940
1 kg of pork ribs.

544
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,460
I want this,

545
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:15,740
this,

546
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,260
and this.

547
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:20,900
Xingfu.

548
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,460
Yani.

549
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,940
You're here.

550
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,570
Come in.

551
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,220
Okay.

552
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,020
Yani is here.

553
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,570
Hello, Qinglai.

554
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,260
Do the dishes

555
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,050
for me.

556
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,980
Sure, you guys can have a chat.

557
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,850
Let me hold this for you.

558
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,500
Xingfu,

559
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,810
this is the outfit I bought for you.

560
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,260
You should try them and see if they fit you.

561
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,130
Yani, you bought things for us again.

562
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,770
Don't be so courteous with me.

563
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,610
I'll get upset if you do so.

564
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,980
Look at what I've bought for you.

565
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,180
I didn't buy any

566
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,660
heavy makeups for you

567
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:46,980
because

568
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,850
we could not put on heavy makeup

569
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,980
during work.

570
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,090
That's why

571
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,090
I bought some light makeup for you.

572
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,770
You can try the color later.

573
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:53,570
Okay.

574
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,570
Xingfu, have a seat.

575
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,770
Bring me the mirror.

576
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,370
Try this.

577
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,500
But, Xingfu,

578
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:10,980
one's elegance

579
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,900
is more than just putting on makeup

580
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,610
and dressing oneself nicely.

581
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,940
I need to study too.

582
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,260
I know that.

583
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,420
Wisdom in hold, elegance in mold.

584
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,050
What was that again?

585
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,020
What I meant was

586
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,610
when you have

587
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,130
enough knowledge,

588
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,290
your elegance

589
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,530
will flow out naturally.

590
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,660
Not just that,

591
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,900
we need to be confident

592
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,020
and polite too,

593
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:33,700
am I right?

594
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,050
Xingfu,

595
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,940
you've totally changed.

596
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,810
The lipstick looks great.

597
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,130
Try it.

598
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,610
I think the color suits you.

599
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,900
I don't understand.

600
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,180
What are you doing?

601
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,700
Why would a decent woman

602
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,500
put on makeup every day?

603
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,850
Why must you be so mean?

604
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,020
Putting on makeup is the most basic respect
you can show to your clients.

605
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,130
This is an act of manners.

606
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,740
Don't judge if you don't know anything.

607
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,500
This looks great.

608
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,740
Qinglai, I'll make a move first.

609
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,570
Take care.

610
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,290
Let me see you off.

611
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:17,900
Xingfu,

612
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,260
you're earning more money

613
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,260
than Qinglai now, right?

614
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,090
Yeah.

615
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,330
Just a little.

616
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,740
No wonder.

617
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,020
What's the matter?

618
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,090
Qinglai minds the difference.

619
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:29,810
What?

620
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,420
I'm not spending

621
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,090
the extra money on other men.

622
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,050
Why should he mind it?

623
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,770
Most men are afraid

624
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,090
that their spouses become
more capable than them.

625
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,220
In my opinion,

626
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,810
Qinglai is far less experienced

627
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,020
than you.

628
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,050
I was

629
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,050
just spouting nonsense.

630
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:47,980
Don't take it to heart.

631
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:49,850
Yani,

632
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,660
you and Qingzhi are doing great.

633
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,020
You two are so close to each other

634
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,770
and you can say anything to each other.

635
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,940
I'm so envious of you two.

636
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,570
Besides spending our days together,

637
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,530
Qinglai and I

638
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,220
have nothing to talk about.

639
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,330
In the past,

640
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,020
when I was still in the village,

641
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,420
I thought

642
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,020
I was lucky to be able to get married

643
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,130
to a man like Qinglai.

644
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,180
He was born in a rich village.

645
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,050
He is honest and hardworking as well.

646
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,180
He is protective of his family and is simple too.

647
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,770
Doesn't that make him a good man?

648
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,700
But now,

649
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,180
I think

650
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,980
there are many flaws to him as well.

651
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
I feel like something's different.

652
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,660
Xingfu,

653
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,020
it's because you've improved,

654
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,330
while Qinglai did not.

655
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,850
But when I think about it,

656
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,500
he does not

657
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,610
have it easy either.

658
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:34,940
He just likes

659
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,370
to work

660
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,660
on the fields with his father.

661
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,420
He likes to work the entire day

662
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,330
and sweat profusely.

663
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,530
After that, he'll devour two bowls of rice

664
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,610
and sleep.

665
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,090
It was a simple and happy life.

666
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,740
But now that we're in the city,

667
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,260
things are different.

668
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,980
We have to rack our brains.

669
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,980
We even have to learn new things.

670
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,940
He's not used to it.

671
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,980
I can tell.

672
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,810
Qinglai is an honest man.

673
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,530
Life here is totally different

674
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,090
from village life.

675
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,850
But Xingfu,

676
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,740
what if

677
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,660
Qinglai cannot get used to it

678
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,090
no matter what?

679
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,370
What else can we do?

680
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,530
No matter what,

681
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,530
he's my man.

682
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,570
He's the father of my child.

683
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,660
If that's the case,

684
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,220
Xingfu, you need to help Qinglai
to improve himself.

685
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,260
If not, your days will get harder and harder.

Yeah.

687
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,370
You're right.

688

I have to help him to improve himself.

00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:20,980
Not bad at all.

703

You're reading such a thick book.

704
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,090
What?

705
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:23,610
Are you planning

706
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,530
to be a lawyer

707
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,570

711

712
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,090
Sure.

713

it's highly likely

716
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,330
that you'll become a real lawyer

717
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,850
after a few more years.

Do you think I can do it?

720
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,130
I can tell from your expression.

721
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,660
In my opinion,

722
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,220
you can achieve

723
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,180
whatever you set out to achieve.

724
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,090
Sure.

725
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:53,700
Thank you.

726
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,610
You can do it.

727

establishing

804
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,420
a fully-funded subsidiary company in China.

805
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,180
It's also the largest

806
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,980
foreign enterprise in our province.

807
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,770
This is the current situation.

808
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,660
They plan to hire

809
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,290
a local

810

third party legal consultant.

811
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,660
According to what I've heard,

812
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,460
they will pay them

813
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,500
around three million yuan per year.

814
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,330
That means

815
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,810
any law firm

816
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,180
that can clinch this deal

817
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,090
will have a three million yuan boost

818
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,180
to their annual income.

819
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,700
Currently,

820
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,500
every law firm in the city

821
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,940
is biding their time.

822
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,130
Ampher is planning

823
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,090
to offer the deal to the one with the best price.

824
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,660
They plan

825
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,020
to make this open to anyone

826
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,850
who wishes

827
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,420
to cooperate with them.

828
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:32,980
My fellow colleagues,

829
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,460
are you guys interested?

830
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,530
Why don't we give it a try?

831
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
Speak up.

832
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,530
It's three million yuan, you know?

833
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,050
If we can get our hands on the money,

834
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,660
we can be rid of our pathetic circumstances

835
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,900
and rise to the sky.

836
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,330
But it's a giant foreign enterprise.

837
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,900
Would they choose a nameless law firm like us?

838
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,090
Yeah.

839
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,180
Right now,

840
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,850
we have to deal with hundreds of cases
for the villagers.

841
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,020
There are only three people

842
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,090
working in this law firm.

843
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,500
We cannot handle it.

844
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,370
Yeah.

845
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,700
Hundreds of cases?

846
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,420
They only total up to tens of thousands of yuan.

847
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,900
This case is worth three million yuan, you know?

848
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,130
And, all those cases are the same.

849
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
We just need to combine them

850
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,460
and go through the motions.

851
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,810
Any one of us

852
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,900
can handle them.

853
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,220
A foreign enterprise

854
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,770
might be too much for us right now.

855
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,530
Can you stop finding excuses for your timidness?

856
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,610
Mr. Guan,

857
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,330
there are over 10 clients outside the law firm.

858
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,330
Are they

859
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,130
from Shiqiao Village?

860
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:47,810
Yes.

861
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,090
Tell them

862
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,900
that we've already won the first case.

863
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,810
They won't lose.

864
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,370
The court has its arrangements.

865
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,050
We'll notify them

866
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,660
once we receive any news.

867
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,610
Go now.

868
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,220
However,

869
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,610
I think we might need

870
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,050
to filter out our clients and cases

871
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,770
in the future.

872
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,090
These clients of ours

873
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,050
were pretty eccentric.

874
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,290
The client I was representing last time,

875
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,180
what was his name again?

876
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,130
His name was...

877
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,460
Sanlin?

878
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,610
Yeah, Sanlin.

879
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,420
Right when I was about to press charge in court,

880
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,050
he did something unexpected.

881
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,980
He brought some things with him

882
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,370
and tried to reconcile with the other party.

883
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,330
Luckily, I discovered it in time.

884
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,660
If not, it would spell trouble for us

885
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,460
if the negotiation broke down

886
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,700
or if he could not fulfill said conditions.

887
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,090
You can't just say that.

888
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,850
After all, many a little makes a mickle.

889
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,330
At least, they can solve our urgent needs.

890
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:40,900
However,

891
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,530
we cannot depend on such cases alone

892
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,610
if we wish to develop our law firm.

893
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,500
That's why

894
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,330
we should fight for the case with Ampher Group.

895
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,740
Do you think it's possible?

896
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,090
Why not?

897
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,980
I know our law firm is tiny

898
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,610
and we might not be the most
experienced lawyers around,

899
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,700
but foreigners might not care about that.

900
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,330
What if

901
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,940
they value our attitudes towards the law?

902
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,290
The three of us

903
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,500
are excellent in that.

904
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,700
I agree.

905
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,090
Actually, I think we should give it a try.

906
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,740
Even if we fail,

907
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,530
at least we can know the difference
between us and the others.

908
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,370
Am I right?

909
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:23,570
And,

910
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,900
how could you know

911
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,530
that we would fail for sure?

912
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,940
Don't tell me we're not even confident
in our own abilities?

913
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,610
What do you say?

914
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,290
Alright.

915
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:40,770
Let's do it.

916
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,370
But since we've decided to do it,

917
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,020
we must

918
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,460
be determined to win.

919
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,370
When is

920
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,180
the bid?

921
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,330
It's on the 12th of next month.

922
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,940
We have 25 days left.

923
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,850
We still have time.

924
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,740
From now on,

925
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,770
we have to do our best

926
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,090
to prepare the legal documents.

927
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,900
Time for lunch!

928
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,570
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Wang,

929
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,220
lunch is here.

930
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,530
Mr. Guan,

931
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,260
time for lunch.

932
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,740
Okay.

933
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,740
Leave them over there for now.

934
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,570
Xingfu,

935
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,290
how many cases

936
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:27,980
do we

937
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,180
have to deal with this week?

938
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,460
We still have nine cases left.

939
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,330
Okay.

940
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,370
Everything is happening at the same time.

941
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,460
Now, we're trying to win
the bid for Ampher Group's case.

942
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,460
We have to spend a lot of time
preparing for the bid.

943
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:43,810
It would be great

944
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,330
if we could delay these cases to next month.

945
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,370
What?

946
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,130
If you delay them to next month,

947
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,900
all those apples will go rotten.

948
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,290
I guess we have no choice then.

949
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:56,460
By the way, Xingfu,

950
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,180
tell them

951
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,130
to stop coming.

952
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,660
The journey is pretty long.

953
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,900
We'll notify them

954
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,220
immediately if we have any news.

955
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,900
Can anyone interpret this material

956
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,370
judicially for me?

957
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:09,980
Which material?

958
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,660
This one.

Equity transfer agreement
of foreign investment enterprise.

960

After its establishment...

961
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:17,370
Yes,

962
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,770
just follow what it says

963
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,370
and you'll be done.

Why aren't you eating?

966
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,500
I have already finished my meal.

967
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,850
Why are people like this?

968
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:51,850
What do you mean?

969
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,050
They were fine at first,

970
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,420
but they changed

971
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,530
gradually.

972
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,290
Were you referring to us?

973
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,610
It's all because of the land reclamation.

974
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,180
I wasn't referring to that.

975
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,900
I was referring to Guan Tao and the other lawyers.

976
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,810
They were happy when they first

977
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,770
received requests from the farmers.

978
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,370
They said they wanted

979
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
to get back their money for them.

980
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,460
But now, they've changed.

981
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,810
They're not paying attention to them anymore.

982
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,090
They'll help whoever pays them the most.

983
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,980
In the end, they just look down on farmers.

Morning, Mr. Guan.

Morning.

986

Have you had breakfast?

987
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,130
I have no appetite because I slept late

988
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:53,610
and woke up early.

Mr. Guan,

00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,370
it must've been tough on you.

991
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,780
I made some porridge for you.

992

you're so thoughtful.

It's piping hot too.

996
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,170
Finish it while it's hot.

997
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,850
How did you make this?

998
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,650
I made it with an electric rice cooker.

999
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:32,940
Hey,

1000
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,370

Don't worry about it.

00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,500
I know that.

00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:39,700
It smells great.

I did.

00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,940
But...

1049
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,380
But the apple case

1050
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,980
is hugely beneficial to the law firm too.

1051
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,170
Xingfu, are you trying to argue this with me?

1052
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,650
I didn't say that the case wasn't important.

1053
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,290
It's just that the bid is more urgent

1054
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,690
from a chronological perspective.

1055
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:22,980
Alright.

1056
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:24,820
Mr. Guan,

1057
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,730
I know the huge case is important.

1058
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,060
I know they're farmers

1059
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,170
and they're not rich and powerful,

1060
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,380
but you guys shouldn't ignore them

1061
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,420
because of the huge case.

1062
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,860
Xingfu,

1063
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,820
you misunderstood me.

1064
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,460
I understood what you meant

1065
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,380
when you passed the porridge to me.

1066
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,130
All of them are my clients.

1067
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
I won't forget about them.

1068
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,460
Don't worry.

1069
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,650
I'll surely deal with their cases

1070
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,420
within the allocated time.

1071
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,820
It's getting late. You should get off work.

1072
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,210
Xingfu,

1073
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,290
although the three of us are penniless now,

1074
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,770
we'll be rich

1075
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,650
when we make it back.

1076
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,610
Guan Tao.

1077
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,130
How's the preparation? Is everything ready?

1078
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,540
Yeah.

1079
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,290
Let's go.

1080
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,340
By the way, Xingfu,

1081
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,820
we're going to attend the bid.

1082
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,540
We'll leave the house

1083
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,540
to you.

[Ampher Group]

1085
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,770
I didn't expect you
to grace us with your presence.

1086
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,380
It's my duty.

1087
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,690
Isn't that Mr. Xiao from the Lawyers Association?

1088
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,090
He's actually here?

1089
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,340
They have the famous
judicial theory expert with them too.

1090
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,900
They look pretty overwhelming.

1091
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,500
Let's head inside.

1092
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,500
Mr. Frank,

1093
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:15,980
that's all

1094
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,980
for the introduction

1095
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,820
of Xuze Law Firm.

1096
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,290

Next, let us welcome

00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,290
Yidao Law Firm.

1100
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,020
Yidao Law Firm?

1101
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,730
I know them well.

1102
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,540
Mr. Han's standard

1103
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,650
is impeccable.

1104
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,570
There are over 3,000 members

1105
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,860
within the Lawyers Association.

1106
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,650
I dare not say

1107
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,500
he's the top member.

1108
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,610
However, he's one of the top ten members.

1109
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,290
Am I right, Mr. Qian?

1110
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,860
Mr. Xiao is right.

1111
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,380
In my opinion,

1112
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,020
he's more than qualified enough

1113
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,540
to be one of the top 100 members.

1114
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,690
As a lawyer,

1115
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,460
one's capability

1116
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,980
is very important.

1117
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:02,690
However,

1118
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,340
one's connections

1119
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,540
are more important.

1120
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,130
Mr. Han

1121
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,650
is especially great

1122
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,420
[Representative of Fangyuan Law Firm]
at that.

1123
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,250
You two flatter me.

1124
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,060
You see,

1125
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,690
[Representative of Yidao Law Firm]
I've been a lawyer for more than 20 years.

1126
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,650
I realized something.

1127
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,730
Actually, in the end,

1128
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,610
everyone in the industry
is pretty much on the same level.

1129
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,290
It's a contest to see
who's better at memorizing the law.

1130
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,060
However, I heard

1131
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,610
that it's your first time visiting China.

1132
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,500
To be a lawyer in China,

1133
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,290
not only

1134
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,060
do you need to be good at your job,

1135
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,420
but you also have to be capable of communicating
with different circles of society.

1136
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,210
We have an advantage

1137
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,060
over others

1138
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,500
because I've worked

1139
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,340
in different departments over the years.

1140
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,250
I'm familiar with both the top
and bottom levels of society.

1141
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,130
Mr. Qian, am I right?

1142
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,460
Yes.

1143
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,820
I remember

1144
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,770
that when I was first

1145
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,980
transferred to this city,

1146
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,060
you came to my house

1147
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,380
on the second day

1148
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,170
right after I reported for duty.

[Representative of Fangyuan Law Firm]

1150
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:08,380
But why is it important to have a relationship
with the other circles?

1151
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,290
Why is it important to have a relationship
with the other circles?

1152
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,730
It's because

1153
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,540
this is

1154
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,130
the national condition unique to China.

1155
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,420
If you want to start a business in China,

1156
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,340
it will be difficult for you

1157
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,940
to do well

1158
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,820
if you don't have great connections.

1160
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,770

1183
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,540
it's very competitive here

1184
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,570
and the rate of elimination is high.

1185

Am I right?

1193
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:34,940
That's right.

1194
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,210

basic documents for the bid,

1197

1199
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,340
the culture of your company.

1200

and the Chinese market.

and discuss the situation with you

1211

as soon as possible.

1212

Due to time constraints,

1213
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,210
we would like

1214
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,820

1215
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,020
Mr. Frank hopes

1216
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,060
that he can visit

1217
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:20,940
Mr. Han

1218
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,570
and Yidao Law Firm as soon as possible

1219
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,770
to proceed with the next step.

1220
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,500
Of course. You're welcome to do so.

1221
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,170
We await your arrival.

1222
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,380
Let us

1223
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,090
congratulate Yidao Law Firm.

1224
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,420
Let us congratulate Ampher Group

1225
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,060
for making

1226
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,420
a wise call.

1227
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,290
That's all for the bid today.

1228
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,690
Mr. Frank,

1229
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,130
may I take up some of your time?

1230
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,290
I just wish to say something.

1231
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,420
We prepared

1232
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,210
these documents

1233
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,770
especially for your company.

1234
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,250
It's useless to us.

1235
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,180
So,

1236
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,890
we'll leave them here.

1237
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,500
You can read it

1238
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,810
if you have the time.

1239
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,290
If it can

1240
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,060
serve you to some extent,

1241
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,020
at least it's something

1242
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,930
that we can be happy about.

1243
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,180
At least it proves

1244
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,100
that all of our effort

1245
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:23,770
wasn't wasted.

1246
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,290
No matter what,

1247
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,860
we respect your decision.
