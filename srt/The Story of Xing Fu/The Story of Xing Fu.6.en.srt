[The Story of Xing Fu]

2
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,950
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,799
Say something.

4
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,519
Xingfu has been talking for a long time.

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,319
You didn't even show her some support.

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,319
Support? Why should I?

7
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,840
Just live our days well.

8
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,079
Stop making yourself suffer.

9
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,319
Besides,

10
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,319
our family

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,359
has about 100,000 yuan in savings only.

12
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,799
Even if I take everything out,

13
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,120
it's still insufficient.

14
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,280
Dad, Mom,

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
I have thought it through.

16
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,439
As for the remaining amount,

17
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,159
we can take a loan from the credit cooperatives.

18
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,599
The country has policies for the rural areas now.

19
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,639
As long as it's used
for production and entrepreneurship,

20
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,759
we can take a loan from the credit cooperatives.

21
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,199
I was thinking if we could fork out
more money on our own,

22
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,039
we would pay less interest on the loan.

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,319
Besides,

24
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,479
our family savings are being left dormant.

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,520
What do you mean by "being left dormant"?

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,039
That is saved

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,759
for Qingzhi's wedding.

28
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,120
But isn't it still early now?

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,840
Why not take it out for investment?

30
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,639
When the money is multiplied in the future,

31
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,199
we'll have enough money.

32
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,199
You're too ambitious.

33
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,960
You're talking about such a big matter

34
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,120
as if it's as easy as touching the upper lip

35
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,840
with the lower lip.

36
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,599
Do you know how we saved

37
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,879
those 100,000 yuan?

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,280
It's saved from Qinglai's
day-and-night work on the field,

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,879
Xiuyu's salaries,

40
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,039
and your mom's

41
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,520
and my hard work in the past few years.

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,400
And we only managed to save just a little money.

43
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,039
It's precisely because of this

44
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,360
that I want to build a greenhouse

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,400
as a vegetable base

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
to make a fortune.

47
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
This way, you and mom

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,400
no longer need to toil yourself.

49
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,240
Yes,

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,520
building a greenhouse
will cost a lot of money at one go.

51
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,879
But we have good control
over the temperature and water.

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,479
We can grow vegetables all year round.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We can also sell

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,360
the off-season vegetables at a higher price.

55
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,479
Otherwise, Cai wouldn't pull the string

56
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,479
so we could sign an agreement
with the supermarket in the city.

57
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,080
Qinglai and I will grow the vegetables.

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,840
The supermarket will sell our vegetables.

59
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,879
You and mom

60
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,719
will count money at home.

61
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,000
You're really eloquent.

62
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,599
Mom, I really feel

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,759
that

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,400
it's something worth doing

65
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,639
after reviewing all the conditions.

66
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,879
Cai and the supermarket
will sell the vegetables all year round.

67
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,479
And Qinglai has skills in this area.

68
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,879
Most of the young people in our village

69
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,520
work in the Group.

70
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,919
Only a few of them work on the field.

71
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,919
Half of the land is used for plantation,
and the other half is left unattended.

72
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,319
The rent is cheaper now.

73
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,039
This is an opportunity.

74
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,719
Also,

75
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,719
I'll invest

76
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,319
tens of thousands of yuan from my family in this.

77
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,240
No way.

78
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,719
You must not use your money.

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,879
Why?

80
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,120
I've married into this family.

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,319
We're a family.

82
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,560
You're right.

83
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,000
Qinglai,

84
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,439
what's your opinion?

85
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,439
What do you think?

86
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,639
When I first heard Xingfu mention it,

87
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,080
I was shocked too.

88
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:19,400
But after understanding the details,

89
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,240
and after Xingfu
carefully calculated the amount,

90
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,919
I think this

91
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,879
is quite plausible.

92
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,439
You think so too?

93
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,160
Look,

94
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,399
they've already

95
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,920
said it all.

96
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,399
Why don't you let them try it out?

97
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
But

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I feel

99
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,720
keeping the money safe at home

100
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,319
gives me peace of mind.

101
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
If we take the money out,

102
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,199
it will be hard to predict

103
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,560
whether we can get it back.

104
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,120
Dad, we'll definitely earn back the money.

105
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,160
The returns could even be more.

106
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:50,920
Look.

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,639
Are you sure it can make money?

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,920
Yes.

109
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,399
What if we make a loss?

110
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,519
Dear,

111
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,079
don't make a fuss.

112
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,600
We can't hesitate in doing business.

113
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,959
We must dare to take the risk.

114
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,439
Qingzhi,

115
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,279
how come you have the time to call me?

116
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,079
I miss you.

117
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,480
Guan Tao, have you been busy lately?

118
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,959
Do you still play sports?

119
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:26,959
No.

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,839
I haven't had the chance.

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,240
Everyone is busy.

122
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,560
They take a rain check

123
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,959
alternately.

124
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,120
I did send you a message.

125
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,120
You didn't give me a reply.

126
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,439
Let me tell you.

127
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,360
We must meet someday.

128
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,920
Even if the others can't join,

129
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,319
we both must still meet.

130
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,279
Okay. No problem.

131
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,480
Guan Tao,

132
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,439
my sister-in-law

133
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,040
went to your law firm, right?

134
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,319
Yes.

135
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,639
Your sister-in-law suddenly showed up

136
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,040
at our law firm that day.

137
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
I was wondering

138
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,480
if you introduced her.

139
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,680
I didn't.

140
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,800
Who can I introduce her to?

141
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,240
She just happened to join the company herself.

142
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,319
That's impressive.

143
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,639
Guan Tao, I called

144
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,079
to tell you

145
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,319
that she's alone

146
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,519
and isn't familiar with the place.

147
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,079
If you can,

148
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,240
help me to look out for her.

149
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,079
Don't worry.

150
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,360
I will treat her as my sister.

151
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,199
Thank you.

152
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,560
Tell her to look for me if she needs any help.

153
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,399
I'll hang up then.

154
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,120
Okay. Goodbye.

155
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,399
Qinglai, move it a bit further.

156
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,519
Further back.

157
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,240
That's right.

158
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,439
Here.

159
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,600
Guancai,

160
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,240
I have something to discuss with you.

161
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm building a greenhouse

162
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,319
on the slope your family owns.

163
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,560
You can't charge me by the mus.
[* 1 mu is about 0.165 acre]

164
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,279
Xingfu,

165
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,319
you're quite shrewd.

166
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,000
What about this?

167
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,879
Things remain unchanged.

168
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,519
I'll charge you

169
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,600
50 yuan less each year, all right?

170
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,279
No way.

171
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,600
You're taking advantage of me.

172
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,000
Qinglai!

173
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,000
Come over.

174
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,360
Come on.

175
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,839
Say something.

176
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,000
Well,

177
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,000
when you stole peaches from my house

178
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,879
as a kid,

179
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,360
I'd never stopped you, right?

180
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,439
Now, you two

181
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,240
are being calculative with me on this matter.

182
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,959
Who remembers your childhood?

183
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,319
What about

184
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,040
we leave it at this?

185
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,480
All right.

186
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,000
Since the head of the family said so,

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,680
then it's settled.

188
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,560
She's calling you the head of the family.

189
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,279
You two are very efficient.

190
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Of course.

191
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,040
The faster we build, the earlier we'll make money.

192
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,800
You have a keen eye for marrying such a wife.

193
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,279
Your ancestors must have accumulated merits.

194
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,560
Come on. Pull it down.

195
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,079
Slowly.

196
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,199
Thank you. Sirs, watch out.

197
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:07,720
Okay.

198
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,040
Just put it here.

199
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,360
Qinglai. Watch out.

200
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,680
Okay.

201
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,160
Come on.

202
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,879
Watch out.

203
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,560
Don't drop it.

204
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,319
Put it here?

205
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,360
Hello,

206
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,000
Xingyun.

207
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,800
Xingfu,

208
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,199
have you started to rent the land
and build a greenhouse?

209
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
We're working on it.

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,279
Well, it must have cost you a huge sum.

211
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,120
Yes.

212
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,920
I've invested my 30,000 yuan in it.

213
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,279
I see.

214
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,639
Why did you ask?

215
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,800
Are you short of money recently?

216
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,920
No.

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,799
I know it must be hard on you out there.

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,080
If you face any difficulties,
you must let me know.

219
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,919
All right, Xingfu.

220
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,919
Stop talking about me.

221
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,360
You must take good care of yourself too.

222
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,759
Also, visit our mom often.

223
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,039
Goodbye.

224
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:06,349
[Rent Reminder Notice]

225
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:08,840
Let's go.

226
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,480
There's a new oyster bar

227
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,320
across the street.

228
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,360
It should be good.

229
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
Eating oysters at noon?

230
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,960
You need some replenishment, right?

231
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,440
Isn't it good for both of us,

232
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,320
right?

233
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,080
Zhang, let's not eat out.

234
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,720
I brought lunch. You can try it too.

235
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,360
Okay.

236
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,080
You even brought your own lunch.

237
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,519
What did you bring?

238
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,840
I made this stir-fried pork with chili.

239
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,600
-Come on.
-I'll heat it up.

240
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,679
Try it later.

241
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,639
Okay.

242
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,320
Mr. Guan,

243
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,159
let's have lunch.

244
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,039
-We're leaving now.
-Join us.

245
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,720
Just go ahead.

246
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Okay.

247
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,080
We'll have our lunch first then, Mr. Guan.

248
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:58,679
Okay.

249
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,919
I made my own weight-loss meal.

250
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,799
I used very little oil. It's very simple.

251
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,120
How is it?

252
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,120
Have you adapted to the environment here?

253
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,240
It's good, Senior.

254
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,679
You're not

255
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,759
having lunch?

256
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,559
I'm not hungry. I have some leftovers

257
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,360
from breakfast.

258
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,200
I'll just take a bite.

259
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,279
Qingzhi's place is far from here.

260
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,720
It must be hard for you to travel like this

261
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,759
every day.

262
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,480
Qingzhi's place?

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,720
Are you thinking that I'm living at his place?

264
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,559
So, you're not living at his place?

265
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,519
Isn't he your brother-in-law?

266
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,720
How could I live there?

267
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,639
I rented a room outside.

268
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,799
The base salary isn't high

269
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,279
during your apprenticeship.

270
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,000
You have to pay for your rent and living expenses.

271
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,480
It must be pretty stressful for you.

272
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,200
Did your family help you out?

273
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,559
No. That's why I scrimp.

274
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,840
I haven't paid my rent for months.

275
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,159
Take this.

276
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,639
Senior, what is this?

277
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't mean anything.

278
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,440
Qingzhi and I are brothers.

279
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,279
And you're his sister-in-law.

280
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,960
So, you're like a sister to me too.

281
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,639
If you're facing difficulties,

282
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,399
I think

283
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,080
it's okay for me to help you.

284
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,039
Don't stand on ceremony.

285
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
No, Senior.

286
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,279
I accept your kindness,

287
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,399
but I can't take this.

288
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,519
This isn't about being courteous.

289
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,240
Since childhood, my parents
have been forbidding me from borrowing money.

290
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,919
When my dad passed away,

291
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,440
my mom never borrowed money
no matter how hard life was.

292
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,279
Take it back.

293
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,519
If this goes on,
your body won't be able to stand it.

294
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,360
I'm fine.

295
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,240
Well,

296
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,480
I'll hang in there

297
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,759
until I receive my salary in a few days.

298
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,879
After that,

299
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,639
I'll persevere
until I become an official employee.

300
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,720
Then, I can take on cases

301
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
and take commissions, right?

302
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,840
Let me teach you a trick.

303
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,679
If you're really out of money,

304
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,279
you can apply for a credit card at the bank.

305
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,320
When you've reached the credit limit,
apply for another one.

306
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,279
Use one credit card to pay off
another credit card debt.

307
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,639
This way, you can survive
for about one and a half years.

308
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,279
Well, that's borrowing money from the bank, right?

309
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,159
No way.

310
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,080
I don't feel at ease.

311
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,840
In theory, this is not called
borrowing money from the bank.

312
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,399
This is borrowing from your future money.

313
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,559
That's how I survived back then.

314
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,440
Can we really do so?

315
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,399
Why not?

316
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,440
You'll still repay it, right?

317
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,799
Based on fortune-telling,

318
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,320
you're fated to be wealthy.

319
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,399
This is just a temporary crisis.

320
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,039
It's true.

321
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,519
Thank you, Senior.

322
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,200
Don't mention it.

323
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,159
What's wrong?

324
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,919
The Chinese chives...

325
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,559
The Chinese chives...

326
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,360
What kind of smell is this?

327
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,879
-It smells disgusting.
-What's wrong?

328
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,159
It's not spoiled. It smells quite good.

329
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:56,919
Xingfu,

330
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,759
how long have you been missing your menstruation?

331
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,360
Mom, you're saying

332
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,000
that I...

333
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,200
You're pregnant.

334
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,559
Xingfu,

335
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,879
the Wang family has a descendant.

336
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,559
Qinglai!

337
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,720
I'm coming.

338
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,720
Come quickly.

339
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,720
-Bring your wife...
-What is it, Mom?

340
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,159
to the health center for a check-up.

341
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,559
Xingfu, how are you feeling?

342
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,399
Are you sick?

343
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
He Xingfu!

344
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,519
She's here!

345
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,240
Come on.

346
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,720
Take a seat.

347
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,440
How is it, Doctor?

348
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,080
Qinglai, congratulations.

349
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,480
You're laughing so happily.

350
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,399
Is it a girl or a boy?

351
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,879
It's not fully formed yet.

352
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,000
We don't know for now.

353
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,480
Besides,

354
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,159
we're promoting gender equality now.

355
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,600
Even if we knew the gender now,

356
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,159
our hospital would forbid us to mention it.

357
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,559
Mom, are you saying

358
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,360
that you won't accept the child if it were a girl?

359
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,240
What? How could we not
acknowledge the Wang descendant?

360
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,279
How could we?

361
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,240
Mom, it doesn't matter
whether it's a boy or a girl.

362
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,320
Xingfu,

363
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,320
you're amazing.

364
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,240
You've just married into the family,

365
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
and you're now carrying our baby.

366
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,519
It's you who's amazing, foolish kid.

367
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,080
Yes, it's me.

368
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,879
It's me.

369
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,759
Doctor,

370
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,200
what do I need to take note of?

371
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,320
Maintain a good mood,

372
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,399
and don't tire yourself out.

373
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,399
Hello, Xingfu. What's the matter?

374
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,200
Xingyun,

375
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,519
I'm pregnant.

376
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,960
That means I'm going to be an aunt soon.

377
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,519
That's great.

378
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,720
Xingfu, have you told our mom?

379
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,639
Mom already knew it.

380
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,759
By the way, I have something to ask you.

381
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,519
What is it?

382
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,440
How much does a computer cost?

383
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,000
A computer?

384
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,279
It's about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

385
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,600
Okay.

386
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,080
I'll find a time to meet you then.

387
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,519
Take me to buy a computer.

388
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,799
Okay.

389
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,200
But you're pregnant now.

390
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,840
You must be extra careful.

391
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,519
Goodbye.

392
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:41,800
[Rent Reminder and Utility Bill Notice]

393
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,020
Dear,

394
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,650
I'll do it.

395
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,340
Stop moving around.

396
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,340
Just some bowls.

397
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,460
Pass them to me. Stop moving around.

398
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,020
I forgot the chicken soup.

399
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,140
Mom, I'll take it.

400
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,810
Stop.

401
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,170
Did I ask for your help?

402
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,220
Sit down.

403
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,690
Qinglai,

404
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,170
I've been so tied up at work recently.

405
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,020
Why did you call me back at noon?

406
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,410
What a sumptuous meal.

407
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,260
Celebrating a festival?

408
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,170
Xiuyu,

409
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,340
you're going to be an aunt.

410
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,090
Xingfu, you're pregnant?

411
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,090
Qinglai, you're amazing.

412
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,090
What are you looking for?

413
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,850
Where's the liquor? Why can't I find it?

414
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,090
Over there.

415
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,610
Why did you hide it so well?

416
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,570
Did you see it?

417
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,220
The sun rises from the west today.

418
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,700
Mom proactively allows Dad to drink wine.

419
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,660
Xingfu is carrying the Wang child.

420
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,020
It's a happy occasion.

421
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,500
I'll let your dad delight in it.

422
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,810
Come on.

423
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,940
It's ready.

424
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,500
Well, Qinglai,

425
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,290
have some drink today too.

426
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,260
Okay.

427
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,570
Well...

428
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,370
It's here.

429
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,330
Pass it to him.

430
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,220
Let me do it, Dad.

431
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,900
Okay.

432
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,260
Today is a happy day.

433
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,940
Cheers. Come on.

434
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,530
Congratulations.

435
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,570
Look at how happy your dad is.

436
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,530
Dad, Mom, while you're happy,

437
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,980
I'd like to discuss something with you.

438
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,370
What is it?

439
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,530
Okay. Speak up.

440
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,260
I want to buy a computer.

441
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,530
Buy a computer?

442
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,290
What is it for?

443
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,770
It's not food.

444
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,290
Just make do with the television.

445
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,610
No. I contacted Cai,

446
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,460
and he sent me some market information,

447
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,530
such as the quotations.

448
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,130
He emailed them to me.

449
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,330
I need a computer to view them.

450
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,180
I agree.

451
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,290
I think Xingfu needs to know the market

452
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,570
to better manage the greenhouse.

453
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,570
We'll grow the vegetables

454
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,770
based on the market demand.

455
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,850
Well...

456
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,610
How much does it cost?

457
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,570
I've asked Xingyun.

458
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,570
It's about 2,000 yuan.

459
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,810
What? About 2,000 yuan?

460
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,020
We can do a lot of things with 2,000 yuan.

461
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,330
We can buy some meat and have a delicious meal.

462
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,330
You love nothing but money in your entire life.

463
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,700
When it comes to money,

464
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,900
it's like slicing the meat off his ribs.

465
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,570
Xingfu, you make the call yourself.

466
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,090
Don't listen to your dad.

467
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,260
Just buy it as long as you are happy.

468
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,370
Look,

469
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,050
there was a spendthrift lady

470
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,570
in our family then.

471
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,290
Now,

472
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,050
we have another one.

473
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,220
So?

474
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,610
Don't mess with me.

475
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,700
I have a partner in crime now.

476
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,530
You got a problem?

477
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,050
Dad,

478
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:42,810
I'll toast to you.

479
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:43,460
Okay.

480
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,500
Xingfu,

481
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,850
wait for a while.

482
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,050
Here's your soup.

483
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,090
Xingfu,

484
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,660
you're carrying the Wang child.

485
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,370
Your dad and I have seen it very well.

486
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,130
You're a sensible and good daughter-in-law.

487
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,740
From now on,

488
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,090
I'll pass you all the keys to the house.

489
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,020
You'll be the head of the family.

490
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,810
Mom,

491
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,180
I can't do it.

492
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,500
Why not?

493
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,850
We're old.

494
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,050
Let your mom

495
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,850
enjoy a happy life.

496
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,020
You'll take over

497
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,370
as the head of the family.

498
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,260
Yes.

499
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,420
You'll take over.

500
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:28,940
I...

501
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,660
All right.

502
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,740
Dad, Mom,

503
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,660
I won't be afraid of suffering,

504
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,900
tiredness, and worries. I'll work harder

505
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,570
so you two can enjoy a happy life.

506

Isn't this night view nice?

I felt something was amiss at dinner just now.

You were telling me about going on a diet.

Can you continue to work here?

00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,290
the rent.

Xingfu, you don't get it.

752

Yes, you can afford the rent.

753
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,250
But do you know how much it costs

754

to live a good life in a big city?

755

You might solve it for me today.

756

But what about after I become
an official employee?

757

Can you still help me then?

Of course, I can't.

That's right. Just live our days well.

796
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,340
I went to meet my sister too.

797

She can't even afford her meals.

800
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,860
So, I gave her the money
intended for the computer purchase.

But you couldn't just give her everything
out of the 3,000 yuan.

809
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,860
Could she just give her sister one half
and save the other half for herself?

810
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,020
Dad, don't worry.

811
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:47,980

from the money I invested in the greenhouse.

813
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,130
Cut it out.

814
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,900
Your sister was bullied because of our family.

815

I feel bad.

you must give it to her too.

It's your duty.

818
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
All right. Stop talking about it.

819
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,980
I'll cook now.

820
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,980
You must be hungry.

821
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,500
It'd be better to buy a computer instead.

Okay!

844
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,250
How inefficient this is.

845
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,340
It's already two months.

846
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,650
But the agreement hasn't been signed yet.

847
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,250
What's the problem?

848
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,980
It's the construction plan
of the sewage treatment plant.

849
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,900
We can't reach a consensus.

850
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,460
Why so?

851
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,770
They set a very high requirement for the plant.

852
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,860
It costs a lot of money.

853
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,460
I suggest

854
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,730
making do with whatever is available

855
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,690
and embracing the thrifty spirit.

856
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,500
A smaller one

857
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,690
can still do the job.

858
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,820
Didn't you always advocate thriftiness

859
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,940
and living within our means?

860
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,860
I did advocate thriftiness.

861
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,130
But we must pay attention
to the environmental protection issues.

862
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,090
We were clueless back then.

863
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,650
When we built
the construction material factory,

864
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,650
we polluted the water
at the Shuiwei Village downriver.

865
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,540
Although we'd remedied it later on,

866
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,650
Maoqin, the Secretary of the village,
still puts on an unfriendly face

867
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,610
whenever he sees me.

868
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,210
He was unhappy looking at me.

869
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,380
Now that we have money

870
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,610
and are fighting for the title
"The Most Beautiful Village",

871
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,500
we shouldn't scrimp

872
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,020
on the environmental protection part.

873
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,900
We must spend as we deem fit.

874
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,340
The problem doesn't lie in money only.

875
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,650
The place itself isn't spacious.

876
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,250
It's just the quarry.

877
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,940
It'll be very cramped if they build

878
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,340
both the sewage treatment plant

879
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,570
and the health care product plant on it.

880
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,380
A smaller plant

881
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,540
can still do the job.

882
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,380
The sewage treatment
will take a bit longer though.

883
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,210
Did you tell Mr. Zhang and the others

884
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,690
about our specific conditions?

885
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,020
I did.

886
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,540
I've been communicating with them.

887
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,500
But Mr. Zhang

888
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,730
is a stick in the mud.

889
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,250
He keeps dragging on
and refusing to sign the agreement.

890
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,020
What about this?

891
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,860
Promptly invite Mr. Zhang and the others over.

892
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,820
I'll discuss it with them.

893
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,210
The client will be meeting you at 10:30 AM.

894
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,210
You have a meeting
at Lawyers Association at 11:30 AM.

895
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,730
The Lawyers Association
will arrange for your lunch.

896
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,340
I've settled the express courier as requested.

897
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,940
I've also booked the high-speed rail tickets

898
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,690
and a business suite at Four Seasons Hotel

899
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:19,770
for your business trip to Shanghai.

900
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,500
Did I miss

901
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,940
anything?

902
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,540
This document has been stamped.

903
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,570
Thank you, Mr. Han.

904
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,060
He,

905
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,380
it's been a while since you started working here.

906
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,650
Yes.

907
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,060
How is it? Can you adapt to it?

908
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,170
It's fine.

909
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,730
To become a lawyer,

910
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,940
you have to start as an assistant.

911
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,730
As young people, there's no harm
in gaining more experiences.

912
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,980
Don't be like some young people

913
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,420
who have great ambition but little skills.

914
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,730
They can't handle big projects

915
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,210
and are unwilling to perform minor tasks.

916
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,980
They only focus on the money.

917
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,900
Such people have no prospects.

918
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,730
Trust me.

919
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,130
I get it.

920
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,540
Work hard.

921
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,090
I'll train you.

922
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,820
Thank you, Mr. Han.

923
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,170
By the way,

924
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,060
come along with me to Shanghai.

925
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:15,980
Book tickets for yourself too.

926
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,650
If you perform well,

927
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:19,730
I'll let you pass your probation upon our return.

928
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,380
What is it? Don't you want it?

929
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,940
Of course, I want it, Mr. Han.

930
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,500
I'll get going then.

931
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,610
Wait.

932
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,540
Take the afternoon off

933
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,540
and go get some nice outfits.

934
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,690
We're representing the image of the law firm

935
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,340
when we head out for work.

936
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,210
Okay.

937
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,650
I'll get going then, Mr. Han.
