[Episode 25]

3
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,319
This seems too formal.

4
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,879
Hey.

5
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,599
Halt.

6
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,719
What are you doing?

7
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,319
Visitors' vehicles are not allowed.

8
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,719
We are here to pick up Mr. Xu.

9
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,239
There are so many Mr. Xus.

10
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,719
Throw a stone and it could hit two.

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
Which Mr. Xu do you mean?

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,159
The director of the Cadre Office
of Organization Department, Mr. Xu.

13
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,159
Still, you can't enter.

14
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,919
It's the rule that no visitors' vehicles
are allowed.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,360
We've spoken to Mr. Xu.

16
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,319
He will be right down.

17
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,639
We'll just pick him up and leave.

18
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,080
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

19
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,560
No visitors' vehicles are allowed! It's the rule.

20
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,120
Move your car to the side. Go on.

21
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,080
What about I give Mr. Xu a call?

22
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,080
Call him after you move the car, okay?

23
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,120
Go on, hurry up.

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,000
Another car is coming. Move it.

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,520
But...

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
But people might say

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,280
I have no regard for rural affairs.

28
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,800
That won't be good.

29
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,080
Hello.

30
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,439
Mr. Yu.

31
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:49,879
Mr. Xu.

32
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,439
Are you here?

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,439
Yes.

34
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,199
Alright.

35
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,319
Gosh.

36
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,639
They insisted that I do the ribbon cutting.

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,599
It's too troublesome to go to and fro.

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,159
-Are you downstairs?
-Yes.

39
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,120
Okay.

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,919
I'll be right down.

41
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,280
Okay.

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
Mr. Xu.

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,840
Here.

44
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,159
Gosh.

45
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,000
Why didn't you wait inside?

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,039
Hello, Mr. Xu.

47
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,000
We were supposed to pick you inside.

48
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,840
But that guard wouldn't let us in.

49
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Sorry about that, Mr. Xu.

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,719
This way.

51
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,159
Who is it?

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,360
Mrs. Xu.

53
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,560
What brings you here?

54
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,159
Mr. Xu wanted to see me.

55
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,360
Okay.

56
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,400
Go ahead.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,719
I'll go in.

58
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:16,759
Go on.

59
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,480
Is it Qingzhi?

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,279
Come in.

61
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,360
Mr. Xu.

62
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,439
Did he really say that?

63
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,319
Mr. Xu.

64
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,879
My brother is a simpleton.

65
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,399
I'll talk to him.

66
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,079
I won't stoop to his level.

67
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,519
But I really cannot

68
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,279
let him continue working there.

69
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,519
Can't you give him another chance?

70
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,000
I will let him know.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Do not take it

72
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,240
as if I'm picking on him over a small matter.

73
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,079
I helped him

74
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,079
get this job. Was it easy?

75
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,399
Frankly speaking,

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,480
security personnel

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
should be hired through open recruitment.

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,560
It was because you were out of options.

79
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,199
But him?

80
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,279
He went around telling everyone

81
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,560
that we are related.

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,839
His work attitude is improper.

83
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,839
His relationship with colleagues is bad.

84
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,560
The security chief had hinted to me twice.

85
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,160
If this continues

86
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,160
and something happens,

87
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,639
it will impact me directly.

88
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,040
Mr. Xu.

89
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,560
I get it.

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,480
My brother is not sensible.

91
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,160
It's caused you trouble.

92
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,720
I

93
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,879
apologize to you

94
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,279
on behalf of him.

95
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,040
This is

96
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,680
not the main reason

97
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,279
I wanted to see you.

98
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,680
Then...?

99
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,160
Look.

100
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,160
He's lost his job.

101
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,279
He can't be doing nothing at home.

102
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,160
So,

103
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,800
he

104
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,120
will go to you again.

105
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,480
And you'll have to do everything you can

106
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,360
to help him get a job.

107
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,360
Qingzhi.

108
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,000
No matter what,

109
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,360
you must not use

110
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:07,399
your power as the mayor's secretary
to get him a job.

111
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,879
No way.

112
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,920
I understand.

113
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,839
In this world,

114
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,639
there is something that you can do and cannot do.

115
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,560
As for using power for personal gain?

116
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,839
That's the greatest landmine.

117
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,800
This isn't a piece of advice.

118
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,079
It's a warning.

119
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,120
It's a grave matter.

120
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,680
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,480
Qinglai.

122
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,759
Why did you do it?

123
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,680
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

124
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:42,959
What did I do?

125
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,040
What's the matter, Qingzhi?

126
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,439
Xingfu.

127
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,759
A new aged care was built

128
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,480
in Yani's father's hometown.

129
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,120
It was from donations
given by those working outside the town.

130
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,800
Yani's father donated too.

131
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,720
And,

132
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,920
he has the highest position among the donors.

133
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,480
So the county invited him
to go and do the ribbon cutting.

134
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,759
Mr. Xu really looked forward to it.

135
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,120
Isn't it something to be proud of?

136
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,160
But the car from the county

137
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,199
reached the entrance of the Municipal Council

138
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,399
and got stopped by Qinglai.

139
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,879
He just wouldn't let them in.

140
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,199
What?

141
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,160
Did I do anything wrong?

142
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,279
Aren't you a man of principle?

143
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,199
The rule says

144
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,959
no visitors' vehicles are allowed in.

145
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,000
And no waiting at the gate.

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,319
It's written in black and white.

147
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,519
Is stopping them from entering all you did?

148
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,879
What did you tell them?

149
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,720
What did he say?

150
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,680
They said

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,600
they were there to pick up Mr. Xu.

152
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,000
And Qinglai said,

153
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,519
the Municipal Council has multiple Mr. Xus.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,319
Throw a stone and it could hit two.

155
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,720
What kind of words were those?

156
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Am I wrong?

157
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,680
There really are several Mr. Xus
at the Municipal Council.

158
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,560
How would I know which Mr. Xu he meant?

159
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,519
Lying through gritted teeth, aren't you?

160
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,439
Huh?

161
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,639
You're obviously trying to embarrass Mr. Xu.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,920
He got you the job.

163
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,720
Not only are you not grateful,

164
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,680
but you also treated him like this.

165
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,000
What do you think they'd think of us?

166
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,480
They can think about whatever they want.

167
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,680
I won't suck up to him.

168
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,120
At his age, he is still only a department director.

169
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,560
What's so great about that?

170
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,879
I'm like an electrical pole to him.

171
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,879
He always ignores me.

172
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,439
Since he ignores me,

173
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,439
why should I care about what he thinks?

174
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
So he complained to you?

175
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,360
Bring it up then!

176
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
A great department director he is.

177
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,240
So petty.

178
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
What's done is done.

179
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,480
Let him be.

180
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,279
Fine, Qinglai.

181
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,600
You can quit.

182
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,399
Qingzhi.

183
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:36,919
You...

184
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,759
Can't you forgive him this time?

185
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,559
It's hard to get a job in the city.

186
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,120
I was hoping

187
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,399
to bring our son here

188
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,639
once we earn enough money.

189
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,639
Xingfu.

190
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,720
It's not me wanting him to quit.

191
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,840
Mr. Xu doesn't want him to work there anymore.

192
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Rather than being fired,

193
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,159
it's better if Qinglai resigned on his own.

194
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,960
Qingzhi.

195
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,799
Sit down and talk.

196
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,720
I'll get you some water.

197
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,279
I'm not going to quit.

198
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,960
Go ahead and fire me if he dares.

199
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,879
Qinglai.

200
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,200
Can't you consider my relationship

201
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,279
with Yani?

202
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,879
Mr. Xu is very angry about what happened.

203
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,600
But he didn't mention it to Yani and Mrs. Xu

204
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,639
and spoke to me in private.

205
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
If you butt heads with him,

206
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,039
he will surely tell Yani and her mom.

207
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,320
Yani is not the biggest worry.

208
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,600
But Yani's mom has never liked me much.

209
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,960
Then let her be.

210
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,759
So if it's not her daughter,

211
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,840
you will be forced to be single?

212
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,639
What are you saying?

213
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,679
Let me speak!

214
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,320
Tell me, what have you done for the family?

215
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,200
I'm asking you.

216
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,159
You're always going on about Yani.

217
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Is losing

218
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,080
a marriage candidate

219
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,639
a bigger deal than your own family?

220
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,480
Besides, you chose to date her

221
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,360
all because she...

222
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,919
Her father is a county magistrate, right?

223
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,519
Turns out her father isn't the magistrate.

224
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,919
Even if he was,

225
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,120
he wasn't going to give our family a push.

226
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,960
Then what's the point of marrying the woman?

227
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,639
Qinglai!

228
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,279
You're in no position

229
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,600
to talk about Yani and me.

230
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,519
I know.

231
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,879
Over the years, I've owed a lot to our family,

232
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,679
to you.

233
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,159
I can pay them back myself.

234
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,879
But I won't let you criticize Yani!

235
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,919
And don't you use your so-called ideals

236
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,240
to speculate how other people act.

237
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
When I met Yani,

238
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,200
I didn't even know who her father was!

239
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,279
Just quit the job.

240
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,279
Okay.

241
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,960
I'll quit.

242
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,759
I've been wanting to for a while anyway.

243
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,480
But if I quit,

244
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,000
Qingzhi,

245
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,360
you will still get me a job.

246
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,360
Qinglai.

247
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,200
I don't have the ability.

248
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,960
Qinglai.

249
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,120
Xingfu.

250
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,399
If you need any help with living expenses,

251
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,200
I, Wang Qingzhi, can skimp on meals

252
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,360
just to help you.

253
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,360
But my hands are tied if it's about work.

254
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,720
Aren't you working as a secretary

255
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,799
for a high-ranking official?

256
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,440
Qinglai.

257
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,159
My boss isn't a high-ranking official.

258
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,159
Even if he was,

259
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,000
it's wrong for me to use the position
to get things done.

260
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
If you're willing to work hard,
you will surely make money.

261
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,440
Look at Xingfu.

262
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,559
She's doing pretty well, isn't she?

263
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,879
Xingfu, I have something to do. I have to go.

264
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,000
Qingzhi.

265
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,279
Qingzhi!

266
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,879
I helped you get to where you are.

267
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
Now that I'm in need,

268
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,240
you'll just ignore me, huh?

269
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,080
Fine!

270
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll quit tomorrow.

271
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,799
After I quit,

272
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,879
I'm going to pay your beloved
father-in-law a visit.

273
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,840
Wang Qinglai!

274
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Are you done?

275
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,960
When did you become like this?

276
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,960
He helped you get a job.

277
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,120
Rather than being thankful,

278
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,519
you tried to embarrass Yani's father
in front of him?

279
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,320
Are you proud of that?

280
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,960
Go on.

281
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,000
Let me see it.

282
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,240
You're a grown man.

283
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,639
Can't you survive without your little brother?

284
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Since coming to the city,

285
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,159
you've been complaining about everything.

286
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,440
Yes.

287
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,279
The reason we're here

288
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,759
is more or less because of me.

289
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,039
It's fine that you're upset with me.

290
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,159
But did you have to fight with your own brother

291
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,080
and make trouble for his father-in-law too?

292
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,279
Are we all in your debt or what?

293
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,840
Hello?

294
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,559
What is it, Xingfu?

295
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,200
Xingyun.

296
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,919
Can you do me a favor?

297
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,039
Help me look for a job.

298
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,200
What do you mean?

299
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,840
Xingfu.

300
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,559
Senior Guan just secured a big case.

301
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,879
You can't leave now.

302
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,279
It's not for me.

303
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,360
It's for Qinglai.

304
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,080
Qinglai?

305
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,840
Isn't he working as a security guard?

306
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,559
It's a long story.

307
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,840
He quit.

308
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,120
Just keep an eye out for me.

309
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:14,799
Xingfu.

310
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,879
If it's a job for you,

311
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,639
I'd be more than willing.

312
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:19,360
But...

313
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,279
you know how Qinglai is.

314
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,720
He's never held a serious job.

315
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,919
It's going to put me in an awkward position

316
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,919
if I were to recommend him to someone.

317
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,559
You could've just said no.

318
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,639
No need to explain.

319
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,240
It's fine.

320
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,240
Bye.

321
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,000
Wait, Xingfu.

322
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,440
I...

323
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,320
Xingfu.

324
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,360
Send this by courier

325
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,519
to this address.

326
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,720
Okay.

327
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,039
Hey, wait.

328
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,000
Hold on, Mr. Guan.

329
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,799
This.

330
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,600
Please sign it.

331
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,759
Hold it down.

332
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,799
Hello?

333
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,279
This is Fangyuan Law Firm.

334
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,720
We have a delivery.

335
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,960
Please come and retrieve it.

336
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,159
[Fangyuan Law Firm]

337
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:10,799
Okay.

338
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,360
We're moving next month, right?

339
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
Why have you started packing?

340
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,879
I thought

341
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,600
I should pack up the things we don't use.

342
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,159
When the other place is ready,

343
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
you could bring the stuff there bit by bit

344
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,320

345
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,440
A moving company could do that.

346
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,039
We have to spend our money wisely.

347
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,679

348

We can take the small stuff.

349

If only you could drive.

It'll be more convenient for you to move things.

You should work hard to become a modern person.

At the same time,

371

It's expensive to learn to drive.

Don't worry about that.

377

If you really want to do it,

378
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,360
it doesn't matter how expensive it is.

I can ask him.

00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,759
He can give you a discount.

383
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,639
What a coincidence.

384
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,759
Indeed it is.

387

I guess I'd equip myself first and wait.

00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,270
You don't want this, and you don't want that.

520
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,540
Then what is it you want?

521
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,820
Mommy.

522
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,670
He called you mommy.

523
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,750
He recognizes you now.

524
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,990
Don't drink so fast.

525
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,380
It's not good for you. Have some food.

526
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,430
Dad, drink up.

527
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,710
Go on, eat before it gets cold.

528
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,430
Happy Chinese new year!

529
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,060
Xingfu.

530
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,030
It's lit.

531
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,540
Come on.

532
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,710
Look.

533
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,300
Oh.

534
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,300
It's lit.

535
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,270
Beautiful!

536
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,860
-It's the Chinese new year.
-It's the Chinese new year!

537
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,230
Happy Chinese new year!

538
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,380
Qinglai, Xingfu.

539
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,190
Good to see you two.

540
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,910
Mr. Wan, wishing you a happy new year.

541
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,030
Yes, thank you.

542
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,190
Come on, greet the old sir.

543
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,230
Give the boy a red envelope.

544
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,300
Here's Mr. Wan.

545
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,990
Here you go.

546
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,140
Here.

547
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,820
A red envelope for you.

548
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,340
Thank Mr. Wan.

549
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,470
Prosperity for the new year.

550
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,340
Thank Mr. Wan.

551
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,510
You didn't have to bring gifts.

552
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,820
-Come on, take a seat.
-Sit.

553
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,710
I'll put them here.

554
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,580
Come on, Xingfu, sit here.

555
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,580
Qinglai can sit there.

556
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,470
Okay.

557
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,270
How long will you stay here?

558
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,190
Two or three days.

559
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,910
We wanted to see our boy.

560
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,670
Everyone says that.

561
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,860
To see their children.

562
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,340
What about the elderly?

563
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,510
-We visit them too.
-Altogether.

564
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,620
Come on.

565
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,470
All you young people

566
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,580
are the same.

567
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,990
Once you leave,

568
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,470
you don't come back.

569
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,580
Our Chuanmei is the same.

570
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,540
She'd call back once in a while.

571
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,270
But a phone call

572
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,270
just isn't the same as meeting face-to-face.

573
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,100
When you guys

574
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,990
reach my age, you'd understand.

575
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,780
Nothing is more important than family.

576
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,270
Your wife, kids, and a warm house matter more.

577
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,100
Mr. Wan.

578
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,060
I didn't think you'd say such a thing.

579
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,860
If you only cared about your wife,
kids, and a warm house,

580
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,580
Wan Village wouldn't be what it is today.

581
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,750
That's a different matter.

582
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,750
Times have changed.

583
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,230
If we didn't seek new opportunities elsewhere,

584
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,670
there would be no food to eat.

585
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,470
Now the residents of Wan Village

586
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,820
don't have to worry about their next meal.

587
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,910
Young people

588
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,060
leaving for better opportunities

589
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,510
is a good thing.

590
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:42,950
But,

591
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,300
do not forget

592
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,750
why you're doing it.

593
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,100
Don't dig yourself into a hole in the process

594
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,860
and bring harm to your family.

595
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,580
That wouldn't be worth it.

596
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,780
No matter how you venture

597
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,100
and how far you go,

598
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,860
you should always come home often.

599
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,380
Look.

600
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,990
In the blink of an eye,

601
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,510
the boy has grown so much.

602
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,060
You two

603
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,380
should spend more time with him.

604
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,430
Right?

605
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,100
Time flies.

606
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,910
You're a smart person,

607
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,780
Xingfu.

608
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,030
Qinglai is an honest man.

609
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,340
You have an inquisitive mind

610
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,300
and you're opinionated.

611
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,230
This

612
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,190
has to be taught as soon as possible.

Grow alongside him.

614
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,580
Then next time,

615
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,910
the kid will also be successful.

616
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,860
Am I right?

617
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,430
I'll put this outside.

618
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:36,780
Okay.

619
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,780
You've seen the photos, right?

620
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,950
The environment is pretty nice.

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,430
Yes, on the right.

00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,380
The industry is paying close attention
to this case.

625
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,430
No worries.

626
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,950
I'm well prepared for it.

Congrats.

You can finally drive.

Ms. Xingfu.

Do you mean to say the company
needs to get a new car

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,340
so that you could put your license to use?

669
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,510
Not to that extent.

670
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,540
But it took me so long to learn.

671

Okay, fine. I'll start.

692
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
I'm going to drive.

693
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,950
Don't be nervous.

694
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,380
I'm not.

695
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,140
No reason to be.

696
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,860
Go on and start.

697
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,140
Turn on the ignition.

698
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,540
Put it into drive.

699
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,820
Look in front.

700
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,910
Mr. Guan.

701
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,910
Thanks for today.

702
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,780
You helped me practice driving.

703
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,300
No need to thank me.

704
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,030
You knowing to drive is a good thing for me.

705
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,340
It'll be more convenient.

706
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,340
Right.

707
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,710
I can be your chauffeur.

708
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,190
You want to be the chauffeur?

709
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,060
So how many roles do you have now?

710
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,270
If you hire me as the chauffeur,

711
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,030
then I'll be the cleaner, receptionist,

712
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,100
and chauffeur.

713
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,060
Then,

714
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,750
perhaps you could give me a pay raise.

715
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,270
Want more money, do you?

716
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:14,910
(Guan Tao.)

717
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,270
(How nice it is)

718
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:16,910
(to be a modern person.)

719
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,670
What are you doing?

720
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,580
So you know where home is.

721
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,270
I told you, didn't I?

722
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,510
Guan Tao is teaching me to drive,

723
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,340
so I'd be back late.

724
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,140
Sure, go wild.

725
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,710
Looks like you're about to get ahead of yourself.

726
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,230
Are you asleep?

727
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,270
Let me tell you something.

728
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,100
Today, I drove on a big road for the first time.

729
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,620
I was so nervous.

730
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:14,990
The road...

731
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,860
You drove.

732
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,510
Good that you can drive.

733
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,270
Go to sleep.

734
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,270
It's late.

735
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,230
Qinglai.

736
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,430
Get up and eat.

737
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,670
Come on.

738
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,270
Wake up.

739
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,620
Don't touch me.

740
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,470
It hurts.

741
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:51,820
What happened?

742
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,230
What is this?

743
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,780
Did you get into a fight?

744
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,270
What fight?

745
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,710
Then why is there a bruise?

746
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,340
The goods fell on me

747
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
while I was moving them at the station.

748
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,950
Does it hurt?

749
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,580
Your arm is injured.

750
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,910
Maybe you should take a rest today.

751
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,300
I can't afford to.

752
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,300
Morning,

753
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,990
modern

754
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:33,990
person...

755
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,030
Morning, Mr. Guan.

756
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,030
What's the matter?

757
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,020
Nothing.

758
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:44,740
What is it?

759
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,220
You seem kind of down.

760
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:47,980
I...

761
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,500
You could tell?

762
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,260
It's too obvious.

763
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,090
What's wrong?

764
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,610
Mr. Guan.

765
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,940
Can I

766
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,260
ask you for a favor?

767
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,020
Could you help

768
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,090
Qinglai get a job here?

769
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,130
Qinglai is still jobless?

770
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,220
That's right.

771
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,890
He hasn't found any permanent job.

772
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,650
He only worked some one-off gigs,

773
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,330
earning enough to pay for his next meal.

774
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,810
And he got injured.

775
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,810
It hurts me to see him being like this.

776
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,570
That's odd.

777
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,810
He's quite capable, isn't he?

778
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,060
Yeah.

779
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,300
In our hometown,

780
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,650
he always did physical work.

781
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,810
He never complained.

782
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,370
I don't know why,

783
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,460
but after coming here,

784
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,500
he is unable to settle down.

785
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,060
He can't find any suitable jobs.

786
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,500
You suddenly asked me like this.

787
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,170
I...

788
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,220
Our law firm is expanding.

789
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,260
Work has increased.

790
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,460
If we were still at our old office,

791
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,060
you could manage the front desk

792
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,780
and menial work by yourself.

793
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,780
But the way it is now,
it's not going to be sustainable.

794
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,330
We were thinking about

795
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,060
hiring a handyman specifically.

796
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,410
Do you think

797
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,540
Qinglai can do it?

798
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,820
Right, why haven't I thought of it?

799
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,980
Qinglai can...

800
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,770
He can do all the menial work.

801
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,380
But make sure you get this, Xingfu.

802
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,500
Qinglai

803
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,610
will be paid the handyman's salary.

804
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,500
Though it might be more

805
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,770
than what you've gotten,

806
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,860
it's still a low sum.

807
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,340
Think about it.

808
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,900
Mr. Guan.

809
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,210
What about

810
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,980
you pay Qinglai the receptionist's salary

811
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,420
and I'll take the handyman's salary.

812
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,060
I will continue to be the receptionist.

813
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,420
The two of us can switch.

814
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,770
That won't do.

815
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,060
A role's salary is fixed.

816
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,290
The receptionist is paid 4,000 a month.

817
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,170
The handyman gets 2,500.

818
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,500
You agreed.

819
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,290
Yes.

820
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,250
But Qinglai is prideful.

821
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,090
I worry

822
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,210
that when he finds out I earn more than him,

823
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,770
he won't want to do it.

824
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,090
We're a married couple anyway.

825
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,420
We're in the same boat.

826
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,820
As long as the company

827
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,020
doesn't have to pay more, it's fine, right?

828
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,690
Xingfu.

829
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,380
Humans

830
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,650
can become spoiled.

831
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,060
You really shouldn't spoil him like this.

832
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,940
We're husband and wife.

833
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,090
Looking after each other's interest

834
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:12,730
is only right.

835
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,650
You want to be a modern person, right?

836
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,610
Then you should live

837
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,570
according to modern family ideals.

838
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,020
I'm telling you it's not right
to continue on like this.

839
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,090
It's against the rule.

840
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,060
You're only harming him and yourself.

841
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,770
A married couple should be honest
with each other.

842
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,940
Even if it's with the best intention.

843
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,170
Besides, the law firm has its own rules.

844
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,770
The handyman gets 2,500 a month.

845
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:34,860
Tell him that.

846
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,460
He can come if he's okay with it.

847
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,420
The probation period is one month.

848
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,540
Okay.

849
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,540
Get ready.

850
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,540
We have an appointment to get to.

851
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,130
Oh,

852
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:42,610
okay.

853
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,210
Morning, Mr. Guan.

854
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:48,860
Morning.

855
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,170
It's still early.

856
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:53,820
You drive.

857
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,340
But it's more crowded in the city center.

858
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,650
I...

859
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,170
You have to go through this stage sooner or later.

860
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,860
What's the matter, Ms. Xingfu?

861
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,980
Scared?

862
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,540
Why should I be scared? I'll drive.

863
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,380
It's not my car anyway.

864
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,170
Hello?

865
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,420
Xingfu, you have to get back here.

866
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,940
The boy has a high fever!

867
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,380
Medicine didn't work.

868
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,460
He convulsed just now
and scared the heck out of me.

869
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,570
We're taking him to the village health center.

870
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,340
Please hurry back!

871
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,340
Okay, I'll go right away.

872
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,060
What's the matter?

873
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:31,690
Mr. Guan.

874
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,770
Can I take the day off?

875
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,690
My son has a high fever and spasmed.

876
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,770
I need to hurry back.

877
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,690
Here's the car key.

878
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,900
Get in the car.

879
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,380
Get in.

880
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,020
Okay.

881
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,210
Mr. Guan.

882
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,770
You can drop me off at the bus terminal.

883
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,860
What bus terminal?

884
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,940
This is urgent.

885
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,290
I'll take you right to Wan Village.

886
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,130
It is the quickest.

887
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,170
Don't you have an appointment in the afternoon?

888
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:58,980
That's...

889
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,380
It's fine.

890
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,250
Mr. Wang can take over.

891
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:11,650
Hello?

892
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,380
Qinglai.

893
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,250
(Our son is sick.)

894
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,380
(Hurry back to Wan Village.)

895
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:29,725
[Treatment Area]

896
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:36,770
Dad.

897
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:37,940
-How is the boy?
-Xingfu.

898
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,540
You're back.

899
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,340
How is he?

900
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,980
The doctor said

901
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,730
the spasms were caused by the fever.

902
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,060
The fever has gone down.

903
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,250
But

904
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,170
he has to be monitored for a night.

905
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,420
If the fever persists through the night,

906
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:51,860
then...

907
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,570
he has to be transferred.

908
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,770
Xingfu is here?

909
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,420
Come on.

910
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,210
I've never seen a child

911
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,090
become so hot.

912
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,130
He was convulsing non-stop. I was so scared.

913
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,610
We wouldn't have called you back
if it weren't so serious.

914
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,130
Oh.

915
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:09,940
Mr. Guan.

916
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,060
Where is Qinglai?

917
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,090
Qinglai is on his way back.

918
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,420
When you called me,

919
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,860
I was with Mr. Guan on official business.

920
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
He saw how anxious I was

921
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,770
and offered to drive me back here.

922
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:21,820
Goodness.

923
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,940
We're always troubling you.

924
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:24,860
It's nothing.

925
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,420
Thank you so much.

926
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,570
Dad, Mom.

927
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,250
Why don't you two go back and rest?

928
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,210
I'll stay here.

929
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,770
Okay.

930
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,500
Okay.

931
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:33,420
Well...

932
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,210
Mr. Guan.

933
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,900
Thanks for your help.

934
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,540
Take a break before you go back.

935
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,500
Dad, Mom.

936
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,570
Is there anything to eat at home?

937
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:39,980
Yes.

938
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,820
Mr. Guan drove me here.

939
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,770
He hasn't eaten anything.

940
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,060
Yes, there's food.

941
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,860
Come to our house. Eat and rest.

942
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,060
It's another 2 to 3 hours to drive back.

943
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:47,820
Xingfu.

944
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,690
I'll stay here.

945
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,460
The kid is still under medical observation.

946
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,570
If anything happens,

947
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,210
it will be more convenient having a car around.

948
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,340
No need to worry about me.

949
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,980
I will take care of myself.

950
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,690
That's a good idea.

951
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,900
We will go and prepare first then.

952
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,500
Thank you.

953
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,170
Thanks.

954
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,570
Dou.

955
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,820
It's my fault.

956
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,690
I...

957
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,770
wasn't able to be with you.

958
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,730
It caused you to suffer.

959
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,380
When you wake up,

960
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,020
you can give me a good beating, okay?

961
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,650
Here, Xingfu.

962
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,250
Have some water.

963
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,170
Thanks.

964
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,690
Xingfu.

965
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,340
Don't worry too much.

966
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,290
The doctor already said

967
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,940
that the boy's fever has gone down.

968
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,380
He just needs some rest.

969
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,570
He might be better after he has a sound sleep.

970
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,500
I hope so.

971
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:54,940
Mr. Guan.

972
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:56,770
Xingfu.

973
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,420
How is it?

974
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,290
The fever is gone.

975
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,020
He had a blood test.

976
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,210
There aren't any problems.

977
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,210
Let's wait for him to wake up.

978
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,730
Hello, Mr. Wu.

979
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,020
My apologies.

980
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,730
I couldn't make it this afternoon.

981
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,690
How did it go with Mr. Wang?

982
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,820
Yes, sure.

983
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,420
I will make it up to you.

984
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,340
Have you eaten?

985
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,540
No.

986
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,650
It's late.

987
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,820
Why hasn't Mr. Guan gone back?

988
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,770
The doctor said Dou's condition
hasn't stabilized.

989
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,860
He has to go to the Children's Hospital
if anything happens.

990
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,570
Mr. Guan has a car.

991
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,250
It's more convenient.

992
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,570
So he stayed.

993
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,380
Everything looks fine now.

994
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,820
You should ask him to go back.

995
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,900
He's been out and about the whole day.

996
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,570
It's not safe to drive at night.

997
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,980
Let him sleep at our house for today.

998
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,500
Qinglai, listen.

999
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,090
I spoke to Mr. Guan.

1000
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,460
I asked him if you could work at the law firm

1001
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,090
as a handyman like I did before.

1002
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,940
It's 2,500 a month.

1003
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,170
Will you do it?

1004
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:55,820
Sure.

1005
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,060
You...

1006
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,210
You agreed without hesitation.

1007
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,690
Why would I say no to 2,500?

1008
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:04,770
I...

1009
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,340
I was worried

1010
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,460
you'd think it's too low

1011
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:08,380
and wouldn't come.

1012
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:11,770
That's true.

1013
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:12,690
Then,

1014
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,940
don't tell other people
I'm earning less than you.

1015
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:16,690
That'll solve it.

1016
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,340
Of course I won't tell others. Why would I?

1017
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:20,940
It's fine then.

1018
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,460
I'll do it.
