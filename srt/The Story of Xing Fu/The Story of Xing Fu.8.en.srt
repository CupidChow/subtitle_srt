[The Story of Xing Fu]

2
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,950
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,799
Try it.

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,519
See if the temperature is right.

5
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,519
This is nice.

6
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,760
Look.

7
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,879
Everything is stated very clearly in the contract
that we signed with the village.

8
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,079
It's valid for 50 years.

9
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,519
Now, it's not even 10 years have passed.

10
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,439
How can they just change it?

11
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,799
The contract that we sighed with Guancai

12
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,560
is for 30 years.

13
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,359
We are in the right here.

14
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,439
The village can't just confiscate our land.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,120
What did you tell them today?

16
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,439
I didn't say much.

17
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:12,760
I just had a fight with Chuanjia.

18
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,719
Nothing came out of it.

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,280
Let's read the contracts through today.

20
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,439
Then, you can talk to the secretary
and the chief tomorrow.

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,000
Even if Chuanjia is being unreasonable,

22
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,520
they have to be reasonable, right?

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,039
I think it's better if you go.

24
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,120
I'm afraid that I can't explain things well.

25
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,759
Are you serious?

26
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,719
Look.

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,439
You are Party B.

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,240
You are the head of the household.

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,000
You have to stand out for this.

30
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,120
Chuanjia just spoke sarcastically to me
for that today.

31
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,000
It's different for our family, right?

32
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,000
Mom said

33
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,680
that you are the person in charge of this family.

34
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,240
In our family,

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,400
the women make houses, and the men make homes.

36
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,080
Look at you.

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,639
Aren't you afraid that the villagers
will laugh at you?

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,039
Why should I be afraid?

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,599
Having a capable wife

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,400
means that I'm capable too.

41
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,000
I know the contracts well.

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Why did you bring them here?

43
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,840
Mr. Wan.

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,439
We...

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,199
still want to turn that land

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
into a vegetable farm.

47
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,680
Besides, it's already stated

48
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,400
in the contracts.

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,039
Furthermore...

50
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,919
Mr. Wan.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
We don't understand.

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,800
There is so much land in the village.

53
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,520
Why do you have to take ours?

54
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
You know

55
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,680
my father-in-law and Qinglai

56
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,400
are very attached to the land.

57
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,599
Losing that land is like losing their souls.

58
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,080
Besides, to plant organic vegetables,

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,039
we've signed a contract with the distributor.

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,319
We have to supply them at regular intervals.

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,919
We've invested a lot of money in it.

62
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,000
We've just built the greenhouse.

63
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,560
You know about it too back then.

64
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,879
And you were quite supportive.

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,840
Yes.

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,400
I understand your situation.

67
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,639
I know your father-in-law even better.

68
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,400
Right?

69
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,599
Back then,

70
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:18,879
I was a bit concerned at first

71
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,840
when they decided to take your land.

72
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,000
But I never thought

73
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
that your father-in-law and Qinglai

74
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,199
would be

75
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,639
so understanding

76
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
that they agreed right at the spot.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,959
I felt so relieved.

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
Mr. Wan.

79
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,800
They didn't want to agree.

80
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,040
They were simply afraid to reject you.

81
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
They didn't want to upset you

82
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
and jeopardize your authority in the village.

83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,279
When they went back,

84
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,279
they were so upset.

85
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,879
They couldn't even eat.

86
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,360
That's why we are here today

87
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,399
to discuss it with you.

88
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,240
Why can't you choose another piece of land?

89
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,319
Xingfu.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,920
Actually,

91
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,160
we've discussed this

92
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,800
among the village council.

93
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,639
But based on our country's policy,

94
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,120
well,

95
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,040
we can't build a factory on farmlands.

96
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,279
Besides,

97
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,399
we don't have any other
complete piece of land

98
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,959
near the Health Products Factory
that we are going to build.

99
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:08,680
Right?

100
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,800
Only this floodplain of yours is available.

101
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,040
According to the policy,

102
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,279
this is land reclamation.

103
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,639
There's no problem with that.

104
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,959
So, this is just a coincidence.

105
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,160
I don't mean to make it difficult for your family.

106
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,120
Although

107
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,639
there were some complications

108
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,319
between your family and mine in the past,

109
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,199
But please don't overthink it.

110
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,800
We have to build

111
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,319
the factory.

112
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,480
And we have to use

113
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,000
this piece of land.

114
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,439
We have our reasons for doing so.

115
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,279
You are a reasonable person,

116
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:36,759
right?

117
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,319
There's this saying.

118
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,920
It's called collective interest
outweighs anything.

119
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,399
The minority should be subordinate
to the majority.

120
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,560
The majority wins.

121
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,480
I'm sure you understand.

122
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,600
So,

123
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,199
please go back and explain it to your family.

124
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:48,839
Right?

125
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,720
You can plant vegetables

126
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,800
anywhere you want.

127
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,560
For that,

128
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,120
the village council

129
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,199
will do our best to help you out.

130
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,199
As for

131
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,480
the compensation for your loss
from the land confiscation,

132
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,040
the village will pay you.

133
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,600
As for the material loss,
the Wanjia Group will pay for it.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,399
Alright?

135
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,519
With money,

136
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
you can plant your vegetables anywhere,

137
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,680
right?

138
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,759
There are so many villagers in Wan Village.

139
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,639
You can rent the land from them.

140
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,600
Right?

141
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,480
I had spent a lot of effort

142
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,399
on that land.

143
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,360
I worked on it from day to night.

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,399
I got rid of the weeds and fertilized it.

145
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,000
Our land is so fertile

146
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,399
that it can produce

147
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
100 jin more grains than others.

148
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,839
There are about a thousand families

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,240
in Wan Village.

150
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,079
We don't have many farmlands to begin with.

151
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,680
There are many good farmers in Wan Village.

152
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,959
But no one

153
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,600
can farm as good as I do.

154
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,199
They don't say it.

155
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,399
But they know it

156
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,800
in their hearts.

157
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,199
You can ask your mom about it.

158
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
That's right.

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,839
Unfortunately,

160
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,959
we are going to lose that land.

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,759
He has been bragging...

162
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,720
Drink slowly.

163
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,480
about this for decades.

164
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,600
Now,

165
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,519
he's going to lose his land.

166
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,920
He can't brag anymore.

167
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,839
I can finally be at peace now.

168
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,319
Are you a farmer?

169
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,800
I am.

170
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,720
Then, you should work on it as much as you can.

171
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,439
I am but I don't want to.

172
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,920
Didn't you see that I have done my best to give my children

173
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,360
the best education they could get all these years?

174
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,600
Qingzhi

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,040
is a postgraduate student.

176
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,959
If Xiuyu

177
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,199
had done well in the college entrance exam,

178
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,800
she would've graduated from the university now.

179
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,759
Qinglai was the most miserable.

180
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,319
He was asked to collect feces

181
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,920
around the village since young

182
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,879
so he's into farming.

183
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,600
Or else,

184
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,480
he would've been a great student too.

185
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,160
I think so too.

186
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
Why do you always have to oppose me?

187
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,360
Go and live in the city

188
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,639
if you can.

189
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,879
Don't' stay here.

190
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Do you think I don't want to?

191
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,600
Let me tell you.

192
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,199
When Qingzhi is married

193
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,480
and has a son,

194
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,120
I'll go there and take care of his child for him.

195
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,199
When I'm free, I'll go for the square dancing.

196
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,800
I'll buy a scarf.

197
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,600
Then,

198
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,120
I'll take a photo for you.

199
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,319
Yay.

200
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,160
Moreover, I'll hang my photo in this house

201
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,959
so you'll be pissed off all the time.

202
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Drink less.

203
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,879
Xingfu.

204
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
What else did Mr. Wan say?

205
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,480
How much are they going to compensate us?

206
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,560
For the compensation for the land,
the village has a standard for it.

207
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,040
As for the material loss,

208
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,000
they asked us to make a detailed calculation

209
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,360
and give it to the Wanjia Group.

210
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,560
The group will take a look at it.

211
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,079
Tomorrow,

212
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,279
I'll go and find another piece of land
in the village that we can use.

213
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,560
I have to be quick.

214
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,079
I have to plant the vegetables

215
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:38,519
before spring,

216
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,240
right?

217
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,840
Qinglai.

218
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,720
In my opinion,

219
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,080
after they pay us the compensation,

220
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,440
you should quit farming too.

221
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,799
Come and work with me in the Wanjia Group.

222
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,679
Won't it be nice to work in an office?

223
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,399
I would have worked there if I could.

224
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,279
But I can't.

225
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,200
You'll have to take orders from someone else.

226
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,000
Right?

227
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,799
I...

228
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm not a good talker either.

229
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,080
To work with someone,

230
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,120
you have to converse with them, right?

231
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,600
I can't do that.

232
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,080
They don't farm because they are lazy.

233
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,360
If I work harder,

234
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,559
I can earn more than you do in the factory.

235
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,240
It's true.

236
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,759
For this organic vegetable greenhouse,

237
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,360
according to your sister-in-law's proposal,

238
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,879
having a yearly income

239
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,879
of 150,000

240
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,039
is not just a dream.

241
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,039
We can even earn

242
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,519
200,000 per year.

243
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,519
You usually don't talk much.

244
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,559
When have you become so ambitious?

245
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,159
I've calculated it with Xingfu.

246
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,320
You can ask her.

247
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,279
Have you finished dinner, Dad?

248
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,399
Isn't this amazing?

249
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,120
Chuanjia.

250
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,879
Is this what a father should do?

251
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,000
He hasn't even finished his food yet

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
and you are already playing with him.

253
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,440
As his father,

254
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,159
you should become his role model.

255
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,159
Do I have

256
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,399
to force-feed him when he doesn't want to eat?

257
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,360
Come.

258
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,639
Let me feed you.

259
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,320
Come on.

260
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,879
Good boy.

261
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,600
Egg.

262
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,080
You want the egg?

263
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,279
Okay. Here's the egg.

264
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,639
See? He's not full yet.

265
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,279
Here's the egg.

266
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,000
Why do you

267
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,279
keep your eyes on me all the time?

268
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm full now.

269
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,440
I want to play.

270
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,080
Here you go.

271
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,679
-Continue to spoil him then.
-Are you full now?

272
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,080
You take it.

273
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,120
Continue to spoil him then.

274
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,639
I don't know how to play.

275
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,600
You'll pay for it.

276
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,639
I'm talking to you.

277
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,440
Can you listen to me?

278
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,840
Go ahead.

279
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,080
I'm already an adult now.

280
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,679
Can you show me some respect?

281
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,919
Don't always lecture me anywhere you like.

282
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,679
I can even manage a big group well.

283
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,399
Everyone respects me.

284
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,200
But why

285
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,600
do you always have to find fault in me?

286
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,360
Are you kidding?

287
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,519
Do you think they respect you?

288
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,279
They are doing it

289
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,600
out of respect for me.

290
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,480
Fine.

291
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,559
Yeah, right, respectable man.

292
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,480
You are the one that brings the good

293
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,440
and I'm the one that causes all the trouble.

294
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,360
That has nothing to do with this.

295
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,799
I'm strict with you

296
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,159
for your own good.

297
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,039
Right?

298
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,080
You shouldn't get irritated

299
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,840
whenever someone criticizes you,

300
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,360
be it serious matters or trivial things.

301
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:43,960
Well, that person,

302
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,759
answer me.

303
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,559
did Xingfu go to Wanjia Group
to talk to you yesterday?

304
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
How did you treat her?

305
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
What did you tell her?

306
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,120
What did you hear?

307
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Did she complain to you?

308
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,000
What did she say?

309
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,159
How can she be so shameless?

310
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,039
Don't say that.

311
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Is this how you should talk in front of your son?

312
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,000
You are the head of Wanjia Group.

313
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,120
You need to learn
how to get along with the villagers.

314
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,120
You need to find a way.

315
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,559
Even the superiors and leaders
that come here for inspection

316
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,559
are humble

317
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,240
and calm.

318
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,000
You are the head of Wanjia Group.

319
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,080
But you are always

320
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,279
so harsh on the villagers

321
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,399
and acting all arrogant.

322
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,000
How...

323
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,840
How can you lead Wanjia Group well like this?

324
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,320
I learn it from you.

325
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,159
When you were young,

326
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,440
you and your gang fought so much

327
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,159
with those from the other villages.

328
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,320
And you didn't go easy on those rogues

329
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,519
in the village.

330
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,039
But now, you are lecturing me about it.

331
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,480
I didn't have a choice back then.

332
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,799
Time is different now.

333
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,600
We are more advanced now.

334
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,440
You have to change too.

335
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,240
Moreover, I've realized my mistake now.

336
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
I have so many other strong points.

337
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Why do you only remember

338
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
the bad points from the past?

339
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,399
Fine.

340
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:48,720
I...

341
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,840
I'll try to observe

342
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,639
and see if I can find any strong points in you.

343
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,279
Spare the rod, spoil the child.

344
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,039
You should think about that too.

345
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,799
Rather than lecturing me here,

346
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,360
you should reflect on yourself.

347
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,960
I shouldn't have raised you.

348
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,000
Taotao.

349
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,000
This child.

350
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,320
Taotao, slow down.

351
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,759
The contracts.

352
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,440
Chunxian, hurry up.

353
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,840
You are here right on time.

354
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,720
This is mine.

355
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,559
Come and take a look at the contract.

356
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,600
This is yours, Fusheng.

357
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,559
Here. This is for your family, Qinglai.

358
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:17,759
[5.2 acres; 8,600 per acre.
Total compensation: 255,840 yuan]

359
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,480
Guancai.

360
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,120
This is yours.

361
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,679
All of you are here, right?

362
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,200
Since you are all here,

363
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,159
please take a seat.

364
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,000
Let the meeting begins.

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,600
Come.

366
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,960
Lately,

367
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,799
Mr. Wan is busy

368
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,600
with the construction of the factory.

369
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,879
So, he is at Wanjia Group right now.

370
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,720
But we have to proceed

371
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,759
with the land acquisition issue

372
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,840
as soon as possible.

373
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,480
So,

374
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,879
I'll be in charge of this.

375
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,519
Well.

376
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,080
Based on the country's policy

377
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,960
and

378
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,879
the land appraisal

379
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:50,960
that we did on your land,

380
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,039
the village council

381
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,200
has come up with the proposal

382
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,720
that you have with you right now.

383
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,519
Take a look at it carefully.

384
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,799
If you agree to it,

385
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,039
please sign your name.

386
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,080
Later,

387
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,720
our accountant

388
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
will transfer the money to you.

389
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,840
And we'll consider

390
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,960
this settled.

391
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,480
This is so unfair.

392
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,639
Why do they have more than 200,000

393
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,039
while I only get around 50,000?

394
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,720
200,000?

395
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
Why are you shouting?

396
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,759
This...

397
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,960
It's done according to the country's policy.

398
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,159
It equals the average yield of every acre

399
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,559
of the past three years times six.

400
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,159
This is

401
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,759
how we got the number.

402
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,480
Moreover, did you ever

403
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,120
take care of your land?

404
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,279
It is barren.

405
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,039
We calculated it

406
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,440
with two rice harvesting seasons each year.

407
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,559
Right? It's 1,600 yuan

408
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,480
for each acre of land.

409
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,600
How much is it when you multiply it by six?

410
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,879
Six times six is 36.

411
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,279
So, it's 9,600, right?

412
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,559
Your family has a total of 5.2 acres of land.

413
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,440
If we multiply them,

414
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,919
it'll be 49,920 yuan.

415
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,320
In the end, the village has given you 50,000.

416
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,559
And you are still complaining?

417
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,759
Why are you giving Qinglai's family

418
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,759
more than 200,000 then?

419
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,960
Don't you know what they are growing on that land?

420
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,840
They plant organic vegetables.

421
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,960
They work every day from day to night.

422
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,399
Their land

423
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:09,960
is their main source of income.

424
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,600
Right?

425
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,039
How can you compare your land with theirs?

426
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,519
Their land is calculated

427
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,600
by 8,200 per acre.

428
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,559
Right?

429
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,840
I have vegetables on my land too.

430
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,639
Are you the one who planted them?

431
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,799
They are planted by Qinglai.

432
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,399
I don't care.

433
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,200
You need to be fair.

434
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,240
Where's Mr. Wan?

435
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,679
I need to talk to my uncle.

436
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,039
About what?

437
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,279
You can try and complain about this to him.

438
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,960
He'll surely give you a good lesson.

439
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,399
You want

440
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,759
to take this to your uncle?

441
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,159
I've asked you to come here today

442
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,759
to discuss this,

443
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,519
right?

444
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,320
These are the proposals we have made.

445
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,900
Take a look.

446
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,610
If you have a problem

447
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,970
or a question, you can bring it up.

448
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,850
Then, we can

449
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,780
explain to you

450
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
and discuss it properly.

451
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,730
Don't...

452
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,780
be so unreasonable with your nonsense.

453
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,210
Who is being unreasonable?

454
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,380
Look.

455
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,570
Look.

456
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,490
Look at it yourself.

457
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,940
Am I being unreasonable?

458
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,690
Look at it yourself.

459
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,090
Who is the unreasonable one here?

460
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,610
Our family has 5.2 acres of land.

461
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,420
We get 49,000.

462
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
Next, Chunxian's family.

463
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,660
Look at it yourself.

464
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,090
They have more than 50,000 for 5.3 acres of land.

465
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,660
Wang Qinglai's family has 5.2 acres of land too.

466
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,970
Why do they get 200,000?

467
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,810
How is this fair?

468
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,780
They get more than the three of us put together.

469
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,570
Are you two mutes?

470
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,810
Say something.

471
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,020
I have no problem with this.

472
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,380
As long as it's based on the policy

473
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,420
and it's fair.

474
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,210
It's not fair at all.

475
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:36,810
Fusheng.

476
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,940
Mind your language.

477
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,540
Let's go.

478
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,900
You treat an outsider

479
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,300
better than your own family.

480
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,900
What kind of a world are we in right now?

481
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,140
Guancai!

482
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,660
What is it?

483
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,300
Guancai.

484
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,420
Mom.

485
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,330
They are all gone now.

486
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,570
Let's go too.

487
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,140
Mr. Cailiang.

488
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,900
How about you inform us again
after you've made up your mind?

489
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,260
I have to go home now.

490
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,180
Let's go.

491
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,090
Go ahead and throw a tantrum then.

492
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,540
Mr. Cailiang.

493
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,380
This is just the compensation for the land.

494
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,300
What about our investment in the greenhouse

495
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,380
and the vegetables that we've planted?

496
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,020
Look.

497
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,210
I'm just

498
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,180
in charge

499
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,060
of the compensation for the land.

500
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,380
For the material loss,

501
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,060
Wanjia Group will compensate you for it.

502
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,330
But don't worry.

503
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,850
We'll pay you fair and square.

504
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,260
We won't give you less than it should be.

505
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,060
Wanjia Group

506
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,360
will compensate you

507
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,759
based on the receipts

508
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,840
of your total investment.

509
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,679
After you've settled the account,

510
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,240
you can send all the receipts to Wanjia Group.

511
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,039
We didn't know this would happen.

512
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,480
So, we didn't ask for a receipt
for a lot of things.

513
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,679
You have no receipts?

514
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,000
Then, it'll be a problem.

515
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,679
Well...

516
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:53,559
Well...

517
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,960
This Health Product Factory

518
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,519
is a joint business.

519
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,399
When we check the account,

520
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,320
we have to tally ours with theirs.

521
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,279
So we have to be strict about it.

522
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,360
No matter what,

523
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,480
you have to get us the receipts.

524
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:07,600
Okay.

525
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,480
We'll figure it out then.

526
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,880
The labor cost of laying the pipeline is 4,000.

527
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,160
Greenhouse building,

528
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,599
4,000.

529
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,079
Material cost, 260,000.

530
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,640
Back then, in order to cut down some costs,

531
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,839
they didn't give us a receipt for it.

532
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,240
I think it should be more than that.

533
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,640
Now.

534
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,119
I have to go to the farm to do some calculations.

535
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,720
Let me go with you.

536
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,799
It's okay.

537
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,880
You are pregnant now.

538
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,720
I can go by myself.

539
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,559
You can continue with the calculation.

540
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,039
Okay.

541
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,480
That's what happened.

542
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,119
I have already given them the proposals.

543
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,000
Qinglai didn't say anything.

544
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,200
They just asked about the compensation
for the material loss.

545
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,759
I told them

546
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,640
that Wanjia Group will pay them separately.

547
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,039
Chunxian was fine with it too.

548
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,480
Guancai is the one who started it.

549
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,720
Later, Fusheng went along with him.

550
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,720
I think the problem

551
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,839
lies in Guancai.

552
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,920
When he got

553
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:13,880
too out of line,

554
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,440
I lectured

555
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,799
your niece.

556
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,240
You should've kicked him.

557
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,880
What a rascal.

558
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,559
He's just

559
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,400
jealous of what Qinglai is going to get.

560
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,680
Yes.

561
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
I wasn't cautious enough.

562
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,119
I should've

563
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,119
talked to them separately.

564
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,319
Then, this wouldn't have happened.

565
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,440
There's no need to.

566
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,519
We have nothing to hide.

567
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,359
Moreover, we are just following the policy.

568
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,680
If you talk to them one by one,

569
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,000
they'll be even more suspicious of each other.

570
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,279
Then, there'll be more speculations.

571
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,000
Tell them

572
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,119
if they keep being unreasonable,

573
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,960
we will compensate them
on the lowest compensation rate

574
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,000
instead of the highest.

575
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,839
I'll tell him tomorrow.

576
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,880
You have to go to the city tomorrow

577
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
to work on the loan, right?

578
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,279
I've forgotten about it.

579
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,279
I still have some time now.

580
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,799
Ask him to come here. I'll talk to him.

581
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,039
Hello?

582
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,440
Hi.

583
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,400
Is this the Jinhua Xiangrui Pipe Fitting Factory?

584

(We purchased)

(Can you help me check the record)

588

(I have to refer this to our Finance Department.)

590
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,599
Can you give me the contact number
of your Finance Department?

591
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,119
Jot this down then.

592
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:20,799
Okay.

593
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,839

[Kebao Agriculture]

595
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,160
Stop knocking. Come in.

596
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,640
Uncle, are you looking for me?

597
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,920
I saw the jujube that you like on my way here.

598
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,599
I had washed them before I came up.

599
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,839
You are quite thoughtful.

600
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,240
But you used it in the wrong place.

601
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,279
I was weak when I was young.

602
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,440
But I'm not foolish.

603
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,799
You are not foolish.

604
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,440
You are too smart.

605
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,519
Let me ask you.

606
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,319
Why did you make a ruckus about the compensation

607
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,240
for the land acquisition?

608
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,720
Uncle.

609
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,319
Why can Wang Qinglai's family get so much money?

610
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,119
Because they are diligent,

611
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,680
they work hard.

612
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,960
They work from day to night,

613
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,519
to take care of their land

614
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,519
Okay.

615
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,039
If you can earn

616
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,079
around ten thousand per year from your land,

617
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,279
I'll compensate the same amount to you
according to the times-six standard.

618
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,160
Look at you.

619
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,400
You plant the seeds in spring

620
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,000
and you leave them untended until autumn.

621
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,119
The yield of your crops
is not even enough to feed birds.

622
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,480
How dare you compare yourself to them.

623
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,480
I'm physically weak. You know that!

624
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,680
Wanjia Group

625
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,319
has given you an easy job.

626
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,680
Did you do it well?

627
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,359
Coming in late, leaving early,
and being absent without approval.

628
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,599
You've done it all.

629
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,960
Do you think I don't know that?

630
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,039
I didn't hold you accountable for it

631
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:46,960
for the sake of your dad.

632
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,680
I even asked you

633
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,240
to come to my office to talk about this.

634
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,759
Do you think anyone can come here?

635
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,279
You better not take this for granted.

636
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,480
Let me tell you.

637
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,160
Wanjia Group has given

638
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,759
the highest compensation rate

639
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,759
for your land.

640
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,519
Shut up

641
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,720
and sign the contract.

642
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,640
Stop creating any more trouble.

643
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,000
No.

644
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,039
Say that again?

645
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,759
I can't accept it.

646
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,400
I won't sign it.

647
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,599
What do you mean by that?

648
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,559
What rights do you have?

649
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,079
Why is an outsider getting more money

650
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:15,759
than me?

651
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:16,480
You are just jealous!

652
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,119
I won't accept it!

653
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:17,559
You...

654
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,680
You won't?

655
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,640
I'll ask your dad to break your legs.

656
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,160
How about now?

657
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:21,960
Get out!

658
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
I won't accept it even if you hit me!

659
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,480
Get out.

660
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,119
I won't accept it!

661
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,599
I won't sign it!

662
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,240
Sign it in no time!

663
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,359
I won't!

664
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,839
That rascal.

665
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,039
Cailiang.

666
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,319
Well.

667
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,480
I've already talked to Guancai

668
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,920
about the land compensation.

669
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,039
He has no objection.

670
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,000
Another thing.

671
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:53,920
Cailiang.

672
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,119
We are all from the same village.

673
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,920
We should take care of them as much as we can.

674
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,519
For the three families,

675
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,359
give them another 20,000 in cash

676
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,240
for extra care.

677
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,599
Tell them that they don't have to

678
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,599
return the rent to Qinglai's family.

679
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,000
The village will pay for it.

680
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,480
Yes. Draw up

681
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,240
a new contract for them.

682
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,359
Ask them to sign it and settle this soon.

683
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,920
I have too many things to do

684
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,599
at the Group right now.

685
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,279
I'll leave the village to you.

686
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,920
Back then, we had savings of 176,000.

687
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,000
Together with my 30,000,

688
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,160
and the 200,000 loans from the bank,

689
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,640
it's a total of 406,000.

690
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,240
The construction of the greenhouse,

691
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,039
including the materials and the labor cost,

692
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
and the vegetable seeds that we bought

693
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,200
cost us a total of 396,000.

694
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:42,200
But after organizing
all the receipts with Qinglai,

695
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
we only got the receipts for less than 320,000.

696
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,599
We don't have the receipts

697
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,920
for the rest of the 70,000.

698
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,519
We might not be able to get them back.

699
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,519
How much?

700
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,480
Seventy thousand?

701
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:55,960
Xingfu.

702
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:56,680
Well...

703
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,720
We let you manage the family.

704
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,079
Is this how you do it?

705
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,359
Dad.

706
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,440
Back then, I wanted to save as much as I could.

707
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,839
To pay less interest,

708
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,079
I only borrowed 20,000 from the bank

709
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,480
and spent it on only the necessary things.

710
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,319
But the inflation rate is very high right now.

711
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,839
If we bought everything at the original price,

712
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,559
400,000 would not be enough at all.

713
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,359
I wanted to save as much as I could

714
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,759
and get the lowest price possible

715
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:15,759
so I didn't ask for a receipt

716
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,400
when I bought them

717
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,240
But Cailiang said they needed proper receipts

718
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,279
to compensate us for the material loss.

719
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,240
We had contacted the factory
where we bought those things.

720
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,400
They said

721
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,119
they can only give us an invoice
or a written statement,

722
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:32,079
but not a proper receipt.

723
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,200
I don't know if we can explain

724
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,920
our situation to them.

725
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:36,920
It'll be pointless.

726
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,720
They are running on
a proper entrepreneurial management system.

727
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,480
All rules are stated clearly.

728
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,839
Especially the Finance Department.

729
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,279
How do you know that?

730
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,400
Are you an expert?

731
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,359
I've told you.

732
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,759
I'm getting an accounting certificate
to work in the Finance Department.

733
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,599
[Financial Management]
I've learned about this.

734
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,799
I don't know why you have to
go on a wild-goose chase.

735
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,200
What's wrong with working in the office?

736
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,559
Do you have to work in the Finance Department?

737
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,599
You are going on a wild-goose chase.

738
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,759
Same with you here.

739
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,519

00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,440
Hey.

741
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,160
You are running off the topic.

742
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,839
We are not done with this compensation issue yet.

743
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:08,519
You are right.

744
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:10,000
Let's settle this first.

745
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,079
Xingfu.

746
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,799
This is 70,000 that we are talking about.

747
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,400
Your mom and I barely managed to earn 100,000

748
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,559
by working hard and living frugally.

749
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,480
Now, 70,000 is gone just like this.

750
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,559
What did I say at first?

751
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,240
I knew that this wouldn't work.

752
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,400
You spent so much money on this.

753
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,240
See what happens now?

754
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,880
But you said we should put it into practice
when we have an idea.

755
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,799
See?

756
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,000
What now?

757
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,799
Dad.

758
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,960
Xingfu just wanted

759
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,160
to make more money.

760
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,079
Did she make it?

761
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,400
Did she?

762
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,720
She did everything for nothing.

763
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:43,599
Dad.

764
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,079
Calm down first.

765
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,519
I admit

766
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,880
when I started this,

767
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,440
I didn't think of the consequences.

768
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,559
I'm the one who created this problem.

769
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,119
I'll deal with it myself.

770
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,799
Tomorrow, I'm going

771
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,279
to explain our situation to them.

772
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,759
I've also called my younger sister.

773
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,559
She has inquired about it for me.

774
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,920
She told me that it was negotiable.

775
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,200
As long as both parties
agree to draw up an agreement,

776
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,440
they can still compensate us without the receipts.

777
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,920
If it doesn't work,

778
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,279
I'll hire a third party to do the cost estimation.

779
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,119
If we do that,

780
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,799
we won't lose this much money.

781
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,200
It's still a loss

782
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,279
no matter how much it is.

783
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,559
Are you done?

784
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:27,960
Chuanjia,

785
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,960
can we talk to Mr. Wan about this?

786
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,519
He's the chairman.

787
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,039
He has no time

788
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,559
for this kind of minor issue.

789
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,440
I've always been in charge

790

of the company's finance.

Even if you go to him,

he'll refer you back to me.

00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:44,960
Okay. Qinglai.

794

[Wanjia Group]

These receipts

add up to 317,680.

798

These are the supplementary invoices

that we've gotten from the factories

800

after we were told to prepare these materials.

801

They add up to around 70,000.

Please take a look.

803

Around 70,000?

806
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,720
You even have written receipts here.

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,559
Okay.

808
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:15,880
I got it.

Later,

810
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,000
I'll ask the Finance Department

811
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,960
to transfer the 317,000 and something

812

into your bank account.

813
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,880
Later, I'll draw up an agreement. After you sign,

this will be settled.

815

As for the other receipts

that are not in compliance with the protocols
of the Finance Department,

817
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,039
you should just forget about it.

818
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,880
No, Chuanjia.

819
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,400
You can't do this.

820

We've invested so much into it.

821

You can't just ask us to forget it.

822
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,079
It'll be a huge loss to us.

I didn't ask you to invest the money.

the village wants to take our land.

828
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,440
Or else, we wouldn't be facing this issue.

829
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,440
What do you mean by the village
wants to take your land?

830
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,200
The land is part of the state-owned assets.

No.

00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,000
Enough, Qinglai.

836
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,920
We have a set of rules and regulations.

837
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,319
I'll pay you everything that is stated

838
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,359
in these receipts.

839
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,920
As for the others,

840
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,880
stop pestering me with unreasonable demands, okay?

841
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:09,519
Well.

842
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,440
It's like this, Mr. Wan.

843
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,480
I had talked to your dad before this.

844
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,480
He told me

845
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,119
that the compensation policy says
you'll compensate us for whatever we've invested.

846
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,039
All of our losses

847
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:21,400
will be compensated by the party
who acquires the land.

848
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,160
We had invested more than 390,000 into this.

849
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,319
Including the 70,000.

850
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,440
But now, you insist on getting
the receipts from us.

851
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,319
That's why I got
these supplementary invoices for you.

852
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,160
Based on what your dad said,

853
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,319
Wanjia Group has to compensate us.

854
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,359
Stop talking

855
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,319
about what my dad said.

856
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:38,720
What is the meaning of this?

857
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,440
Are you

858
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,000
threatening me with my dad?

859
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,079
Let me tell you.

860
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,160
He only told you

861
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,440
the principles.

862
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,599
But I still have the final say

863
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,680
in this.

864
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,920
You have nothing to back you up.

865
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,559
And you want to ask me for 70,000?

866
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,720
What if you say
that you've invested 700,000 in it?

867
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,759
Do I have to give you the money too?

868
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,880
We've invested 70,000 in it.

869
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,720
We just want to get this amount back.

870
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,480
No way.

871
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,200
Let me tell you again.

872
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:01,400
I'll compensate you based on your proper receipts.

873
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,519
It's 317,680,

874
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,279
right?

875
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,000
I won't pay you a penny less.

876
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,480
I'll ask the Finance Department
to transfer it to you later.

877
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,400
But

878
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,279
other than that,
you won't get any more money from me.

879
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,480
Just tell me

880
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,799
whether or not you want this money.

881
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,240
How can I take it?

882
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:17,000
We invested more than 390,000 into it.

883
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,519
Now, you are just going
to give me back the 310,000.

884
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:19,400
Then, we'll lose

885
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,839
the rest of the 70,000 for nothing.

886
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,119
How can I explain it to my family?

887
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,599
If we can't come to an agreement,

888
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,279
we can hire a third party to do the cost estimation.

889
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,240
Everything that we are using is just there.

890
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,640
I'm not making this up.

891
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:35,960
Fine.

892
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,599
You want to hire a third party?

893
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,119
Okay.

894
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,200
Then, there's nothing else to say

895
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,240
between us.

896
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,160
Here.

897
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,319
Keep your things.

898
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,519
Xingfu.

899
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:53,440
Hello.

900
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,039
Xingyun.

901
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,240
Last time, you told me

902
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,079
about hiring a third-party evaluation agency

903
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,200
to do a cost estimation
on the materials of the farm.

904
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,039
Where can I find one?

905
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,039
Please ask around for me.

906
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,079
Yes. It's quite troublesome.

907
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,319
Okay. I got it.

908
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:13,880
How...

909
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,839
How can it end up like this?

910
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,000
I told you in the beginning that this wouldn't work.

911
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:18,640
You...

912
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,799
Why did you have to build a greenhouse?

913
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,400
We are farmers.
We should've farmed the traditional way.

914
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,960
Why did you have to go on a wild-goose chase?

915
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,640
Be quiet.

916
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,839
Qinglai.

917
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,640
Bring your wife to your room to rest.

918
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,039
Dad.

919
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:41,880
Mom.

920
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,119
Go and rest.

921
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,440
Be careful.

922
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:55,240
Are you out of your mind, old man?

923
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,279
Don't you know that Xingfu is pregnant?

924
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:59,200
She's carrying your descendent.

925
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:00,799
Moreover,

926
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,359
they are doing their best,
running around the village

927
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,680
to deal with this matter.

928
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,839
Did they ever goof off?

929
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,359
Are they happy that they can't get the money back?

930
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,880
You are their father.
But you can't offer any help to them.

931
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,920
All that you do

932
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,279
is nag them again and again.

933
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,559
How despicable.

934
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,839
But we are losing money.

935
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:19,680
Money?

936
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,279
Is that more important than Xingfu's baby?

937
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:32,880
Here.

938
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,319
Drink some hot water first.

939
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,359
Here.

940
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,319
Eat this.

941
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,400
This is delicious.

942
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,359
It's good for your body.

943
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,359
Are you tired?

944
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,559
Do you feel any discomfort in your stomach?

945
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,279
Seeing that our father is so anxious about it,

946
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:03,880
I feel bad too.

947
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,240
This is my fault.

948
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,119
He is always like that.

949
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,240
He is very fussy about money.

950
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,880
And it's a trigger for him.

951
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,279
He was not being personal.

952
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,359
Don't blame yourself.

953
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:18,240
Here.

954
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,759
Shall I call Qingzhi

955
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,519
to ask him about it?

956
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,519
Good idea.

957
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,039
What is it, Qinglai?

958
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,319
Qingzhi.

959
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,279
it's about

960
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,440
the land acquisition again.

961
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,440
At first, things were going well.

962
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,920
But because of the receipts,

963
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,240
we can't claim the amount of 70,000.

964
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,960
We have

965
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,920
no other choice.

966
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,559
That's why

967
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,119
I want to discuss it with you.

968
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,240
I can't explain it well.

969
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,680
I'll pass the phone to Xingfu.

970
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,519
Hello, Qingzhi.

971
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,440
Please go ahead, Xingfu.

972
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,279
You know that your brother and I
rented the land to build

973
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,079
a greenhouse, right?

974
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Now, we are having some disputes with the village

975
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,440
over the compensation.

976
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,850
Xingfu.

977
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,530
Farmland acquisition

978
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,770
is very complicated.

979
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,180
The situation is different

980
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,420
for each place.

981
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,900
But the issue with our family

982
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,330
is quite simple.

983
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,260
I don't think it's that complicated.

984
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,610
Besides,

985
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,130
the government has

986
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,980
a special Intervention Department
for farmland acquisition.

987
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,940
Here is my suggestion.

988
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,850
We can write down this issue in detail

989
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,220
in a letter.

990
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,020
Then, send it to the relevant department

991
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,770
to do an appeal.

992
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,530
The government is paying a lot of attention

993
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,050
to the issues related to
agriculture, farmer, and rural area now.

994
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,050
Their principle

995
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,740
is to make sure that the farmers
won't suffer any losses.

996
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,570
Okay.

997
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,220
I can explain this in detail.

998
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,740
But if I have to write a letter,

999
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,090
where should I send it to?

1000
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,370
Xingfu.

1001
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,940
You write the letter

1002
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,900
and I'll send it for you.

1003
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,660
What does he mean?

1004
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,740
I have to write it down.

1005
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,130
Lin, stop.

1006
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:20,980
Mr. Wan.

1007
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:23,730
Mr. Wan.

1008
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,210
I've been waiting a long time for you.

1009
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,500
Are you here to stop me?

1010
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,340
Yes.

1011
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,690
I want to talk to you.

1012
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,570
Sure.

1013
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,300
Lin, you can go back first.

1014
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:31,840
OK.

1015
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:32,780
What is it?

1016
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,130
Qinglai and Xingfu

1017
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,170
went to see Chuanjia...

1018
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:36,860
Hello, Mr. Wan.

1019
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,650
to talk about the compensation.

1020
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,050
It didn't end well.

1021
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,860
Actually,

1022
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,050
it was your fault.

1023
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:43,690
Yes.

1024
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,420
Chuanjia didn't do anything wrong.

1025
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,050
Yes.

1026
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:46,780
I know.

1027
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,130
My daughter-in-law

1028
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,300
is too ambitious.

1029
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,860
She insisted on building
a vegetable planting base.

1030
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,500
I told Qinglai

1031
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,380
to tell her

1032
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,530
to just enjoy her life as it is.

1033
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,860
But she refused.

1034
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,300
Mr. Wan.

1035
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,050
Look.

1036
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,250
If we indeed lose the 70,000,

1037
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,460
it'll be a huge blow to a small family

1038
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,420
like ours.

1039
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,530
I'm sure you know about our situation.

1040
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,300
Qinglai has just gotten married.

1041
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,130
Qingzhi

1042
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,530
is not married yet.

1043
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,340
Xiuyu doesn't even have a boyfriend.

1044
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,340
That money

1045
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,050
is really important to me.

1046
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,860
You are so troublesome.

1047
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,730
Yes.

1048
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,860
I'm so troublesome.

1049
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,300
Okay. I'll find out more about it.

1050
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,300
Let me see if I can solve it in another way.

1051
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,170
Because of this,

1052
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,210
my daughter-in-law has made a lot of calls

1053
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,610
and asked for help from a lot of people.

1054
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,090
According to her sister,

1055
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,610
we can

1056
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,530
hire a mediator

1057
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:35,940
to do the cost estimation.

1058
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,650
What do you mean?

1059
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,610
She wants to hire a mediator?

1060
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,340
I think so.

1061
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,420
Your daughter-in-law is really something.

1062
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,460
That's not true. She's overreaching herself.

1063
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,210
If she didn't make this mess,

1064
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,690
you wouldn't have to deal with such trouble,

1065
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,530
same for the villagers.

1066
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,250
Enough. I know it already.

1067
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,170
Okay.

1068
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,340
I'll think of a way.

1069
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,170
Okay.

1070
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:56,650
Okay now.

1071
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,300
I have to go now. I still have things to do.

1072
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,050
Come and drink with me when you are free.

1073
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:00,820
Okay.

1074
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,340
What?

1075
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,530
Drink?

1076
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,050
Drink?

1077
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,250
Are you eating?

1078
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,250
Why are you so late?

1079
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,250
Have you eaten?

1080
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,420
A pointless question.

1081
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,860
Would I be back at this time if I had eaten?

1082
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,170
Get him a set of cutlery.

1083
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,020
Be good.

1084
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,610
I had an impromptu meeting
with Mr. Liu at the company.

1085
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,860
We double-checked

1086
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,210
the date of the construction again.

1087
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,460
How is it going with the loan?

1088
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,900
Everything is ready on my side.

1089
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,130
Don't tell me

1090
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,650
you can't get the loan

1091
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,860
after we are ready with everything.

1092
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,250
We can start the construction
as soon as the loan is approved.

1093
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,050
Leave that matter to me.

1094
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,020
You've done well

1095
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,250
with the Health Products Factory this time.

1096
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,420
Good job.

1097
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,050
How much have you been drinking?

1098
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,650
You are even praising me.

1099
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,300
Are you drunk?

1100
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,210
Shut up.

1101
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,820
You

1102
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,570
should trust me more.

1103
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,420
Such as getting the loan.

1104
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,460
If you entrust it to me,

1105
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,460
I'll get it done nicely in spades.

1106
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,500
You should enjoy your life at home more.

1107
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,170
I want to do that too.

1108
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,020
But why do you

1109
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,340
always have to create

1110
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,730
additional problems

1111
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,050
when you do something?

1112
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,570
What is it again?

1113
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,570
Qinglai's land acquisition issue.

1114
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,980
Did you give them a hard time again?

1115
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,940
I'm in the right here.

1116
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,780
Don't wrongly accuse me.

1117
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,210
Even so, you have to be kind.

1118
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,130
They are a small family.

1119
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,500
It's not easy for them to run a business.

1120
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,530
They didn't have all the receipts
because they wanted to save money.

1121
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,690
Moreover,

1122
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,650
we can easily tell

1123
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,050
how much they have invested in their farm.

1124
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,420
Asking for 400,000 is not a lot.

1125
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,820
Moreover, the Wangs have been an honest family.

1126
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,780
They won't simply ask for more.

1127
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,650
I admit

1128
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,860
that I don't like their daughter-in-law.

1129
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:45,860
See?

1130
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,020
I knew it.

1131
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,420
This is your problem.

1132
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,090
You bully her

1133
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,380
now that you find a chance.

1134
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,300
I don't have to.

1135
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,420
Helping her is being kind.

1136
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,690
Not helping her is being just.

1137
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,090
She's asking me for a favor, right?

1138
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,210
But she's always so arrogant.

1139
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,300
Whenever I think about the notice you put up,

1140
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,610
I get so mad.

1141
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,020
She even told me

1142
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,500
that she would hire someone
to do the cost estimation.

1143
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,980
She can go ahead and do that.

1144
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,940
It's still up to me to decide its validation.

1145
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:11,820
Look at

1146
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,900
this personality of yours.

1147
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,130
What good can you do?

1148
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,940
I was hoping you could take over Wanjia Group

1149
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,820
to be my successor

1150
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,250
and the head of Wan Village.

1151
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,940
But you are so petty.

1152
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,690
How can you hold a grudge
against a powerless villager?

1153
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,980
I just want to put her in her place.

1154
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,420
She needs to be more down-to-earth

1155
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,500
and know her place.

1156
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,460
Enough.

1157
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,980
Act wisely while you can.

1158
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,460
The Wang family already knows
how powerful you are.

1159
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,820
On my way back today,

1160
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,610
Youde was waiting for me by the roadside

1161
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,090
to talk to me about this.

1162
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:41,980
Chuanjia.

1163
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,780
You have to show some respect to them.

1164
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,570
Moreover, the project will start soon.

1165
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
If you can't acquire the land

1166
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,940
when the loan is approved,

1167
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,300
how much do we have to pay
for the interests per day?

1168
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,730
Do you think it's a good time
to wrestle with a weak woman?

1169
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,460
Since her father-in-law

1170
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,250
has begged me,

1171
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,690
you better give them an out.

1172
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,170
Look at you. I knew it.

1173
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,130
You have a sharp tongue

1174
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,570
but a soft heart.

1175
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:03,940
You are

1176
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,650
so easily influenced

1177
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,860
by their pitiful stories.

1178
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,940
Keep spoiling them.

1179
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,980
Dad, Mom,

1180
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,340
this is the bank book with two transfers.

1181
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,210
We've got 255,840 from the land compensation.

1182
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,730
And 261,000 from the material loss.

1183
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,210
So much money?

1184
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,860
We still have to find a new land

1185
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,090
and start again.

1186
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,940
We have to invest the money again.

1187
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:34,650
Well...

1188
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,860
We can talk about it later.

1189
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,690
We can talk about it later.

1190
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,340
This is not right.

1191
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,250
They should compensate

1192
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,650
390,000 to us for the material loss, right?

1193
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,210
Look.

1194
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,170
It's 260,000.

1195
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,690
39 and 26,

1196
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,050
there's a difference of 130,000.

1197
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,380
They've deducted 130,000

1198
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,250
from the underground water pipes

1199
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,530
and the greenhouse.

1200
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,900
But we can reuse them.

1201
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,420
We can rebuild them on another land.

1202
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,250
This...

1203
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,690
I've calculated this together

1204
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,050
with Mr. Cailiang.

1205
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,020
We didn't suffer any losses.

1206
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,500
We can still get back the 130,000.

1207
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,690
Enough. Let's eat. The food is getting cold.

1208
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,690
Give this back

1209
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,090
to Xingfu.

1210
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,460
What?

1211
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,130
Dad.

1212
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,820
Xingfu's 30,000

1213
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,980
is in that account too.

1214
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,170
I know.

1215
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,530
It's safer for me to keep it here.

1216
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,530
Don't forget about it.

1217
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,650
All this while,

1218
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:28,780
both of you

1219
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,820
have worked hard on this.

1220
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,730
Finally, things have settled down.

1221
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,500
Let's celebrate with some alcohol.

1222
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,020
Let's drink some.

1223
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,050
How are you going to pour it?

1224
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,210
Here.

1225
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,500
Don't drink too much.

1226
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,300
Here.

1227
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,210
Why are you giving me water?

1228
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,090
You are pregnant. You can only drink water.

1229
00:40:59,050 --> 00:40:59,570
Here.

1230
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:00,820
Here.

1231
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,940
Let's celebrate this.

1232
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,340
Let's celebrate this.

1233
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,380
You've worked hard.

1234
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,780
Actually, we just did the legwork.

1235
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,050
But most importantly,

1236
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,420
Dad brought this matter

1237
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,500
to Mr. Wan in person.

1238
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,460
You bet.

1239
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:18,980
Back then,

1240
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,900
when Mr. Wan led the villagers
to mine from a quarry,

1241
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,570
I was among the first batch of villagers
who went with him.

1242
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,460
Give this, he has to help me

1243
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,820
with no excuses.

1244
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,170
There is one thing I've never told you about.

1245
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:30,860
Back in those years,

1246
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:31,690
one time

1247
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,460
when we were

1248
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,610
transporting the stones out of the quarry,

1249
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,690
we had a conflict with the villagers

1250
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,860
of Shuiwei Village.

1251
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,730
We were going to go into a fight.

1252
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,940
A lot of people were afraid.

1253
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,570
I went to Shantang and told him this.

1254
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,820
"Shantang.

1255
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:46,780
Do you want to fight?

1256
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,090
If you do,

1257
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,250
just give me an order

1258
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,340
and I'll fight for you.

1259
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,090
Do you want to fight?"

1260
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,650
You haven't even drunk the wine yet.

1261
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,340
And you are already drunk.

1262
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,210
Enough.

1263
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,050
You shouldn't call him by his name.

1264
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,570
It's Mr. Wan.

1265
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,420
No.

1266
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,530
He was not Mr. Wan back then.

1267
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,860
Back then, all of us called him Shantang.

1268
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,130
Do you know that?

1269
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,050
When we sit together now

1270
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,900
and talk about the past,

1271
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,570
if we'll call him Shantang,

1272
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,610
he'll have to accept it.

1273
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,780
At our prime,

1274
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,090
during our most glorious time,

1275
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,050
when we ran into Chuanjia

1276
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,650
in the village,

1277
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,090
his dad would kick him

1278
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,690
if he didn't call me sir.

1279
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,980
Does Chuanjia still do that now?

1280
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,210
Now?

1281
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,250
He is...

1282
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,610
He is the head of Wanjia Group now.

1283
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,090
Now is the time for you to drink.

1284
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,460
Here. Drink.

1285
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,570
Cheers.

1286
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,210
Our yield

1287
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,460
is not bad this year.

1288
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,530
We can

1289
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,860
finally be happy.

1290
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,650
Let's enjoy a prosperous new year ahead.

1291
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,530
Okay?

1292
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,340
Yes.

1293
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,860
Amazing.

1294
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,500
But Qingzhi has to travel
with his leader for work this year.

1295
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,340
He can't come back this year.

1296
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,170
It's okay.

1297
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,980
Qingzhi has to work, right?

1298
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,690
It's good enough as long as we are all safe

1299
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,340
