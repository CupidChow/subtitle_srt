[Episode 31]

3
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,200
Chuanmei!

4
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:52,760
Chuan...

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,680
Dad,

6
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,319
thank God I was at home.

7
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,920
I would've lost Chuanmei

8
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,159
if I came home any later.

9
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,000
My child.

10
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:13,599
Hey!

11
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:13,959
You!

12
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,519
Why were you so silly?

13
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,560
Huh?

14
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,800
Dad!

15
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm sorry!

16
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,840
I'd let you down!

17
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,360
I was too embarrassed to face anyone.

18
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,159
I didn't want to make things difficult for you.

19
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,560
I just wanted to end everything.

20
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,240
You guys...

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,840
Are you guys trying to drive me into a corner here?

22
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,879
Dad,

23
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,439
look at her right now.

24
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,360
You should stop saying that.

25
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,360
I assume you forgot how Chuanmei grew up.

26
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,280
When Mom died,

27
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Chuanmei was only 6.

28
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
I was 12.

29
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,840
To other people, we were motherless.

30
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,439
However, we knew

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
that we had no parents.

32
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,319
At night,

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,919
when a strong wind was blowing
against the window,

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,560
Chuanmei cried while hugging me.

35
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,080
She asked me

36
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,919
where our parents went.

37
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,520
Dad, what did you think I should say?

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,199
Should I say

39
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,599
that our father was collecting ores
in the mountains together with his men

40
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,240
to sell them to other places?

41
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,080
Do you know why Chuanmei didn't do well
in her studies?

42
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,599
It's because no one cared for her.

43
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,199
It's because no one

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,120
cared for her living conditions.

45
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,840
It's because no one cared for her

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
when she was bullied in school.

47
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,919
Have you ever asked her about that?

48
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,280
Dad, you didn't even know

49
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,360
when we were out of food!

50
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,000
I cared for her.

51
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,199
I provided her with food,

52
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,120
apparel,

53
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,159
taught her in her studies,

54
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,479
I did everything!

55
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,000
Dad, I was only 12 back then!

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,520
I was still a child too!

57
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,080
Huh?

58
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,160
When Chuanmei failed to get into university,

59
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,040
she cried for two days straight

60
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,639
without eating anything.

61
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,920
Dad, I couldn't stand it
when she was suffering like that!

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,639
But you didn't even come back!

63
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,639
Yes.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,920
I ran out of choice.

65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,480
That's why I came up with such a devilish idea.

66
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,639
I...

67
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Dad, I know my fault now.

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,319
I know my mistake now.

69
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,519
I've let you down.

70
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,720
I've caused trouble for you.

71
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,800
I've let down the Wang family!

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,040
I've let down Wang Xiuyu!

73
00:04:59,199 --> 00:04:59,759
Chuanjia.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,360
Dad!

75
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,399
Dad!

76
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:03,839
Dad!

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,879
Dad, what about this?

78
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,000
You can send me to prison.

79
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,319
You can send me to prison.

80
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,399
Or you can beat me,

81
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:11,680
Dad.

82
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,160
Dad, you can make me apologize to the Wang family.

83
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,439
You can even sever your ties with me.

84
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,040
However, regarding Chuanmei,

85
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,040
you have to help her out

86
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,800
no matter what.

87
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,959
If not, she'll be done for.

88
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,000
Dad!

89
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,680
What should we do?

90
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:51,075
[Qingzhi]

91
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,639
Hello?

92
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,240
Qingzhi?

93
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,360
How was it?

94
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,839
Qinglai, I've already asked someone
to look into it.

95
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,439
However, it will take some time.

96
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,720
But I've never heard

97
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,800
of an exception like this before.

98
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,439
I see.

99
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,720
Okay.

100
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,519
Let's leave it at that for now.

101
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,639
What did Qingzhi say?

102
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,639
Qingzhi

103
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,439
has already asked someone to look into it.

104
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,319
However, it'll take some time
before they can obtain any result.

105
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,199
Xiuyu, calm down for now.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
You must be patient.

107
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,480
I'm sure

108
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,079
we can resolve this somehow, you know?

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,360
Don't panic.

110
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,839
You didn't know how I spent my days

111
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,519
out there for the past few years.

112
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,240
I always lived in fear.

113
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,480
That's why I wanted to go somewhere far away.

114
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,160
I didn't want to return home.

115
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,519
No wonder you weren't willing to come home.

116
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,600
I said you could bring your boyfriend back
if you had one,

117
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,240
but you didn't do so.

118
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,920
You kept saying that you wanted to go overseas.

119
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,319
I don't have a boyfriend.

120
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,639
I don't dare to have a boyfriend.

121
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,399
Plenty of men

122
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,480
tried to court me in the past few years.

123
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,600
However, I was afraid

124
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,040
that once I got married to someone,

125
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,480
he might find out that I was

126
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,959
a scammer.

127
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,839
By then, the family

128
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,639
would be shattered into pieces.

129
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,800
We brought it upon ourselves.

130
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,240
Dad,

131
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,639
no matter how serious the issue is,

132
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,279
your health is the most important thing.

133
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,120
Actually,

134
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,399
I regretted it when I allowed Chuanmei

135
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
to attend university in the city.

136
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,120
What's so good about attending university?

137
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,160
I could've made all kinds of arrangements for her

138
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,399
if she stayed

139
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,480
in the village.

140
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,800
It's much better than letting her
make a living alone in the city.

141
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,319
Usually,

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,560
Xiuyu and I will have no choice

143
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
but to encounter each other in the company.

144
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,439
Whenever I see Xiuyu,

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,399
I feel hurt too.

146
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,720
However, there's no medicine
to rectify our regrets.

147
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:34,360
When the first step is wrong,

148
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,879
all of the steps will be wrong.

149
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,639
Now that we know the truth,

150
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,120
we should try to rectify the situation.

151
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,679
The key is the Wang family's attitude

152
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,120
and their requests.

153
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,879
We should try to meet all of their requests.

154
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
If that doesn't work,

155
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,360
we can compensate them with more money.

156
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,360
For your sake,

157
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm willing to spend any amount of money.

158
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,519
However, there are things
we cannot buy with money in the world.

159
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,720
Is Youde around?

160
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,039
Youde.

161
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,639
Mr. Wan?

162
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,240
Guizhi!

163
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,399
Mr. Wan?

164
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,720
Madam.

165
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,399
Please come inside.

166
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,360
Okay.

167
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,440
Have a seat.

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,960
Oh.

169
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,320
Little Dou is a big boy now.

170
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,919
Come on, here you go.

171
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,360
Take this.

172
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,600
No, we mustn't do so.

173
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
Treat this as a gift from his grandfather.

174
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,440
-Say thank you.
-Youde.

175
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,000
-You're really fortunate.
-Thank you, mister.

176
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:15,559
Good boy.

177
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,559
Let me see how heavy you are.

178
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,279
Mr. Wan, he's pretty heavy.

179
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,000
Let me.

180
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,600
Okay.

181
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,720
Alright, go now.

182
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,399
Youde, Madam,

183
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,720
I won't beat around the bush.

184
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll get straight to the point.

185
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,440
I assume you guys have heard about

186
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,320
the incident with Xiuyu and Chuanmei.

187
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,960
I came here

188
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,679
just to discuss this incident.

189
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,039
Please sit down.

190
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,759
Let's sit down and talk.

191
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,360
I only heard about it not long ago.

192
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,360
Youde, Madam,

193
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,600
I truly don't know what to say.

194
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,120
But no matter what,

195
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,240
it was definitely our fault.

196
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,480
I didn't...

197
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,240
I didn't expect them

198
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,840
to commit such an immoral deed!

199
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,799
I was so angry that I gave Chuanjia a beating

200
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,200
after I'd heard about it.

201
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,639
As the saying goes, spare the rod, spoil the child.

202
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,639
In the end,

203
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,960
it was because I failed my duties as their father.

204
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,519
I wasn't a good father.

205
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,120
Their mother passed away

206
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,720
when they were very young.

207
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,559
I had to go into the mountains
and collect ores with my fellow villagers.

208
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,960
I didn't have time to care for them.

209
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,919
After they grew up,

210
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,120
I was busy with the village and the Group.

211
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,240
I didn't educate them properly.

212
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,879
I do regret my decision.

213
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,440
Youde, Madam,

214
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm here

215
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
to ask for your forgiveness.

216
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
I wish to see

217
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,559
if there's any room for negotiation.

218
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,600
If this incident just happened,

219
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,960
I would

220
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,399
definitely call Chuanmei back

221
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,159
and send Xiuyu to university.

222
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,120
However,

223
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,519
it's already been 10 years.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What has been done cannot be undone.

225
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,600
It doesn't matter no matter what I say right now.

226
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,279
My poor Xiuyu,

227
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,440
she tried her best

228
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,960
to get into university, you know?

229
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
To be honest,

230
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,759
I inquired about this before coming here.

231
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,440
Judging from this situation,

232
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,600
Chuanmei isn't the topic of concern here.

233
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,039
So, I asked

234
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
whether it's possible for Xiuyu
to attend the university now.

235
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,600
According to what I heard,

236
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,320
it's impossible.

237
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,840
After all, Chuanmei graduated six years ago.

238
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,639
If you guys don't believe me,

239
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,240
you guys can try to inquire about it.

240
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,799
If you find any university
that wishes to take Xiuyu in,

241
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,159
I'll send her there

242
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,279
without any complaints.

243
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,559
I'll fork out all of the expenses.

244
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,879
However, based on the current situation,

245
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,679
it's a stalemate.

246
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,519
Even if you take back Chuanmei's
graduation certificate,

247
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,039
Xiuyu can never attend it.

248
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,240
However, if we make this matter public,

249
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,440
Chuanmei's certificate

250
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,320
and job

251
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,039
will be gone.

252
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,600
Even so,

253
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,240
she deserves it.

254
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,639
They weren't hers from the start.

255
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,679
However,

256
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,120
if we do make this public,

257
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
Chuanmei won't be able

258
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,759
to survive in society again.

259
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,279
She'll be too embarrassed to live.

260
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,440
She would rather die outside.

261
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,279
Youde, Madam,

262
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,200
all three of us are parents here.

263
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,519
We shouldn't pay for our mistake

264
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,000
by sacrificing Chuanmei, right?

265
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,919
She's still young.

266
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,000
She still has a long future ahead of her.

267
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,279
Now,

268
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,360
I'm still fretting about

269
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,360
how she will survive in the future.

270
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,480
What about me, then?

271
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,519
How can I survive?

272
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,039
Xiuyu.

273
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,159
This is a conversation between adults.

274
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,559
Return to your room.

275
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,559
This concerns Xiuyu anyway.

276
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,039
Xiuyu, you're right.

277
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,519
I can't just think about my daughter

278
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,159
while neglecting other people's daughters.

279
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,039
Xiuyu,

280
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,559
give me a suggestion then.

281
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,039
What do you plan to do about it?

282
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,000
Xiuyu was the one

283
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,879
who got into the university.

284
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,320
She might have been one of
the company leaders now

285
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,799
if Chuanmei

286
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,840
didn't cheat and take over her place.

287
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,879
Xiuyu had a bright future ahead of her.

288
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,440
But now, it's ruined.

289
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,720
Youde, Madam,

290
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,080
when you say that,

291
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,159
I...

292
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,080
I...

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,600
I feel so embarrassed!

294
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,080
I feel thoroughly embarrassed!

295
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm shameless!

296
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm so shameless.

297
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,159
Alright.

298
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,039
Mr. Wan, get up now.

299
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,799
I don't have a choice here.

300
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,600
I'm thoroughly embarrassed!

301
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,759
We're parents too.

302
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,530
Our children are the most precious things
in our lives.

303
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:34,890
We can't do anything about it

304
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,740
even though it has come to this.

305
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,530
We should discuss a way

306
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,650
and see how we can resolve this.

307
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,570
Madam, thank you for saying that.

308
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,690
Let's discuss it then.

309
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,460
You guys can tell me

310
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,260
what's on your mind.

311
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,140
I will do my best to satisfy your requests

312
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,860
as long as they're within my capabilities.

313
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,260
If so...

314
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,050
If so...

315
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,770
Mr. Wan, since

316
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,050
you had said that,

317
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,530
I'll tell you what's on my mind.

318
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,530
Please.

319
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,930
No.

320
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,650
I want to attend university.

321
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,500
Attending university is the only thing I desire.

322
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,260
Forget about everything else.

323
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,180
Xiuyu,

324
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,370
if you still can attend university

325
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,220
even after people hear about this,

326
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,290
I will ask her to return the slot to you

327
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,660
even if it means her reputation will be ruined.

328
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,770
My family

329
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,180
had committed an immoral deed,

330
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,980
and I couldn't do anything about it.

331
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,530
If not, I wouldn't have resorted to this.

332
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,260
Xiuyu,

333
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,530
please tell me what to do.

334
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,700
What should I do?

335
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,460
Chuanmei was in the wrong.

336
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,180
However, it wasn't serious enough
that she should pay with her life, right?

337
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,810
However, she'll be done for

338
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,050
if people hear about this!

339
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,810
Xiuyu,

340
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,130
back then,

341
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,530
you were classmates and great friends

342
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,610
with Chuanmei, right?

343
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,900
Please let her off, okay?

344
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,740
Please let Chuanmei off!

345
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,220
I'm begging you here!

346
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,660
But I only want to attend university!

347
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,570
Come on, Mr. Wan.

348
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,900
Just let her cry.

349
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,260
It's truly been tough on her.

350
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,660
Yeah.

351
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,180
She'll feel better after crying.

352
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,810
Madam,

353
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,460
why don't you tell me your requests?

354
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,330
Mr. Wan, since you've already said that,

355
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,770
we'll think about it.

356
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:07,850
Okay.

357
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,290
If so,

358
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,610
I would like to make another shameless request.

359
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,130
Please try not to tell anyone about this

360
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,090
before you guys

361
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,020
come up with your requests.

362
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,260
It's best to keep it a secret.

363
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:24,850
Please?

364
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,700
You know Xingfu's personality

365
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,220
as well.

366
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,220
She's a tough nut to crack.

367
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,940
I'm just afraid that she might erupt in rage

368
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,770
when she hears about it.

369
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,420
Yes.

370
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,700
Please don't tell Xingfu

371
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,330
about this,

372
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,370
please?

373
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,050
We shouldn't tell her then.

374
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,090
I've said what I needed to say.

375
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
I don't feel that terrible now.

376
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,810
You guys may find me anytime

377
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,810
if you have made up your mind.

378
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,980
Thank you, Youde, Madam.

379
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,050
What did Xiuyu say?

380
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,900
What else?

381
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,900
She only wants to attend university.

382
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,020
She wants nothing else.

383
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,370
However, she won't be able to attend university

384
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,180
even if we expose them.

385
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,900
By then, not only
will she not be able to attend university,

386
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,020
but we will also receive no compensation for it.

387
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,500
If that happens,

388
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
all will be lost.

389
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,180
But Xiuyu would suffer for nothing, you know?

390
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,180
Mom.

391
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,260
What should we do then?

392
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,090
That's the best solution we have.

393
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,700
Xiuyu has no choice but to suffer.

394
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,810
Mr. Wan said

395
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,500
he would promote Xiuyu

396
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,130
and give her a raise.

397
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,940
He'll return the land to you too.

398
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,770
If that's the case,

399
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,700
Qingzhi would have enough money
to hold his wedding,

400
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,570
while Xiuyu would earn enough for her dowries.

401
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,130
He even said

402
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,570
he would take good care of Xingfu Inn.

403
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,810
In the future, we won't need to bow down

404
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,980
to anyone we see.

405
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:13,660
Mom,

406
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,050
we should at least tell Xingfu about it.

407
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,020
Didn't you hear Mr. Wan?

408
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,370
We need to keep this from her.

409
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,260
Mom,

410
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,460
I don't think this will do.

411
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,660
Why don't we tell her after we receive the money?

412
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,770
That child is dead stubborn.

413
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,850
She'll definitely stir up trouble
if she hears about this.

414
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,260
Why don't we

415
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,500
discuss this with Qingzhi?

416
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,500
Qingzhi?

417
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,420
He's living alone in the city.

418
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,810
We saw everything when we went to the city, right?

419
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,180
He couldn't

420
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,460
even fend for himself out there.

421
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,290
How could he pay attention to the family
in that state?

422
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,740
He's our child after all.

423
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,850
He won't have any objections
as long as we agree to it.

424
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,500
If so...

425
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,770
Xiuyu, she...

426
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,180
You can break the news to Xiuyu.

427
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,130
Me?

428
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
You should do it.

429
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,940
Fine, I'll be the bad guy.

430
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,660
Xiuyu isn't an insensible child.

431
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,460
It's just that she's in a fit of rage.

432
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,420
She's still angry.

433
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,570
It's fine. I'll talk to her.

434
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,020
She'll understand us.

435
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,770
It'll be fine.

436
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,420
I'm back.

437
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,940
Xingfu?

438
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,940
Don't show it on your face.

439
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,180
She'll be suspicious.

440
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,180
Qinglai, go back through the backyard,

441
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,810
you hear me?

442
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,050
You're back?

443
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,090
Xingfu, you must've been exhausted.

444
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,700
Look at the time.

445
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,700
You should rest early.

446
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,660
Okay.

447
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,500
Where's Little Dou?

448
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,610
He's sleeping. You should rest.

449
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,740
Let me take a look at him.

450
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,850
He's sleeping.

451
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,530
Mom,

452
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,130
I've been busy lately.

453
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,530
It must've been tough on you and Dad.

454
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,850
We're a family.

455
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,370
We're doing this

456
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,180
so that our children can lead better lives.

457
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:29,850
Yes.

458
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,700
I just hope

459
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,570
that my inn will do better and better

460
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,570
so that I can earn more money.

461
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,980
That way, I can send Little Dou
to a good university

462
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,180
so that he can lead a good life in the future.

463
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,050
You're so ambitious.

464
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,530
Little Dou is a lucky child.
He was born at the right time.

465
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,290
Dad, Mom,

466
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,330
you guys should rest early.

467
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,330
I'll return to my room first.

468
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,900
Help me check

469
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,980
if the iron gate was shut.

470
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,330
Okay.

471
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,370
You can take a rest.

472
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,610
Go and rest.

473
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,940
Is Xiuyu asleep?

474
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,500
She was asleep long ago.

475
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,610
I do feel tired.

476
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,420
Right?

477
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,570
Mom,

478
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,090
they're starting to fix the road now.

479
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,940
I have to keep an eye on them.

480
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,610
I won't come back if it's too late.

481
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:17,570
I'll spend the night at the inn.

482
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,700
So, Little Dou...

483
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,290
That's great.

484
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,500
It's so dark out here.

485
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,810
It isn't safe for you to travel alone.

486
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:23,900
You should spend the night there.

487
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:25,260
Alright.

488
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,420
Why don't I bring Little Dou

489
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,940
to visit you in the afternoon?

490
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,700
Alright.

491
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,050
Mom, you're the best.

492
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,810
You're the best. Look at how tired you look.

493
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,900
Rest early, okay?

494
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,330
Okay, you too.

495
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,740
Xiuyu is asleep.

496
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,290
Xiuyu must be exhausted

497
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,530
from all the crying.

498
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,530
This is

499
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,740
the ending she got.

500
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,980
Our daughter is pitiful indeed.

501
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,900
I thought we could make a comeback

502
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,610
after all of our children grew up.

503
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,500
Who would've expected this to happen?

504
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,900
She couldn't attend university.

505
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,500
And, several years had passed since then.

506
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,980
It's useless no matter how she cries about it.

507
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,940
It's been 10 years.

508
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,370
Xingfu.

509
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,980
Time for breakfast!

510
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,500
Time for breakfast!

511
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:49,850
Wash your hands.

512
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,020
-Okay.
-Wash your hands.

513
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,260
Little Dou, have you washed your hands?

514
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,330
He has.

515
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,770
Sit here.

516
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,810
Join Grandma for breakfast.

517
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,810
Where's Xiuyu?

518
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,810
Xiuyu.

519
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,940
Xiuyu?

520
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,370
Mom,

521
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,770
did Xiuyu go out?

522
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,180
She...

523
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,420
I think she went to work.

524
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,530
No way.

525
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,810
I woke up at 6 AM.

526
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,850
Don't tell me she went out before the sun rose?

527
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,770
That lass,

528
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
she must've left out of spite.

529
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,530
The corn tastes stale. Try it and tell me.

530
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,020
Why did she leave out of spite?

531
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,220
She...

532
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,660
She didn't want to attend the blind dates
I'd arranged for her.

533
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:37,810
Mom,

534
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,370
when it comes to seeking a partner,

535
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:40,660
you shouldn't

536
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,260
be impatient.

537
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,420
It all depends on Xiuyu's wish.

538
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,770
Yeah.

539
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,020
I've been

540
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,130
too busy for the past few days.

541
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,290
I haven't gotten to catch up with her.

542
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,610
She told me she was going to take

543
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,220
the accounting qualification exam.

544
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,570
How was it?

545
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,900
She...

546
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,290
She couldn't register for the exam.

547
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,610
What? She didn't register for the exam?

548
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,090
It's no wonder I didn't see her for some time.

549
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,980
If she doesn't make it this time,

550
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,770
she can register for the next.

551
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,180
Was it because she forget about the time?

552
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,130
Let's eat up.

553
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,460
I've been too busy lately.

554
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,290
I didn't even know that something like this

555
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,850
happened to Xiuyu.

556
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,850
Why didn't you tell me?

557
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,460
I also forgot about it.

558
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
I think I should give Xiuyu a call.

559
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,740
You can call her after breakfast.

560
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,770
Why are you in a hurry?

561
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,050
I have to call her.

562
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,700
Eat up.

563
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,420
(Hello, the number you have dialed
is unavailable.)

564
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,900
(Please try again later.)

565
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,050
She switched off her phone.

566
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,740
Eat up.

567
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,220
Qinglai,

568
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,900
I'll spend my entire day at the inn.

569
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,500
I have plenty of things to deal with.

570
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,260
I think I won't have time to catch up with Xiuyu.

571
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,500
Pass a message to her when you see her.

572
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,530
Tell her

573
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,570
that she can take the exam next time

574
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,770
if she didn't make it this time.

575
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,220
I will support her no matter what she does.

576
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,810
Pass the money to her.

577
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,130
Tell her to take a breather,

578
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,290
buy some clothes,

579
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,090
watch a movie, or do something with it.

580
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,850
Go and coax her, okay?

581
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,660
She should watch a movie.

582
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,090
Let's dig in.

583
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,020
Eat up.

584
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,020
These are your room card and ID card.

585
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,810
Please keep them safe.

586
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,090
Alright.

587
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,130
Let me take you to your room.

588
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,370
Okay, thank you.

589
00:29:59,370 --> 00:29:59,940
Please follow me.

590
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:01,610
Here.

591
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,330
Let's go hiking later.

592
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,020
Okay.

593
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,020
Change into your slippers.

594
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,370
Have you eaten anything?

595
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,090
Xiuyu,

596
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,050
you should finish them.

597
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,290
Later,

598
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,770
I'll bring you out for lunch

599
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,370
when I return later.

600
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,660
We can talk about it later.

601
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,130
Qingzhi,

602
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,850
are you planning to stay out of this too?

603
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,610
Xiuyu,

604
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,500
Mom called me yesterday.

605
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,370
I know you feel that it's unfair to you,

606
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,130
but...

607
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:03,700
Qingzhi,

608
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,130
what if you were in my shoes?

609
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:07,850
Will you accept your fate?

610
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,900
Xiuyu, I...

611
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,700
I hate Chuanjia and his family to the core.

612
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,180
I've inquired about

613
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,130
this matter from someone else.

614
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,420
I've done my research online as well.

615
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,220
Here's the result.

616
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,420
The impersonator's qualifications,

617
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,700
school roll, educational background,

618
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,500
and undergraduate degree

619
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,050
will all be canceled.

620
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,500
If they have a government post,

621
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,460
they will be sacked.

622
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,050
If they're employed,

623
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,660
they might

624
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,850
be sacked.

625
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,050
It's actually very difficult

626
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,290
for the victim

627
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,130
to attend university again,

628
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,850
especially for your case.

629
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,530
It's been almost 10 years since the incident.

630
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,260
It's impossible for the university

631
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,980
to take you in
based on your results 10 years ago.

632
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,570
It has never been done before.

633
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,460
Or,

634
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,370
they'll make you take the gaokao next year.
(*National College Entrance Examination)

635
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,610
However, you're 10 years older

636
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,850
than the current batch.

637
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,220
Do you think it's viable for you

638
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,770
to prepare

639
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
for the gaokao at this age?

640
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,370
What are you trying to say?

641
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,530
Since

642
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,020
it has already come to this,

643
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,330
why don't we try to request
as much compensation as we can get?

644
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,850
I've already inquired about it.

645
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,810
Even if we press charges against them,

646
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,130
they'll only compensate us for it.

647
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,940
If we can settle this in private

648
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,940
and reconcile...

649
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:19,980
I understand now.

650
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,020
You're just like the rest of them.

651
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,500
All of you want to sell me out.

652
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,420
All of you will benefit from the act.

653
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,700
Qinglai will get back his land.

654
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,660
Dad and Mom will get money in their pockets.

655
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,220
You can marry Yani

656
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,020
after you get the money.

657
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,020
Xiuyu,

658
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,330
don't say that.

659
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,770
I won't accept a single cent from them.

660
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,660
You do make it sound nice.

661
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,660
Do you really think that you don't need

662
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,850
to spend a single cent to marry Yani?

663
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,310
Xiuyu...

664
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,750
I thought you would be different

665
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,340
since you attended university
and worked in the city.

666
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,140
I didn't expect you to be like the rest.

667
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,180
You can go to work.

668
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,180
I'm sorry.

669
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,270
Sorry for disturbing you.

670
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,340
Xiuyu!

671
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,420
Xiuyu!

672
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:05,900
Xiuyu!

673
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,860
Wait for me. I'm serious.

674
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,030
I'll head to work now.

675
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,070
Wait for me to come back.

676
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,990
We can talk after that, okay?

677
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,030
There's nothing for us to talk about.

678
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,710
I'm sorry.

679
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,030
I was unlucky

680
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,790
to be born in this family.

681
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,070
Xiuyu!

682
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,990
Xiuyu!

683
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,550
Xiuyu!

684
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,580
What?

685
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,860
How could you guys do that?

686
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,790
You even wanted them
to sign a confidentiality agreement?

687
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,470
Anyway,

688
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,420
I've already

689
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,550
explained

690
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,750
the entire story to you.

691
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,380
You're our legal consultant.

692
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,420
This is your duty.

693
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,270
Just draft up an agreement
as soon as possible, okay?

694
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,750
I'm the Group's legal consultant.

695
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,230
I'm not serving your family.

696
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,790
This is your family affair.

697
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,180
I have the right to reject your request.

698
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,230
Listen, Wan Chuanjia,

699
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,100
this matter...

700
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,860
I will never help you out.

701
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,660
This is illegal, do you know that?

702
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,100
How could you do such a dumb thing?

703
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,580
That's an immoral thing for you to do!

704
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,380
That's enough.

705
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,030
Don't go overboard, okay?

706
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,550
You don't have the right to lecture me.

707
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,140
We had a deal between us, right?

708
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,830
If so, what gives you the right

709
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,780
to lecture me like a saint?

710
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,180
This issue

711
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,260
can be big

712
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,660
or small.

713
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,510
It all depends on the words you use, right?

714
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,780
They were the ones
who came up with the requests.

715
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,780
We've already made a deal with them.

716
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,740
We'll compensate them while they'll keep it a secret.
What's wrong with that?

717
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,180
Every word I told you was true.

718
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,100
If you don't believe me,
you can ask the Wang family.

719
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:50,990
Fine.

720
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,070
You guys are better than me.

721
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,550
Please hire another legal expert to assist you.

722
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,950
I've never learned how to draft up

723
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,070
a contract with that many conditions in school.

724
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,260
I don't know how to do it.

725
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,300
Xingyun!

726
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,350
Look at your temper.

727
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,030
You have such an explosive temper.

728
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:17,510
You see,

729
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,220
two days ago,

730
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,070
we had a meal in the inn.

731
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,510
Although your sister

732
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,470
clinched a deal with Xie

733
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,740
using an unorthodox method,

734
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,660
I was planning to give you credits for it too.

735
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,430
I was planning to let our group
extend our contract with your law firm.

736
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,070
If you handle this,

737
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,740
not only will I extend our contract,

738
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,660
but I will also raise your agent fee rate

739
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,390
from the standard 1%

740
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,550
to 5%, just like Han's rate.

741
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,830
I'll extend our contract immediately
once you get this done.

742
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,740
But of course,

743
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,550
if you're still unwilling

744
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,910
to draft up the contract

745
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,260
after all I've said,

746
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,470
I will never force you to do so.

747
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,510
I can call Han immediately.

748
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,070
With his capabilities,

749
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,780
I'm sure he's better than you at this.

750
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,140
If so, why didn't you go to him in the first place?

751
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,990
After all,

752
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,990
it's our family affair.

753
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,950
We shouldn't wash our dirty linen in public.

754
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,260
Besides,

755
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,830
if I do approach Han for this matter,

756
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,390
should I look for you or him

757
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,140
for the Group's legal matters

758
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,350
if I do extend our contract with your law firm?

759
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,700
Am I right?

760
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,990
Xingyun,

761
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,950
you're living in the city right now.

762
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,350
You have seen much of life.

763
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,390
Of course you know that it isn't that easy

764
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,830
to get a good job in the current society.

765
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,780
Even if Xiuyu manages to attend university,

766
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,950
she still has to find a job

767
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,180
after graduating from university, right?

768
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,740
Can you promise that you'll find her a better job

769
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,950
than her current job?

770
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,740
Can you promise her that she'll earn more
than what she currently earns?

771
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:44,700
I know.

772
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,180
It doesn't

773
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,910
sound nice.

774
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,140
It feels

775
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,300
as if we bought her place
in the university with money.

776
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,030
But think about it.

777
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,910
I made arrangements for her
to join our group many years ago.

778
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,470
I gave her a high wage

779
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,510
for an easy post.

780
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,300
Doesn't that count as compensation to her as well?

781
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,140
Xingyun, you're a smart girl.

782
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,180
Think about it.

783
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,740
Actually, we're just taking

784
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,660
what we need from each other.

785
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,550
Does Xingfu know about this?

786
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,220
The Wang family isn't a bunch of idiots.

787
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,580
Of course they won't let her know about this.

788
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,620
In their hearts,

789
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,510
your sister will always be an outsider.

790
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,620
Wang Qinglai,

791
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,910
your so-called brother-in-law,

792
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,660
didn't even dare to tell your sister about this.

793
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,180
So,

794
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,030
this concerns her sister-in-law.

795
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,390
If her family is willing to compromise,

796
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,950
do you think your sister has any say in it?

797
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,510
Enough already.

798
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,350
You've been here for quite some time.

799
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,950
I'm sure you have some ideas

800
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,470
about my personality.

801
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,070
I will surely treat you well in the future

802
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,510
if you get this done for me.

803
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,300
Besides the things I've promised you verbally,

804
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,620
you can leave your sister's inn

805
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,910
and everything related

806
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,030
to me.

807
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,070
I will do everything I can to support her, okay?

808
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,620
And,

809
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,180
if I do approach Han,

810
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,260
I'm sure you know

811
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,350
his personality better than I do.

812
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,780
He's greedier

813
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,030
and more ruthless than you.

814
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,660
That's why I would rather

815
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,780
let you have the goods on us

816
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,220
than enlist his service.

817
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,470
After all,

818
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,260
I still treat you as a part of the family.

819
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,620
Wan Chuanjia,

820
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,910
from now on,

821
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,350
no matter if it's my sister's inn

822
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,300
or their family,

823
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,830
you're not allowed
to make things difficult for them.

824
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,260
Deal.

825
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,430
Is there anything else?

826
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,780
It's fine. Take your time.

827
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,430
You can think about it slowly.

828
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,950
Tell me

829
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,030
if you have any other ideas.

830
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,260
We'll add it to the deal anytime.

831
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,660
People are successful for certain reasons.

832
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,470
Look at how intelligent you are. Good for you.

833
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,830
I'll send it to your email once I'm done.

834
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,100
I appreciate your effort.

835
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,220
Wan Chuanjia,

836
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,910
do not ever tell my sister about this.

837
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,220
Of course.

838
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,260
Hello?

839
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,780
I wish to book two rooms.

840
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,220
Sorry, we're fully occupied right now.

841
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,700
Is there no room at all?

842
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,220
I'm really sorry about this.

843
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,300
We ran out of rooms.

844
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,700
Call me if you have any rooms available.

845
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,700
We will notify you as soon as possible
if we have any.

846
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,510
Okay, thank you.

847
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,620
Xingfu, what should we do?

848
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,100
What's wrong again?

849
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,470
We have too many customers

850
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,030
and not enough rooms.

851
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,430
I'm afraid that people might stop coming

852
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,070
if we keep rejecting them like this.

853
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,180
We have no choice. We only have six rooms here.

854
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,740
Did you send Mr. Wu's meal to him?

855
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,390
I did.

856
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,660
Verify yesterday's account for me.

857
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,580
-Okay.
-I'll go and check on him.

858
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:10,990
Mr. Wu.

859
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,180
Xingfu, you're here?

860
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,550
I'm here to clean the table.

861
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,700
Thanks.

862
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,830
How's your leg?

863
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,830
Can you walk now?

864
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,740
It's fine now.

865
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,030
I've almost recovered.

866
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,870
Look at my feet.

867
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,100
Don't take it to heart.

868
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,990
You see, you got hurt when you were staying here.

869
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,430
By right, our inn should be
responsible for your injury.

870
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,470
Why don't I waive the fee for you?

871
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,430
Stop.

872
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,660
Stop right there.

873
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,700
Xingfu,

874
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,780
these are two different matters.

875
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,870
I sprained my ankle myself.

876
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,830
It has nothing to do with your inn.

877
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,510
Please don't

878
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,030
take this matter to heart, okay?

879
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,580
I will pay you for the meal and the room.

880
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,180
I appreciate the intention.

881
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,830
But I...

882
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:56,870
By the way,

883
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:58,620
Xingfu,

884
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,350
one of my friends

885
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,180
will be visiting me
together with his child this Saturday.

886
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,300
They wish

887
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,910
to have a vacation here.

888
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,220
Please reserve a large room for me.

889
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,350
No problem.

890
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,030
Saturday, right?

891
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,260
Yes, Saturday.

892
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,430
You mean this Saturday?

893
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,140
That's right.

894
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,220
Let me check.

895
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,780
Sorry, but our rooms are fully booked.

896
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,700
Has business been booming lately?

897
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,070
I fretted when we had no customers.

898
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,580
Now, I'm fretting
because we have too many customers.

899
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,510
It's fine.

900
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,700
I'll think of something for you.

901
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:35,510
Okay.

902
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,620
Mr. Wu,

903
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,220
I'll go and check on the road.

904
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,220
Here, mister. Good job.

905
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,950
Thank you.

906
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,910
Here, have some water.
