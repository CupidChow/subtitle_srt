[Episode 4]

3
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,599
Anyone home?

4
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,159
Get me some water.

5
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,760
My legs are killing me.

6
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,439
-You're here.
-Come.

7
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:49,959
Come.

8
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,560
Perfect timing.

9
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,439
Have this cup of water.

10
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:51,879
Here.

11
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,680
Come.

12
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,439
-You must be tired.
-Here you go.

13
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,040
And exasperated.

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,120
What happened?

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,280
Is she not coming back?

16
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,079
Mrs. Wang,

17
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,480
I was wrong about her.

18
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,439
I had your son marry a stubborn mule.

19
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,879
I'll return that pig's head

20
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,959
to you later.

21
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,239
Consider this match

22
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,319
my mistake.

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,959
Oh, don't say that.

24
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,000
M... Madam,

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,760
what...

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,280
What did she say?

27
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,319
Qinglai.

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,759
You're a man.

29
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,960
Act like one.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,199
Don't fight with women.

31
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,199
Give in and apologize to her,

32
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,159
and you'll get your wife back.

33
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,759
That'll solve everything, right?

34
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,240
What gives?

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,400
Qinglai,

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,120
you can't give in.

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,560
You'll spoil her rotten.

38
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,719
There's no room for you to butt in.

39
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,639
The adults are talking.

40
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,039
The chickens ran out of their coop.

41
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,199
Both of you go

42
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:34,560
and get them back.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,039
-Yes. Go now.
-Hurry.

44
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:36,639
Go and get the chickens.

45
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,000
Go!

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,159
Go! Go on!

47
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,159
What did Xingfu say?

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,120
She said...

49
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,080
Lower your voice.

50
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,400
What did she say?

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,800
She said

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,039
if you still want her as your daughter-in-law,

53
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,680
you'll have Qinglai bring her back
in a sedan chair carried by eight people.

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,639
If not,

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,039
she's staying at her mother's.

56
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,280
The choice is Qinglai's.

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,280
Oh, right.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,199
She also said this.

59
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,479
If Qinglai is a man,

60
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,240
he should confront Chuanjia
and seek justice for her sister.

61
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,560
If he manages to do that,

62
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,639
then she won't need the sedan chair.

63
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,439
She'll come back on her own right away.

64
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,960
That's what she said.

65
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,360
A sedan chair carried by eight?

66
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,400
And justice for her sister?

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,919
Yes.

68
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,120
That girl is too much.

69
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,719
She sure is a lot like me when I was younger.

70
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,120
I would be surprised
if she came back with you just like that.

71
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,960
Madam.

72
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,479
Do as I tell you.

73
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,000
Will that work?

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,680
Why not?

75
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,479
I'm sure it'll work.

76
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,360
All right.

77
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,759
I'll try.

78
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,080

They've distributed the grain subsidies.

84

Yes.

00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,360
That's right.

86
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,879
They have.

87
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,719
I'll go and check.

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,879
Now, about the location for the construction

89
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,000
of the health products factory,

90
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,280
I've had several discussions about the matter

91
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,680
with Cailiang and a few other village cadres,

92
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,039
but we couldn't come to a decision.

93
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,599
Then,

94
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,919
I thought about the time we began quarrying.

95
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,520
Of course,

96
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,680
we didn't know much
about environmental protection at the time,

97
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,000
so it was a mess.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,680
For this matter...

99
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,639
I thought we should get a greening company

100
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,960
to reduce the environmental damages.

101
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,840
I asked.

102
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,039
It would cost us

103
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,360
several million.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,719
But then I thought,

105
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,040
what if we...

106
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,480
How long is this meeting going to take?

107
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,480
It'll go on for a while.

108
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,759
You should wait outside.

109
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,639
Please let him know.

110
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:31,920
All right.

111
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,439
This will allow us to save on the greening costs

112
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
as well as make money from the wasteland.

113
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,120
We would kill a few birds with one stone.

114
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,600
Think

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,639
about it

116
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,519
and discuss this together

117
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,879
to see if this is feasible.

118
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,720
-It sounds good.
-It will work.

119
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,319
-Yes.
-Sounds good.

120
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:45,920
Right?

121
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,959
Good idea.

122
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,480
It would be best if we could find

123
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,639
some time

124
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,600
to inspect the site ourselves.

125
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,720
Well, we shouldn't go alone.

126
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,759
I'll call up

127
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,199
a few professionals

128
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,920
to come

129
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,560
with us.

130
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,439
Yes.

131
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,839
Chuanjia hit the nail on the head.

132
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,480
Yes.

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,160
Chuanjia.

134
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,160
The budget is ready, right?

135
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll head back to the company
and put what we discussed into effect.

136
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,560
All right.

137
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,519
It's settled then.

138
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,199
Do some calculations

139
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,120
and write up the report.

140
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,920
All right. Will do.

142

[Village Branch Committee of Wan Village]

144
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,439
Were you waiting for me?

145
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,040
Madam,

146
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,600
Chuanjia

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,040
is married.

148
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,519
Chuanmei is in the city.

149
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,079
We don't need your services anymore.

150
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,199
Mr. Wan,

151
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,120
look at what you're saying.

152
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,199
I was the one

153
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,079
who found a wife for Chuanjia, didn't I?

154
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,120
Tell me what the matter is.

155
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,040
I came

156
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,040
to talk to you about the Wang family.

157
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:39,920
You see,

158
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,639
because of the incident
during the wedding hazing,

159
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,639
the bride refuses to go back

160
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,120
to the Wang family.

161
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,360
That's a problem
with the Wang family's discipline.

162
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,639
Why tell me about that?

163
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,120
All my son did was join the celebration,

164
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,160
and he came back with an injury.

165
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,480
And I didn't even say anything.

166
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,839
You're right.

167
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,160
The Wang family knows

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,800
their daughter-in-law caused a huge mess as well.

169
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,399
So

170
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,560
they spent a few days discussing it

171
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,399
and decided

172
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,560
they didn't want her

173
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,680
anymore.

174
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,439
They don't want her anymore?

175
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,319
They should get rid

176
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,639
of a woman like that.

177
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,319
They'll only invite trouble if they let her in.

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,920
Qinglai's mother

179
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,639
told him to take her to town

180
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,199
and get a divorce.

181
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,360
And

182
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
I happened to run into them.

183
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,600
I told them they couldn't do that.

184
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,879
If

185
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,959
they just get divorced without saying anything,

186
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,360
other people might think

187
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,879
it was because of the wedding hazing.

188
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,560
Right?

189
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,199
You didn't know what was going on,

190
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,199
did you?

191
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,959
So I thought

192
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,240
I had to tell you somehow.

193
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,199
Right?

194
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,399
Qinglai's parents are too embarrassed

195
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,720
to see you.

196
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,959
They know I'm thick-skinned,

197
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,600
so they sent me instead.

198
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,800
I figured I would help them

199
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,240
till the end.

200
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,279
I would bring Qinglai to go find Xingfu

201
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,680
and see that they get a divorce in town.

202
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,160
I mean,

203
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,839
there's no use trying to talk them out of it.

204
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,160
You can't change their minds.

205
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,279
You always said it yourself, right?

206
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,279
You must have a home or family
before you can have a village.

207
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,079
A village will only prosper
if a home is harmonious.

208
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,240
That alone is enough reason

209
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,879
to get rid of a daughter-in-law like that.

210
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,759
If they actually let her in,

211
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,639
she would definitely

212
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,079
bring trouble and cause havoc.

213
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,879
To put it bluntly,

214
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,920
she might even disturb the peace

215
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,879
of the Wan Village.

216
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,639
The villagers might learn
from their bad example.

217
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,800
One after another,

218
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,560
couples might get into fights or get divorced.

219
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,959
You worked so hard to manage

220
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,000
and build the Wan Village into what it is today.

221
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,759
It's not worth letting it all go to ruin

222
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,360
because of a little woman.

223
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,399
As the old saying goes,

224
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,199
real men

225
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,480
don't fight with women.

226
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,839
Listen to me.

227
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,759
You're old and mature.

228
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,360
You don't have to fight with a little girl,

229
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,240
right?

230
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,399
I just came

231
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,560
to let you know.

232
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,439
I'll relay your word

233
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,759
to the Wang family.

234
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,000
They are still hesitating.

235
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,199
I'll let them know

236
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,360
they don't have to hesitate anymore.

237
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,480
Mr. Wan has agreed.

238
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,000
The marriage must be done away with.

239
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,920
Right?

240
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,560
Madam.

241
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,879
Everyone has a mouth on them.

242
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,120
And this is why you can make a living

243
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,480
with yours.

244
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,879
Makes sense.

245
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,480
I manage the Wan Village

246
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,279
with family values.

247
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm glad that the Wang family

248
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:26,879
understands this.

249
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,879
A harmonious family cultivates prosperity.

250
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
They want their son to divorce

251
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,319
his disobedient wife.

252
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,319
No need to have a secretary like me
to issue the papers, right?

253
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,759
They want a divorce, don't they?

254
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,200
Then let them get one.

255
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,440
Freedom of marriage.

256
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,799
Freedom of divorce.

257
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,279
I oversee many things

258
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,960
but not a man divorcing his wife.

259
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,159
Tell the Wang family

260
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,919
that this is their family matter.

261
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,039
The village committee can't do anything about it,

262
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,559
and I don't have the time for it.

263
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,559
No...

264
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,039
Mr. Wan!

265
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,120
Oh, dear...

266
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,919
What?

267
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,279
I told him exactly

268
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,000
what you wanted me to say.

269
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,080
Mr. Wan didn't fall for it.

271
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,519
And now,

272
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,840
they might actually have to get a divorce.

273
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,759
You useless woman.

274
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,080
All you do

275
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,600
is give stupid ideas.

276
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,919
Now, if they don't get divorced,

277
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,159
we would've been lying to Mr. Wan.

278
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,559
And if they did?

279
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,519
What about the betrothal gifts we gave?

280
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,360
And

281
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,840
all the money we spent on the wedding

282
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,679
would go down the drain, wouldn't it?

283
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,639
They haven't even warmed the wedding bed yet,
and they're already getting divorced.

284
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,120
What is Qinglai going to do?

285
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,559
He'll be the joke of the town!

286
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,240
How is he going to marry another woman?

287
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,000
Huh?

288
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
This isn't right.

289
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,360
Mr. Wan is always going on and on

290
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,600
about keeping harmony in a family, isn't he?

291
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,279
He talked those couples out of getting a divorce

292
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,879
in our village, didn't he?

293
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,240
Why did he do this when it came to us?

294
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,759
Madam,

295
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,039
could you

296
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,960
make another trip for us?

297
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,879
Tell my daughter-in-law
who doesn't know any better.

298
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,080
Tell her

299
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,759
that if she still refuses to come back,

300
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,320
we'll have no choice

301
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,720
but to make them get a divorce.

302
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,799
Right?

303
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,639
Hello?

304
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,840
Daxun?

305
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,919
What have you been up to?

306
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,200
Why are you ignoring me?

307
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,120
Why won't you pick up my calls?

308
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,600
Are you still mad at me?

309
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,360
Don't stay mad, okay?

310
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,320
Xingyun, yes?

311
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm Daxun's mother.

312
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,000
M...

313
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,399
Madam...

314
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,720
Where's Daxun?

315
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,000
Young lady,

316
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,960
there are some things
Daxun can't bring himself to say,

317
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
so I'll say them for him.

318
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,200
You are a very good child.

319
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,200
But

320
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,080
you guys aren't compatible.

321
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,519
It's better

322
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,120
to break things off now

323
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,200
to avoid dragging each other down.

324
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:08,840
Madam,

325
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,759
where's Daxun?

326
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,159
Have him tell me this himself.

327
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,519
Even if he were here,

328
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,000
he would say the same things.

329
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,840
Young lady,

330
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,120
we didn't bring up certain things

331
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,279
to help you save face.

332
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,480
Face? Why would I want that?

333
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,879
I have no such thing to speak of now.

334
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,759
I don't want that.

335
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,320
Just...

336
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,080
Just tell me why.

337
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,799
Do you really not get it?

338
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,559
We know

339
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,799
what happened to you.

340
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,679
As you know,

341
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,720
we have a lot of relatives and associates.

342
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,320
They are of a higher social status.

343
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,600
If word gets out about this,

344
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,840
we will lose respect among them.

345
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,120
You and Daxun

346
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,120
should end things now.

347
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,639
The smoke from the chili almost choked me.

348
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,639
Here, Xingfu.

349
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,519
Give this to me.

350
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,440
Xingyun,

351
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
it's time for dinner.

352
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,200
Xingyun?

353
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,519
Why are you drinking again?

354
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,399
I know you're upset.

355
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
But you can't keep drinking

356
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,600
to drown your sorrows.

357
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,399
Oh, don't cry.

358
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,360
Don't cry.

359
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,879
Daxun...

360
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,840
Daxun doesn't want me anymore.

361
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,399
Why?

362
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,320
He heard it over the phone.

363
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,039
He heard what they did to me...

364
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,720
He feels ashamed of me.

365
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,600
Xingfu...

366
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:44,799
What?

367
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,559
You were taken advantage of,

368
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,799
and that's what he thinks?

369
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,639
He thinks they touched me...

370
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,360
He thinks I'm spoiled now...

371
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,879
Do you know how I felt when I heard that?

372
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,399
I...

373
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,879
It's like my heart has been stabbed.

374
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Before all of this,

375
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,679
we were so good together.

376
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,519
He even told me

377
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,039
he was going to bring me to his parents.

378
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,120
He was going to marry me.

379
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
We were going to be together forever.

380
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,480
His mother called me just now.

381
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,679
She said

382
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,759
they had a lot of relatives.

383
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,519
She didn't want me to embarrass them.

384
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,519
Do you know?

385
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,360
At that moment, I suddenly felt

386
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,840
that no matter how hard I tried,

387
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,440
no matter

388
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,440
how good I am,

389
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,320
to them,

390
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,159
I would always be beneath them.

391
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,399
We were never going to be equals,

392
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,440
you know?

393
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,519
I didn't send you to university

394
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,960
to let you think that way.

395
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,879
They were born phoenixes.

396
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,960
But me?

397
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,000
The more they look down on us,

398
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,480
the more we have to live well.

399
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,360
Xingyun.

400
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,600
I...

401
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,519
Even the son of a village secretary

402
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,000
can humiliate me.

403
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,440
They aren't

404
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,120
even sorry at all.

405
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,600
What does that make me?

406
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,519
I feel like...

407
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't have anything left...

408
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,000
Coming.

409
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,600
Madam, you're here.

410
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,240
Come inside.

411
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,399
What does that mean?

412
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,600
That's what they mean.

413
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Xingfu,

414
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,559
listen to me

415
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,879
and come back with me.

416
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,440
If there's a problem,

417
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,039
you can talk to them when you return.

418
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,519
If you don't go back,

419
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,840
I'm afraid this marriage

420
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,080
might actually be over.

421
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,279
So that means

422
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,240
they don't want me anymore.

423
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,679
It's not that they don't.

424
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,759
It's that they don't dare.

425
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,559
Madam.

426
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,399
You and I

427
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,440
are as close as sisters, aren't we?

428
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes.

429
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,840
Be honest with me.

430
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:28,320
Do they actually want a divorce,

431
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,460
or are they just trying to threaten us?

432
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,380
I'll be frank with you.

433
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,650
Bad blood

434
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,500
has been spilled between the Wang family

435
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,530
and Mr. Wan because of the incident with Xingyun.

436
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,460
They are serious

437
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,530
about getting a divorce.

438
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,290
Xingfu!

439
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,570
Put that cleaver down,

440
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,050
pack your things

441
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,100
and go back to the Wan Village with her right now.

442
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,408
Yes.

443
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:54,860
Xingfu.

444
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,650
Madam.

445
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,740
Please tell my in-laws this.

446
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,890
I understand their concerns.

447
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,460
But I do not agree with their actions.

448
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,100
One must always be reasonable.

449
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,740
No matter who they are

450
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,180
and what positions they hold.

451
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,500
If they don't dare to seek justice

452
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,850
for my sister,

453
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,740
that's fine.

454
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,980
But I'm not afraid.

455
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,940
If they decide they don't want me anymore

456
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,050
because of this,

457
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,900
well, so be it then.

458
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,330
Xingfu!

459
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,020
I... You just can't get through to her.

460
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,940
Oh, that stubborn girl.

461
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,460
What do we do now?

462
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,180
Stay for lunch.

463
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,260
How can I still have an appetite?

464
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,220
Never mind.

465
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,940
Madam,

466
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,370
let's make it clear then.

467
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,420
It's the Wang family
that brought up talks of divorce.

468
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,700
If they do get divorced,

469
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,660
we won't be returning the betrothal gifts.

470
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,850
That's a matter for later.

471
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,900
We'll talk about it later.

472
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,500
I'm off.

473
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,420
Oh, not a day of peace.

474
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:30,725
[Xingfu]

475
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:46,025
[Qinglai]

476
00:19:11,993 --> 00:19:17,707
[Happiness]

477
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,290
Xingfu.

478
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,330
Mom!

479
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,900
Mom?

480
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,370
Where's Xingfu?

481
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,220
Isn't your sister in her room?

482
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,020
No.

483
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,900
No?

484
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,370
Xingfu?

485
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,770
She's not in her room.

486
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,900
Xingfu?

487
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,370
Oh, no.

488
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,420
She must have gone back.

489
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,420
What?

490
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,370
Quick. Call your sister.

491
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,570
Hello?

492
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,570
Xingfu?

493
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,090
Where did you go?

494
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,130
On my way to the Wan Village

495
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,570
to make things right for you.

496
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,090
Xingfu, don't go.

497
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,130
I don't want that.

498
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,500
Xingyun,

499
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,220
we'll talk when I get back.

500
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,850
Why is she so stubborn?

501
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,980
She didn't even talk to us.

502
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,660
She is going to throw away her marriage!

503
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,500
Mom,

504
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,330
will Xingfu really get a divorce?

505
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,500
Xingyun,

506
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,090
what do you really think about this?

507
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,500
I don't know.

508
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,660
How can you not know?

509
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,460
Don't you know your sister is doing this

510
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,770
all for you?

511
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,020
You know how our family,

512
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
including you,

513
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,530
got to where we are today!

514
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,850
To send you to school,

515
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,740
your sister dropped out after middle school.

516
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,900
She only got married
after you graduated from university.

517
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,700
She finally found a good husband and in-laws.

518
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,810
And this mess had to happen on her wedding day.

519
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,570
What if her marriage

520
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,980
is ruined

521
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,700
because of this?

522
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,570
How can you live with yourself then, Xingyun?

523
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,700
Mom.

524
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,700
What do you mean?

525
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,660
Xingyun...

526
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,610
You

527
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,050
and your sister

528
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,260
are my flesh and blood.

529
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,940
It hurts me to see either of you in pain.

530
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,020
But...

531
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,900
Things have already come this far.

532
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,940
So what if your sister manages

533
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,850
to get them to apologize?

534
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,900
Just bear with it.

535
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,260
Such is life for people like us.

536
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,500
When we're wronged,

537
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,370
we just have to accept it.

538
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,220
You're all right.

539
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,420
My dear.

540
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,770
I know

541
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,610
you'll be all right.

542
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,260
Mr. Wan,

543
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,850
the Wang family's daughter-in-law
is here to see you.

544
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,220
She came, after all.

545
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,660
Let her in.

546
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,220
All right.

547
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,810
Mr. Wan.

548
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,810
You're here again to ask me for an explanation.

549
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,290
Yes.

550
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,610
I heard

551
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,500
your mother-in-law has decided

552
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,770
she no longer wants you because of this matter.

553
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,260
Is that true?

554
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,330
Yes.

555
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,940
Why are you here then?

556
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,940
Because my sister was harmed.

557
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,810
She thinks she is dirty now.

558
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,130
She showers several times a day.

559
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,740
Her skin is all red from all the scrubbing.

560
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,500
Her boyfriend broke up with her because of this.

561
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,460
She is depressed.

562
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,180
That bad?

563
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,530
How would you feel

564
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,330
if your daughter's clothes were ripped off

565
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,940
and she was touched

566
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,050
by all those men?

567
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,130
Those scoundrels...

568
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:58,900
Mr. Wan,

569
00:25:59,050 --> 00:25:59,980
this isn't hazing.

570
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,090
It's sexual harassment.

571
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,850
I must seek justice for my sister.

572
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,090
The Wang family doesn't dare to come to you

573
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,420
because you're the secretary.

574
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,290
You're the leader.

575
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,020
But I'm not afraid.

576
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,700
You're the secretary. You're the leader.

577
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,370
And that's all the more reason
why you should be sensible!

578
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,700
And if I'm not?

579
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,660
I'll sue.

580
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,220
If I do something about this,

581
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,290
will you still get a divorce?

582
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,900
That depends on my in-laws.

583
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,220
I don't want to get a divorce.

584
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,180
But if I have to,

585
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,530
for this reason,

586
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,700
I'll accept it.

587
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,700
Did you see your wife?

588
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,050
No.

589
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,700
The people at the village committee
said she had already left.

590
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,500
Left?

591
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,050
Why wouldn't she come back here

592
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,420
if she came back to our village?

593
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,810
Did she actually come back?

594
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,940
Gang wasn't making a fool of you, was he?

595
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
No.

596
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,610
I met the village accountant.

597
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,220
He said Xingfu talked to Mr. Wan

598
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,570
and left afterward.

599
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,530
That's a fact.

600
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,180
It looks like she is determined
to get to the bottom of things for her sister.

601
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,500
She would forsake everything

602
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,850
for her sister.

603
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,530
She would rather abandon this family

604
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,130
for the sake of getting justice for her.

605
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,810
You had better be prepared.

606
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,090
Mom.

607
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,420
I...

608
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,700
I'm not prepared.

609
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,660
And I don't want to be.

610
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,660
I don't want to get a divorce.

611
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,770
If this marriage is going to be broken off

612
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
just like this,

613
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,740
you better get our betrothal gifts back.

614
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,370
Have you read the contract Mr. Zhang sent?

615
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,770
I have.

616
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:11,940
What do you think?

617
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,660
What do you think?

618
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,660
Since the health products factory

619
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,810
is going to be built in our village,

620
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,220
we should put the Wan name on it.

621
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,940
But if we are doing this in the Wan Village,

622
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,050
Wanjia Group
should be the majority shareholder

623
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,370
so that we have a say
in the operation of the factory

624
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,370
in the future.

625
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,220
In that case,

626
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,130
we'll have to put in much more money
than we initially planned.

627
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,050
So what?

628
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,050
The more we put in,

629
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:38,810
the more shares we get,

630
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,020
and the more we'll earn.

631
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,020
You've always liked a tough challenge.

632
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,420
I'm just worried you're too green

633
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,290
and you won't be able to handle it.

634
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,700
That's fine.

635
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,850
If something happens,
the big ones will handle it first.

636
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,020
I have you to fall back on, don't I?

637
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,810
Glib-tongued.

638
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:56,850
How about this?

639
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,980
Tomorrow,

640
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,900
have Cailiang gather
the village committee cadres

641
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,770
for a meeting at the company.

642
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,900
We'll discuss the matter together.

643
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,700
All right.

644
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,770
I'll let them know later.

645
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,020
After the meeting,

646
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,370
make a trip to Wang Youde's place.

647
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,050
What for?

648
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,940
To apologize

649
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,180
to

650
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:19,980
Xingfu's sister.

651
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,850
What's the matter?

652
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,330
What do you mean "what's the matter"?

653
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,370
You want me to apologize to her?

654
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,420
Not happening.

655
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,180
I can't embarrass myself like that.

656
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,810
She hit Chuanjia's head so hard

657
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,330
that he is still hurting.

658
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,130
We were already kind enough

659
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,850
not to have the security team
pull her out and beat her up.

660
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:38,850
And now, you want him to apologize?

661
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,850
Nonsense!

662
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,290
Dad!

663
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,290
I'll take you outside.

664
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,220
You did all those things to her.

665
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,420
What's the big deal with apologizing?

666
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,130
You won't lose anything.

667
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,050
Had she been more forceful,

668
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,370
I would have lost

669
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,500
my life.

670
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,610
Well, she apologized, didn't she?

671
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,570
Why can't you

672
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,940
apologize to her sister?

673
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,050
It's just an apology.

674
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,050
It's not about apologizing.

675
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,090
I was drunk that day.

676
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,220
I didn't mean to do it.

677
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,660
Besides,

678
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,090
I am the general manager
of our company right now.

679
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,850
I have about eight hundred people working for me.

680
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,260
We all make mistakes at work.

681
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,740
If I gave in and apologized

682
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,850
for such a petty thing,

683
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,460
what should I do at work then?

684
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,500
Am I going

685
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,020
to have to give in to everyone and everything?

686
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,020
I wouldn't be able to command any respect then.

687
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,900
No one would listen to me.

688
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,530
Dad.

689
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,420
Wedding hazing has always been a tradition.

690
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,770
It's not as if I started it.

691
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,940
Everyone does that at their wedding.

692
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,940
Wang Youde

693
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,700
asked me

694
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,850
to go, didn't he?

695
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,740
You're older than them.

696
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,460
You shouldn't have participated
in the wedding hazing.

697
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,740
Besides,

698
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,050
you guys went overboard.

699
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,900
How could you guys

700
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,370
rip her outfit apart?

701
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,460
How dare you laugh?

702
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,460
She's at least a female undergraduate, you know?

703
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,500
She's not married yet.

704
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,330
No one will do that to her if she's married.

705
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,330
What I meant was,

706
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,180
even if I did go overboard,

707
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,050
her elder sister smashed my head

708
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,570
until I was bleeding all over the place.

709
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,770
I accepted my fate, right?

710
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,260
I didn't cause trouble for her.

711
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,330
But she apologized to you.

712
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,020
We wouldn't need the cops

713
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,290
if apologies did work.

714
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,220
What?

715
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,330
I just touched her sister.

716
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,900
Her sister won't die from it.

717
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,610
She smashed me on the head, you know?

718
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,770
Now, she wants an explanation from me?

719
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,850
The issue will be resolved
as long as you take a step back.

720
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,220
Figure it out yourself.

721
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,090
You should

722
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,180
tell them that instead.

723
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,260
I won't go.

724
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,700
He always sides with outsiders.

725
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,050
Xingyun!

726
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,180
Xingyun.

727

728
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,980
Mom, where's Xingyun?

729
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,700
Her stuff is missing.

730
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,180
Xingyun

731
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
has returned to the city.

732
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,660
This is her letter to you.

I've already spoken to Mr. Wan.

that he'd give us an explanation.

Will he give you an explanation?

783

Mr. Wan promised me
that he'd give me an explanation.

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,520
That's impossible.

Why is that impossible?

Just wait and see.

[Wanjia Group, Yuzhong Wanjia
Health Products Factory Construction Proposal]

811
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,840
So,

812
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,710
the goal of this meeting today

813
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,560
is mainly to discuss

814
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
the construction
of the health products factory.

815
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,560
That's the main thing.

816
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,110
However,

817
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,960
I want to talk about one thing

818
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,520
before we get into it.

819
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,750
All of you knew

820
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,710
that an unhappy incident

821
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,960
occurred at the wedding ceremony

822
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,440
of Wang Youde's son.

823
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,400
They overdid the celebration.

824
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,310
It ended terribly.

825
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,590
Of course,

826
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,480
wedding hazing

827
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,310
is an ancient custom

828
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,880
that has been passed down from our ancestors.

829
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,750
However, there are good customs and bad customs.

830
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,520
In my opinion,

831
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,520
we should retain the customs if they're good

832
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,480
and eliminate them if they're bad.

833
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,920
We should change our existing customs.

834
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,790
So, I hereby suggest

835
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,230
that from now onward,

836
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,590
no one is allowed to haze
another person's wedding

837
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,920
in such a manner again.

838
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,080
Do you guys have any opinions?

839
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,040
Can you guys express

840
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,270
a clear stand regarding this proposal?

841
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,310
We'll change our customs here.

842
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,230
I don't have any objections.

843
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,670
No objections?

844
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,310
Alright then.

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:34,840
go now.

847
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,630
Head to the village committee

848
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,310
and ask them to post this on the notice board.

849
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:37,840
Okay, Mr. Wan.

850
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,560
I'll depart immediately.

851
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,080
Alright, let's get back to business.

852
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,400
So,

853
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,630
regarding the construction
of the health products factory,

854
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,710
I assume all of you

855
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,190
have read the contract, loan agreements,
and so on.

856
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,270
Tell me your opinions.

857
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,920
Cailiang, why don't you start first?

858
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm not all too familiar with it.

859
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,710
If so,

860
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,400
I'll get the ball rolling then.

861
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,310
First,

862
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,110
I agree with Chuanjia's suggestion

863
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,790
of becoming their major shareholder.

864
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,400
After all, the factory is going to be built

865
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,750
in Wan Village.

866
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,110
It won't look nice

867
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,310
if they don't put our brand

868
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,790
in the factory's name.

869
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,040
However, if we want to become
their major shareholder,

870
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,750
that means...

871
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,190
That means

872
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,000
we have

873
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,270
to spend a lot more

874
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,080
than what our budget

875
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,670
allows.

876
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,710
I'm not saying this because the village

877
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,400
cannot afford to take out the money.

878
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,670
The problem

879
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,750
is that after the factory is built

880
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,840
and the production line starts running,

881
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,270
we at least need to promote our products

882
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,630
on the market.

883
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,150
By then, we have to employ sales agents,

884
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,880
do promotions, advertisements,

885
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,670
there are all kinds of fees.

886
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,840
This is an endless pit.

887
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,590
We can fill the hole

888
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,270
if the factory does well.

889
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,750
But what if it doesn't do well?

890
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:45,400
Am I right?

891
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,080
We've invested a lot of money in the early stage.

892
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,750
We can't just let them go to waste.

893
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,230
Second, the Wan Village

894
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,790
is known as the Star Village

895
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,790
and a wealthy village.

896
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,840
What should we do

897
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,110
if the reputation of our village

898
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,960
was affected because of it?

899
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,750
Was that

900
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,790
your personal opinion?

901
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,880
Or was that your collective opinion

902
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,920
after you guys were done discussing?

903
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,710
This...

904
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,880
How can we achieve anything
if all of you are such cowards?

905
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,110
I don't understand something.

906
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,630
In the past, when you guys went into the mountains
to harvest ores

907
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,150
and sell them,

908
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,960
you guys couldn't afford any food,

909
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,150
and there weren't even any decent roads.

910
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,400
Even so, you guys made it.

911
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,310
What's wrong with you all now?

912
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:24,880
Have you guys lost your guts

913
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,960
now that life is getting better

914
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,080
and the living conditions have been improved?

915
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,880
Now that the nation's economy is well-developed,

916
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,480
people are having it way easier now.

917
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,750
What do you think they need now?

918
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,790
Of course, they'll think about health
and longevity.

919
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,190
Think about it, during festive occasions

920
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,110
or weekends,

921
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,310
who would still bring

922
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,840
a chicken or a duck with them

923
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,110
to visit their friends

924
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,080
or relatives?

925
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,000
Health products are the norm now.

926
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,310
The packaging is nice,

927
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,040
they look great,

928
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,150
and they're practical too.

929
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,150
There are so many health products
on the market right now.

930
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,560
All of them are selling like hotcakes.

931
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,630
Mr. Wan,

932
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,710
we are just a bit concerned.

933
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,560
The health products market

934
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,920
is saturated.

935
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,230
If we launch another brand,

936
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,560
we might not be noticed.

937
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,520
What if we incur losses

938
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,000
because we can't sell them out?

939
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,480
It's a huge investment.

940
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,150
You guys are already thinking about the losses

941
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,750
when we haven't started the business yet?

942
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,230
If you're afraid our products might go unnoticed,

943
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,310
we should put in more effort
and make it more obvious,

944
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,150
don't you think so?

945
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,040
Improve the packaging

946
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,000
and improve the product content.

947
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,630
If it doesn't work in the North,
sell it in the South.

948
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,110
If no one buys them in the city,
we can sell them in the villages.

949
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,190
I'm sure we can sell them out.

950
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,190
Why did you guys think we wanted
to build this factory in the first place?

951
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,110
It's because you guys kept nagging us

952
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,310
about it during our meetings.

953
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,400
The tile factory

954
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,360
and construction material factory

955
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,790
are getting more and more obsolete.

956
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,750
They don't make much profit now.

957
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,040
That's why

958
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,230
we said we wanted to build
a health products factory

959
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,310
and change the enterprise,

960
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:41,960
am I right?

961
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,440
So, according to you guys,

962
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,190
we should just do nothing

963
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,360
and wait for our demise, huh?

964
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,480
What are you doing?

965
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,630
Mind your manners.

966
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,310
We're discussing it right now, aren't we?

967
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,710
What kind of attitude was that?

968
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,150
Mr. Wan,

969
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,400
Chuanjia's words
aren't completely unreasonable.

970
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,880
Anyway,

971
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,190
we'll take risks no matter if we proceed with

972
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,560
or cancel the project.

973
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,630
You see, we just think

974
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,000
that we should think of the countermeasures

975
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,080
beforehand

976
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,360
so that we won't panic

977
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,880
when we face issues in the future.

978
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,080
We just want to take some precautions.

979
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,560
Alright.

980
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,480
There will surely be difficulties.

981
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,520
Am I right?

982
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,710
However, we mustn't run away

983
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,310
at the first sight of them.

984
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,670
We made it

985
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,670
even though we were

986
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,110
penniless in the past.

987
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,400
Now, I'm sure

988
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,400
we can get through this without any problem.

989
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,360
Chuanjia is anxious.

990
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,590
I can understand his feelings.

991
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,190
However,

992
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,360
you need

993
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,040
to take note of your attitude.

994
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,360
Am I right?

995
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,360
The Wan Village

996
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,040
is considered

997
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,230
a wealthy village no matter

998
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,270
in the city or the county.

999
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,270
However, if we expand our scope
to the entire province,

1000
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,400
even the entire nation,

1001
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,520
we will cease to be excellent.

1002
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,840
We can't just settle down

1003
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,520
just because we're leading
a comfortable life now.

1004
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,110
The Wan Village's glorious days

1005
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,440
are yet to come.

1006
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,150
That's why

1007
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,440
we need everyone here

1008
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,590
to stay united

1009
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,400
and work hard together.

1010
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,270
Don't worry, Mr. Wan.

1011
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,670
Just lead the way.

1012
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,040
We'll follow your lead.

1013
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,270
We shall spare no effort.

1014
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,750
Since no one has any objections,

1015
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,040
it's decided

1016
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,040
then.

1017
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,590
-Okay.
-Sure.

1018
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,670
Hello.

1019
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,230
Hello.

1020
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,360
I contacted you before

1021
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,480
regarding the unit rental.

1022
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,670
Ah, it's you? Please come in.

1023
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,520
Thank you.

1024
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,230
Do I need to change into slippers?

1025
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,110
It's alright.

1026
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,590
Take a look.

1027
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,480
This is the kitchen.

1028
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,520
It's shared.

1029
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,710
In front of us is a washroom.

1030
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,230
It's also shared.

1031
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,000
Right now, we have two free rooms.

1032
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,960
The room facing the south
costs 900 yuan per month.

1033
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,560
This one facing the west costs 800 yuan per month.

1034
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,040
800 yuan per month for a tiny room like this?

1035
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,840
That's right.

1036
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,560
Can you lower the price by a little?

1037
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,480
I just graduated, and I haven't found a job yet.

1038
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,520
I'm sorry, young girl.

1039
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,360
That's the market price.

1040
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,310
Alright then.

1041
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,400
I'll take this room.
