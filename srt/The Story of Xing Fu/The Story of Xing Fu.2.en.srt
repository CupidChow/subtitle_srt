Why ask that?

00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,719
I want to cook.

How come you still have the appetite?

11

Everyone has to eat.

Dad and Mom are old now.

They've not stopped for a breath the whole day.

14
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,199
They might need food.

Oh, my goodness.

16
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,719
Pack your things up

Excuse me.

31
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,120
I wonder where's the health center.

Hey.

37
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,560
Isn't she the daughter-in-law

39

That's her.

Did she really beat Chuanjia?

41
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,199
Yes, it was her.

42
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,560
I saw it with my own eyes.

43
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,080
Blimey, that was scary.

44

How dare she?

47

49

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,080
however, she's so ruthless.

No.

132
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,279

he has only got three stitches on his head.

134

I saw Wan Chuanjia at the health center just now.

He's fine

143

It was all rumors.

that Wan Chuanjia is alright?

147
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,560
I saw it with my own eyes.

just now?

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,600
Did he ask for compensation?

158
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,839
Why would you say that?

159
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,040
Would they covet

160
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,240
our paltry wedge?

161
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,240
Back then, I followed Mr. Wan to the quarry.

162

I was one of the wingmen.

163

I had helped

164
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,319
him before.

165
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,319
So he will forgive you

166
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,560
for my sake.

167
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,480
Am I right?

168
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,639
Does it mean

169
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,360
he's not going to hold us accountable?

170
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,240
You've beaten his son

171
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,319
so badly.

172
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,879
Do you think there are no consequences?

173
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,000
We don't have to give them compensation,

174
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,759
but we owe them an apology.

175
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,800
Tomorrow, you should bring Xingfu along

176
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,560
to pay a call on Mr. Wan

177
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,319
and apologize to them.

178
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:37,079
Then,

179
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
we can just turn the page.

180
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,320
Xingfu.

181
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,240
Did you hear that?

182
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,840
We'll visit Mr. Wan tomorrow

183
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,720
and eat the humble pie.

184
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,399
And everything will be over.

185
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,519
Xingfu.

186
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,600
Alright.

187
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,919
(Come and eat.)

188
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,840
(Xiuyu.)

189
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,759
(-Coming.)
(-Qingzhi, come and eat.)

190
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,960
Dad.

191
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,519
You should have been there.

192
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,759
Chuanjia was bleeding heavily

193
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,879
when he was taken

194
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,360
to the health center.

195
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,799
They were beating him to a pulp.

196
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,399
He deserves that.

197
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,120
They should have beaten you harder.

198
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,000
Only those youngsters would play pranks
at the bridal chamber ritual,

199
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,639
how could a senior like you go there too?

200
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,519
I didn't.

201
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,919
I was just kidding

202
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,159
with the bridesmaid.

203
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,120
You were being rude.

204
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,159
You deserve it.

205
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,200
After all,

206
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,799
you're the General Manager of the Wanjia Group.

207
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,799
It was embarrassing for you

208
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,159
to be hit by the woman who just got married.

209
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,320
Okay, I got it.

210
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,799
No worries.

211
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,720
I'll go to her with a few people tomorrow.

212
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,320
What are you going to do?

213
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,960
I'm going to see her at Wang's house.

214
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,240
I can't let it slide.

215
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't you dare.

216
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,200
You were hit by her

217
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,159
in such a situation.

218
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:02,960
Yet, you still want to make a big scene

219
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,799
by going to her house to see her.

220
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,000
Everyone will know eventually.

221
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,639
Don't you think it was embarrassing enough?

222
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,679
I know it was embarrassing.

223
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,559
That's why I'm thinking of...

224
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,159
Shut up!

225
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,159
You're already in your thirties.

226
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,840
Although you're not a member of the party,

227
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,440
you're a member of the Wan Village Committee.

228
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,279
You're always acting ignorantly.

229
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,879
I wouldn't dare let you inherit the business
of the Wanjia Group.

230
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,919
Answer your phone call.

231
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,240
Mind your own business.

232
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,039
Chuanmei.

233
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,720
Dad.

234
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,600
Chuanmei.

235
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,360
How have you been lately?

236
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,240
How is your health condition?

237
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,559
I've not been doing good.

238
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,360
Your brother has been making me angry.

239
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,120
I'm reprimanding him now.

240
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,559
Don't listen to dad spouting nonsense.

241
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,080
He's about to get himself a new wife.

242
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,240
Dad.

243
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,519
Chuanmei.

244
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,240
Don't get angry because of him.

245
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,879
I'm not angry

246
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,039
after hearing your voice.

247
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,320
Come back soon

248
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,159
to supervise him on my behalf.

249
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,200
When are you coming back?

250
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,799
After I'm done with my work.

251
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,720
Go ahead and carry on with your work.

252
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,919
I really miss you. Don't come back then.

253
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,559
Come back only when I'm dead.

254
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,440
Xingfu.

255
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,960
Let's sleep then.

256
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,720
What are you thinking about?

257
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,080
Xingfu.

258
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,600
What are you thinking about?

259
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,519
Nothing.

260
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,360
Let's sleep.

261
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:46,759
Thinking about it now,

262
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,679
it's like a dream.

263
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,000
Xingfu.

264
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Did you know

265
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,320
that I'd fallen in love with you

266
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,200
at first sight

267
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,879
during our blind date?

268
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,080
Our daughter-in-law

269
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,120
is making us worried.

270
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,240
I think she's quite good.

271
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,039
She dares to speak up and stand up for others.

272
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,879
She's not a coward.

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,559
There's nothing good
about standing up for others.

274
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,440
As the saying goes,

275
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,679
the one who stands up first will be bullied.

276
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:00,960
Why is it so?

277
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,240
Because he's seeking trouble.

278
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,080
That's much better than being a coward.

279
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,279
The three men of the Wang family

280
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,440
are all upright.

281
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,320
But when there's an issue,

282
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,679
they will chicken out.

283
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,000
How useless.

284
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,240
Now I understand

285
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,799
that you want our daughter-in-law
to be on your side.

286
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:18,879
You're right.

287
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,159
So what?

288
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,399
Xingfu.

289
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,279
Xingfu.

290
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,559
Why did you wake up?

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,480
Why are you sitting here?

292
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,200
Haven't you been sleeping?

293
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,360
What are you thinking about?

294
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
I thought that I'd understood it.

295
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,759
But after thinking about it a couple of times,
I think

296
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,519
that it's not reasonable

297
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,759
for us to apologize to Wan Chuanjia

298
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,440
when he was the one

299
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,440
who bullied my sister first.

300
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,720
Do you all celebrate a marriage like that here?

301
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,360
Xingfu.

302
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,000
Our family

303
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,519
are small potatoes and have no power

304
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,519
in the Wan Village.

305
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,080
My parents

306
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,039
wouldn't dare offend
the superiors in the village.

307
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,399
They're afraid that your life won't be peaceful
in the future.

308
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,120
Do bear with it.

309
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,960
Moreover,

310
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,039
you've hit him on his head.

311
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:04,799
You're right.

312
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,879
After all, I hit him on his head.

313
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,039
I should go and apologize to him.

314
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,120
Xingfu.

315
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,840
I can see

316
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,000
that you're an understanding person.

317
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,870
We'll be a family in the future.

318
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,940
You'll make the call for everything.

319
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,870
Let's live our lives peacefully in the future,

320
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,750
okay?

321
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,300
Xingfu, regardless of anything,

322
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,820
Mr. Wan is the elder.

323
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,700
You have to be mindful of what you say there.

324
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,660
Don't act inappropriately.

325
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,990
Say more positive things.

326
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,470
Do you get it?

327
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,710
Dad and Mom, I got it.

328
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,430
Go then.

329
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,750
We'll make a move then.

330
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Xiuyu.

331
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,470
Stop learning.

332
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,910
None of the guests eat well yesterday.

333
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,430
I'm going to sort out the candies and cigarettes.

334
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,820
After I'm done, send them to each house
with your brother.

335
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,540
I'm not going.

336
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,540
The one who is in the wrong
should make up for the mistake.

337
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,750
It doesn't make sense for me to go.

338
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,750
Is it so hard for you to send the candies?

339
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,620
Does it trouble you a lot?

340
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,270
I'm busy.

341
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,990
I still have to read lots of books.

342
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,380
You're just a woman.

343
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,750
It's useless for you to study every day.

344
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,140
I want to study accounting.

345
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,270
You're not capable enough

346
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,510
to study accounting.

347
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,470
You have the surname "Wang",

348
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,620
not "Wan".

349
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,540
I can't believe you're thinking
of climbing the social ladder.

350
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,060
Just find someone to get married to.

351
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,140
That's much better than anything else.

352
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,140
Hurry up and go.

353
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,860
You go, too.

354
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,990
Go and get a bun.

355
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,670
The kid has already grown up,

356
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,710
but he's not eating at the table.

357
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,710
You adults didn't set rules for him either.

358
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,140
His mom failed to teach him properly.

359
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,270
If she doesn't feed him like this,

360
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,270
what should we do if he's not willing to eat?

361
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,510
Are you not going to do anything about it?

362
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,300
You failed to set a good example for him.

363
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,140
You always check your phone while eating.

364
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,670
Always.

365
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,060
That's why the kid won't behave well.

366
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,340
I learned this from you.

367
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,620
Are you solely focusing on eating?

368
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,270
You're also holding different things.

369
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,300
We're checking out different things.

370
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,620
The county superior is coming to inspect

371
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,950
the project of the factory
producing healthcare products tomorrow.

372
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,710
I have to get prepared.

373
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,780
You can't possibly take part in it

374
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,820
in such a condition.

375
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,270
If that's the case,

376
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,430
I'll tell the superior tomorrow

377
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,100
that when I went to the construction site
for inspection earlier,

378
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,580
I was hit on the head

379
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,710
by falling rocks on the mountain.

380
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,950
The superiors prefer this kind of reason.

381
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,030
Go away.

382
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,140
You're not exactly cultured

383
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,620
but you always have some pointless ideas.

384
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,710
Who is it?

385
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,340
Who is it?

386
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,060
I'm coming.

387
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,950
Be good while eating.

388
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,340
I'm coming.

389
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,990
Mrs. Wan.

390
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
We're here to see Mr. Wan.

391
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,670
Dad.

392
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,270
Qinglai is here with his wife,
whom he just married.

393
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,670
You two are here.

394
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,190
Mr. Wan.

395
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,470
You're...

396
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,100
Chuanjia.

397
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,300
Well...

398
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,580
Mr. Wan.

399
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,300
I brought Xingfu

400
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,300
with me here today

401
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,470
to send our apologies.

402
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,470
Xingfu didn't think it through

403
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,300
when she hit you yesterday.

404
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,910
It was a stupid mistake.

405
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,710
You...

406
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,580
Can you be

407
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,380
the bigger person

408
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,430
and forgive us this time?

409
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,340
Qinglai.

410
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,060
You weren't the one who hit me yesterday.

411
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,620
Why are you doing all the talking?

412
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:28,950
Moreover,

413
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,380
why weren't you there yesterday

414
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,540
to keep your wife under control?

415
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,380
Mr. Wan.

416
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,710
Chuanjia.

417
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,860
It was my fault that I hit you yesterday.

418
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,860
I apologize to you.

419
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,510
That's enough.

420
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,340
It's very good to see that Xingfu is remorseful

421
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,030
for her mistake.

422
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,910
Let's end this matter here.

423
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,950
But...

424
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,300
There are still a few words I need to tell you.

425
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,230
Xingfu.

426
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,620
The Wan Village

427
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,270
is unlike the other villages.

428
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,470
Our motto is,

429
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,620
"All for Wan,

430
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,100
Wan for All."

431
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,710
Get it?

432
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,580
We can only prosper

433
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,430
if all the members of the village

434
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,470
can work together harmoniously.

435
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,510
Don't you agree?

436
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,430
Xingfu only did that yesterday

437
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,190
because she was feeling giddy.

438
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,670
She spent an entire night
regretting what she did.

439
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,270
Don't worry.

440
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,470
This time,

441
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,620
she'll surely learn her lesson.

442
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,190
An entire night?

443
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,300
Then, did you have the time
for the main event last night?

444
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,670
You're the senior.
How could you say things like that?

445
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,140
Alright.

446
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,950
It's not a big deal.

447
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,580
Let's put it behind us

448
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,990
and carry on with our lives.

449
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,820
Thanks, Mr. Wan.

450
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,580
It's fine.

451
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,780
My dad told me to bring you these.

452
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,140
I'll leave them here.

453
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,030
That's too kind of you.

454
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,990
We'll get going.

455
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,670
Sure.

456
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:45,750
Chuanjia, see them out.

457
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,750
Let's go, Xingfu.

458
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,820
Wait a minute.

459
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,100
I'm not done yet.

460
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,510
Mr. Wan.

461
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,140
It was my fault that I assaulted him.

462
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,470
I brought you gifts
and apologized for my mistake.

463
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,060
Then, what about the things

464
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,620
Chuanjia did to my sister?

465
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,300
Xingfu, what are you talking about?

466
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,270
What is this?

467
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,270
Let's go.

468
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,030
He owes my sister an explanation.

469
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,950
Mr. Wan.

470
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,780
I only hit Chuanjia

471
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,540
because he bullied my sister.

472
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,510
Let's talk things out.

473
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,140
I didn't bully your sister, all right?

474
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,230
You got married, right?

475
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,380
I was just having fun at the wedding.

476
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,230
We were all having fun and it was just a joke.

477
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,820
We were all trying to create a good atmosphere.

478
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,990
-It was just a joke.
-You bullied her.

479
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,270
Xingfu.

480
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,910
A wedding day is a happy day.

481
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,230
We all want to make it fun.

482
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,380
As the old saying says,

483
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,670
"There are no rules during the first three days
of the marriage."

484
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,860
Although

485
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,710
the joke was a little too much,

486
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,060
it's not unforgivable.

487
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,820
But that was too much, Mr. Wan.

488
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,470
My younger sister just graduated from college.

489
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,620
She is still single.

490
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,540
How is she supposed to live with this?

491
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,820
I understand, but...

492
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,380
What do you want then?

493
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,910
Mr. Wan.

494
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,820
I suppose you're a sensible man.

495
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,910
It was my fault that I hit him,

496
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,100
but Chuanjia is at fault too
for what he did to my sister.

497
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,670
Qinglai.

498
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,100
How often do you pay respects

499
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,060
to your ancestors

500
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,510
to get such a wife?

501
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,140
Since I became the secretary,

502
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,340
many people

503
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,950
have come to thank me.

504
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,470
But you're the first person

505
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,140
to come to me

506
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,380
and ask me to eat humble pie.

507
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,820
I didn't ask for an apology from you.

508
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,430
He bullied my sister,

509
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,620
so he should apologize.

510
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,540
Chuanjia,

511
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,990
why don't you bring some gifts

512
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,300
and visit Xingfu's house

513
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,300
to apologize

514
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,380
to her sister?

515
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,990
Why should I, Father?

516
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,710
Whenever there's a wedding in the Wan Village,

517
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,270
all families would have the wedding hazing

518
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,140
and they are all fine with it.

519
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,510
But it becomes a problem when it's their family.

520
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,540
Isn't it Mr. Wang who invited me to go?

521
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,270
What are you still waiting for, Wang Qinglai?

522
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,620
Hurry up and bring your wife home!

523
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,300
Why should I go home?

524
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,510
I haven't finished reasoning!

525
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,380
You are asking me why?

526
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,230
That's because this is my house.

527
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,540
It's not a place for you to reason with me.

528
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,540
Then does it mean
that your family is unreasonable?

529
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:50,540
Get her out!

530
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,140
Let's go, Xingfu!

531
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,030
How could you speak like that?

532
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,270
Is that how you act as a cadre?

533
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,340
Listen to me, Father.

534
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:54,910
Stop already.

535
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,430
You keep saying that we must be reasonable,

536
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,430
now they've come to you

537
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,580
to reason with you!

538
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,620
Does she look like she came to apologize?

539
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,270
She just came to mess around!

540
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:01,990
Let go!

541
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,950
-Look at her, she's not letting this go!
-Xingfu!

542
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,230
Xingfu! Xingfu!

543
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,580
Mr. Wan,

544
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,860
I'll only ask you this.

545
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,860
Is there no place

546
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,430
in the Wan Village where we can be reasonable?

547
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,380
What do you mean?

548
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,710
Are you implying
that I'm abusing my power as a secretary?

549
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,380
Why wouldn't there be a place for reasoning?

550
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:16,950
You...

551
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,860
You can go to the court

552
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,580
or the police station,

553
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,540
go and report me!

554
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,060
Dismiss me as the secretary if you can!

555
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,470
I've been meaning to resign anyway.

556
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,430
If you reported me successfully,

557
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,380
I will thank you.

558
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,270
Go and report me! Go.

559
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,510
We must speak nicely.

560
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,230
Madam!

561
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,100
Madam!

562
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,910
It's you two.

563
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:46,950
Madam,

564
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,270
These are my brother

565
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,510
and my sister-in-law's wedding candies.

566
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,780
I brought them to you.

567
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,470
Xiuyu.

568
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,230
How did it go with Mr. Wan?

569
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,030
Madam,

570
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,510
Mr. Wan didn't blame us.

571
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,510
My brother has taken my sister-in-law

572
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,780
to make an apology to him.

573
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,540
This incident is over already.

574
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,340
Xiuyu,

575
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,340
forgive me for saying this,

576
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,060
your sister-in-law is new here,

577
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,510
and she acted out of line.

578
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,710
But you guys can't just let her mess around

579
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,670
in the future either.

580
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,230
If we see it from the public's perspective,

581
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,380
Mr. Wan is the head of the Wan Village

582
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,430
who leads us to the path of wealth.

583
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,030
If we see it from a personal perspective,

584
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,300
what kind of life

585
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,710
did the Wang Family have before this?

586
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,030
Isn't it because Mr. Wan became the secretary

587
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,380
and gave your family a piece of land

588
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,060
and got you a position in the Group?

589
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,820
As humans,

590
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,470
we can't be ungrateful.

591
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,910
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

592
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,190
Madam, we understand all the things you've said.

593
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,030
My sister-in-law was not
in her right mind yesterday.

594
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,430
After this lesson,

595
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,510
she won't repeat it again.

596
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,670
That's great!

597
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,190
Then I'll keep these

598
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,340
wedding candies, okay?

599
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,230
Okay.

600
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,580
How can you speak to Mr. Wan like that?

601
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,710
What did I say?

602
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,100
What did I say wrong?

603
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,030
Okay, even though what you said was right,

604
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,710
you still can't speak

605
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,820
to Mr. Wan like that.

606
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,620
Then how should I say it?

607
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,990
Should I kneel?

608
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,670
-Madam!
-Madam!

609
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,430
What's wrong?

610
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,030
Xiuyu!

611
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,670
Don't be so anxious.

612
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,100
Mr. Wan had promised

613
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,230
that if Xingfu admits her mistake,

614
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,430
everything will be over.

615
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,860
What's wrong with this girl? Has she gone crazy?

616
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,100
-What happened?
-Why didn't you give these out?

617
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,230
Don't even mention this again!

618
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,270
Next time, don't ever ask me

619
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,190
to do such an embarrassing thing.

620
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,670
I feel ashamed.

621
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,060
You're back.

622
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,780
Mom, let me talk to her.

623
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,270
What did Mr. Wan say?

624
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,910
Xingfu made Mr. Wan annoyed with one sentence.

625
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,300
What did I tell you before you left?

626
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,670
Didn't I tell you to say something nice?

627
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,580
What did you say to him again?

628
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,580
Why did you make Mr. Wan more annoyed?

629
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,750
I didn't say anything.

630
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,270
And I've apologized too.

631
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,780
Mr. Wan also said that this matter was over.

632
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,140
I just asked him

633
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,340
if Chuanjia

634
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,710
could apologize to my sister too.

635
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,270
You are so daring.

636
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,620
You hit Chuanjia

637
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,340
and you still want him
to apologize to your sister?

638
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,580
Are you out of your mind?

639
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,300
I did something wrong

640
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,060
and I can apologize.

641
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,030
Why can't he apologize too?

642
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,340
Why are you so stubborn?

643
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,510
What kind of mistake did Chuanjia make?

644
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,950
You go around and ask the people out there.

645
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,470
The last time when Shicai got married,

646
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,910
they tied the father-in-law
with his daughter-in-law together to ride a donkey.

647
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,780
But they managed to bear with it.

648
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,540
Why can't you bear it too?

649
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,910
It's their choice if they chose to endure it.

650
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,860
I can't stand it anyway,

651
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,820
and neither can my sister.

652
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,950
I must uphold justice for my sister.

653
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,860
Are you going to ruin our family?

654
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,860
If you're going to be like this,

655
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,710
our Wang Family doesn't dare to have you here.

656
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,430
Father!

657
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,750
As a father-in-law, how can you say such things?

658
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,990
Just ignore him.

659
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,190
Your father is in a fit of anger.

660
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,100
Come here, Xingfu.

661
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,190
Follow me.

662
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,860
Let's talk about this in the room.

663
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:07,950
How can you talk like that?

664
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,270
It's okay, it's nothing.

665
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,580
Ignore him.

666
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,950
Seriously.

667
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,780
Xingfu,

668
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,990
I'll ask you one question,

669
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,750
what do you want to get out of this mess?

670
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,750
Mom.

671
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,710
You're making me confused now.

672
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,670
Are you suggesting

673
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,910
that I want to gain something from this argument?

674
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,230
Don't all people do things
just to get what they want?

675
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,910
If you have to say it like that,

676
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,820
I just want them to distinguish right from wrong.

677
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,300
If they can't tell right from wrong,

678
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,950
are they even human beings?

679
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,820
Why do you have to make it sound so serious?

680
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,030
It's not easy in this world

681
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,380
to tell right from wrong.

682
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,750
Everyone would try to justify

683
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,030
their own actions.

684
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,620
It's obvious that they were rude to us first.

685
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,950
Xingfu,

686
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,540
let me ask you.

687
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,910
If the Wan family insists

688
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,990
that it won't apologize to you,

689
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,030
what will you do?

690
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,990
Are you still going to live
a happy life with Qinglai?

691
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,580
Mom.

692
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,380
You're now doing something
that is out of your capability.

693
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,580
You have really

694
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,910
offended Mr. Wan.

695
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,060
Xingfu, you looked smart on the outside,

696
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,270
but why can't you know your place

697
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,950
when you do things?

698
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,860
In this world,

699
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,030
tell me, who could truly distinguish

700
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,030
between right and wrong?

701
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,540
Well, everyone just

702
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,030
wants to have a simple life.

703
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,340
And it's nothing easy.

704
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,470
Mom.

705
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,910
Are you also afraid of me being a burden to you?

706
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,580
Xingfu.

707
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,140
I'll be honest with you.

708
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,100
Your dad

709
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,750
yells at home all the time.

710
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,140
But, when he's out there,

711
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
he's as quiet as a mouse,

712
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,140
much less talking to Mr. Wan.

713
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,950
When I first married into this family,

714
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,100
I wasn't used to it either.

715
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,270
Thinking back,

716
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,230
I stumbled upon all kinds of problems.

717
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,380
Your dad even beat me once.

718
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,910
After that, I took my time pondering it.

719
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,510
And I eventually wrapped my head around it.

720
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,340
Our family is nothing significant.

721
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,910
It's not influential in this village.

722
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,540
If you keep being defiant,

723
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,860
will we be able to make a living here?

724
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,380
We will have a hard time.

725
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,380
All these years, our family

726
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,620
managed to get by

727
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,910
by staying humble.

728
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,820
Now that Qingzhi

729
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,580
has gotten a postgraduate degree,

730
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,230
I'm able to stand tall in the village.

731
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,510
We're both women, Xingfu.

732
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,910
And all women live for their families, don't they?

733
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,910
When you and Qinglai have a kid,

734
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,190
nurture him well.

735
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,340
Make him a big boss

736
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,580
or a high-ranking official.

737
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,780
By then, you will have the say

738
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,230
on what's right and wrong.

739
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,030
Now,

740
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,990
we have to learn to suck it up.

741
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:06,950
Mom.

742
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,140
I don't agree

743
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,340
with what you said.

744
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,780
Enough.

745
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,340
Get up and stop tossing and turning.

746
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,990
Don't keep things to yourself.

747
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,780
Just say it.

748
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,990
Get up.

749
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,380
Why don't we

750
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,430
go to Mr. Wan's place

751
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,510
and apologize to him again tomorrow?

752
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,100
What?

753
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,580
Why should I apologize to him again?

754
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,820
Did I do something wrong again?

755
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,340
All this would have been over now

756
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,670
with an apology from you.

757
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,270
Yet you insisted on
having Chuanjia apologize to your sister.

758
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,270
And you even pulled a long face before Mr. Wan.

759
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,540
Now that you've driven him mad,

760
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,190
how are you...

761
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,670
You think it's right for Wan Chuanjia

762
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,540
to have bullied my sister?

763
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,580
And Mr. Wan was mean to me because of this.

764
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,780
In fact, I feel wronged.

765
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,990
As my husband,

766
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,580
you dared not defend me

767
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,060
when he was being mean to me.

768
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,140
And you have the cheek
to ask me to apologize to him.

769
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,140
How could you even suggest that?

770
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,140
But

771
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,910
you messed with the secretary.

772
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,300
How are we going to make a living here?

773
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,620
Nothing will change.

774
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,670
We just live our lives as they are.

775
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,030
I don't believe he can do anything to me!

776
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,950
I'm telling you.

777
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,340
If he's really not going to say sorry,

778
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,710
I won't let this slide!

779
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,230
Go to sleep!

780
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,230
Guizhi.

781
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,620
Do you think

782
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,190
Mr. Wan

783
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,510
will fight

784
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,710
with some lass who is new in the village?

785
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,670
He will.

786
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,470
Mr. Wan is a man of principle.

787
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,750
Well, our family is dead meat.

788
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,620
We messed with Mr. Wan.

789
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,990
How about this?

790
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,510
We will visit

791
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,510
Mr. Wan again tomorrow.

792
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,910
And apologize to him again.

793
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,620
Well, in my opinion,

794
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,820
there's nothing bad
about Xingfu's hotheadedness.

795
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,780
Back then, our family

796
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,780
would always be tolerant and give in to things.

797
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,300
Now that we've got an explosive daughter-in-law,

798
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,380
people will think twice

799
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,100
before they mess with us.

800
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,470
Well, aren't you worried

801
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,140
that she will become
more and more temperamental?

802
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,950
What if she ends up

803
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,620
being out of control?

804
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,060
As the saying goes,

805
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,230
time leads one to the ways of the world.

806
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,580
She may be young and wild now.

807
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,620
But once she's given birth

808
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,820
after some time,

809
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,780
she will know how to behave herself.

810
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,300
But how do we deal with Mr. Wan?

811
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,580
Looks like Mr. Wan is not around.

812
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,740
He's off to a meeting?

813
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,390
Perhaps.

814
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,700
Mrs. Wan, is Mr. Wan...

815
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,790
My dad is occupied. You should leave.

816
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:28,790
Don't...

817
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,100
Why don't we

818
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,870
kneel before him again?

819
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,100
How dare you do that again?

820
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,390
Have you forgotten what happened the other day?

821
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,140
How about this? Let Mr. Wan cool off first.

822
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,740
And we will visit him

823
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,260
and apologize to him another day.

824
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,700
What about Xingfu?

825
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,260
She's relentless.

826
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,580
And we didn't manage to placate Mr. Wan.

827
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,990
We're basically stuck in the middle.

828
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,910
I'm thinking...

829
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,390
That won't do.

830
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,260
Why not?

831
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,060
We're going to use my money, not yours.

832
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,140
Where did your money come from?

833
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,350
I gave it to you.

834
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,870
All you care about is money.

835
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,470
Fine, since you're full of ideas, you settle it.
I'll stay out of it.

836
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,910
No, but the thing
is that we're not going to get it back.

837
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,100
Come here, Xingfu.

838
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,790
I have something to tell you.

839
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,620
-What is it?
-Take a seat.

840
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,580
Look.

841
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,390
Here's 1,000 yuan

842
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,140
from Mr. Wan to you.

843
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,350
It's from Mr. Wan?

844
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,390
Did you go to see him again?

845
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,870
Well, your dad and Mr. Wan

846
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,580
have been working together for years.

847
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,870
They go way back.

848
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,430
It's only right for him to have shown
your dad some respect.

849
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,030
Why did he give me this money?

850
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,220
He said...

851
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,390
Well, he had a fit of anger yesterday.

852
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,310
But, when he got home, he gave it a good thought.

853
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,910
And it's not right for Chuanjia
to have bullied your sister.

854
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,390
He even told Chuanjia

855
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,350
to serve both of us tea.

856
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,220
And he apologized to us

857
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,390
for what happened to your sister.

858
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,830
He said this was a token of apology from him.

859
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:14,990
Dad.

860
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,990
Did Wan Chuanjia admit his fault?

861
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:19,830
Yeah.

862
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,350
He did.

863
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,220
You see,

864
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,540
now that both our families have talked it out,

865
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,910
it's water under the bridge now.

866
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,220
Besides, Mr. Wan said

867
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,910
that he likes your personality.

868
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,470
That Qinglai has gotten himself a good wife.

869
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,830
I don't need him to like me.

870
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,390
I just want Wan Chuanjia

871
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,910
to apologize to my sister.

872
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,660
What's this money for?

873
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,310
You stubborn girl.

874
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,580
You're not happy with anything.

875
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,510
Can't you just let it slide?

876
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,390
Indeed. We said,

877
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,350
"We don't want the money.

878
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,950
There's no way we're accepting it."

879
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,910
Mr. Wan got upset hearing that.

880
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,580
Anyway,

881
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,660
it's a token of apology from him.

882
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,700
Right, Xingfu?

883
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,260
There's no way

884
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,350
you should reject an elder like him, right?

885
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,030
Well, that's settled.

886
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,700
Mr. Wan said,

887
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,540
"This is the end of it."

888
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,620
It's great to have turned the page.

889
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,310
Isn't it?

890
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,260
From now on,

891
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,220
we will live our lives honestly.

892
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,950
We will all be fine.

893
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,580
It's in the past.

894
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,470
No one is going to bring it up again.

895
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,140
It's all over now.

896
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,540
Are you making dried eggplant, Xingfu?

897
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,310
Braised meat with dried eggplant
is my favorite dish.

898
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,910
Xingfu?

899
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,870
What's the matter with you, Xingfu?

900
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,660
I'm fine.

901
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,990
Qingzhi.

902
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,140
You came just in time. Come here.

903
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,700
I'm troubled

904
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,060
by something.

905
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,350
You're a postgraduate student.

906
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,100
That makes you cultured.

907
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,660
Help me to get my head around it.

908
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,180
Go ahead, Xingfu.

909
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,350
Dad and Mom said

910
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,140
that they went to see Mr. Wan again.

911
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,700
That Mr. Wan had Wan Chuanjia

912
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,950
apologize to my sister in front of our parents.

913
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,830
And he even gave me 1,000 yuan.

914
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,830
That's new to me.

915
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,310
Right?

916
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,310
Well, do you think

917
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,830
I should accept the money?

918
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,180
Logically speaking,

919
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,830
since Xingyun was bullied by Chuanjia,

920
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,350
it's reasonable

921
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,870
for Mr. Wan to have given you

922
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,180
the money as compensation.

923
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,310
It's just that...

924
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,030
What?

925
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,140
This is just my personal opinion, Xingfu.

926
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,350
It's just

927
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,740
that the situation has changed

928
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,390
with Mr. Wan giving you this money.

929
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,700
It's as if

930
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,510
you asked them for an apology

931
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,180
because you were after this 1,000 yuan.

932
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,620
That's what I thought, Qingzhi.

933
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,220
All I've been after

934
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,700
is nothing but an explanation from them.

935
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,430
If we are to talk about compensation,

936
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,700
I injured Wan Chuanjia's head,

937
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,700
so logically speaking,

938
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,220
I should pay his medical bill.

939
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,700
But he's not asking me to do so.

940
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,660
Yeah.

941
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,830
This won't do.

942
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,990
I have to return this money to Mr. Wan.

943
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,620
Thank you, Qingzhi.

944
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,140
I'm going to beat you up, brat!

945
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,540
Let's talk it out, Dad!

946
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,100
Why are you hitting me?

947
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,260
Talk it out?

948
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,510
You're driving me mad!

949
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,140
Just because you're an intellectual?

950
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,430
What did you mean by that?

951
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,830
Hurry up, go after her!

952
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,910
The situation has changed
with the money involved?

953
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,790
That was truly a bad idea, Mom.

954
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,540
I knew Xingfu wouldn't accept the money.

955
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,060
What's the use of saying that now?

956
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,390
Quick! If she manages to see Mr. Wan, we'll be done for!

957
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:50,990
Hurry up!

958
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,260
Quick! You must stop her!

959
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,430
If she sees Mr. Wan, we will be in trouble!

960
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,390
Mom. Dad.

961
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,580
Well, you shouldn't have lied to Xingfu.

962
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,740
Oh, no!

963
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,510
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

964
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,260
What are you doing?

965
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,060
You think I wanted to do that?

966
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,510
My 1,000 yuan is gone for nothing.

967
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,700
And I'm still distressed by it!

968
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,350
What can I do since your brother married

969
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,910
such an unreasonable wife?

970
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,310
I thought of solving the problem with that money.

971
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,310
And now?

972
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,740
The money is gone, and we're in deep water!

973
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,660
It's all your fault
for coming up with that bad idea.

974
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,180
Why didn't you give her 2,000 yuan instead?

975
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:29,990
Mom.

976
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,950
I'm okay, Mom. He didn't hit me.

977
00:40:41,223 --> 00:40:42,830
[Village Branch Committee of Wan Village]

978
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,430
Cailiang.

979
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,100
It's still early, don't head home yet.

980
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,740
Come with me to the Wanjia Group.

981
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,430
Are you heading out, Mr. Wan?

982
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,180
Okay, sure.

983
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,030
Mr. Wan!

984
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,510
Hold up, Mr. Wan.

985
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,260
It's you again. What is it?

986
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,430
Mr. Wan.

987
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,830
Since Chuanjia has apologized to my sister...

988
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,430
Xingfu!

989
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,660
We won't take the money.

990
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,350
Xingfu.

991
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:57,990
Mom asks you to go home.

992
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:58,870
Hurry up.

993
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,620
Wait.

994
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,180
What do you mean?

995
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,180
I don't get it.

996
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,100
Mr. Wan.

997
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,830
I'm aware this is a token of apology from you.

998
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,390
And we appreciate it.

999
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,100
In fact, we're not after your money.

1000
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,910
Now that Chuanjia has admitted to his mistake

1001
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,700
and apologized for it,

1002
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,620
that's considered an explanation for my sister.

1003
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,870
You should take the money back.

1004
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,510
Let's head home now, Xingfu.

1005
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,430
Wait, Qinglai.

1006
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,830
I guess you're daydreaming.

1007
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,350
I've never given you any money.

1008
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,830
Didn't you ask my mother-in-law

1009
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,870
to pass me the 1,000 yuan

1010
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,260
as an apology for my sister?

1011
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,910
Go home and tell your mother-in-law

1012
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,140
to stop acting like a smart aleck.

1013
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
Or she will end up hurting herself.

1014
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,830
They're really something.

1015
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,140
They managed to come up with that idea to trick me.

1016
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,310
And I ended up buying it!

1017
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,700
Well, what's happened happened.

1018
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,060
Does it make any difference

1019
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,580
whether he apologizes for it or not?

1020
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,100
It's just an apology.

1021
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,510
Does it really matter?

1022
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,830
Of course, it does!

1023
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:16,910
Isn't life

1024
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,580
all about being fair and just?

1025
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,540
I apologized when I was at fault.

1026
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,620
Why can't they apologize

1027
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,620
now that they're at fault?

1028
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,260
No leader would ever

1029
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,430
say sorry for no reason.

1030
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,100
That could reflect on him.

1031
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,390
Come on, Xingfu.

1032
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,790
Stop it already.

1033
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,700
You are now part of the Wang family.

1034
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,830
So, you can't just think about your sister.

1035
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,180
Well, you made a big deal

1036
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,620
out of such a trivial matter.

1037
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,870
How are we going to live our lives after this?

1038
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:42,870
How?

1039
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,390
By resigning ourselves to our fates?

1040
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,260
By deceiving ourselves?

1041
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,510
What's wrong
with resigning ourselves to our fates?

1042
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,430
Who in the world doesn't suffer from grievance?

1043
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,470
My dad,

1044
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,990
my mom, and Xiuyu.

1045
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,950
They're all suffering from grievance
because of this.

1046
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,260
Why

1047
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,180
can't you suck it up

1048
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,790
