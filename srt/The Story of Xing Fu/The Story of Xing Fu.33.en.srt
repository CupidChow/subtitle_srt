[Episode 33]

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,319
Let me take a look at what they've bought.

4
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,640
I don't feel like going,

5
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,079
but you're forcing me to go.

6
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,719
What's so fun about the countryside?

7
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,439
Back then, I hadn't been to the countryside before.

8
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,319
I was curious about it.

9
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,760
That's why I promised your father

10
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,799
to hold our wedding in the countryside.

11
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,200
But

12
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,239
once is more than enough.

13
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,200
I will never go there again.

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,040
It was 30 years ago.

15
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,400
Now, it's totally different.

16
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,200
What's the difference?

17
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,719
Why would the farmers

18
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,560
move to the city

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
instead of staying in the village then?

20
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,599
What are these?

21
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,120
Don't touch them.

22
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,759
Those are my bed sheets,

23
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,000
quilt cover,

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,800
blanket,

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,479
pillowcases, and pillows.

26
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,479
I'm afraid that the place

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,520
isn't sanitary.

28
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,000
Besides,

29
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,319
I brought my cup,

30
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,159
toiletries,

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,280
some tissues,

32
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,400
and

33
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,680
wet wipes.

34
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,680
Mom,

35
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,240
we're just staying there for a few days.

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,759
Aren't you overdoing it?

37
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,759
It'll only benefit us

38
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,439
if we bring our stuff there.

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,400
It won't harm us.

40
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,599
I forgot to buy the sanitizer.

41
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:57,960
I have to take that.

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,080
Whatever.

43
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,919
I hate it when I have to dine together
with the farmers.

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,319
So,

45
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,639
do you think

46
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,000
it's inappropriate for me

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,639
to bring some disposable tableware with me?

48
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,280
I think

49
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,439
it's inappropriate.

50
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,719
Let me say this first.

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,639
I will try my best to get used to it.

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,120
But if I can't,

53
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,319
we'll head back tonight.

54
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,599
By then, just tell them

55
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,800
that your father has work to do

56
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,159
and his superior told him to go back.

57
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,199
Don't try to stop us from going back, okay?

58
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,599
It'll make everyone upset.

59
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,599
Okay.

60
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,120
Mom,

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,080
we'll obey your order.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,039
Listen,

63
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,479
her father

64
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,400
is very pretentious.

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,000
He always does this when he sees me.

66
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,639
Hmm.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,439
Hmm.

68
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,479
Ah.

69
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:50,919
Hmm.

70
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:51,879
Hmm.

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,039
It's fine.

72
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,360
We just need

73
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,159
to apologize

74
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,159
when we see him later.

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,039
I know that.

76
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,039
Mr. Xu,

77
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,919
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,520
Mr. Xu,

79
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,319
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,199
Mr. Xu,

81
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,840
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,919
-They're here.
-They're here.

83
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,479
They're here.

84
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,960
Mr. Xu.

85
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,080
You are

86
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,800
Qinglai, am I right?

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,159
Yes, I'm Qinglai.

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,680
Hi, Qinglai.

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,800
Welcome.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,839
Nice to meet you, Mr. Xu.

91
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,480
Nice to meet you.

92
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,199
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Xu.

93
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:29,959
I'm Qinglai,

94
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,240
Qingzhi's

95
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,000
elder brother.

96
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,199
Oh,

97
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,120
so, you're Qinglai.

98
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:37,720
Mrs. Xu,

99
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,839
I'm Xingfu,

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,439
Qingzhi's sister-in-law.

101
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,360
Mr. Xu,

102
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,279
sorry that you had to worry about Qinglai.

103
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:44,839
Let me hold them for you.

104
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,879
Let's forget about that.

105
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's go inside then.

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,199
This is Xingfu Inn.

107
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,120
This place is called Niaofei Creek.

108
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,720
This is our inn.

109
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,160
The scenery here looks primitive.

110
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,519
The inn does look tasteful.

111
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,439
It's okay, I guess.

112
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,079
People from the city love to
spend their vacation here.

113
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,079
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu,

114
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,000
the journey must've been tough.

115
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,000
Why don't I

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,879
bring your luggage

117
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,079
to your rooms first?

118
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,319
You guys can take a break for now.

119
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,319
Okay.

120
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,519
Why don't you

121
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,879
take a break?

122
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,680
-I'll have a chat with Xingfu.
-Aren't you exhausted?

123
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,560
Not at all.

124
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,000
-You can go ahead.
-I'll bring Mr. Xu to his room.

125
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,000
Mr. Xu, follow me.

126
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,120
Follow me.

127
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,720
You can go ahead then.

128
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,199
Mrs. Xu,

129
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,000
we'll go first.

130
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,920
-Follow me.
-Mrs. Xu.

131
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,240
Let's have some tea in the pavilion.
It's over there.

132
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,040
Okay.

133
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,879
The tea here is excellent
because we brew it with spring water.

134
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,720
Really?

135
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,319
I love tea.

136
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,120
Is that so?

137
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,800
If so, let me give you some tea leaves
before you head back.

138
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,759
It's our local specialty.

139
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,319
Don't be so courteous.

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,600
Here.

141
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,759
Come in.

142
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,199
Where do we leave them?

143
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:40,959
Qinglai, just leave them here.

144
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,439
It's huge.

145
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:43,959
Take a look.

146
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,240
There's a bathtub inside.

147
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,040
-Outside is the balcony.
-Qingzhi!

148
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,199
I love that bathtub!

149
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,959
This...

150
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,399
This is different from what I had imagined.

151
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,279
It's okay, isn't it?

152
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:52,519
Qinglai,

153
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,439
this looks much better than
the pictures you sent me.

154
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,199
Mrs. Xu,

155
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,120
try this tea.

156
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,079
See if it is nice.

157
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,639
Do you like it?

158
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,199
It's not bad.

159
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,680
Mrs. Xu,

160
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,959
I do meet up with Yani in the city quite often.

161
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,879
We do get along well as well.

162
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,959
Yani is a nice girl.

163
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,079
She has helped me out a lot

164
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,360
when I was in the city.

165
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,120
I'm very thankful to her.

166
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,000
Yani told me about you.

167
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,839
You two are close.

168
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,439
Yani

169
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
has a one-track mind.

170
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,800
Sometimes, she doesn't understand

171
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,879
the social norms.

172
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,519
I heard from Qingzhi

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,959
that you are the most capable person

174
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,759
in the family

175
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,680
and

176
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
that you know your codes of conduct well.

177
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,959
If so, I won't beat around the bush with you.

178
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,319
The view here is magnificent.

179
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,000
The environment here is excellent.

180
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,319
Mr. Xu.

181
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,680
Not bad at all.

182
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,319
So...

183
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,160
I was pretty insensible

184
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:57,800
at

185
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
that time.

186
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,160
Sorry for making things difficult for you.

187
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,040
It's all in the past now.

188
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:02,720
Just forget it.

189
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,439
I heard

190
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,600
that you've been doing well since you came back.

191
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:06,920
I'm doing fine, I guess.

192
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,360
Anyway, I've created trouble for you.

193
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,680
Let me apologize to you.

194
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,800
It's all in the past.

195
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,399
Just let bygones

196
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:12,959
be bygones.

197
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,560
Qinglai,

198
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,759
it's fine.

199
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,920
Dad doesn't hold a grudge against people.

200
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,240
Mr. Xu,

201
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:18,879
you guys

202
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,639
can take a break.

203
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,519
I'll go and prepare the meals.

204
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,600
Alright, Qinglai.

205
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,040
Okay.

206
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,879
-I'll go first.
-See you later.

207
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,480
Okay.

208
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,040
Although Yani's father isn't
a high-ranking official,

209
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,439
his poor relatives do flock to him

210
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,439
quite often.

211
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,800
I have to receive them and greet them
with courtesy,

212
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,480
take care of their meals and accommodations,

213
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,639
and deal with

214
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,040
all of their needs.

215
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,199
I have to resolve all of their issues.

216
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,319
The most hateful thing

217
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,399
is that those people

218
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,360
have no courtesy at all.

219
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,920
They'd throw their dirty socks on our couch

220
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,439
and turned our house

221
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,399
upside down.

222
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,759
We had no choice but to endure it.

223
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:51,959
Xingfu,

224
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,319
here are your snacks.

225
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:53,839
Okay.

226
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,240
Mrs. Xu,

227
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,000
let's have some snacks

228
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,519
while talking.

229
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,560
Xingfu,

230
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,480
a business owner

231
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,319
who wants to cooperate with us
will be coming tomorrow.

232
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
I told him to come at 10 AM.

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,519
Okay.

234
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,240
Alright.

235
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,160
Sorry about that, Mrs. Xu.

236
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,759
Please continue.

237
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,240
I didn't say anything much.

238
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,959
There's a business deal tomorrow?

239
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,439
The inn's business has been booming lately.

240
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,839
That's why we receive many offers of cooperation.

241
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,040
Don't worry.

242
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,199
It won't cause any burden

243
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,879
for the family.

244
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,279
The scenery here is truly gorgeous.

245
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,800
We can never enjoy

246
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,439
such fresh air in the city.

247
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,800
How nice.

248
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,399
Mr. Xu.

249
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,039
This place is great.

250
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,399
Is that so? Have you had a look around?

251
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,039
-It must've been tough climbing the hill.
-It is really challenging.

252
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,360
I'm exhausted.

253
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,120
My in-laws were worried that you guys
might be exhausted after the trip.

254
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,080
That's why

255
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,519
they told me to help you guys settle down for now.

256
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,399
You guys can take a break for now.

257
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:57,960
You...

258
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,440
Come on.

259
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,320
Have a seat.

260
00:08:59,399 --> 00:08:59,639
I...

261
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,440
It's fine.

262
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,360
I'll make some preparations.

263
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,200
We can dine together

264
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,240
at the restaurant downstairs
when they come back.

265
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,360
Call me if you need anything.

266
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,240
There's a phone over there.

267
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:07,919
Okay.

268
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,759
You can resume your work.

269
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,519
Please rest well.

270
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,080
Thank you.

271
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,879
What do you think?

272
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,799
It's pretty good.

273
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,120
I didn't expect this place to be this sanitary.

274
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,279
I told you so, didn't I?

275
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,919
Let me have a look.

276
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,919
I don't think you'll use
all those items you brought now.

277
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,759
The countryside has changed entirely.

278
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,799
It's totally different now.

279
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,679
The curtain isn't drawn.

280
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,960
It's actually automatic?

281
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,120
Look.

282
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,000
Look at the amazing scenery.

283
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,200
The scenery here is enchanting.

284
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,159
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu,

285
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,039
please come inside.

286
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,919
They're here.

287
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,919
Dad,

288
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,360
Mom.

289
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,000
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu.

290
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,279
Hello.

291
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,200
Nice to meet you, my girl.

292
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,879
Mrs. Xu,

293
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:57,440
Mr. Xu,

294
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,039
let me introduce them to you.

295
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,799
This is my father,

296
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,600
and this is my mother.

297
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,759
Hello,

298
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,639
my sister.

299
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,159
Hello.

300
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,000
You must've been exhausted from the long trip.

301
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Not at all.

302
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,559
We did take a good rest just now.

303
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,240
Yeah.

304
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,159
You're doing well, aren't you?

305
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,519
Yeah, we're doing great.

306
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:11,919
Hurry.

307
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,600
Have a seat.

308
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,960
Is everyone from your family here?

309
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,039
I have another daughter.

310
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,039
Her name is Xiuyu.

311
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,360
She went to the city

312
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,960
for the factory's training.

313
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
It's our first time seeing each other.

314
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
I've bought some gifts for your family.

315
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,440
Here.

316
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,200
This is a token of my appreciation.

317
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,799
These are

318
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,519
facial masks meant for Xiuyu.

319
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,519
Her face

320
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,279
will be revitalized

321
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,480
after she put this on.

322
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,879
-I hope she'll like it.
-Yeah.

323
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:37,399
Here.

324
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,519
You're too courteous.

325
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,519
-Little Dou!
-Thank you.

326
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,320
Here's a gift for you.

327
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,840
Thank you.

328
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,639
-Thank you.
-Here are some toys for him.

329
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,000
-Thank you so much.
-These are for him.

330
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,799
Thank you so much.

331
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,320
Thank you.

332
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't mention it.

333
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,399
My sister.

334
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,399
This is

335
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,159
the latest trend

336
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,440
in the city now.

337
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,960
Mom,

338
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
this health product

339
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,120
is produced by their village.

340
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,600
What?

341
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,120
I...

342
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,720
I had no idea.

343
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,080
Mrs. Xu,

344
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,919
that's a great gift.

345
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,759
That proves your excellent taste.

346
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,440
Although they were produced here,

347
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,480
we'd never bought them for Dad and Mom.

348
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,080
-Yeah.
-You're so thoughtful.

349
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,960
Great, then.

350
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,799
Try it.

351
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,759
We'll keep this, then.

352
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,360
Sure, keep it.

353
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,960
Thank you, Mrs. Xu.

354
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,440
Thank you.

355
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,120
Don't just stand there.

356
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,080
Please have a seat.

357
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,720
Yeah.

358
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,480
Hurry.

359
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Please have a seat.

360
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,879
Mr. Xu.

361
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,720
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu,

362
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,240
these are the dishes I've made for you all.

363
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,879
They're all quite light.

364
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,960
Please try it and see if you like them.

365
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,039
We provide

366
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,080
serving chopsticks and spoons here.

367
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,960
All of our utensils have been sterilized.

368
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,440
Please use them without any worries.

369
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,679
Both Qingzhi

370
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,399
and Yani

371
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:38,919
are

372
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
excellent children

373
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,279
who strive to improve themselves.

374
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,320
I think

375
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,080
it's time

376
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,919
for them to get married now.

377
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,080
As Yani's parents,

378
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,159
we have

379
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,480
mixed feelings.

380
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,440
We're happy

381
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,039
and

382
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,000
sad

383
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,639
at the same time.

384
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,279
Our child has grown up.

385
00:11:59,279 --> 00:11:59,759
She needs to

386
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,679
leave our side eventually.

387
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,960
So today,

388
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:03,559
we came

389
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,799
all the way

390
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,879
here

391
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:06,960
because first,

392
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,440
we plan

393
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,840
to meet our future in-laws.

394
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,440
Second,

395
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,639
we're here

396
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,720
to discuss their marriage.

397
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,120
Third,

398
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,320
we're here

399
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,840
to check out Qingzhi's hometown too.

400
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:20,799
So,

401
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,639
Wanjia Village...

402
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,120
It's Wan Village.

403
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,600
I see.

404
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,240
It's

405
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,039
Wan Village.

406
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,600
I was born in a village too.

407
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,879
Of course,

408
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,679
we have no way to compare
the days we had and the current times.

409
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,360
Our children

410
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,600
were lucky to be born in this time.

411
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,080
Now,

412
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,360
they have good policies
for village development.

413
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,440
The inn

414
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,200
is excellent.

415
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,159
It's great.

416
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,320
So,

417
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,080
anyway,

418
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,639
their days

419
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,279
will get better and better.

420
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,679
Enough already.

421
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,039
Were you

422
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,840
doing a report just now?

423
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,519
Next,

424
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:57,440
let's welcome

425
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,600
Qingzhi's father to say something.

426
00:12:59,399 --> 00:12:59,960
Me?

427
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,639
I...

428
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:00,919
I...

429
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,320
I think

430
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,120
I'll skip.

431
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,759
Why don't you say something?

432
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,360
You should do it.

433
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,200
Just say something.

434
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,080
Okay.

435
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,080
Mr. Xu,

436
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,200
you see,

437
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,840
people from the countryside
are more straightforward.

438
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,559
We don't know the rules in the city.

439
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,159
Please don't

440
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,759
mind us.

441
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:16,879
You guys can decide

442
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,559
on their wedding.

443
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,080
About the dowry,

444
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,039
just give us a sum.

445
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,000
We'll...

446
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,000
-It's okay.
-We'll try our best.

447
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,759
You can forget about

448
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,559
the dowry.

449
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,720
It's not popular in the city.

450
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,159
So,

451
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,360
it's better for you

452
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,639
to leave the money to the children.

453
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,720
I don't think that's appropriate.

454
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,759
About the wedding date,

455
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,919
we need

456
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,600
to discuss it.

457
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,399
Dad,

458
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,279
didn't we discuss this before?

459
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,200
We won't hold a wedding.

460
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,159
We'll hold a destination wedding.

461
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,200
You're such an insensible child.

462
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,840
You should let him finish his words first.

463
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,279
We still

464
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,039
have to visit

465
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,399
our in-laws tomorrow.

466
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,679
Getting married is a huge deal.

467
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,600
We should

468
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,879
discuss it thoroughly.

469
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,279
That's right!

470
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,480
Qingzhi,

471
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,240
tell us what you think.

472
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,559
Mr. Xu, it's like this.

473
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,960
Both my parents said they would follow my will.

474
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,080
As for me,

475
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,440
I'll follow Yani's will.

476
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,200
We'll have a destination wedding.

477
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,679
If so, let's have a drink.

478
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,639
Let's welcome Mr. Xu and Mrs. Xu to Xingfu Inn

479
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,639
and welcome them

480
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,159
to visit our house.

481
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,399
Mrs. Xu,

482
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,399
all these vegetables

483
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,799
are organic vegetables.

484
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:05,879
We grew them ourselves.

485
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,519
There are no pesticides
or chemical fertilizers.

486
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,519
You can consume them with no worries.

487
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,879
We'll deliver them to you

488
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,000
on time after you finish them.

489
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,960
I'm truly delighted

490
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,519
to enjoy such fresh vegetables.

491
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,000
Thank you so much.

492
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,279
-You gave us so many things.
-It's fine.

493
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:18,960
Just take it.

494
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:19,960
It's fine.

495
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,440
-It's fine.
-Put them in the car.

496
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,200
That's enough.

497
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,679
There are too many things.

498
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,480
My goodness.

499
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,759
Xingfu,

500
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,600
you're a sensible person.

501
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,360
I can rest at ease

502
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,559
now that Yani

503
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,080
has a great sister-in-law like you.

504
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,200
Don't worry.

505
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,679
We will surely treat her well

506
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,360
after she gets married into our family.

507
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,200
Am I right, Qingzhi?

508
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,759
Yeah.

509
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,759
Thank you.

510
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,679
Don't worry.

511
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,240
See you, Xingfu.

512
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Visit us when you're free.

513
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,960
We'll make a move then.

514
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,639
Goodbye, Mrs. Xu.

515
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,440
You guys can head back now.

516
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,600
We'll bring them back then.

517
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:54,919
Thanks.

518
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,440
-See you, Mr. Xu.
-My sister, take care of yourself.

519
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,039
Little Dou.

520
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,559
Qingzhi.

521
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,519
Say goodbye to them.

522
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,559
Drive slowly, okay?

[Wanjia Group]

524
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,220
Thanks.

525
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,220
Xiuyu.

526
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:43,810
You can

527
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,020
pack up your things at home.

528
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,570
You can report for duty
in the Finance Department this afternoon.

529
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,650
I'm too lazy to head back.

530
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,290
You're too lazy to even head home?

531
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,930
What's wrong with you lately?

532
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,930
You can start to work in the Finance Department
right after finishing your training in the city.

533
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,860
This is a great chance for you.

534
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,740
Others need to compete
to get to work there, you know?

535
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,170
You better know what's good for you.

536
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,410
Be punctual.

537
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,020
Do

538
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,980
them again.

539
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,530
Xiuyu,

540
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,020
I thought I told you to report for duty
in the Finance Department?

541
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,290
What are you still doing here?

542
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:25,900
I'm too lazy to head there.

543
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:26,940
You're lazy?

544
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,420
That won't do.

545
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,900
There's no desk for you here.

546
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,530
I've assigned your desk to someone else.

547
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,530
Your desk is in the Finance Department.

548
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,900
I'll leave if there's no desk for me.

549
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,220
Leave?

550
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,660
Where are you going?

551
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,980
You better pack your things.

552
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,330
I'm talking to you!

553
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,500
Xuemei,

554
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:48,980
what's going on?

555
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,740
She's upset when she gets to have training

556
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,810
in the city?

557
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,660
She got transferred to the Finance Department
right after she came back.

558
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
That's amazing.

559
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,370
Do you think

560
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,530
she's having an affair with Mr. Wan Junior?

561
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,260
I'm sure of it.

562
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,740
Mr. Wan Junior definitely

563
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,260
treats her in a different way from us.

564
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,180
I'm Mr. Wan Junior's cousin, you know?

565
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,180
Even so, he's never this nice to me.

566
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,020
She's making it as if we owe her a favor.

567
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,050
But I don't think that's it.

568
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,420
What are you saying?

569
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,260
It's all because she's good at hiding it.

570
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,090
Look at what she's doing right now.

571
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,810
Do you think an ordinary person
can get away with it?

572
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,260
You guys better believe me.

573
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,530
If not, let's make a bet.

574
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,980
I'm sure she'll apply for leave

575
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,220
in the next few days.

576
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,940
Are you saying that...

577
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,770
That's enough.

578
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,850
Stop spouting nonsense.

579
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,700
If Mr. Wan Junior hears about this,

580
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,220
he will sack all of you
even if you're his biological sisters.

581
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,180
When she's being this arrogant,

582
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,660
why should I be afraid of saying this?

583
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,980
What have I done?

584
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,290
What have I done?

585
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,180
Say that again if you dare!

586
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,130
Let go of me!

587
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,330
Xiuyu!

588
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,610
What are you doing?

589
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,050
She loves to gossip, doesn't she?

590
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,460
She can gossip
in front of Mr. Wan Junior all she wants.

591
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,090
Hey,

592
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,290
she was just saying.

593
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,740
You shouldn't take it to heart.

594
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,610
Why are you being so serious?

595
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:09,940
She was just saying?

596
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,370
Fine, I'll do the same.

597
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,500
Mr. Wan Junior and you are having an affair.

598
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,090
Will you be happy with that?

599
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,900
What nonsense are you saying?

600
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,330
So, she can spout nonsense

601
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,420
while I can't?

602
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,530
Besides,

603
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,740
wasn't I speaking the truth?

604
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,610
Everyone in the company knows

605
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,850
that you're into Mr. Wan Junior.

606
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,330
Xiuyu,

607
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,460
are you out of your mind?

608
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,180
I'll be angry

609
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,260
if you keep spouting nonsense like that!

610
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,050
Why should I be afraid

611
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,980
when you're being this arrogant?

612
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,850
Good for you.

613
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,260
You think you're a big shot now?

614
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,050
There's no place for you here!

615
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,420
You better pack your things

616
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,570
and head to the Finance Department!

617
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,660
Listen,

618
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,740
I won't leave.

619
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:56,770
Fine.

620
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,370
I'll tell Mr. Wan Junior about it.

621
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,700
Go ahead.

622
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:06,900
Come in.

623
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,370
Mr. Wan,

624
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,460
didn't you say you transferred Xiuyu
to the Finance Department?

625
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:14,900
What about it?

626
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,660
She said she's not going.

627
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,770
What?

628
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,090
She's not going?

629
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,370
She said she's too lazy to go.

630
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,290
Fine then.

631
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,900
Just let her stay there.

632
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,570
I'll tell the Finance Department later.

633
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,530
But why?

634
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,220
Why are you being so protective of her?

635
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,980
If this continues,

636
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,370
we'll have no way to keep her in check.

637
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,420
If so,

638
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,180
just let her be then.

639
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,130
Just let her do whatever she wants.

640
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,700
Just leave her alone.

641
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,260
But why?

642
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,700
What do you mean?

643
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,770
Why do you have so many questions?

644
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,740
Just do whatever you're told.

645
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,130
What?

646
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,020
Do I need to explain myself to you now?

647
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,290
But...

648
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,290
Just get straight to the point.

649
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,900
Leave and close the door if there's nothing else.

650
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,290
Tell the others

651
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,220
to treat Xiuyu well

652
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,330
and don't cross her.

653
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,940
She's finally leaving.

654
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:34,900
Yeah.

655
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,130
I thought she said she's not leaving?

656
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,090
She was so fierce.

657
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,420
She hurt my hand.

658
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,130
Yeah, right?

659
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:55,770
This is so exhausting.

660
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,220
We don't even know

661
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,610
if we have to work overtime tonight.

662
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:57,980
Yeah.

663
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,460
I still have plenty of things to do at home.

664
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,530
I don't want to work overtime.

665
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,020
Yeah.

666
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,810
Me too.

667
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,770
Let's go.

668
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,530
Let's take the stairs.

669

[Xingfu Inn]

670
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,330
Why are you so early today?

671
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,940
Xiuyu is coming back today.

672
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,420
I brought some dishes home.

673
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,530
I'm planning to make something nice for her.

674
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,460
I've been busy

675
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,050
with the inn lately.

676
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,850
I had no time to catch up with her.

677
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,420
She sounded upset

678
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,660
when I called her too.

679
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,740
Was it

680
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,500
because she felt sad

681
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,420
she didn't register her name

682
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,180
for the exam on time?

683
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,500
Maybe.

684
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,050
Yeah, maybe.

685
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,570
Didn't you tell her

686
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,460
that she could take the exam next time?

687
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,330
Why was she unhappy about that?

688
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,850
As her sister-in-law,

689
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,090
I didn't provide her with any practical help.

690
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,420
So I bought two books for her

691
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,810
to show my support.

692
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,700
Why isn't she back yet?

693
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:10,940
I don't know.

694
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,700
Let me give her a call.

695
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:19,940
Hello, Xiuyu?

696
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,130
Where are you right now?

697
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:23,980
Talk to me.

698
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,090
Where are you?

699
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,180
Why is it so noisy over there?

700
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,810
She hung up on me?

701
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,180
What were you guys thinking?

702
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,130
Let's forget about Dad and Mom.

703
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,530
But how could you and Qingzhi do the same thing?

704
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,180
How could you sign an agreement like that?

705
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,130
Why didn't you stop them?

706
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,460
Do you know that you've sold your sister out
by doing so?

707
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,500
I feel sorry for her too.

708
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,290
But it was so long ago.

709
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,180
We had no choice.

710
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,420
What do you mean by you had no choice?

711
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,370
Qingzhi couldn't come up
with a good solution either.

712
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,530
Anyway,

713
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,020
I'm sure Xiuyu hates me to the core now.

714
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,900
Anyway,

715
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,610
I've let

716
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:17,900
Xiuyu down.

717
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,180
What's the use of saying that?

718
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,940
Why did you guys hide this matter from me?

719
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,420
Not only did they hide the fact from me,

720
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,500
but you also did the same!

721
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,370
Do you even treat me as your family member?

722
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
I wanted to tell you initially.

723
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,530
But...

724
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,500
you were too busy.

725
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,330
I had no chance

726
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,610
to tell you about it.

727
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,260
How so?

728
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,850
I...

729
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,290
I come back every day!

730
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,370
You didn't tell me anything!

731
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,330
I can understand
if Dad and Mom don't understand me.

732
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,420
But you?

733
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,700
I couldn't even sleep at ease.

734
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,500
I wanted to tell you the truth.

735
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
But Mom didn't allow me to.

736
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,460
You know how my mom is.

737
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,330
She always threatens us.

738
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,610
We had no choice too.

739
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,770
-You keep saying your mother.
-She...

740
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,090
-She was afraid that...
-Everything is about her!

741
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,500
What about you?

742
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,290
What about your opinions?

743
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,260
You're a grown-up for God's sake!

744
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,940
Can't you even decide for yourself?

745
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,130
Mom didn't want to tell me

746
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,290
because she was afraid you might cause trouble.

747
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
What trouble?

748
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,900
I have no choice.

749
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,770
You're not disabled!

750
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,810
What do you mean by you had no choice?

751
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,220
She...

752
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,900
Excuses!

753
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,770
All of these are just excuses!

754
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,660
Xiuyu!

755
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,940
Xiuyu?

756
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:11,740
Xiuyu!

757
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,180
Is Xiuyu back?

758
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,810
Where's Xiuyu?

759
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,090
Xiuyu isn't here.

760
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,810
Look for her then.

761
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,940
I went to the Group to look for her just now.

762
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,900
They said she left long ago.

763
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,020
Where did she go?

764
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,370
What's the matter?

765
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:29,980
What's wrong?

766
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,020
Mom,

767
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,570
I told

768
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,020
Xingfu

769
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,900
what happened to Xiuyu.

770
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:38,740
What?

771
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,740
Why would you do that!

772
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,900
Xingfu,

773
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,850
initially,

774
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,500
I was thinking...

775
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,290
-Xingfu!
-We have to keep a low profile.

776
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:46,900
Maintain a low profile.

777
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,460
Let's not

778
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,090
cause any trouble,

779
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,050
okay?

780
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,370
Xingfu.

781
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,460
Xingfu, let's keep a low profile.

782
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,370
We can't afford another mess.

783
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,700
Let's locate Xiuyu for now.

784
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,330
You!

785
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:55,940
What did I tell you?

786
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,850
What's wrong with you?

787
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,940
Xingfu!

788
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,700
Xingfu, listen to us!

789
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,810
You mustn't be reckless.

790
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,810
It's already done and dusted.

791
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,530
It's not that.

792
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,570
I'm going to look for Xiuyu.

793
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,610
-Oh, Xiuyu.
-Go head then.

794
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,770
Let me join you.

795
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,810
Don't.

796
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,570
Drive slowly.

797
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,050
Come here.

798
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:11,530
Good boy.

799
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,740
Xingfu.

800
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,500
Qingzhi,

801
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,130
Xiuyu ran away from home.

802
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,570
She didn't answer my calls.

803
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,020
I don't know where she went.

804
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,810
I think she has nowhere else to go.

805
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,090
She might go to you.

806
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,660
Tell me

807
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,050
if she contacted you.

808
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:37,770
Alright.

809
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,260
So,

810
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,610
Xingfu,

811
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,740
tell me if you find her.

812
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:40,810
Okay.

813
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,580
[Xingfu Inn]

814
00:27:57,255 --> 00:27:57,905
Xiuyu.

815
00:27:58,975 --> 00:27:59,665
Xiuyu?

816
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:03,015
Why are you sitting here?

817
00:28:04,255 --> 00:28:06,015
You didn't answer my calls the entire day.

818
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:12,665
I don't know where to go.

819
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:17,455
I heard about

820
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:18,535
what happened to you.

821
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,385
Don't be scared.

822
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:21,865
I'm here.

823
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,215
I will uphold justice for you.

824
00:28:34,775 --> 00:28:35,585
Don't cry.

825
00:28:37,735 --> 00:28:39,295
I know you're feeling hard done by.

826
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:07,345
Xingfu,

827
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:08,865
tell me

828
00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:11,015
about your opinion.

829
00:29:13,455 --> 00:29:14,255
I...

830
00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:14,935
It's fine.

831
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,215
Just tell me

832
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:17,105
how you feel.

833
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:19,825
I think

834
00:29:20,015 --> 00:29:21,455
the confidentiality agreement

835
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,385
looks decent,

836
00:29:23,735 --> 00:29:24,775
but something's off.

837
00:29:25,185 --> 00:29:27,185
They impersonated Xiuyu.

838
00:29:27,905 --> 00:29:28,905
Let's forget that it was an immoral deed.

839
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:30,185
He went against the law.

840
00:29:30,775 --> 00:29:33,535
Actions that go against the law
are not protected by the law.

841
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:36,295
How could someone draft up an agreement
for an illegal action?

842
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,065
This is just like

843
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,975
when a thief steals something,

844
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:42,455
and he's trying to stop people from exposing him.

845
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:43,495
If someone exposes him,

846
00:29:44,185 --> 00:29:45,735
the person has to pay the thief
for breaking the agreement instead.

847
00:29:46,425 --> 00:29:47,585
Doesn't that make no sense?

848
00:29:48,185 --> 00:29:49,215
Your crude words carry a fine idea.

849
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:50,295
Your hunch is correct.

850
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:52,865
I can tell at first glance

851
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:53,535
that they hired

852
00:29:53,535 --> 00:29:54,975
a professional to draft this agreement for them.

853
00:29:55,905 --> 00:29:56,775
I can tell

854
00:29:57,185 --> 00:29:58,425
that they've spent some effort on it

855
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:00,145
to avoid washing their dirty linen in public.

856
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:01,625
However, no matter what,

857
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:02,865
the fact is

858
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:04,385
that they had impersonated an individual.

859
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,625
So, in my opinion,

860
00:30:06,015 --> 00:30:07,385
the agreement itself is invalid.

861
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:08,385
It's just a ruse.

862
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:09,865
Yeah, right?

863
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:11,255
I knew something was off.

864
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:12,975
If we look at the smaller picture,

865
00:30:13,015 --> 00:30:14,865
they had infringed upon
an individual's legal name

866
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:15,975
and right to education.

867
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,015
If we look at the bigger picture,

868
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:18,255
they've disrupted

869
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:19,905
the social order

870
00:30:20,215 --> 00:30:21,455
and put the benefit of the nation

871
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:22,825
and society in harm's way.

872
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,695
They've broken the law.

873
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:26,625
If we analyze this case

874
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,735
from a logical perspective,

875
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:28,665
I think

876
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:31,825
there are two solutions to this.

877
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:35,825
Let's analyze the case.

878
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:38,425
First, before you become an impostor,

879
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:40,295
you need a fake ID.

880
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:42,385
Where did they get their hands on the fake ID?

881
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:43,825
And,

882
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:45,185
why didn't

883
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,145
the university detect this issue?

884
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,535
Doesn't that mean the university
should be held accountable too?

885
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:51,775
If we pursue this case,

886
00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:52,975
it will involve

887
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,385
many parties

888
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,495
and individuals as all of them had broken the law.

889
00:30:57,585 --> 00:30:58,535
If so, the case

890
00:30:59,015 --> 00:31:00,425
will become very complicated.

891
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,735
Qingzhi also said

892
00:31:02,535 --> 00:31:04,185
that this wasn't something
an individual could handle.

893
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:04,665
That's right.

894
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:05,495
However, that isn't the main point.

895
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:07,455
The main point is

896
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:09,255
that this is a crime.

897
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:10,425
So,

898
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:12,735
judging from the agreement,

899
00:31:13,695 --> 00:31:14,735
it states that you guys

900
00:31:14,735 --> 00:31:16,975
have to keep quiet about the crime
they had committed.

901
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:18,145
So, what does the book of law tell us?

902
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:20,295
A forced agreement or promise

903
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,865
that goes against

904
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:22,775
the law

905
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:24,585
will be rendered invalid.

906
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:25,295
So...

907
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:26,015
So,

908
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:27,215
the 900,000 yuan penalty

909
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:28,295
is complete nonsense.

910
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:29,495
It's not completely nonsensical.

911
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:30,295
Didn't I tell you already?

912
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:32,495
We have to analyze this
from a logical perspective.

913
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,345
That's right, the penalty

914
00:31:34,345 --> 00:31:35,385
is invalid indeed.

915
00:31:35,385 --> 00:31:36,105
However,

916
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:38,145
the content of the reconciliation

917
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:39,935
and the compensations

918
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,865
stated within the agreement

919
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:44,385
are protected by the law.

920
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:47,935
Let's talk about the second solution.

921
00:31:49,215 --> 00:31:49,865
300,000 yuan.

922
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:52,495
In my opinion, that amount is pretty high

923
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:53,825
for a compensation fee.

924
00:31:54,385 --> 00:31:55,665
If Xiuyu

925
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:56,865
insists on

926
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:57,775
pressing charges against them,

927
00:31:58,215 --> 00:31:58,975
even if I were her representative,

928
00:31:59,295 --> 00:32:00,585
I cannot ensure

929
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:03,585
that the court will give her
a higher compensation fee.

930
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,185
Now, the agreement has been signed.

931
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:09,735
The litigant

932
00:32:09,735 --> 00:32:10,665
is an adult.

933
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:13,105
No matter what,

934
00:32:13,695 --> 00:32:15,185
both parties were willing when they signed it.

935
00:32:16,255 --> 00:32:17,215
Their conflict

936
00:32:17,905 --> 00:32:19,065
is just like this scale over here.

937
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:22,695
Whether the scale

938
00:32:23,665 --> 00:32:25,295
will tip to which side

939
00:32:26,295 --> 00:32:27,425
depends on the litigant herself.

940
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:32,145
Xiuyu is our litigant here.

941
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:34,425
The key is her stand

942
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:35,935
and her decision.

943
00:32:36,425 --> 00:32:37,905
As her family members,

944
00:32:38,585 --> 00:32:40,385
the only thing we can do is to support her.

945
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:41,695
Am I right?

946
00:32:42,015 --> 00:32:42,425
That's right.

947
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:44,215
You can come to me anytime

948
00:32:45,025 --> 00:32:46,155
if you need help.

949
00:32:52,955 --> 00:32:53,675
Xiuyu,

950
00:32:54,195 --> 00:32:55,475
you've been lazing around the entire day.

951
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:56,985
Come and have your meal.

952
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,195
Look, I've made

953
00:32:58,505 --> 00:33:00,025
some tomato and egg noodles for you.

954
00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:01,345
It smells great.

955
00:33:01,825 --> 00:33:02,915
This is your first time

956
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:03,985
trying my cooking, right?

957
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:04,635
Listen,

958
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:06,585
Yani loves it when I make this dish for her.

959
00:33:06,635 --> 00:33:07,265
Try it

960
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,115
and give me your review.

961
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:16,875
Xiuyu,

962
00:33:18,435 --> 00:33:19,155
I know

963
00:33:19,745 --> 00:33:20,785
you've suffered a lot.

964
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:21,955
I had asked someone

965
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:23,675
to look into it for me as well.

966
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:25,875
However, it has already happened.

967
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,875
What has been done cannot be undone.

968
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:29,505
If so, we have to learn

969
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:29,985
how to accept reality.

970
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:30,715
Am I right?

971
00:33:30,715 --> 00:33:31,585
You're starving yourself right now.

972
00:33:31,915 --> 00:33:32,675
It'll be meaningless

973
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:33,065
for us

974
00:33:33,235 --> 00:33:35,345
to uphold justice for you
if something happens to you,

975
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:36,235
don't you think?

976
00:33:38,065 --> 00:33:38,475
Get up

977
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,235
and finish your noodles,

978
00:33:39,235 --> 00:33:39,675
okay?

979
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:44,715
Who's there?

980
00:33:44,785 --> 00:33:45,545
Qingzhi!

981
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:48,675
Xingfu, you're back.

982
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:49,475
Where's Xiuyu?

983
00:33:49,475 --> 00:33:49,985
She's inside the room.

984
00:33:53,435 --> 00:33:54,115
Xiuyu.

985
00:33:54,585 --> 00:33:55,235
Xingfu,

986
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:56,875
did you talk to Guan?

987
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:57,675
What did he say?

988
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:00,155
The penalty inside the agreement

989
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:01,065
is invalid.

990
00:34:01,065 --> 00:34:02,545
You have no obligation
to keep their secret for them.

991
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:04,955
As for the compensation fee,

992
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:06,475
it was meant to compensate you.

993
00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:07,435
You deserve it.

994
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:10,265
However, Xiuyu,

995
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,305
you need to be prepared.

996
00:34:13,235 --> 00:34:14,555
Mr. Guan said

997
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:15,555
this issue could not

998
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:16,825
be resolved immediately.

999
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:20,235
We need to think about

1000
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:21,555
what we should do next.

1001
00:34:25,035 --> 00:34:25,635
Why don't you

1002
00:34:26,345 --> 00:34:27,555
follow me home for now?

1003
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:30,945
I never want to return to that home.

1004
00:34:39,115 --> 00:34:39,675
Qingzhi,

1005
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:41,995
can you find a job for me?

1006
00:34:43,235 --> 00:34:44,305
I wish to stay in the city.

1007
00:34:45,035 --> 00:34:46,745
I don't wish to work for Wanjia Group anymore.

1008
00:34:47,715 --> 00:34:48,385
Xiuyu, you see,

1009
00:34:48,385 --> 00:34:49,595
it isn't that easy

1010
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:51,155
to get a job.

1011
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:52,235
What about this?

1012
00:34:52,345 --> 00:34:53,155
You can stay here for now.

1013
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:53,995
After that,

1014
00:34:54,235 --> 00:34:54,675
I'll try

1015
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,595
and see if I can find any jobs for you,

1016
00:34:55,675 --> 00:34:56,115
okay?

1017
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:56,865
Qingzhi,

1018
00:34:56,865 --> 00:34:57,865
you're so busy with your work.

1019
00:34:58,035 --> 00:34:59,465
I don't think you can take care of her.

1020
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:05,945
Why don't you

1021
00:35:06,515 --> 00:35:07,945
follow me back to the inn?

1022
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:09,465
You can help me out in the inn.

1023
00:35:09,785 --> 00:35:11,265
It's easier for us to discuss things too.

1024
00:35:12,465 --> 00:35:13,825
After Qingzhi finds a job

1025
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:15,155
for you in the city,

1026
00:35:15,345 --> 00:35:16,235
you can come back

1027
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:17,385
if you wish to come back.

1028
00:35:18,745 --> 00:35:19,465
If so, Xingfu,

1029
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:23,465
may I ask you to go to a place with me?

1030
00:35:24,514 --> 00:35:34,315
[To pursue the truth and be a learned one]

1031
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,715
You did great for your finals.

1032
00:36:05,235 --> 00:36:06,305
I guess I did fine.

1033
00:36:06,385 --> 00:36:07,425
Stop pretending.

1034
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:07,865
I'm serious.

1035
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:08,995
You must teach me

1036
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:10,035
how to solve that question.

1037
00:36:10,155 --> 00:36:11,995
The last question is so difficult for me.

1038
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:12,715
I solved it

1039
00:36:12,715 --> 00:36:13,425
just like that.

1040
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:14,745
You just need to do your revisions.

1041
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:38,945
Duoduo!

1042
00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:40,115
Duoduo!

1043
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:40,635
Hey!

1044
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:42,035
What took you so long?

1045
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:42,995
Goodness.

1046
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,075
The lecturer was taking up our time.

1047
00:36:44,075 --> 00:36:45,385
-I'm exhausted.
-We were waiting for you.

1048
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:04,555
This should've been my life.

1049
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:12,345
Let's go home for now.

1050
00:37:13,345 --> 00:37:15,115
We'll think of a way to get your life back.

1051
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:56,235
Xiuyu.

1052
00:37:56,715 --> 00:37:57,825
Xiuyu, I've let you down.

1053
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:00,385
You may not know, but Dad and Mom

1054
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:01,635
were terribly worried about you,

1055
00:38:01,715 --> 00:38:02,385
you know?

1056
00:38:03,675 --> 00:38:04,035
Let me do it.

1057
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:04,715
Let me do it.

1058
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:08,115
Xiuyu.

1059
00:38:08,715 --> 00:38:09,235
Xiuyu?

1060
00:38:09,515 --> 00:38:11,075
Xiuyu will stay in the inn for the next few days.

1061
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:11,945
She won't go home for the time being.

1062
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:13,305
If so,

1063
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:13,825
what about you?

1064
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:16,865
We'll settle our scores when I get back.

1065
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:18,595
Let me deliver this to Xiuyu.

1066
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:19,265
No need for that.

1067
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:26,905
Here.

1068
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:27,515
Xiuyu.

1069
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,305
This is our dorm.

1070
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:33,715
This is my bed.

1071
00:38:33,785 --> 00:38:34,745
This is Liuhua's bed.

1072
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:35,865
She doesn't stay here all the time.

1073
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:36,945
You can

1074
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:38,035
stay here without any worries.

1075
00:38:38,635 --> 00:38:39,945
You can head back to the factory if you like.

1076
00:38:40,345 --> 00:38:40,995
You can stay here and help me out

1077
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:42,425
if you don't feel like heading back.

1078
00:38:43,515 --> 00:38:45,305
Coincidentally, our business
has been booming lately.

1079
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,425
You can stay here and do my accounts for me.

1080
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:49,195
I'll pay you a monthly wage.

1081
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:51,465
I don't need a wage.

1082
00:38:51,905 --> 00:38:52,825
I have my savings.

1083
00:38:53,235 --> 00:38:53,865
That won't do.

1084
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:54,905
These are two different matters.

1085
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:03,235
It's meaningless to live.

1086
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:06,265
Xiuyu,

1087
00:39:06,515 --> 00:39:07,555
you mustn't have that kind of mindset.

1088
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:09,075
You have to pull yourself together.

1089
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:10,715
You still have a long future ahead of you.

1090
00:39:12,515 --> 00:39:13,595
Just take our family as an example.

1091
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:15,945
We had it rough in the past, didn't we?

1092
00:39:16,305 --> 00:39:17,785
But we managed to
pull through somehow, am I right?

1093
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:20,235
Just take me as an example.

1094
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:21,905
When I first established this inn,

1095
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:23,345
I

1096
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:23,995
fretted about it

1097
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:24,825
every day.

1098
00:39:24,825 --> 00:39:26,155
I couldn't sleep well every day.

1099
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:27,745
I could only hope for more patrons
during the weekends.

1100
00:39:28,345 --> 00:39:29,305
But now,

1101
00:39:30,155 --> 00:39:31,945
our inn is fully booked for the next three months.

1102
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:33,425
Days are getting better and better,

1103
00:39:33,425 --> 00:39:34,305
don't you think?

1104
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:37,905
It's the same for you.

1105
00:39:38,825 --> 00:39:40,155
You can't just focus on what's in front of you.

1106
00:39:40,515 --> 00:39:41,825
You still have plenty of things to explore
in your world.

1107
00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:47,635
What world do I have?

1108
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:50,345
Someone stole my world away from me long ago.

1109
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:52,995
Xiuyu,

1110
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:53,905
don't worry.

1111
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:55,425
This isn't over yet.

1112
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:58,345
I will surely demand an explanation from them.

1113
00:40:17,155 --> 00:40:17,945
Coming.

1114
00:40:21,465 --> 00:40:22,075
Xingfu?

1115
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:23,345
I'm here for Mr. Wan.

1116
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:25,515
My dad went to the city.

1117
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:26,265
Do you need anything from him?

1118
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:28,675
Fine.

1119
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:30,345
I'll pass the message to you since he isn't here.

1120
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:35,865
Look.

1121
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:38,945
This is just a copy.

1122
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:41,195
I'll tear the original agreement

1123
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:42,425
if I get my hands on it.

1124
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:44,865
Yes.

1125
00:40:45,155 --> 00:40:46,555
This was our fault.

1126
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:48,555
We've apologized

1127
00:40:48,555 --> 00:40:49,515
and compensated you guys as well.

1128
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:50,465
Wan Chuanjia,

1129
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:51,785
not everything can be resolved

1130
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:53,745
by compensating people with money
and apologizing to them.

1131
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:55,745
Can you accept it if I apologize to you

1132
00:40:55,825 --> 00:40:56,465
after killing you?

1133
00:40:57,235 --> 00:40:58,155
Tell me then.

1134
00:40:58,345 --> 00:40:59,465
What else do you want from us?

1135
00:40:59,745 --> 00:41:01,075
I'm here today to tell you

1136
00:41:01,155 --> 00:41:03,075
that I've heard about the despicable things
you have done.

1137
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:05,155
Don't think that Xiuyu is a pushover

1138
00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:06,195
and that the Wang family is gullible.

1139
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:08,035
I'm not as gullible as them.

1140
00:41:09,035 --> 00:41:10,715
The heck of the confidentiality agreement.

1141
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:12,195
A 900,000-yuan penalty?

1142
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:13,305
Who are you trying to scare here?

1143
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:15,425
Why did you think
I drafted this agreement in the first place?

1144
00:41:16,385 --> 00:41:17,555
It's all because of you.

1145
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:18,465
Think about it.

1146
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:19,425
How much trouble

1147
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:20,195
have you caused for Wan Village

1148
00:41:20,195 --> 00:41:22,075
ever since you married into the Wang family?

1149
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:23,345
The deal is already done.

1150
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:24,155
We've already compensated your family.

1151
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:25,385
Can't you just let bygones be bygones?

1152
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:26,345
Why must you interfere?

1153
00:41:26,345 --> 00:41:27,115
Why must you come here?

1154
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:28,305
Why did you compensate us?

1155
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:30,155
It's all because you've committed
a despicable deed.

1156
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:31,825
How could you walk tall like this

1157
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:32,715
when you're the one in the wrong here?

1158
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,785
Are you even a human?

1159
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:35,595
You guys had ruined

1160
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:36,865
a young girl's future just like that.

1161
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:38,595
Do you think you can resolve this
by giving us money?

1162
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:39,675
What should I do, then?

1163
00:41:40,075 --> 00:41:40,785
I've already apologized to her!

1164
00:41:40,825 --> 00:41:41,555
I've already compensated her!

1165
00:41:41,555 --> 00:41:42,595
I've already made job arrangements for her!

1166
00:41:42,595 --> 00:41:43,865
Your in-laws have already
taken advantage of the situation,

1167
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:44,265
am I right?

1168
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:45,675
Do you think you're untainted?

1169
00:41:46,265 --> 00:41:47,945
Why do you think everything is going smoothly

1170
00:41:47,945 --> 00:41:49,265
for your inn?

1171
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:50,595
Why did you think I approved

1172
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:52,265
the road-fixing proposal in a jiffy?

1173
00:41:52,715 --> 00:41:54,555
You were taking advantage
of Xiuyu's situation too!

1174
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:56,305
I told you to get your own construction team

1175
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:56,995
to fix the road.

1176
00:41:57,235 --> 00:41:58,675
I made things easier for you.

1177
00:41:58,995 --> 00:42:00,035
If you stop biting onto me like a rabid dog,

1178
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:00,995
I won't dig up your accounts.

1179
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:02,035
Go and dig it up then.

1180
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:02,995
Did you think I would be scared?

1181
00:42:03,115 --> 00:42:03,945
The inn

1182
00:42:03,945 --> 00:42:04,515
and the road,

1183
00:42:04,515 --> 00:42:04,995
all the receipts,

1184
00:42:04,995 --> 00:42:05,425
checks,

1185
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:06,075
I have each of them

1186
00:42:06,075 --> 00:42:06,825
ready

1187
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:07,555
for you to investigate.

1188
00:42:07,555 --> 00:42:08,555
I'll bear the blame

1189
00:42:08,555 --> 00:42:09,195
if there's something wrong with them.

1190
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:10,715
If not, I'll sue you for defaming me!

1191
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:12,305
You're truly something else!

1192
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:13,425
I'm utterly speechless!

1193
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:15,235
You truly have a one-track mind,

1194
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:15,785
don't you?

1195
00:42:15,905 --> 00:42:16,995
No wonder even He Xingyun

1196
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:18,195
wanted me to keep this from you forever.

1197
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:21,115
What did Xingyun say?

1198
00:42:26,635 --> 00:42:27,345
Think about

1199
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:28,515
two things when you head back.

1200
00:42:28,515 --> 00:42:29,155
First,

1201
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:30,635
this is a serious issue.

1202
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:32,465
However, why did the entire Wang family

1203
00:42:32,465 --> 00:42:33,115
hide the issue

1204
00:42:33,115 --> 00:42:33,995
from you?

1205
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:34,995
Second,

1206
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,675
do you think I could come up

1207
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:37,745
with such an agreement

1208
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:38,715
when I'm not quite cultured?

1209
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:41,155
Who do you think is the legal counsel

1210
00:42:41,155 --> 00:42:42,115
of our group?

1211
00:42:44,305 --> 00:42:45,425
Just stop this right now.

1212
00:42:45,465 --> 00:42:46,945
Stop trying to complicate things!

1213
00:42:57,635 --> 00:42:58,235
Xingfu,

1214
00:42:59,425 --> 00:43:01,035
Xiuyu has already accepted the deal

1215
00:43:01,035 --> 00:43:02,155
as the litigant.

1216
00:43:02,155 --> 00:43:02,595
Am I right?

1217
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:04,265
We've taken what we needed from each other.

1218
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,035
Can't you please stop complicating things?

1219
00:43:10,345 --> 00:43:11,425
Listen up, Wan Chuanjia,

1220
00:43:11,785 --> 00:43:13,715
I'll show you no mercy

1221
00:43:13,715 --> 00:43:14,715
if you force Xiuyu to do your bidding again.
