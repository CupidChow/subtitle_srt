[The Story of Xing Fu]

00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 37]

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,560
Mom.

4
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,079
I'm back.

5
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,719
Dou.

6
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,560
Mom.

7
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:16,359
Mom.

8
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,360
Xingfu.

9
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,879
Your son had an upset stomach,

10
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,039
so I

11
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,639
brought him to the Health Center.

12
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,719
The doctor said he's fine.
He just needs to be hydrated.

13
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,759
He prescribed us some medicine.
The ordeal took a while

14
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,400
and I just put him to sleep.

15
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,280
How did he get an upset tummy?

16
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,680
It's my fault.

17
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
I wanted

18
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,840
to reheat the leftover prawns

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,199
from last night.

20
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,280
He ate some before I could reheat them.

21
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
You sure

22
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,639
it was because he had the leftover prawns?

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,199
There were fewer prawns on the plate
last time I saw,

24
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,319
so I assumed he ate some.

25
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,680
No more high fever.

26
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,199
The doctor said it was just diarrhea.

27
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,680
When it stops, it means he's cured.

28
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,560
Mom, does Little Dou always have a cold,

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,439
a fever, or an upset tummy.

30
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,319
Well,

31
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,840
children are meant

32
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,560
to be sick once in a while

33
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,879
when they grow up.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,960
Dou is playful. When he's awake,

35
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,319
he runs all over the house.

36
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,159
Within seconds,

37
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,879
he'll get a bruise or a scratch somewhere.

38
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:30,960
Youde and I

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,400
do our best to keep an eye on him,

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
but he can still get out of our view.

41
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,280
Being hyperactive is one of the syndromes too.

42
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,719
He's not hyperactive.

43
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,439
Where is his medical record?

44
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,319
In the drawer.

45
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,680
All other documents are there.

46
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,000
He was so obedient when he was smaller.

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,360
But now, he is not like Qinglai.

48
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,439
The fever is gone.

49
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,360
He's all right.

50
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,919
Little Dou.

51
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,719
Little Dou.

52
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:17,639
Come on, wake up.

53
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,639
Why, Mom? I want to sleep.

54
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,280
Wake up.

55
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:24,680
I'm bringing you to the county hospital.

56
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,719
What?

57
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,040
The doctor...

58
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,800
Dr. Liu said

59
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,839
he is fine.

60
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,600
He took his medicine.
He just needs to drink more water.

61
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,639
He'll be fine in two days.

62
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,199
If no one takes it seriously

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,439
and everyone thinks it's just a normal fever,

64
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,519
we'll miss the optimal time to start treatment.

65
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,160
Tell Qinglai

66
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,680
that I won't be back for dinner.

67
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,360
Haohao, behave.

68
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,560
It's our turn soon.

69
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,959
Haohao, you're tearing my clothes.

70
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,680
Look.

71
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,879
Ms. Guo.

72
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,519
Ms. He.

73
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:22,879
Haohao.

74
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,160
You're here to consult a doctor too?

75
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,279
My clothes...

76
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,439
Yes.

77
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,800
What happened to your son?

78
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,639
He has an upset tummy.
I'm bringing him to see a doctor.

79
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,079
Stop it.

80
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,959
How old is your son?

81
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,120
Six years old.

82
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,480
Here, for you.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,759
Good boy.

84
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,720
Come on, have a seat.

85
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,399
Your son

86
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,399
is so sensible.

87
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,839
My son

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,199
is a naughty kid.

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,519
He has a bad temper

90
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,519
and always falls sick.

91
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,839
What kind of sickness?

92
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,240
Headache, upset tummy, and tantrum.

93
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,800
I can't catch a break.

94
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,639
The doctor said

95
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,720
my son

96
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,639
is hyperactive.

97
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,680
Did you get a blood test for him?

98
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,519
Just to check if his blood lead level is too high.

99
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,639
Blood test?

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,839
What is too high?

101
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,279
Lead poisoning.

102
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,519
The sickness Yancheng's son has.

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,480
No way.

104
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,240
I heard from experts

105
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,360
that lead poisoning

106
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,279
can lead to hyperactivity,

107
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,399
tantrum,

108
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,120
fidget,

109
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,399
and aggression.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Ms. He,

111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,240
you just

112
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,959
described my child.

113
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,560
Are you saying

114
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,879
that he is poisoned?

115
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,360
No, no.

116
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,879
I bring my kid here

117
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,000
to check if his blood lead level is too high.

118
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,079
Since you're here,

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,600
why not ask the doctor

120
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,199
to run a blood test on your son

121
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,360
to check

122
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,600
his blood lead level?

123
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,199
It will put your mind to rest.

124
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,319
No. 11, Guo Yaping. Room 2.

125
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,600
Yes.

126
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,319
Ms. He.

127
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,079
Come with me.

128
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,199
I want to do the test.

129
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,279
Can you talk to the doctor?

130
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,959
I might not be able to explain it clearly.

131
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,639
Okay.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,759
Let's go.

133
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,240
Haohao, let's go.

134
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,839
All right. Give me the toy.

135
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,360
Ms. He,

136
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,319
I didn't know you have a son this young.

137
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,519
You're so capable.

138
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,800
You raise your child properly

139
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,680
and have a stellar career.

140
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,480
Mine is a naughty kid.

141
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,839
He takes up most of my time.

142
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,480
My in-laws

143
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,759
help me to raise him.

144
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,920
You're so lucky.

145
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,240
Unlike me.

146
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,720
God knows what I did in my previous life.

147
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,079
And I'm serving

148
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,240
my sentence now.

149
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,560
I'm from Shandong.

150
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,240
I came to work here

151
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,360
with a village friend.

152
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,199
And then, I married someone from the village.

153
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,120
When he was two years old,

154
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,399
my in-laws brought my husband

155
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,199
to a relative's wedding party.

156
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,839
They didn't want my son to cry or make a scene,

157
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
so they told me to stay home

158
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
to look after him.

159
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,000
And then,

160
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,399
their car swerved into the drain.

161
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,720
All of them

162
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,600
left in an instant.

163
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,919
And now,

164
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,919
I'm a single mom.

165
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,120
But he's naughty.

166
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,480
He's either sick

167
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
or is throwing tantrum.

168
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,759
But I

169
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,240
only have him left.

170
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,759
If something bad happens to him,

171
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,480
I don't want to live anymore.

172
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,559
Ms. Guo.

173
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,679
Don't say that.

174
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,720
If you have any problem, just come to me.

175
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,399
All problems can be solved.

176
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,720
It'll get better.

177
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,200
My father used to tell me this,

178
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,679
"When the going gets tough, the tough get going."

179
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,840
When the hardship becomes too much for me

180
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,720
and I feel like giving up,

181
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,399
I will tell myself

182
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,240
that I'm still young,

183
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,440
I can still endure the hardship.

184
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,960
And when I have weathered through
all the hardships,

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,919
a blissful life awaits.

186
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,639
Thanks, Ms. He.

187
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,440
Talking to you

188
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,440
makes me feel better.

189
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,679
Do not keep everything to yourself.

190
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,519
Just talk to me.

191
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,440
Okay.

192
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,480
I'm old

193
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,879
and useless now.

194
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,679
People might not think that way,
but I know it's true.

195
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
It's exhausting enough to raise your kid.

196
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,639
Do you think it's easy

197
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,639
to worry about him all the time?

198
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,720
I tread lightly every day

199
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,799
in case people resent me
for the mistakes I might make.

200
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,519
But still, I cannot escape from the scrutiny.

201
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,120
Raise your kid from now on.

202
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,840
I don't care anymore.

203
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,000
It's your fault if you raise him wrongly.

204
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,080
At least, I won't be resented.

205
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,919
Enough already.

206
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,559
We're back.

207
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,480
Look how lucky we are.

208
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,559
We made it in time for dinner.

209
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:37,720
Grandma.

210
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:39,919
Grandma.

211
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,279
Little Dou, go wash your hands.

212
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,440
What happened, Mom?

213
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,200
I'm full.

214
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,080
What happened?

215
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,799
You pissed her off?

216
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,519
Why would I?

217
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,679
Then?

218
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,200
Don't look at me.

219
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,200
I said nothing.

220
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,039
Little Dou.

221
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,360
What is taking you so long?

222
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,440
Don't look at others.

223
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,480
Look at yourself.

224
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,320
You did it.

225
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,519
Why confront others?

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What did I do?

227
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,240
I pissed her off?

228
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,519
You know,

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,600
it's normal for a kid to have an upset stomach

230
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,799
from time to time.

231
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,279
Why did you have to make a big deal out of it?

232
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,960
My mom already brought him to the Health Center

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,879
for a checkup.

234
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,840
But you still had to

235
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,600
bring him to the county hospital.

236
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,960
It's like you don't trust my mom at all.

237
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,960
Hasn't my mom been raising our child
all these years?

238
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,879
Without my parents,

239
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,960
we wouldn't have the time for our commitments.

240
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:02,879
I...

241
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,039
Mom.

242
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,960
Mom.

243
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,120
Are you mad?

244
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,159
Don't be.

245
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,679
I didn't mean it.

246
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,960
I didn't think it through.

247
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,639
I wasn't blaming you.

248
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,399
I know how tough it is for you two

249
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
to raise my kid.

250
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,440
He had an upset tummy back then,

251
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,919
but you didn't make a big deal out of it.

252
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
I know you're rich now,

253
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,879
so you look down on us.

254
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,480
Not at all, Mom.

255
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,159
I...

256
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,919
I...

257
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,559
I'm just worried
that he might have lead poisoning.

258
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,879
Poisoning?

259
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,279
I'm his grandma.

260
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,559
Why would I poison him?

261
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,120
What's the matter?

262
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,039
Who's poisoned?

263
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,279
Mom.

264
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,480
You can't fault Xingfu on that.

265
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,519
She told me

266
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,759
not to tell you before we found out the truth.

267
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,159
In case you worry needlessly.

268
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,919
What is going on?

269
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,559
Tell us.

270
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,639
You're making us more worried.

271
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,639
The kid from that family in Shuiwei Village

272
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,879
has lead poisoning.

273
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,639
They thought it was from the wastewater

274
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,039
by the health products factory.

275
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,639
But their wastewater was tested.

276
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,120
It was fine.

277
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
If it's not from the water,

278
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,639
it must be from another source.

279
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Lead poisoning has many syndromes,

280
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,759
such as diarrhea.

281
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,919
You said he was hyperactive,

282
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,279
so I thought he might have lead poisoning.

283
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,440
I then took him

284
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,879
to the county hospital

285
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,440
for a blood test.

286
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,840
The Health Center in our village

287
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,320
cannot run this test.

288
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,600
What did the test say?

289
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,440
The result is not out yet.

290
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,399
Grandma.

291
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,159
Dou, are you poisoned?

292
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,039
Mom, calm down.

293
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,600
It's curable.

294
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,159
But we need

295
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,519
to locate the source.

296
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,519
Otherwise, he'll be poisoned again.

297
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,799
There, there.

298
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,360
Oh, my dear grandson.

299
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,320
Are you all right?

300
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,919
Are you okay?

301
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,240
Little Dou.

302
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,879
Dad.

303
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,039
Little Dou.

304
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,159
Come on.

305
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:26,799
Take the medicine.

306
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,960
What's the matter?

307
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,320
You talked to Mr. Wan?

308
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,600
Yes.

309
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,200
What did he say?

310
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,279
Mr. Wan is quite supportive of the idea,

311
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,519
but Chuanjia needs me to do him a favor

312
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,080
before he negotiates with me.

313
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,120
What kind of favor?

314
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,879
They want Xiuyu

315
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,159
to be their brand ambassador.

316
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,919
That's wonderful.

317
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,240
I know.

318
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,919
But Xiuyu doesn't want to.

319
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,039
I brought it up to Xiuyu

320
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,080
and she kicked me out of the house.

321
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,279
Why?

322
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,559
Why else?

323
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,399
She doesn't want to have anything to do
with Chuanjia.

324
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,360
I'll talk to her later.

325
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,480
No.

326
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,919
Can you talk to her now?

327
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,200
I can't wait for long.

328
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
All right.

329
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,639
I'll talk to her now.

330
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:42,440
Go.

331
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,679
Persuade her.

332
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,360
Chu Yun.

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,639
I got the clothes you picked for me.

334
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,759
I quite like the brand you picked.

335
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,159
And their design looks good too.

336
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,200
I love it. Thank you.

337
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,320
Xiuyu, are you awake?

338
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:11,919
Yes, I am.

339
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,000
Come in, Xingfu.

340
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,120
Xiuyu, what are you up to?

341
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,159
Chu Yun picked several clothes for me

342
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,799
for the photoshoot.

343
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,360
Xiuyu,

344
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,639
I heard from Qinglai

345
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,700
that the health products factory wants you
to be their brand ambassador.

346
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,140
Why did you turn it down?

347
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,620
I don't want to have anything to do with them.

348
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,050
I understand.

349
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,620
But I believe

350
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,140
being a brand ambassador is awesome.

351
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,290
It's a pity

352
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,930
that you turned it down.

353
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,620
How so?

354
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,860
Their health products are sold

355
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,530
to more than 20 provinces

356
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,500
and hundreds of counties.

357
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
That means

358
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,170
we can use their health products

359
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,020
to promote the scenery of Wan Village

360
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,340
to a wider audience.

361
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,650
That way,

362
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,380
the tourism here will be more developed.

363
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,890
You know, everything is interconnected.

364
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,930
I talked to the company.

365
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,740
Every year, they spend so much money on marketing.

366
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,660
But they shouldn't just promote their products.

367
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,020
They should also promote our village.

368
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,460
Add the humanitarian factor to it.

369
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,370
If the consumers like our culture,

370
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,260
they'll like our products.

371
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,420
Not only will you be their brand ambassador,

372
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,180
but you'll also be the face
of the tourism cooperative

373
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,500
and Wan Village.

374
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,770
It's good for you.

375
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,980
It's good for others.

376
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,420
What does it have anything to do with me?

377
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,570
It's a chain reaction.

378
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,610
If the company does well,

379
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,090
Wan Village will do well.

380
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,700
If Wan Village does well,

381
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,610
our family will do well.

382
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,770
If our family does well,

383
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,370
we will do well.

384
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,330
It's like the saying,

385
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,850
"All for Wan,

386
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,260
Wan for all."

387
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,130
Xingfu,

388
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,220
you sound like

389
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,900
Mr. Wan now.

390
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,220
Especially his manner of speech.

391
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,180
Don't mock me.

392
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,330
I am not as educated as you.

393
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,130
You're smarter than me.

394
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,130
If you're the brand ambassador,

395
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,090
you can make much more out of it.

396
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,530
Xingfu,

397
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,020
while you're not as educated,

398
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,420
you might be smarter

399
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,660
than those who are.

400
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,260
That's why I said

401
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,900
that you should stop latching onto the past.

402
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,500
You don't just learn things at school.

403
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,570
You learn through the school of hard knocks too.

404
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,500
Give me the medical visit card.

405
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,460
Right, here.

406
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,500
Hi.

407
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,290
I'm here to retrieve the test report.

408
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,500
All right. Let me have a look.

409
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,810
Wait for a moment.

410
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,530
This is for you.

411
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,220
Thank you.

412
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,810
You're welcome.

413
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,770
This is yours.

414
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,220
This is the medical visit card.

415
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:05,810
Okay.

416
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,090
Thank goodness. Everything is normal.

417
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,850
Ms. He.

418
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,260
Can you check it for me? I don't understand.

419
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,180
What is the problem?

420
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,020
Blood lead level.

421
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,090
230mg.

422
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,980
What does it mean?

423
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,500
So is my child poisoned

424
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,660
or not?

425
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,020
Your son's blood lead level is too high.

426
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,900
What should I do?

427
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,090
Don't worry.

428
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,940
I heard from the experts in the city

429
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,660
that we can take a lead detox treatment.

430
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,980
Let's consult the doctor.

431
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,940
Are you sure?

432
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,660
Yes.

433
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,420
Okay.

434
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,050
Ms. He, thank you so much.

435
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,770
If you didn't ask me to get my son a blood test,

436
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,420
I wouldn't know what was happening.

437
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,220
But why was he poisoned out of a sudden?

438
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,090
Where did it come from?

439
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,700
I'm working on this too.

440
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,260
We can't just give them detox treatment,

441
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,500
while they continue to be poisoned.

442
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,220
Several children in our village fell ill

443
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,500
and everyone suspected

444
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,740
that your health products factory

445
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,850
polluted the water.

446
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,460
But their wastewater conforms

447
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,900
to the national safety standard.

448
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,610
Experts have said

449
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,570
that the lead level in the water

450
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,940
is not enough to harm humans.

451
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,570
There are many sources of lead.

452
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,530
Maybe it's from another source.

453
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,980
We need to locate it.

454
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,940
What should we do?

455
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,330
Treating your child is more important.

456
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,090
What?

457
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,260
Another one?

458
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,810
Yes, his blood lead level is 230mg.

459
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,330
He's now undergoing treatment
in the county hospital.

460
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,940
It's not as serious as Qiang.

461
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,660
When I was treating Qiang,

462
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,700
I asked him how it had happened.

463
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,020
I suspect it's the water.

464
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:04,900
Besides,

465
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,740
his mother said

466
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,460
that that day, she left in a hurry.

467
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
The night before,

468
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,500
she forgot

469
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,900
to fill the kettle with water.

470
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,810
When she boiled the kettle

471
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,660
in the morning,

472
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,850
the water almost dried out.

473
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,900
There was only some water left.

474
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,180
Qiang drank it.

475
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,500
If

476
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,370
the water contains lead,

477
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,660
after some water evaporates

478
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,050
due to boiling,

479
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,330
the lead concentration

480
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,370
in the residual water will be very high.

481
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,700
It can provoke

482
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,740
acute lead poisoning among children.

483
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,330
But their potable water was tested.

484
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,610
It conforms to the safety standard.

485
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,610
The government tests it every quarter.

486
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,130
They also brought people

487
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,370
from the Environment Monitoring Station

488
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,020
to test the water.

489
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,660
Nothing unusual was found.

490
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,090
I see.

491
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,900
There might be another source of poison then.

492
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:50,810
In my opinion,

493
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,420
the priority now

494
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,020
is to check all the children in their village

495
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,220
and from the villages nearby

496
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,130
to see how many of them
have an abnormal blood lead level.

497
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,740
If it's a large-scale poisoning event,

498
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,050
we need to find out

499
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,700
what they share in common.

500
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,220
That way, we can locate the source of lead.

501
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:09,700
Also,

502
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,180
lead poisoning

503
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,530
is very damaging to a child's health.

504
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,220
Carry out the test and find out the truth

505
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,090
as soon as possible.

506
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,330
Otherwise, if this continues,

507
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,810
their immunity and nervous system

508
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,220
might compromise.

509
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,260
I see, Dr. Fang.

510
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,180
Thank you.

511
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,570
You want

512
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,740
to check on the children of those families
who always fall ill?

513
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,980
Mr. Fang worries that it might be
a large-scale poisoning event.

514
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,980
If that's the case,

515
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,130
it'll be very serious.

516
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,420
We need to retrace the source of poison.

517
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,610
We can't wait any longer.

518
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:49,700
Let's go.

519
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:50,900
I'll come with you.

520
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:54,810
Let's go.

521
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,940
Wallflower.

522
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,090
Why are you back?

523
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,180
You must be here to check on Yancheng's house.

524
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,740
Tell your mom not to worry.

525
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,810
I'm here.

526
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,180
This is...

527
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,050
He's Yancheng's cousin.

528
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,290
He's Hu.

529
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,980
He doesn't like to speak,

530
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,530
so we call him Wallflower.

531
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,220
His mom

532
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,770
married into Wan Village.

533
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,770
He's doing great now.

534
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,810
He's a security guard in Wanjia Group.

535
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,850
Yancheng is your cousin?

536
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,220
How is he doing in the city?

537
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,460
He's in a nursing program now.

538
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,530
He can work in a hospital in the future.

539
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,570
A nurse?

540
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,700
That's good.

541
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,660
Wallflower, please send my regards to your mom.

542
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,020
We still have something to do. Bye.

543
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,420
Let's go.

544
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,460
Ms. He.

545
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:53,460
He's here.

546
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,180
Mr. Li!

547
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,050
[Shuiwei Village Committee]

548
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,020
You're back.

549
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,740
Xingfu, why are you here?

550
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:58,700
Here is the thing.

551
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,570
Ms. Guo's son

552
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,180
has an abnormal blood lead level

553
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,370
like Yancheng's son does.

554
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,330
I talked to an expert from the city.

555
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,500
He told us

556
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,810
to test

557
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,940
all of the children here

558
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,610
because this might

559
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,220
be a large-scale poisoning event.

560
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,570
A large-scale poisoning event?

561
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,980
This is no joke.

562
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,370
And I'm not joking.

563
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,660
Lead poisoning is a serious matter.

564
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,810
You can't take it lightly.

565
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,130
Right.

566
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,530
Of course.

567
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,090
But I'm powerless

568
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,850
alone.

569
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:31,980
Look.

570
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,570
A test on every child?

571
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,850
How much will this cost?

572
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,660
You see,

573
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,460
after the merge,

574
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,090
everything financial

575
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,180
went under Wan Village's management.

576
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,660
I do not have the final say.

577
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:45,940
You know what,

578
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,700
Ms. He?

579
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,220
Go talk to Mr. Wan.

580
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,050
The capable Mr. Wan will have a solution.

581
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:53,810
Okay.

582
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,460
I'll talk to Mr. Wan.

583
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,020
This is serious. Goodness.

584
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,900
Will it work?

585
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,700
Yes, I'll talk to Mr. Wan.

586
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,610
You mean,

587
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,130
other than the kid of the family

588
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,700
who lost the legal battle was poisoned,

589
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,330
there's

590
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,810
another one who has a similar problem?

591
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:13,940
Yes.

592
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,330
So you want

593
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,610
all children from Shuiwei Village

594
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,220
to be tested?

595
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,370
Yes.

596
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,980
Is Little Dou all right?

597
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,500
He's fine.

598
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,220
Xingfu, you see.

599
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,420
I have asked around

600
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,330
for this matter.

601
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,700
Lead poisoning

602
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,850
has a lot of causes.

603
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,570
Not necessarily pollution.

604
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,330
I already won the legal battle.

605
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,980
Why can't you put it to rest?

606
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,220
This is not right.

607
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,290
Mr. Wan, you're mistaken.

608
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,850
This has nothing to do with the case.

609
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,180
Testing the children is to find out

610
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,180
whether it's an isolated case
or a collective case.

611
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,130
If it's large-scale poisoning,

612
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,610
we need to locate the source of the poison.

613
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,940
Xingfu,

614
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,290
can we put this thing on hold?

615
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,420
Money is not an issue.

616
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,570
Time is.

617
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,370
The end of the year is in two months.

618
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,050
My company needs to complete the final sprint.

619
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,130
Next month, the winner of the Entrepreneurship

620
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,130
in Rural Communities Competition
will be nominated next month.

621
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,610
The judging panel will visit.

622
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,850
I have to deal with all sorts of evaluations.

623
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,940
Every department of my company
has to submit the annual report.

624
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:26,900
Right?

625
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,330
Of course, they all require money.

626
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,660
So...

627
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,090
Can we

628
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,980
put this on hold?

629
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,660
We need to order our tasks
by their relative importance and urgency.

630
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,050
What do you think?

631
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,180
I see.

632
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,850
I'll find another solution.

633
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,810
Why draw his blood
for a blood test out of a sudden?

634
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,740
It's to see whether his blood lead level

635
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,370
is too high.

636
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,460
Yancheng's son and Ms. Guo's son

637
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,770
have an abnormal blood lead level.

638
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,660
Lead poisoning is detrimental to kids,

639
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,370
so it's best if you get your child checked too.

640
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,660
All right. Noted.

641
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,420
Look how naughty he is.

642
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,660
My grandson can't possibly

643
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,770
be poisoned too.

644
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,660
Madam, you'll only know after the test.

645
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:20,980
But

646
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,330
why should I spend money on unnecessary things?

647
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,330
How can it be unnecessary?

648
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,980
It's for peace of mind.

649
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,660
I wish him well, of course.

650
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,050
But if there's something wrong,
get it treated now.

651
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,810
Okay.

652
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,370
I know.

653
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:41,660
Xiuyu.

654
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,220
Are you awake?

655
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,050
Yes.

656
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,370
I need a favor from you.

657
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:48,770
Yes?

658
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,810
Can you design a flyer for me?

659
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,050
Just to list out

660
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,460
the basic information about lead poisoning.

661
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,370
I want to encourage the parents

662
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,740
to get their kids tested.

663
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,940
All right, I'll do it now.

664
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,530
Not now. It's late.

665
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,330
Do it tomorrow.

666
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,290
I can't.

667
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,940
I have

668
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,260
an ad photo shoot tomorrow.

669
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,180
Mr. Wan told us

670
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,220
to finish it as soon as possible.

671
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,570
He wants to roll out some marketing campaigns

672
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,740
before the judging panel arrives.

673
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,420
I'll help you then.

674
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,090
Let's think about the typesetting.

675
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,530
Simple and clear content will do.

676
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,660
They need to be able to understand it.

677
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,260
Okay.

678
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,810
I'll make snow fungus soup.

679
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,180
Don't work with an empty tummy.

680
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,500
Okay.

681
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,850
Do you think it's legible?

682
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,260
I think so.

683
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,700
It's the simplest template.

684
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,260
Mr. Liu.

685
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,290
We cannot postpone the children's blood test

686
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,220
any longer.

687
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,660
I made these fliers.

688
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,050
Can you bring them with you to school

689
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,500
and distribute them to the kids?

690
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,850
Can you tally

00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,260
should call the Ministry of Ecology
and the Center for Disease Control now.

1038
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,550
Okay.

1039
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,950
I'll report to the Village Committee too.

1040
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:06,910
Also,

1041
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,030
Ms. He,

1042
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,390
I will inform my superior

1043
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,140
about this situation too.

1044
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,910
We'll try to slot in a visit to your village

1045
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,580
in our itinerary tomorrow.

1046
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,830
I'll do it myself.

1047
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,030
All right. Thank you.

1048
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:18,780
Tomorrow,

1049
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,620
I hope you can be present

1050
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,430
to coordinate with us.

1051
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,510
We have a busy schedule,

1052
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,510
so we can only spend an hour there.

1053
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,390
If there's any delay,

1054
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,780
the itinerary will have to be pushed back.

1055
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,470
Okay. What time tomorrow?

1056
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,390
I'm not sure yet.

1057
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,550
Tomorrow, we have to head to six places

1058
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,300
to collect samples. Right?

1059
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:36,660
Yes.

1060
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,830
You know what, Ms. He?

1061
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,470
I'll come whenever I'm available.

1062
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,550
Before I come, I'll give you a call.

1063
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,660
Remember,

1064
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,300
do not arrange anything else for tomorrow.

1065
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,220
Okay.

1066
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,390
I'll wait for your call.

1067
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,100
Okay.

1068
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,300
(Mr. Liu.)

1069
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,620
(It's just my suspicion.)

1070
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,030
But I believe we should tell everyone

1071
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,740
to stop drinking well water

1072
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,660
before the test result comes out.

1073
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,100
Don't use the well water for cooking too.

1074
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,350
Okay, I'll hang up now.

1075
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,620
Xingfu.

1076
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,390
The Village Committee just said

1077
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,390
that the judging panel would come to Xingfu Inn

1078
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,620
after their visit to the health products factory.

1079
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,660
They want you to prepare the reception
and a speech.

1080
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,260
You are to talk about

1081
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,780
the management and prospect of the inn.

1082
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,700
Xiuyu, I need to tell you something.

1083
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,350
I have to go to Shuiwei Village tomorrow.

1084
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,700
Why?

1085
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,620
Let's talk while we walk.

1086
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:33,830
You see.

1087
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,140
I prepared this speech.

1088
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,430
Look through it.

1089
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,350
If the schedule clashes,

1090
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,470
you'll speak on my behalf.

1091
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,180
You're familiar with the inn anyway.

1092
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,300
No, I can't.

1093
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,350
It's not right for you to be absent

1094
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,140
when the judging panel arrives.

1095
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,620
I hope the schedule won't clash.

1096
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,740
It's just what if.

1097
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,550
We need a Plan B.

1098
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,950
Have someone else collect the sample
in your stead then?

1099
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,220
Why do you have to do it in person?

1100
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,470
I need to organize everything.

1101
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,660
Li doesn't have a lot of time,

1102
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,260
and Ms. Guo is inexperienced.

1103
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,870
I don't want her to mess things up.

1104
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,510
Let's keep our fingers crossed.

1105
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,220
I hope the schedule won't clash too.

1106
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,180
Just look through it, will you?
