00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,300
Put your hands together.

4
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,300
Put your hands together.

5
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,510
Forward.

6
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,350
Here. You can park here.

7
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,100
Come forward. Alright.

8
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,350
Here.

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,425
[Welcome to Wan Village, fellow judges!]

10
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,300
Welcome.

11
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,380
Welcome.

12
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,660
Mr. Zhang. Thanks for traveling all the way here.

13
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,020
This way, please.

14
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,950
This way.

15
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,990
Hi.

16
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,350
This way, please.

17
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,020
This is Maoqin.

18
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,590
Nice to meet you.

19
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,660
Come on in.

20
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,510
The Wan Village

21
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,910
has been doing really well in the past two years.

22
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:26,820
Next up,

23
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,790
Mr. Wan will give you a brief introduction.

24
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,790
Compared to last year,

25
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,980
the Wanjia Group has achieved

26
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,310
a 15-percent year-over-year growth

27
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,580
this year.

28
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,030
You know how difficult it is
to survive in the traditional industry now.

29
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,030
We did our best.

30
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,540
As for the health products factory,

31
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,660
ever since we changed our marketing tactics

32
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,910
and promotional strategies,

33
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,630
we have been making a decent profit.

34
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,750
We have included all the information
in the booklet.

35
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,820
I think I should

36
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,310
leave the rest to Mr. Wan.

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,380
Your turn, Wan.

38
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,380
It must be really tiring for Mr. Zhang

39
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,820
to lead the team.

40
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,310
They're here mainly for a site inspection.

41
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,470
Talking here

42
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,750
won't achieve anything.

43
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,660
Liuhua, have you prepared the tea?

44
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,190
It's ready.

45
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,660
The delegates will be here anytime.

46
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,630
Don't worry.

47
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,100
Mr. Li,

48
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,260
when will you be there?

49
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,380
You're almost there?

50
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,190
Sure. I'll be right there.

51
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,980
Xiuyu.

52
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,790
It's bad timing,

53
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,350
but they need me at the Shuiwei Village now.

54
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,510
I'll leave the inn to you.

55
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,510
Xingfu, I can't do this.

56
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,980
Why not?

57
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,310
Did you forget what I told you?

58
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,420
Great men get bestowed great responsibility.

59
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,230
You can do this.

60
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,860
Xing... Xingfu.

61
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,510
What if I screw it up?

62
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,420
Why would you?

63
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,750
Your speech doesn't determine
how the inn is doing.

64
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,310
Besides, you don't have to care

65
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,790
about the feedback from the higher-ups.

66
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,070
You just need to state the truth.

67
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,190
I've got to go.

68
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:00,980
I...

69
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,910
Where's my script?

70
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,310
Did anyone see my script?

71
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,070
Look how friendly the villagers are.

72
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,950
I have to tell you about this one.

73
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,070
This is one of the products

74
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,820
of our health products factory.

75
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,630
She is from our village.

76
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,190
We don't have enough budget

77
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,420
to hire a celebrity.

78
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,380
Nonetheless, the sales have been quite good,

79
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,630
and we're making a very decent profit.

80
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,670
Mr. Zhang, watch your steps.

81
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,700
This is the first inn in the village.

82
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,380
I've heard about it.

83
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,950
The owner of the inn is He Xingfu.

84
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,260
[Xingfu Inn]
You even know her name.

85
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,140
My friend is a writer.

86
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,340
He used to live here.

87
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,220
After he went back,

88
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,780
he couldn't stop praising the inn and its owner.

89
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,780
That made me really curious.

90
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,310
That's why I've always wanted to visit the inn

91
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,190
and meet He Xingfu myself.

92
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,190
You'll see her soon.

93
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,430
[Welcome to Xingfu Inn, fellow judges!]
He Xingfu always strives to do better

94
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,075
and has already applied to be a member of the CPC.

95
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,430
Welcome

96
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,020
to Xingfu Inn, sirs.

97
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:57,870
This way, please.

98
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,310
Sure. This way, please.

99
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,020
This way, please.

100
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,510
After crossing the Bridge of Happiness,
(* "happiness" pronounces as "xingfu")

101
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,990
we'll arrive at the lobby.

102
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,310
In the lobby...

103
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,670
Here.

104
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,670
Watch your steps.

105
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,870
In the lobby,

106
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,380
you can see our latest exhibits

107
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,820
and the story wall.

108
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,700
Xiuyu, where is Xingfu?

109
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,900
Why isn't she here to receive the guests?

110
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,020
Xingfu had something important to do,
so she went out.

111
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,020
What is it that's so important?

112
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,340
Is it more important
than receiving the delegates?

113
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,340
It's fine.

114
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,110
Give her a call
and tell her to come here right away.

115
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,990
Xiuyu, I'll call her.

116
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,260
You can show the guests around.

117
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,260
I'll call her.

118
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,780
Sure. Please come in.

119
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,950
This way.

120
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,110
Watch your steps.

121
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,260
Ms. He, thanks to you,

122
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,820
our efficiency has improved significantly.

123
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,190
Thank you for making the trip.

124
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,020
Thanks.

125
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,550
It's part of our job.

126
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,340
Ms. He.

127
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,630
Why are you here?

128
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,020
Aren't the judges visiting the village today
for the inspection?

129
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,820
What's wrong?

130
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,460
Why aren't you working today?

131
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,580
I was on night shift yesterday,
so I'm getting the day off.

132
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,070
Ms. Guo, let me just answer this call.

133
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,820
Please bring Mr. Li and his colleague
to Madam Zhang's place.

134
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:06,870
Sure.

135
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,510
Li, this way.

136
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,190
Mr. Wan.

137
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,380
Xingfu, where are you?

138
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,340
I'm at Shuiwei Village.

139
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,510
Why are you there?

140
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,630
The delegates are here at the Xingfu Inn,

141
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,780
but you, the owner, are not here.

142
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,870
I've got everything prepared.

143
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,750
Xiuyu will receive the guests
and do the presentation on my behalf.

144
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,670
There will be no difference.

145
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,900
It's different.

146
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,900
Mr. Zhang said this himself.

147
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,190
He wants to meet you.

148
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,630
Can't you just do it for the greater good?

149
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,580
This is a major event.

150
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,820
It will affect the entire village.

151
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,310
It's a collective honor.

152
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,870
Don't you know what to do now?

153
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,550
Get back here now,

154
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,550
or you'll have to bear the consequences.

155
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,900
Liuhua.

156
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,870
Keep this.

157
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,140
We can use it again.

158
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,670
Sure.

159
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,750
Don't worry. Be careful.

160
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,020
Xiuyu.

161
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,900
Xingfu.

162
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,430
Have the delegates left?

163
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,460
They left quite some time ago.

164
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,750
How did everything go?

165
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,260
Nothing much,

166
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,700
but Mr. Wan was slightly upset.

167
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,260
Why?

168
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,670
Because of my absence?

169
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,870
Are they here to inspect Xingfu Inn

170
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,950
or me?

171
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,630
Fine, I'll pay them a visit.

172
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,630
Where are you going?

173
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,020
I'm going to the Village\hCommittee.

174
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,220
Why was I upset?

175
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,190
Mr. Zhang, the leader of the jury team,

176
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,900
left our village disappointed.

177
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,900
I said this during the pep rally.

178
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,780
The judges' visit to the Wan Village

179
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,950
means a lot to the Wan Village.

180
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,780
We need to show him

181
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,780
what the villagers of the Wan Village are made of.

182
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,750
I also emphasized

183
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,510
that none of you should embarrass me

184
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,870
or the village.

185
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,190
Yet, we were embarrassed.

186
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,900
How dare she?

187
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,750
How dare she leave her position
without permission?

188
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,190
How dare she disregard

189
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,190
our collective interest and honor?

190
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,780
Because of her little achievement,

191
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,700
she thought she is above everyone else.

192
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,670
The person I'm going to reprimand today

193
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,430
is He Xingfu.

194
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,260
Although she is not a member of the CPC,

195
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,460
she is part of the Wan Village.

196
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,140
All for Wan and Wan for All.

197
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,870
It's not just a slogan.

198
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,510
It is a collective idea

199
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,430
that should be instilled in all members
of the Wan Village.

200
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,150
We all need to look at the bigger picture.

201
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,550
Let's take this as a lesson.

202
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,500
Those of you who are present here
are members of the CPC.

203
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,620
If you make the same mistake,

204
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,580
I'll do more than just reprimand you.

205
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,980
You're dismissed.

206
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,620
Remind him to take his medicine.

207
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,620
Sure.

208
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,700
Let's go.

209
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,150
Mr. Wan.

210
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,980
I know you're mad at me,

211
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,790
so I came here to explain myself.

212
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,550
Mr. Wan.

213
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,860
12 kids in Shuiwei Village have been diagnosed
with lead poisoning.

214
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,860
Lead poisoning?

215
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,860
Yes.

216
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,270
A high level of lead

217
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,670
was found in these 12 kids' blood.

218
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,820
Mr. Wan, lead poisoning can affect

219
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,910
the kids' health and their immune systems.

220
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,860
This will greatly affect the kids' future

221
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,310
and their health.

222
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,500
We can't wait any longer.

223
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,150
We need to find out the source
as soon as possible.

224
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,220
Chuanjia, have you heard about this?

225
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,500
I haven't.

226
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,740
What she just said was news to me too.

227
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,500
Catch up with Maoqin.

228
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,670
Both of you should find out
what actually happened

229
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,100
and report it to me.

230
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,190
Sure.

231
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,390
I'll visit the Shuiwei Village later

232
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,580
to check things out.

233
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,460
I suspect that the well water is polluted.

234
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,790
I've told the officer
of the Environment Monitoring Station

235
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,860
to take some water samples.

236
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,700
All right.

237
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,390
We'll see how things go after we get the results.

238
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,670
Mr. Wan, it's all my fault.

239
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:27,790
Mr. Wan.

240
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,910
Watch your steps.

241
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,620
I didn't do my job properly.

242
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,740
However,

243
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,070
we had never heard

244
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,100
of lead poisoning before this.

245
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,860
I really have no idea what it is.

246
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,030
I was careless as well.

247
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,310
Which house are we visiting first?

248
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,740
Let's start with Liu's place.

249
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,700
His only grandson is three years old this year.

250
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,820
They discovered a high level of lead in his blood.

251
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,620
Mr. Wan.

252
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,740
Hi.

253
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,190
Where is it?

254
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,620
Right after this turn.

255
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,740
Liu Datou.

256
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,860
Datou.

257
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,030
This is it.

258
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,700
Come on in.

259
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,950
Is anyone home?

260
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,790
Datou.

261
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,550
You're right here.

262
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,790
Come here.

263
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,340
Mr. Wan is here to send you his regards.

264
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,310
Who gave you permission to come here?

265
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,670
Leave now.

266
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,740
Why are you so rude?

267
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,910
Mr. Wan? Who?

268
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,670
I don't know him.

269
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,500
Who am I to talk to a noble man like him?

270
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,190
Get out of here.

271
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,910
Know your place.

272
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,460
Get out of here.

273
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,150
What are you doing?

274
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,620
Cold-blooded freaks.

275
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,670
All you care about is money.

276
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,430
Why...

277
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,460
Mr. Wan is here to send his regards.

278
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,740
I don't care.

279
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,820
His intention is good.

280
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,820
Stop it.

281
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,670
How dare you?

282
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,980
Mr. Wan,

283
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,670
he's still upset about it,
so please don't take it to heart.

284
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,860
He just doesn't get it.

285
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,740
Why don't we

286
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,500
visit the rest of them some other day?

287
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,740
I'm here anyway.

288
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,620
We didn't manage to talk to him.

289
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,910
Let's see if we can talk to the others.

290
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,620
Sure. Let's go.

291
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,220
Mr. Wan, Mr. Li.

292
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,390
Have some tea.

293
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,070
Sure.

294
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,580
Sure. Thank you.

295
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,980
This is the best tea we've got.

296
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,190
I hope you don't mind.

297
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,700
That's too kind of you.

298
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,220
How can I help you?

299
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,620
It's nothing.

300
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,460
Mr. Maoqin and I are here

301
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,500
to find out how is your kid doing

302
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,700
after the lead poisoning.

303
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,790
I heard your child

304
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,190
was the first to get diagnosed.

305
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,620
It wasn't our child.

306
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,390
Qiang, Yancheng's child, was the first
to get diagnosed.

307
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,390
He is currently in a lawsuit
with the health products factory.

308
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,310
Have you not heard about it yet?

309
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,910
Yes, I remember now.

310
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,740
If his child is not counted,

311
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,340
then my child will be the first to get diagnosed.

312
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,500
Speaking of this,

313
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,190
I was quite lucky.

314
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,270
When I brought my kid to the doctor
the other day,

315
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,910
I ran into He Xingfu from your village.

316
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,700
Our village is your village too.

317
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,820
We're family.

318
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,550
Yes.

319
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,910
We're family.

320
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,620
Mr. Wan.

321
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,460
Xingfu is a really kind person.

322
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,030
She was the one who told me
to get my child's blood lead level checked.

323
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,620
When she found out
that there was a high lead level in his blood,

324
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,190
she started worrying about the other kids too.

325
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,150
She spoke to you,

326
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,100
but you were too busy to be bothered.

327
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,910
I...

328
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,980
She worried that it would affect the kids,

329
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,220
so she organized everything herself.

330
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,270
She spent money printing flyers

331
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,430
and visited one family after another.

332
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,030
She also got in touch
with the county hospital personally.

333
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,030
Eventually,

334
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,820
she found a big van

335
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,270
and sent all the kids to the hospital.

336
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,340
Ms. He put a lot of effort into this.

337
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,820
There are so many officers in our village,

338
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,580
but none of them has contributed anything.

339
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,270
Well, I...

340
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,460
Mr. Wan is busy with his work.

341
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,150
It was my fault that I neglected my duties.

342
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,460
I should reflect upon myself.

343
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,070
Indeed, we are in charge of this,

344
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,950
but we didn't do a good job.

345
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,860
No.

346
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,670
I'm not blaming you for anything.

347
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,580
I'm just thinking

348
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,220
how happy the village will be

349
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,190
if you make He Xingfu one of the officers.

350
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,500
Let me top this up.

351
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,740
It's late at night.

352
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,070
Why are you sitting here alone?

353
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,980
You gave me a scare.

354
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,460
What's the matter?

355
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,700
What happened?

356
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,100
It's nothing.

357
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,820
I'm just troubled by something.

358
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,980
What is it?

359
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,910
I always thought

360
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,070
the people of Shuiwei Village

361
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,790
would feel honored

362
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,790
about the merging

363
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,190
of the Wan Village and the Shuiwei Village.

364
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,950
Of course, they do.

365
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,950
They have to be honored and grateful.

366
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,820
But they aren't pleased about it at all.

367
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,430
They aren't pleased?

368
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,310
We should all

369
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,980
be appreciative, right?

370
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,860
That's why I always say
a terrible environment makes terrible people.

371
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,390
I've told you many times.

372
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,430
You're the leader,

373
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,100
and you need to stop calling them terrible.

374
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,100
I got it.

375
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,430
I only said that because I was talking to you.

376
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,620
I won't say it when I'm with others.

377
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,790
You shouldn't even think like that.

378
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,740
What I'm saying is

379
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,980
that ever since we're joined
by the Shuiwei Village,

380
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,430
half of the young men of the village

381
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,820
don't have to leave the village to look for jobs.

382
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,670
They're earning more
than when working in the cities.

383
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,190
The living standard of the farmers

384
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,860
has significantly improved.

385
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,310
We make sure they get

386
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,030
all the village's welfare benefits too.

387
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,070
Look.

388
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,030
Before they joined the Wan Village,

389
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,790
how many families owned a car?

390
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,910
Now,

391
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,910
there are at least a dozen of them who own a car.

392
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,860
They should be grateful, right?

393
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,700
How can they compare themselves
with the people of the Wan Village?

394
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,340
It's not something you can compare.

395
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,500
We made a deal.

396
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,430
Let some people get rich first
and then help others to get rich together.

397
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,010
When we first started our business,
the county helped us a lot.

398
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,980
We had the priority to all the good resources.

399
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,580
The Shuiwei Village was put at a disadvantage.

400
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,250
We managed to achieve our goal first,

401
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,490
so shouldn't we repay kindness with kindness?

402
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,300
Moreover, the merging of these two villages

403
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,890
gave the Wan Village the upper hand.

404
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,490
We got better lands, labor, and resources.

405
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,770
Why didn't you consider that?

406
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,420
What's wrong with you?

407
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,890
Why do you keep defending them?

408
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,180
Look.

409
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,650
That's why I said you had an attitude problem.

410
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,610
Them?

411
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,100
Aren't the Shuiwei Village

412
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,730
and the Wan Village family?

413
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,820
You're the head of the village
and you don't consider them your family.

414
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,370
No wonder they consider us outsiders too.

415
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,530
We merged the village,

416
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,940
but we didn't bring the people together.

417
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,050
I'm a terrible secretary.

418
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,940
You made it sound too serious.

419
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,380
Someone told me

420
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,420
that you'd spent a lot of time

421
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,140
at Shuiwei Village in the past two days.

422
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,570
What actually happened?

423
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,980
Were there any rumors?

424
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,460
Did someone say something about you

425
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,660
and upset you?

426
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,290
Yes, I'm upset.

427
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,620
It's a waste of time talking to you.

428
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,810
Chuanjia.

429
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,700
He Xingfu has arranged

430
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,770
to send all the kids of the Shuiwei Village
for a blood lead test.

431
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,620
Ask her how much she has spent
and we'll reimburse her.

432
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,730
We are the village leaders,

433
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,530
but a villager is doing much better than us.

434
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,810
How embarrassing.

435
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,810
Ms. He.

436
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,050
I'm Li.

437
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,660
We've received the test results.

438
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,620
The well water is indeed polluted.

439
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,770
I've couriered

440
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,250
the test results to you.

441
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,490
Remember to receive it.

442
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,660
Thanks, Mr. Li.

443
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,460
I have another question.

444
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,460
How did the well water get polluted?

445
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,420
It's hard to say.

446
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,860
It could be a natural cause.

447
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,380
There's also a chance
that the surface water got polluted

448
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,530
and seeped underground,

449
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,700
resulting in the contamination
of the groundwater.

450
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,700
Do you mean that the river water is also polluted?

451
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,940
The river water was fine

452
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,530
the last time we did an assessment on it.

453
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,660
Ms. He.

454
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,010
A one-time test can't conclude anything.

455
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,980
What if someone polluted the water source?

456
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,330
Let me be honest with you.

457
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,180
This is our specialty,

458
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,980
so we know it very well.

459
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,250
Many companies

460
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,770
are playing games with us.

461
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,220
Illegally discharging wastewater

462
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,860
is very common now.

463
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,980
Are you saying
that the wastewater treatment plant

464
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,330
has once discharged wastewater illegally?

465
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,010
Ms. He.

466
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,140
I didn't say that.

467
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,570
Please don't sabotage me.

468
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,980
I also said

469
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,330
that lead occurs naturally in the environment
as a trace element.

470
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,980
What I meant is

471
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,660
that we need solid evidence.

472
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,940
Otherwise, none of this will work.

473
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,860
What should we do now?

474
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,220
We need an investigation.

475
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,490
A very thorough one.

476
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,140
We need to work with all the departments,

477
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,530
including the environment, health,
and disease control.

478
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,220
I'll be honest with you.

479
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,900
Without solid evidence,

480
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,220
it will be very difficult to figure things out.

481
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,220
Li.

482
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,730
We've got the water sample. Let's go.

483
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,620
Sure. Get in the car now.

484
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,180
Ms. He,

485
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,180
I have work to do.

486
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,420
I've got to go.

487
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,290
Remember to receive the parcel.

488
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,530
Sure. Thanks, Mr. Li.

489
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,490
Mr. Wan, I heard that lead poisoning

490
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,770
would affect children's intelligence.

491
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,050
Will our children become stupid in the future?

492
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,660
I only have this one child.

493
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,810
Mr. Wan.

494
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,660
Will it cause any sequelae?

495
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,570
My father-in-law was diagnosed with cancer.

496
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,010
Is it caused by lead poisoning too?

497
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,050
Will we get poisoned too?

498
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,810
That's right.

499
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,290
How did the lead poisoning happen out of nowhere?

500
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:29,940
Exactly.

501
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,530
I'm in my sixties,

502
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,660
and this is my first time hearing this.

503
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,420
I think

504
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,290
it's definitely caused
by the wastewater treatment plant.

505
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,380
Ever since the establishment of the plant,

506
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,900
the children in the village are always sick.

507
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,180
It's gotten worse over the past two years.

508
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,810
He's right.

509
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,420
Gentleman.

510
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,140
You can't say things like this.

511
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,290
We need proof.

512
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,220
The court made it clear.

513
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,980
What you said is not true.

514
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,530
Quiet, ladies and gentlemen.

515
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,530
Calm down.

516
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,620
Mr. Wan is saying...

517
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,730
Calm down?

518
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,700
The Wan Village is not affected.
Of course, you are calm.

519
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,810
Imagine if your child is poisoned.

520
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,460
Mr. Wan takes this matter very seriously

521
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,220
and visits the affected families one by one.

522
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
That means this is a serious matter.

523
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,700
But we don't know exactly how serious it is.

524
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,420
What we need now

525
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,940
is an explanation.

526
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,330
How can we calm down?

527
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,090
We need an explanation.

528
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,460
Calm down, please.

529
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,050
Worrying won't solve the problem.

530
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,980
Who is she?

531
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,940
He Xingfu.

532
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,660
So she's He Xingfu.

533
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,420
We've spoken to the doctor.

534
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,140
We managed to diagnose it before it was too late,

535
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,140
so it's nothing too serious.

536
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,420
As long as we can start
the lead detox treatment immediately,

537
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,620
nothing will happen.

538
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,770
They will recover.

539
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,660
Also,

540
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,770
we need to have faith in Mr. Wan.

541
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,490
Mr. Wan takes this matter very seriously.

542
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,050
He'll definitely find out
the source of pollution as soon as possible

543
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,940
and give us an explanation.

544
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,330
Fine.

545
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,860
Let me say a few words.

546
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,900
I know you're very worried.

547
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,810
To be honest, I am too.

548
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,900
This is a serious matter.

549
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,860
This is what we'll do.

550
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,660
Chuanjia. Cailiang.

551
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,380
What about this?

552
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,220
We'll do a census

553
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,530
for all of the members

554
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,010
of Shuiwei Village.

555
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,290
Anyone with a high level of lead in their blood

556
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,660
will receive treatments right away.

557
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,570
Don't worry about the medical bills.

558
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,220
The Wanjia Group will bear all the costs.

559
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,290
What do you think about that?

560
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,010
I think that will work.

561
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:26,980
Fine.

562
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,290
We'll trust Mr. Wan.

563
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:28,860
Sure.

564
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,090
Keep us posted, Mr. Wan.

565
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:30,620
Sure.

566
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,250
Keep us posted.

567
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,660
Sure. We'll work hard too.

568
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,770
Thank you for your understanding.

569
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,860
I'll see you again.

570
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,180
See them out.

571
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,290
Don't worry. The Group will help you.

572
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,290
We're here to back you up.

573
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,180
Take care.

574
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,010
How did this turn into such a huge issue?

575
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,250
Mr. Wan, I have something to tell you.

576
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,810
We've got the test report
from the well water assessment.

577
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,620
It is indeed polluted.

578
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,980
It really was the well water

579
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,250
that caused lead poisoning in the kids.

580
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,490
Mr. Wan.

581
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,420
Shall we report this to the county authorities?

582
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,090
Not right now.

583
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,010
We're conducting a census very soon.

584
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,660
We'll submit it together

585
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,980
with the result of the census.

586
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:30,980
Mr. Wan.

587
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,010
What is wrong with He Xingfu?

588
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,770
Why is she sticking her nose into everything?

589
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,490
Who does she think she is?

590
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,380
She's everywhere.

591
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,660
I don't mind her being everywhere,

592
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,050
as long as she doesn't spread rumors

593
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,050
and make a huge fuss over nothing.

594
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,980
The Entrepreneurship
in Rural Communities Competition

595
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,090
is now at its most crucial phase.

596
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,090
I only hope that we can win the title

597
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,290
without any hiccups.

598
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,090
Then, we can end the year on a high note.

599
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,570
That's exactly what I'm saying.

600
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,660
So many things happened
toward the end of the year,

601
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,860
and she's brought us more troubles.

602
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,220
Is it possible

603
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,570
that the kids got lead poisoning

604
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,490
because of the illegal disposal of wastewater

605
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,940
at your wastewater treatment plant previously?

606
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,180
Mr. Wan.

607
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,050
Please don't wrong me.

608
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,220
Wait.

609
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,050
They tested the river water, didn't they?

610
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,220
It was fine.

611
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,380
Moreover,

612
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,770
lead

613
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
is everywhere.

614
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,250
You can find it in nature

615
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,460
and the kids' books and stationery.

616
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,570
Who says that it has to be from us?

617
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,900
Fine. That will be our defense.

618
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,330
We have to stand firm on our ground

619
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,770
and make sure not to get blamed

620
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,860
for this incident.

621
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,530
Otherwise, both the health products factory

622
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,770
and the Wan Village will be done for.

623
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,330
We'll spend the rest of our lives

624
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,700
in prison.

625
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,530
Don't worry.

626
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,900
They didn't win the previous lawsuit,

627
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,090
and they won't win this time too.

628
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,490
You're saying

629
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,050
that the groundwater of Shuiwei Village
has been polluted.

630
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,660
Will the earth get polluted too?

631
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,140
If the earth gets polluted,

632
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,140
then the vegetables I grow
will be contaminated too.

633
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,290
Then, I won't be able to start the cooperative.

634
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,290
I can't be selling poisonous vegetables, right?

635
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,090
Most of the vegetable farmers

636
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,810
you're going to work with for your cooperative

637
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,980
are from the Shuiwei Village, right?

638
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,220
Yes. The Wan Village doesn't have enough land.

639
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,050
If we want to increase production,

640
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,700
we can only rely on the lands
in the Shuiwei Village.

641
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,460
Qinglai.

642
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,460
Didn't you ask the Group to be your guarantor

643
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,620
so that you can apply for a loan?

644
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,900
You need to put a halt to that immediately.

645
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,810
I've already submitted my application.

646
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,770
Then, what should we do now?

647
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,620
Are you going to be in debt again?

648
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,660
Don't worry.

649
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,810
According to Mr. Li,

650
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,980
we can fix the lead pollution,

651
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,420
as long as we find the source of pollution.

652
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,050
You gave me a scare.

653
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,490
That's good to hear.

654
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,180
However, it's not easy

655
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,140
to find the source of pollution.

656
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,420
You need to find it however hard it is.

657
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,570
That's right.

658
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,010
If you'd listened to me earlier,

659
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,530
we could've been able to avoid these.

660
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:14,940
Ms. He is here.

661
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,133
Sit, Ms. He.

662
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,730
Have a seat.

663
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,980
Have a seat, Ms. He.

664
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,220
Sure.

665
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,420
Yancheng, you're here.

666
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,660
How is the kid doing? Is he feeling better?

667
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,090
He has almost fully recovered.

668
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,420
We owe that to you, Ms. He.

669
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,420
Thank you so much.

670
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,570
Yes. We owe that to Ms. He.

671
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,770
Otherwise, we'd still be in the dark

672
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,570
and oblivious about what's going on.

673
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,050
That's right.

674
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,660
That's not a big deal.

675
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,620
Ms. He.

676
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,940
I was the one who called Yancheng here.

677
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,660
We are all very worried.

678
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,980
They have gone through this
and they can guide us on this.

679
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,010
I heard that they're going to conduct a census
in the village.

680
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,660
We should all go and have it checked out.

681
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,140
Yancheng and I did the test and it showed
that we have a high lead level in our blood too.

682
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,090
It doesn't affect adults much

683
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,010
and the symptoms aren't that obvious.

684
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,490
However, if the lead stays in our bodies

685
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,140
for a prolonged period
without getting excreted,

686
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,420
it will be very dangerous too.

687
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,940
It will cause a lot of illnesses,

688
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,700
and some might even get cancer.

689
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,660
What should we do now?

690
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,530
Ms. He, how did the well water

691
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,980
get poisoned?

692
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,010
Mr. Li of the Environment Monitoring Station said

693
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,090
that the cause of the well water pollution
can be really complicated.

694
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,660
It's not easy

695
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,940
to find the source of pollution.

696
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,250
Why not?

697
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,050
Even I know what's the source of pollution.

698
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,700
It's obvious that the wastewater treatment plant
on top of the mountain

699
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,290
polluted the river.

700
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,860
The river water then
contaminated the groundwater.

701
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,330
It's just that simple, right?

702
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,620
However, Yancheng's case
has already removed the suspicion

703
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,660
of the wastewater treatment plant
being the source of pollution.

704
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,900
But I don't agree with the results.

705
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,490
Look at this.

706
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,530
The wastewater treatment plant

707
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,730
is the only factory we can find along the river.

708
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,900
Who else can it be?

709
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,940
That's right.

710
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,380
Our suspicion won't help with the investigation.

711
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,530
We need evidence.

712
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,530
That's right.

713
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,620
Yancheng.

714
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,570
Do you remember what Mr. Guan said

715
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,730
during the previous lawsuit?

716
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,330
He said that both parties needed evidence

717
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,460
to prove that they had nothing to do
with the incident.

718
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,290
That was what Mr. Guan said.

719
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,940
However, they only managed

720
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,770
to bring out some very messy evidence.

721
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,250
Despite that, the judge sided with them too.

722
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,050
I'll give Mr. Guan a call.

723
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,420
I understand what you're saying,

724
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,460
but do you really want to know the truth?

725
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,660
Of course. I must find out the truth.

726
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,570
If you want to find out the truth,

727
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,250
help the affected villagers

728
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,050
earn the compensation they deserve,

729
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,730
and eliminate all future risks,

730
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,420
the best thing you can do now

731
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,620
is to file a class-action lawsuit.

732
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,010
But what concerns me the most now is

733
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,250
that the Shuiwei Village has merged
with the Wan Village.

734
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,620
I'm sure the affected villagers

735
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,700
will have many other concerns as well.

736
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,660
Leave that to me.

737
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,810
Let me be honest with you.

738
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,290
We lost

739
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,250
Yancheng's case,

740
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,940
so this upcoming lawsuit

741
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,330
won't be an easy one.

742
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,250
Even if it's a class-action lawsuit,

743
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,010
I can't guarantee that I'll win.

744
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,810
But I believe

745
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,220
none of the parties

746
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,530
will have the upper hand.

747
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,810
They will need

748
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,180
solid evidence

749
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,010
to prove that the villagers
who got lead poisoning

750
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,810
is not a consequence

751
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,090
of the disposal of wastewater.

752
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,490
After all, the wastewater treatment plant
is the only building

753
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,900
at the source of the river in Shuiwei Village.

754
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,770
It's most likely the source of contamination.

755
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,900
I must find out

756
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,940
what went wrong.

757
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,290
Xingfu.

758
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,940
Have you thought things through?

759
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,860
Are you really going to do this?

760
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,620
It's going to be very risky,

761
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,530
and you might offend a lot of people.

762
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,250
Xiuyu.

763
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,250
Xingfu, why did you ask me

764
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,860
to come back so urgently?

765
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,090
Have a seat.

766
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,250
This is what happened.

767
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,380
I want to do something

768
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,570
that might offend many people in the village.

769
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,900
But I've thought this through.

770
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,530
I have to do this,

771
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,700
so I'm giving you a heads-up.

772
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,250
In case anything happens in the future,

773
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,010
at least you'll be prepared.

774
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,010
Of course,

775
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,220
it will be better if I can have your support.

776
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,420
What... what is it about?

777
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,900
I'm going to lead
the villagers of the Shuiwei Village

778
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,420
and file a class-action lawsuit
against Wanjia Health Products Factory.

779
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,290
Is it because of lead poisoning?

780
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,290
The lawsuit is meant
to find the source of the well water pollution.

781
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,220
I'm on Xingfu's side.

782
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,980
You should just stay away from this.
What can you do for them?

783
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,570
Xingfu,

784
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,770
I know you are coming from a good place.

785
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,940
However, I still think

786
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,420
you should weigh up the risks.

787
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,940
I know.

788
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,090
Almost every family in our village

789
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,250
knows someone working in the factory.

790
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,250
If we do take it to court,

791
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,050
it might affect all the homestays

792
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,010
in the village.

793
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,700
If you already know the consequences,

794
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,090
why are you still doing this?

795
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,460
Dad, if we don't find out the source of pollution

796
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,770
and eliminate it,

797
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,980
what will happen in the future?

798
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,770
The well water the children are drinking
is poisonous.

799
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,250
Will the food they eat in the future
become poisonous too?

800
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,530
Will the fruits and vegetables we plant here
become poisonous too?

801
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,490
She's right.

802
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,050
If we don't resolve this issue,

803
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,860
the cooperative will never work out.

804
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,730
Even if you fail to start the cooperative,

805
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,090
are we going to stop eating

806
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,090
food and vegetables?

807
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,250
Even if we manage to stay off the poison for now,

808
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,530
what about Little Dou
and the kids of his generation?

809
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,380
Are they going to keep eating

810
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,770
poisonous food and vegetables as they grow up?

811
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,810
We're too old to be bothered by that,

812
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,940
but the children still have a long future ahead.

813
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,860
Xingfu, we'll just do as you say.

814
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,940
Xingfu, what about this?

815
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,530
You'll stay a low profile

816
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,090
and leave it to them.

817
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,420
You'll just help them behind closed doors.

818
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,730
What if the people of the village find out

819
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,940
that you're helping the outsiders?

820
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,220
Dad, if I'm doing this,
I'll do it openly and proudly.

821
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,700
I'll go to Mr. Wan

822
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,900
and ask for his consent and support.

823
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,980
You are working with so many other people
to file a lawsuit against the Group.

824
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,180
And you're asking me to back you up.

825
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,090
Are you kidding me?

826
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,530
Mr. Wan,

827
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,420
I think the villagers' suspicions are valid.

828
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:22,810
What about you?

829
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,250
Do you think so too?

830
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:26,620
Yes.

831
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,730
Why?

832
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,250
We spent so much money

833
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,140
and put in so much effort to build
the wastewater treatment plant.

834
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,010
Do you take it as a decoration?

835
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,420
We acquired so much land,

836
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,730
spent so much money, and put in so much effort
just to build the factory.

837
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,090
You saw it yourself.

838
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,460
Yes, I saw it myself.

839
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,810
But building it doesn't mean putting it to use.

840
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,220
The official
of the Environment Monitoring Station said

841
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,940
that many corporates
would discharge their wastewater illegally

842
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,900
just so that they can cut cost

843
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,940
and increase their profits.

844
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:53,030
Xingfu.

845
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,380
You can't trust others blindly.

846
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,060
You need evidence to prove
that we discharged the wastewater illegally.

847
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,470
Without evidence, it just seems
like you're spreading rumors.

848
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,270
If things get worse,

849
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,860
you might get sued for what you said.

850
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,190
Xingfu, you saw

851
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,990
that Li Yancheng from the Shuiwei Village

852
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,510
filed a lawsuit against us

853
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,430
regarding this matter too, right?

854
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,990
The court made its decision too.

855
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,140
You saw what happened.

856
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,780
Yes, I saw what happened.

857
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,950
But all these people fell sick all of a sudden.

858
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,820
Doesn't it sound fishy to you?

859
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,620
Mr. Wan,

860
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,860
let's not talk about anything else.

861
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,750
Just use our common senses.

862
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,780
Don't you think the wastewater treatment plant

863
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,230
is very likely to be the source of pollution?

864
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,710
At least, we need to eliminate

865
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,380
the best possible source first, right?

866
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,380
Why is it the best possible source?

867
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,270
Xingfu,

868
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,100
can you stop causing trouble?

869
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,750
Xingfu, I understand where you're coming from.

870
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,380
You are worried about the sick children,

871
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,910
but so am I.

872
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,190
I was the one who ordered a screening

873
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,300
for everyone in Shuiwei Village,
adults and kids included.

874
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,580
I also promised

875
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,950
that the Group would bear

876
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,540
all the medical costs.

877
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,430
This is the most crucial phase

878
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,670
of the Entrepreneurship
in Rural Communities Competition.

879
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,910
We need to look at the bigger picture, all right?

880
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,190
I hope that Wan Village

881
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,300
can win the Entrepreneurship
in Rural Communities Competition.

882
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,230
However, I also hope

883
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,300
that we can win it fair and square.

884
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,820
Mr. Wan, has this ever crossed your mind?

885
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,540
If they ever really discover something wrong,

886
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,510
what should we do?

887
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,670
The more titles we win,

888
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,300
the more humiliated we will get.

889
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,700
Moreover,

890
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,310
compared to giving the kids a healthy life,

891
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,540
the medal and the title

892
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,030
really mean nothing.

893
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,350
It's not just a medal and a title.

894
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,430
Do you know how much the medal and the title

895
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,100
mean to the Wan Village?

896
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,830
There's an old saying that goes,

897
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,430
"Truth always comes to light."

898
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,430
The temporary honor

899
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,060
cannot guarantee you
a lifetime of wealth and health.

900
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,790
Even if they can get cured

901
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,430
and get the lead removed from their bodies,

902
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,470
what will happen in the future?

903
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,700
As long as the source of contamination
is still there,

904
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,510
no one can guarantee
that it won't happen again in the future.

905
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,220
Fine.

906
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,140
Xingfu.

907
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,100
Let's cut this conversation short.

908
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,060
Anyway,

909
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,310
you should go to the Shuiwei Village

910
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,430
and talk to them.

911
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,470
We're family.

912
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,430
Whatever they want,

913
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,870
I'll try to fulfill all their requests.

914
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,430
Let's not end up in a lawsuit

915
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,950
and fall out with each other.

916
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,990
It won't do any of us any good.

917
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,790
Fall out with each other?

918
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,350
We want to get the facts right through law.

919
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,830
We want to find out the rights and wrongs
through law.

920
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,030
We want to resolve disputes through law.

921
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,390
We want to achieve justice through law.

922
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,740
Isn't that what the rule of law is all about?

923
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,310
Mr. Wan, what do you say?

924
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,390
Wait. What's going on?

925
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,100
Is the village woman, He Xingfu,

926
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,790
out of her mind now?

927
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,100
What is she trying to achieve?

928
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,430
There's only one thing

929
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,510
that concerns me now.

930
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,660
Did the pollution of the groundwater

931
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,180
really happen

932
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,140
because of the illegal wastewater discharge?

933
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,100
I don't think so.

934
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,260
There wasn't much wastewater.

935
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,350
Moreover,

936
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,910
we stopped doing that

937
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,030
right after you gave the order.

938
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,310
You swear you really stopped doing that?

939
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,030
If you really stopped doing that,

940
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,620
why would something this serious happen today?

941
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
How could you still lie to my face

942
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,990
after everything that has happened?

943
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,700
Well...

944
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,510
I only did that a few times.

945
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,990
It was a long time ago.

946
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,350
Even if we contaminated the water,

947
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,660
it would've been flushed away a long time ago.

948
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,220
Why would I trust you?

949
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,510
I don't even know

950
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,990
when you're telling the truth and when you're not.

951
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,790
You caused this mess,

952
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,470
so please clean up after yourself.

953
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,060
Don't drag me into this,

954
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,390
or our partnership will end here.

955
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,350
Fine. Don't worry.

956
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,830
It's going to be fine.

957
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,060
I certainly hope so.

958
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,990
If anything happens, we'll all be done for.

959
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,660
Give Mr. Han a call

960
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,260
and tell him to get prepared.

961
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,790
Madam Li, the only reason why we're doing this

962
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,540
is because we hope to provide your grandchildren

963
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,910
with clean drinking water.

964
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,580
Don't you want to know what actually happened?

965
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,790
Of course, I want.

966
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,700
But the Wanjia Group

967
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,030
is bearing all our medical costs.

968
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,180
What if I join you to file the lawsuit

969
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,510
and they refuse to reimburse us?

970
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,310
The lawyer will talk to them on your behalf.

971
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,350
The lawyer is not related to us.

972
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,350
Why would he help us?

973
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,030
All they want is money.

974
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,390
They will leave once they've earned enough,

975
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,950
but we will keep staying here

976
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,060
one generation after another.

977
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,910
Once we start a dispute,

978
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,030
it will be very difficult to resolve it.

979
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,100
Madam Li.

980
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,220
Fine. That's enough.

981
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,180
I know you're coming from a good place,

982
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,580
but don't count me in.

983
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,100
Let's go.

984
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,180
Madam Li, please stay.

985
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,100
We shall go too.

986
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,870
No, but...

987
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,260
Let's go.

988
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,580
We'll get going.

989
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,350
Please think about it at home.

990
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,660
Ms. He, my husband just started working
at the factory.

991
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,580
If I get involved in the lawsuit
against Wan Village,

992
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,220
he might lose his job.

993
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,660
They have no right to dismiss your husband
because of this.

994
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,990
The boss can fire

995
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,140
anyone he likes.

996
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,660
You shouldn't let that bother you.

997
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,260
We should look at the bigger picture.

998
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,310
If we fail to find the source of pollution,

999
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,700
what will happen to your child in the long run?

1000
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,220
She's right.

1001
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,910
Let me discuss this with my husband.

1002
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,740
Wait. Look...

1003
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,350
Cui'er, you need to reconsider this.

1004
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,390
Don't go.

1005
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,510
We are supposed to have a meeting
to discuss the matter.

1006
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,180
Don't...

1007
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,790
Think about it.

1008
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,060
Look.

1009
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,510
Ms. He, please don't take this to heart.

1010
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,790
The people of our village have yet to realize

1011
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,790
the severity of this issue.

1012
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,220
Allow them a few days to think about it.

1013
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,470
I'm sure they'll come around.

1014
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,990
He's right, Ms. He.

1015
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,950
I think Liu Datou's grandson

1016
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,060
was diagnosed with lead poisoning too.

1017
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,990
Let me talk to him later.

1018
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,620
Perhaps he will join us.

1019
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,390
Sure.

1020
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,390
Mr. Han.

1021
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,910
What was that supposed to mean?

1022
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,180
Didn't we win the lawsuit

1023
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,350
against Yancheng?

1024
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,950
Isn't it going to be the same this time?

1025
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,950
They look the same,

1026
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,950
but if they have a big group of people

1027
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,220
and are filing a class-action lawsuit
against you together,

1028
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,740
it won't be that easy to win.

1029
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,660
How so?

1030
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,430
Whether it's a group or an individual,

1031
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,790
it's still the same thing.

1032
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,990
Does the number of plaintiffs
affect the judge's decision?

1033
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,990
If that's the case,

1034
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,790
I'll bring all my factory workers there

1035
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,790
and outnumber them.

1036
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,310
Mr. Wan, don't worry.

1037
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,310
I'm not saying
that we will definitely lose the lawsuit.

1038
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,030
I'm only telling you
that it's way riskier than before.

1039
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,260
It was just a villager previously.

1040
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,580
Our evidence can easily
overturn the allegations.

1041
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,830
After all, it was just an individual.

1042
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,140
Now that there is a group of people,

1043
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,830
the judge will definitely handle it
more meticulously.

1044
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,310
Besides, we have to prove
that the kids falling sick

1045
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,700
has nothing to do with the wastewater.

1046
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,830
I'm afraid that it won't be as easy.

1047
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,950
Mr. Wan.

1048
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,910
What are you doing here?

1049
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,990
Are you not done sabotaging me yet?

1050
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,310
The lawyers are here.

1051
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,950
I just want to drop by to say hello.

1052
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,350
Mr. Wan.

1053
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,260
Mr. Han. Ms. He.

1054
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,350
Mr. Mo, you showed up right on time.

1055
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,870
I have something to ask the two of you.

1056
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,140
I've said this before,

1057
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,990
but if we're going to reopen the case,

1058
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,830
the standard procedure requires me
to do this again.

1059
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,390
Sure. Go ahead.

1060
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,830
Please be honest with me.

1061
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:19,220
Have you ever discharged wastewater

1062
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,740
just like what they suspected you of?

1063
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,430
This...

1064
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,950
We didn't.

1065
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,830
The Wanjia Group is an established group.

1066
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,220
We wouldn't care about
earning that little profit,

1067
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,030
right?

1068
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,540
We don't need to save that small amount of cost.

1069
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,030
That's good.

1070
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,260
After all, many companies these days

1071
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,260
are doing this.

1072
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,950
It's really not a big deal.

1073
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,390
That's right. I'm just really unlucky

1074
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,620
to have run into He Xingfu, the troublemaker.

1075
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,700
She just won't let me go.

1076
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,580
Sorry, Ms. He.

1077
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,220
I forgot she's your sister.

1078
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,430
However, Ms. He,

1079
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,430
do you think you can tell your sister

1080
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,180
to stay out of others' businesses?

1081
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,540
What does the Shuiwei Village

1082
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,700
have anything to do with her?

1083
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,260
There's no need to side with the outsiders, right?

1084
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,390
What's in it for her?

1085
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,620
That's how my sister is.

1086
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,790
She always stands up for justice.

1087
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,580
She won't listen to me

1088
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,790
even if I am to talk to her.

1089
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:36,030
Mediation is part of our duties.

1090
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,620
Mr. Mo, don't worry.

1091
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,350
Ms. He will do her best to mediate the issue.

1092
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,350
You can also talk to the people

1093
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,950
and try to resolve the dispute out of court.

1094
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,910
The troublemakers will back off
once they run into difficulties.

1095
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,700
It's best if we can avoid the lawsuit.

1096
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,510
After all, you're from the same village,

1097
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,060
right?

1098
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,990
Peace is the greatest good.

1099
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,700
I got it.

1100
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,060
Of course,

1101
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,580
if we can't avoid the lawsuit,

1102
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,700
as your company's legal counsel,

1103
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,740
we'll definitely do our best to win it.

1104
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:11,060
But let me give you a heads-up.

1105
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,950
I don't want to learn anything new

1106
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,830
in the midst of the lawsuit.

1107
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,430
I don't want it

1108
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,260
to ruin our plan.

1109
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,540
It won't happen.

1110
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,350
Alright. Let's get to work.

1111
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,140
I need you to talk to your staff.

1112
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,390
We might need to get some relevant documents.

1113
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,510
Sure.

1114
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,740
He, I'm afraid that you might need to stay here
in the coming few days

1115
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,830
to sort out the documents.

1116
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,510
Why don't you stay at home for a few days?

1117
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,310
It's near to the office
and it'll be easy for you to travel to work.

1118
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:49,870
On top of that,

1119
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,100
you can meet up with your sister

1120
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:53,830
and talk to her.

1121
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,620
Tell her to stay out of others' businesses.

1122
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,580
Ms. He.

1123
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,220
Please talk to your sister.

1124
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,180
Tell her not to meddle in others' affairs.

1125
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,580
It won't do her any good.
