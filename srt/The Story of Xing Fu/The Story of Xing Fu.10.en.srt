[The Story of Xing Fu]

2
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,950
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,040
Senior.

4
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,920
How was it?

5
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,280
Have you got yourself a case yet?

6
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,719
That's impossible.

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,439
I'm a fresh graduate

8
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,640
who just joined the company.

9
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm working as Mr. Han's assistant too.

10
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,040
I have to run his errands for him every day.

11
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,719
I don't have time to find cases.

12
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,239
Well,

13
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,959
since I'm doing this for him,

14
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,879
do you think

15
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,280
he'll split the commission with me?

16
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,239
You want his money?
It's easier for you to give up.

17
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,480
Come on, I'll do yours first.

18
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,560
Thank you.

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,640
Don't mention it.

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,799
Tell me then. I'm a fresh graduate,

21
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,959
and I have no idea where to start.

22
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,719
Where can I get my own cases?

23
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,240
Don't be impatient.

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,800
Everyone has to go through the same phase.

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,479
Can you spare some time?

26
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,199
Why don't you join me for my cases?

27
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,240
I'll share my commission with you

28
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,360
according to your workload.

29
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,280
Thank you.

30
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,759
I appreciate the thought.

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,800
However, I cannot agree.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,479
After all, I have to get my own cases.

33
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,680
Besides, if Mr. Han hears about this,

34
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,879
I'm sure he'll be upset.

35
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,560
You're very ambitious.

36
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,599
It'll be fine.

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,800
Getting your client source

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,400
is just like shooting a three-pointer.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,199
It's not that easy.

40
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,319
However, once you score one,

41
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,400
you'll get three points.

42
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,439
Who knows? Maybe you'll score one tomorrow.

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,560
He,

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,319
were you chatting during work hours?

45
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,280
No, I wasn't.

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,919
I just

47
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,319
had some questions for Mr. Guan
regarding certain laws.

48
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,800
You're asking Guan questions

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
when I'm your mentor?

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,199
Are you looking down on me now?

51
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,120
That's not it.

52
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,879
Of course not.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
I was just...

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,039
We have a client to handle.

55
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,639
Follow me.

56
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,400
Senior, see you later.

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,479
I'll leave them on your desk later.

58
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,800
Thanks, Senior.

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,439
No worries.

60
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,319
Were you looking for me?

61
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,199
You must be Mr. Han.

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,479
I'm here to seek your advice.

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,639
Have you made an appointment?

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,280
Appointment?

65
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,599
I came here right after they told me your name.

66
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
So, she came because of my reputation.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,319
Is it okay?

68
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,240
Please have a seat.

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,120
Madam,

70
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,039
what do you need my help for?

71
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,319
A divorce.

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,039
A divorce?

73
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,080
Do you know how old you are?

74
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
You want to get a divorce now?

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,960
You should just forget it.

76
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,879
It's not for me.

77
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,520
It's for my daughter.

78
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,800
Why isn't your daughter here then?

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,199
My daughter, she...

80
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,479
It's like this.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,719
Madam,

82
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,560
we're lawyers,

83
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,800
not vets.

84
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,319
We can't solve every issue for you.

85
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,000
And lawyers are usually
classified into different categories.

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
A lawyer of my rank

87
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,439
only deals with non-law cases.

88
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,199
For example, cases concerning
intellectual property,

89
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,639
legal counsel,

90
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,000
contract review, and so on.

91
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,120
It's been a long time

92
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,680
since I've handled a divorce case.

93
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,199
What about this?

94
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,959
Next time, ask your daughter
to come here personally.

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,439
The receptionist will arrange a lawyer for her.

96
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,959
You see, I'm busy.

97
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,639
I'll make a move first.

98
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,680
He,

99
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,480
see her off.

100
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,800
Mr. Han.

101
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,519
You're leaving already?

102
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,800
-Madam!
-I'm not done yet!

103
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,199
Madam!

104
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,160
What is he doing?

105
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,120
Madam, calm down.

106
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,720
Please...

107
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
How can I calm down?

108
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,560
He left before I finished

109
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,199
my words!

110
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,360
He's looking down on me!

111
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,720
Wait, madam.

112
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,959
Why did I look for him in the first place?

113
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,240
Mr. Han is truly occupied!

114
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,480
He's truly busy with something.

115
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,439
Please wait here for now.

116
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,040
Please have a seat.

117
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,920
I'll get you some water.

118
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,360
Calm down, okay?

119
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,680
Two other people are waiting for him inside.

120
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
He's truly busy.

121
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,839
You can tell me about it for now.

122
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,360
He's busy?

123
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,279
Yes, that's right.

124
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,519
He's busy.

125
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,680
But

126
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,560
he didn't even let me finish my words.

127
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,439
Calm down. Have some water.

128
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,839
You can tell me about it.

129
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,199
Are you a lawyer as well?

130
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,079
I'm a student of Mr. Han.

131
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,360
I'm a trainee.

132
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,240
But it's the same if you tell me about it.

133
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,920
I can pass the message to him.

134
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:38,959
Alright.

135
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,439
I'll tell you then.

136
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,759
It's like this.

137
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,040
My daughter

138
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,800
is really unfortunate.

139
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,839
Ever since she got married to Ding Dahua,

140
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,680
she has never lived in peace,

141
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,600
not even one day.

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,399
My daughter didn't complain

143
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,720
and stayed by his side

144
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,160
when he was still a nobody.

145
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,079
After that, he was imprisoned.

146
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,439
He was sent to prison.

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,800
My daughter

148
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,600
has to serve his parents
and take care of their children.

149
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,439
It was tough.

150
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,399
However,

151
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,040
now that he has made it rich,

152
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,000
he's trying to chase my daughter out of the family

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
without any recompenses!

154
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,240
He's going to let the vixen

155
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,800
inherit all of his assets!

156
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,319
How could he do such a thing?

157
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,279
He's inhumane!

158
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,240
Madam,

159
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,839
I have a question.

160
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,000
The Ding Dahua you mentioned just now,

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,319
is he the chairman of Dahua Group?

162
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,879
Who else

163
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
but him?

164
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,519
Madam,

165
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,120
don't worry.

166
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,879
Regarding your daughter's case,

167
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,920
we will surely uphold justice for her.

168
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,720
Now, I'll get a lawyer

169
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,279
who's good at these kinds of cases for you.

170
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,360
Is that okay with you?

171
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,279
Girl,

172
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,600
how can I thank you for your kind service?

173
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,759
Don't mention it, madam.

174
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,439
Don't worry. Just wait here.

175
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,600
I'll bring him here.

176
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,240
Okay.

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,519
Calm down, okay?

178
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,040
Guan,

179
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,759
the mother-in-law of Ding Dahua,

180
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,319
chairman of Dahua Group, is here.

181
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,800
She said Ding Dahua had an affair

182
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,600
and he's trying to kick his wife out of the house.

183
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,319
You should check it out.

184
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,740
Give me a second.

185
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,660
My goodness.

186
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,020
Dahua Group's net worth

187
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,260
is over 2 billion yuan now.

188
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,060
This will be a huge case.

189
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,580
Xingyun,

190
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,620
this is your opportunity
to score a three-pointer.

191
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,180
Go now.

192
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,300
It's our opportunity.

193
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,820
Mr. Han said he's not handling this case.

194
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,660
Let's handle it together.

195
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,460
Hurry, the old lady is waiting for us.

196
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,900
Madam,

197
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,460
this is our senior lawyer.

198
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,900
His name is Guan Tao.

199
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,820
He specializes in divorce cases.

200
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,860
Hello, madam.

201
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,220
Mr. Guan,

202
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,900
sorry for the trouble.

203
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,780
It's my duty.

204
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,580
Please have a seat.

205
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,900
Please have a seat.

206
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,020
Sit down.

207
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,700
Mr. Guan,

208
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,980
This madam feels very dear to me.

209
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,740
And she didn't tell her daughter

210
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,820
that she was coming today

211
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,340
for an inquiry.

212
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,940
Can we not charge her

213
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,660
for this inquiry?

214
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,220
According to the rules,

215
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,740
we have to charge her.

216
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,820
Charge me then.

217
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,340
I don't lack the money.

218
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,260
Madam, it's not about the money.

219
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,460
Mainly, if we take your money,

220
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,460
it's as if

221
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,300
we must handle your case for you.

222
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,500
However, you'll be in a difficult spot

223
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,020
if your daughter doesn't agree with you

224
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,380
after this.

225
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,260
Mr. Guan.

226
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,940
Xingyun,

227
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,980
keep this a secret from the others.

228
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,700
This is just a normal conversation between us.

229
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,860
We're just chatting with each other.

230
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,620
I won't charge you.

231
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,420
Thank you.

232
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,580
You see, lawyers

233
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,260
shouldn't be money-grubbers.

234
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,380
Madam, can you

235
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,100
describe the situation to me?

236
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,580
Of course.

237
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,820
I'm lucky enough

238
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,740
to meet two good Samaritans today.

239
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,020
This is my contact number.

240
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,940
Please discuss it with your daughter after this.

241
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,660
You may come to me if there's any problem.

242
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,020
Alright.

243
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,540
Girl,

244
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180
I'll tell my daughter

245
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,900
that I'm leaving the case to you and Mr. Guan

246
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,300
after I reach home.

247
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,420
Madam, we will do our best

248
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,100
to defend your daughter's rights.

249
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,740
Alright.

250
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,820
My ride is here.

251
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,740
Madam, take care.

252
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,660
Goodbye, madam. Remember to keep in touch.

253
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,620
You may go now.

254
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,460
Senior,

255
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,860
can I talk to you about the case?

256
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,380
How did it go?

257
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,620
I think it'll be fine.

258
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,580
Madam said she'd tell her daughter

259
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,500
that she'd be leaving the case to us

260
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,900
after she reached home.

261
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,860
Can we take her words seriously?

262
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,500
Didn't hear what she said just now?

263
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,380
Her daughter is a nose of wax.

264
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,380
She listens to her mother for everything.

265
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,940
That's why her mother was the one
who made the inquiry.

266
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,060
So,

267
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,500
as long as she has designated us
to handle the case for her,

268
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,020
I'm sure her daughter will be fine with it.

269
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,180
Alright. This is pretty good.

270
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,340
But now,

271
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,660
there's another problem.

272
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,460
What is it?

273
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,340
It's Han.

274
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,620
What's wrong with him?

275
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,780
You're still a trainee.

276
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,380
You cannot handle cases alone.

277
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,540
I'm not handling it alone.

278
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,060
Senior, we're handling this together, aren't we?

279
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,940
But he's your mentor, not me.

280
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,740
He said he no longer deals with divorce cases.

281
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,380
It's because he didn't know

282
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,140
that the old lady is Ding Dahua's mother-in-law.

283
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,380
What should we do then?

284
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,980
Senior, what did you do as a trainee

285
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,820
when you encountered the same thing?

286
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,300
From my experience,

287
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,660
there are two methods.

288
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,100
First,

289
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,340
you can insist on handling the case.

290
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,540
At most, he'll fall out with you.

291
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,660
However, he might not
hire you as an official employee

292
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,460
after one year. That's the price you have to pay.

293
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,860
Just like what happened to me back then.

294
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,180
Second,

295
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,340
you have to let him exploit you
and claim your credits willingly

296
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,980
at least for the rest of the year.

297
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,180
So, according to the first method,

298
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,900
if I insist on handling this case,

299
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,140
does that mean I don't need
to handle the case together with him?

300
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,140
If you insist on handling this case,

301
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,460
he cannot do anything about it.

302
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,460
Didn't I tell you already?

303
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,940
At most, he won't hire you
as an official employee as scheduled.

304
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,180
If so, how did you become
an official employee here?

305
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,700
Back then, I had the goods on him.

306
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,460
I was lucky back then.

307
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,340
I found out by accident

308
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,820
that he was handling a case for a defendant

309
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,860
while tipping off the plaintiff.

310
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,900
That's why he didn't dare to do anything to me.

311
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,860
But it's different for you.

312
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,740
Xingyun,

313
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,660
let me put it this way.

314
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,980
We joined this law firm

315
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,860
because of our love for the occupation.

316
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,380
We're not here to please certain individuals.

317
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,780
That's why we don't need to put ourselves
under the constraint of a petty man.

318
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,220
However, isn't it too huge of a price for me to pay

319
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,340
to sacrifice my chance
to become an official employee here?

320
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,940
That's why

321
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,820
you have to weigh the pros and cons yourself.

322
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,260
Why don't I

323
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,140
notify him for now?

324
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,740
Think about it.

325
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,700
We need his stamp

326
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,980
in order to initiate the case.

327
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,140
That means

328
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,380
we cannot avoid him no matter what we do.

329
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:02,940
It's fine.

330
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,620
You don't need to be too concerned about me

331
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,860
no matter what decision you make.

332
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,620
I will still have cases no matter what.

333
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,060
I'm just afraid

334
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,300
that you might not

335
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,820
get to handle this case

336
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,540
if he hears about this.

337
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,300
Look at you.

338
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,420
You're throwing a tantrum again.

339
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,820
I'm responsible

340
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,900
for training all the trainees, aren't I?

341
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,220
Besides,

342
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,940
how could a girl from the countryside like her
compare with you?

343
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,020
Am I right?

344
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,540
You'll be sullying our pure relationship

345
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,140
if you keep worrying

346
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,700
about her for nothing.

347
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,100
Come in.

348
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,820
Mr. Han,

349
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,140
do you have time?

350
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,740
I have something to report to you.

351
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,420
What kind of important matter is it?

352
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,820
It's your first time
being this respectful toward me

353
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,860
after you joined our company as a trainee.

354
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,540
So, Mr. Han, can I make the report now?

355
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,740
Speak. What is it?

356
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,100
That old lady you saw this morning,

357
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,300
she's the mother-in-law of Ding Dahua,

358
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,620
the chairman of Dahua Group.

359
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,380
Ding Dahua had an affair,

360
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,860
and he wants to kick his wife out of the house.

361
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,060
He's planning to transfer his assets away.

362
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,980
His mother-in-law
wants her daughter to divorce him.

363
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,020
Mr. Han,

364
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,780
Dahua Group's net worth

365
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,340
is over 2 billion yuan right now.

366
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,460
What did I tell you again?

367
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,620
Youngsters like you
have to gather more experience.

368
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,300
Look. You became

369
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,620
much smarter

370
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,820
after I allowed you to engage with our client.

371
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,100
Hurry

372
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,300
and organize the case details for me.

373
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,740
Put them on my desk, okay?

374
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,580
Mr. Han,

375
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,420
no matter what,

376
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,100
I was the one who persuaded the old lady to stay.

377
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,620
Do you think

378
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,540
I can handle the case together with you?

379
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,460
Alright. I'll consider it.

380
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,140
Send me her contact number first.

381
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,700
Okay?

382
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,900
If so, Mr. Han,

383
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,380
it's a promise then.

384
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,780
He,

385
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,380
the old lady only came here

386
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,700
because of my reputation,

387
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,220
am I right?

388
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,820
You saw it for yourself.

389
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,020
As a trainee under me,

390
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,660
I just arranged for you to engage our client

391
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,820
to understand the situation.

392
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,980
Isn't that part of your duty?

393
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,740
Why are you trying
to negotiate a deal with me right now?

394
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,260
Mr. Han, I don't dare to negotiate a deal with you.

395
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,620
You see,

396
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,980
I just joined this industry not long ago.

397
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,700
It's quite difficult for me to get a case.

398
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,220
I just hope that you can
bring me along for this case.

399
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,620
Alright.

400
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,620
I'll think about it.

401
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,220
You should hurry and organize
the case details first.

402
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,660
Thank you, Mr. Han.

403
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,700
Dahua?

404
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,020
How's Qinglai?

405
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,020
Qinglai is still recuperating.

406
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,460
Dad is the one who's working in the fields now.

407
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,300
If so, that means

408
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,700
you're the head of the family now.

409
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,180
That's not true.

410
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,900
I'm just an errand girl.

411
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,780
My in-laws

412
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,460
still make the call here.

413
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,740
You're being too modest here.

414
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,980
I don't think your in-laws
will report me to the police station

415
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,340
if they were the ones in charge here.

416
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,500
Here.

417
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,820
Officer Li said

418
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,860
that I have to compensate you guys

419
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,820
with 1,000 yuan.

420
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,100
You guys can total up Qinglai's medical bill.

421
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,940
You can come and retrieve
the money from me in a few days.

422
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,700
Let that be the end of it.

423
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,660
When you head back,

424
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,500
you should tell Qinglai

425
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,020
to learn from Youde

426
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,140
and be an honest person.

427
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,340
Everyone loves money.

428
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,580
However, you should make them
with your own abilities.

429
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,260
You shouldn't cheat people of their money,

430
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:17,820
Am I right?

431
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,340
Moreover, this is the company's money.

432
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,860
It belongs to the state.

433
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,900
Mr. Wan,

434
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,620
please make yourself clear.

435
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,980
Who's cheating the company here?

436
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,580
Isn't it clear enough?

437
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,260
Qinglai

438
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,780
came to my office

439
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,020
and created a ruckus

440
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,100
so that he could get the money.

441
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,740
Why do you think I kicked him in the first place?

442
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,740
Mr. Wan,

443
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,420
Qinglai didn't create a commotion
for no good reason.

444
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,900
Yes.

445
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,860
The Group did compensate us.

446
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,020
But we haven't included

447
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,060
the time and effort we had spent

448
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,460
planting the crops

449
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,460
and building the greenhouses.

450
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,180
We accepted our fate.

451
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,740
But when it implicated the dealer,

452
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,180
he asked us for 60,000 yuan as compensation.

453
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,300
Where do we get that amount of money?

454
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,420
That's why we asked the Group for money.

455
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,900
You and Qinglai are a perfect match indeed.

456
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,340
Both of you are cunning and devious.

457
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,780
Fine. You want to make things clear?

458
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,260
Let's make things clear, alright?

459
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,780
70,000 yuan.

460
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,020
You claimed 70,000 yuan
without an official invoice.

461
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,020
Am I right?

462
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,140
I believed in your family

463
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,580
because Youde was an honest man.

464
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
You didn't have an official invoice.

465
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,540
Let's forget about how difficult it was
for the Group

466
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,740
to compensate you without any invoices.

467
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,940
But you just had to push your luck!

468
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,700
Now, you want another 60,000 yuan?

469
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,620
You said the dealer wanted 60,000 yuan from you.

470
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,820
And I have to give you the money.

471
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,820
So, should I fork out the money too
if the dealer says

472
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,900
he wants 600,000 yuan from you?

473
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,660
You better be clear about this.

474
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,580
That's not my money.

475
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,620
It belongs to the Group.

476
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,580
It belongs to the state!

477
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,460
It belongs to the villagers of Wan Village!

478
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,340
I have to consider the villagers' benefits!

479
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,420
Yeah, I know you have to consider their benefits.

480
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,460
Aren't we a part of them too?

481
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,060
Who will consider our benefits then?

482
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,860
The state declared that they wanted
official invoices out of nowhere.

483
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,620
How should we know

484
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,220
we need to get official invoices beforehand?

485
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,140
For the past few years,

486
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,380
the central government has been paying

487
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,620
great attention to the issues
of agriculture, farmer, and rural area.

488
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,900
Their most basic principle

489
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,740
was to make sure that farmers weren't exploited.

490
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,220
Since you're exploiting us,

491
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,900
that means we can have the land to ourselves too.

492
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,300
Did I exploit you guys?

493
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,420
Did I give you guys a single cent less?

494
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,620
But now, you're saying
you don't want to give us the land?

495
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,220
Listen up!

496
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,460
The nation has its own policies,

497
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,940
and I have my own conscience!

498
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,260
This project was finally implemented
after much effort.

499
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,580
This project will be initiated soon.

500
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,820
This factory concerns the future,

501
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,900
the reputation,

502
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,380
and the benefits of Wan Village!

503
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,500
No one shall mess this up!

504
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,700
If anyone messes this up,
that means they'll be going against me!

505
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,300
That means they're going against Wan Group!

506
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,020
And that means they're going against
the entire Wan Village!

507
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,940
You make the call here, right?

508
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,740
Listen up.

509
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,740
You better hurry back.

510
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,500
You shall face the consequences

511
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,620
if the factory's construction is delayed!

512
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
Take your money and leave.

513
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,300
Mr. Wan!

514
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,420
We won't take your stupid money.

515
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,340
Why must you make a mess out of this?

516
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,780
Why did you talk back to Mr. Wan?

517
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,180
Just let him say whatever he likes.

518
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,300
I didn't mean to talk back to him.

519
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,620
I just wanted to reason with him.

520
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,860
We're just trying to live our life here,

521
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,020
not to reason with others day in and day out.

522
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,700
There's no need to be clear about everything.

523
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,500
We would've been fine if you acted dumb.

524
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,980
Why did you have to offend him?

525
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,300
You...

526
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,620
What are you trying to do here?

527
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,620
It's all because you added fuel to the fire.

528
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,540
Does it benefit us in any way
by offending Mr. Wan?

529
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,020
What an embarrassment.

530
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,620
Dad, don't be angry.

531
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,380
I can deal with my own affairs.

532
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,420
You can deal with your own affairs?

533
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,220
Things wouldn't have

534
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,140
gotten out of hand in the first place

535
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,380
if you could deal with them.

536
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,940
It's useless

537
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,300
for you to say that.

538
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,140
Xingfu wouldn't need to go back and forth
to deal with things

539
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,540
when she's pregnant if you and your son

540
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,700
aren't useless.

541
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,140
You only act like a tyrant at home.

542
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,140
Must you be so harsh with your words?

543
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,900
What do you mean
by I only act like a tyrant at home?

544
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,620
Dad, where are you going?

545
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,740
Just ignore him.

546
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,380
I think he went to look for Mr. Wan.

547
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,380
They've been friends for many years.

548
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,780
Maybe Mr. Wan will let go of this
on account of their friendship.

549
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,780
I'm not trying to criticize you here.

550
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,940
But you treat them too nicely.

551
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,300
They don't have

552
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,740
a conscience.

553
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,660
They're ingrates.

554
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,140
Idle hands are the devil's tools.

555
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,380
They have too much free time on their hands.

556
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,700
Mr. Wan,

557
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,580
your blood pressure is still quite high.

558
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,460
You need to rest and recuperate

559
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,140
for the next few days.

560
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,620
Take your medicine on time.

561
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,140
Don't be too anxious.

562
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,180
Your bad emotions

563
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,540
will affect your body greatly.

564
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,380
Did you hear that?

565
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,020
Be happy.

566
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,780
You were so infuriated at a little girl like her.

567
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,660
You don't need to go that far.

568
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,500
Just stop talking.

569
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,060
I wouldn't need to worry about all these things

570
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,460
if you were capable enough.

571
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,260
I won't head to the company this afternoon.

572
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,180
I'll rest at home.

573
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,420
Keep an eye on things for me.

574
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,500
Alright.

575
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,500
Okay, rest well.

576
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,100
You'll be fine.

577
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,380
Thank you.

578
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,740
Take good care of Dad.

579
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,060
Chuanjia,

580
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,100
is Mr. Wan at home?

581
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,540
Alright.

582
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,580
Take good care of your father.

583
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,260
Take care.

584
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,860
Mr. Wan?

585
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,340
Mr. Wan.

586
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,500
He's resting.

587
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,620
Mr. Wan,

588
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,780
I brought some fruits here

589
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,300
since I heard that you got sick.

590
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,020
Mr. Wan,

591
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,060
my daughter-in-law was insensible.

592
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,940
Please don't hold it against her.

593
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,340
Women

594
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,100
do act crazy

595
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,420
when they're pregnant.

596
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,620
In addition,

597
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,140
she was panicking

598
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,420
because of Qinglai's condition.

599
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,260
That's why she became so reckless.

600
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,460
Please don't hold it against her.

601
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,020
Your health is more important than hers.

602
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,060
Mr. Wan,

603
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,700
I've been working under you for several decades.

604
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,340
Can you think twice about the compensation

605
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,940
on account of our ties?

606
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,900
Youde,

607
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,380
I think you met him too just now.

608
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,620
Chuanjia just saw the doctor out.

609
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,780
The doctor said my blood pressure

610
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,740
was over 180.

611
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,540
Are you guys trying to attack me in succession

612
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,260
so that I'll die from a heart attack?

613
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,300
Mr. Wan,

614
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,660
please don't say that.

615
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,540
Please don't say that.

616
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
That's not the case.

617
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,060
Regarding the compensation...

618
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,740
Regarding the compensation,

619
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,900
I've explained everything to Qinglai's wife.

620
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,980
There's nothing to discuss.

621
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,900
Since the agreement has been signed,

622
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,180
we'll follow the agreement.

623
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:55,780
Mr. Wan.

624
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,140
Mr. Youde,

625
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,540
Dad had made things clear just now.

626
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,020
You're no longer a young boy.

627
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,500
Why can't you understand what he means?

628
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,020
Dad is sick right now.

629
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,660
Can you please let him rest?

630
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,820
Mr. Wan...

631
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,700
Enough.

632
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,780
You can talk to him next time.

633
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,220
Go now.

634
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,020
He's sleeping.

635
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,020
Alright.

636
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,500
Here.

637
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,060
Take your medicine.

638
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,100
There's no way we can survive!

639
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,740
How can we survive in the future?

640
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,220
Didn't I tell you guys already?

641
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,860
I told you guys not to meddle with it!

642
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,620
You just had to do the opposite!

643
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,740
You just had to meddle with it!

644
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,820
Look at what happened!

645
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,300
We've lost both our land

646
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,700
and money.

647
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,340
Qinglai was injured,

648
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,380
and I was thoroughly embarrassed!

649
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,340
Most importantly, we offended Mr. Wan!

650
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,140
Of all the people to offend,

651
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,940
you just had to offend Mr. Wan!

652
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,460
Did you forget the name of this village?

653
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,860
It's called Wan Village!

654
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,340
You like to argue, don't you?

655
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,220
Go and get our land

656
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,660
and money back from them!

657
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,860
How can we survive in the future?

658
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,140
Hello, Xingyun?

659
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,700
Are you busy lately?

660
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,380
I need your help with something.

661
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,140
Alright.

662
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,500
I'll call you when I reach there.

663
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,260
Okay.

664
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,060
Xingfu,

665
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,180
I think studying does benefit oneself.

666
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,060
Senior, look at this clause.

667
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,580
Is this negotiable?

668
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,540
Qingzhi.

669
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,580
They have

670
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,660
everything in this book.

671
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,100
We have to buy one of these.

672
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,020
Senior, what do you think?

673
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,220
Look.

674
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,220
This case

675
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,620
is pretty troublesome.

676
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,060
It's because you've already signed
the land acquisition

677
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,620
and compensation agreement with the village.

678
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,700
In law,

679
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,580
you guys have already agreed
to the land transfer.

680
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,220
However, you're lucky

681
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,380
that as part of the compensation,

682
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,940
your produce

683
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,420
hasn't been removed yet.

684
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,540
Your vegetables

685
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,060
aren't ripe enough to be harvested yet.

686
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,620
In the future, the produce

687
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,380
can serve as compensation.

688
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
The village is trying to claim the land

689
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,500
according to the government's policy.

690
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,340
Your appeal is perfectly reasonable.

691
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,580
The other party cannot demolish
your farm forcefully

692
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,020
before the other conditions are met.

693
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,100
Does that mean

694
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,260
we still have a chance to win it back?

695
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,100
Guan Tao,

696
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,740
do you think we can win this case?

697
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,820
Xingyun knows this too.

698
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,380
There's no guarantee

699
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,940
that I can win a case.

700
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,940
However, if I do handle this case,

701
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,940
there's an 80% chance that I can win.

702
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,540
That's great.

703
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,540
Xingfu,

704
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,580
did you discuss it with Dad and Mom before coming?

705
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,540
I did.

706
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,540
At first, they were reluctant.

707
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,820
That's why I said I'd come here

708
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,900
to discuss it with you.

709
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,660
However, after listening to Mr. Guan,

710
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,300
I think

711
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,900
I'm more determined to do it.

712
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,740
Let's sign the agreement.

713
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,900
After that, we'll pay you.

714
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,340
You don't need to worry about the fee.

715
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,380
We're friends.

716
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:50,820
However,

717
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,260
you guys need to prepare
an authorization contract for me.

718
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,180
If not, it's illegal.

719
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,940
Well, thank you in advance then.

720
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,740
Don't mention it.

721
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:58,980
If so,

724
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,180
Xingyun and I will return to work first.

Alright, let me see you out.

726
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,860
It's fine.

Let us see you out.

728

I've already footed the bill.

as of now.

755
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,220
I would have let her handle it

756
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,420
if it was an ordinary divorce case.

757

However,

your case is a little complicated.

we can let her give it a try.

Of course not.

It's decided then.

835
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,740
I'll draft up an agreement.

836
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,100
You guys can sign it later.

837
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,860
I'll head to the market and hire someone

838
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,820
to appraise the goat tomorrow.

839
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:40,980
Alright.

840
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:41,660
Head home now.

841
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,540
I'm pretty busy here.

842
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,980
But Officer Li,

843
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,260
that goat was mine all along.

844
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,220
Now, I have to buy it for half the price?

845
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,580
I'm at a disadvantage here.

846
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,380
I bought the goat first.

847
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,260
But you get to buy it for half the price.

848
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,380
I'm the one at a disadvantage here.

849
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,780
That's enough.

850
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,820
You guys have been arguing

851
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,980
the whole morning!

852
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,940
What else do you guys want then?

853
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,740
Enough already.

854
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,220
It's decided then.

855
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,500
You two shouldn't argue or fight

856
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,460
after you head back.

857
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,420
Alright, go now.

858
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,820
Your goat?

859
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,420
Since when did it become yours?

860
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,140
Li,

861
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,540
what's with them?

862
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:21,860
It's just a minor issue.

863
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,220
It's all because of a goat.

864
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Sun Maocai had an extra goat.

865
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,020
Zhang Shan said

866
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,580
the goat was hers.

867
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,220
Sun Maocai insisted on saying
that he bought it in the market.

868
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,540
Actually, people with sharp eyes can tell

869
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,380
that the goat belonged to Zhang Shan.

870
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,900
So, are you heading

871
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,700
to Wanjia Health Products Factory's
groundbreaking ceremony?

872
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,020
I have to go.

873
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,220
I have to go.

874
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,900
Great. Give me a ride.

878
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,700
I'll check out the progress

of the security team.

Alright.

[Wanjia Health Products Factory

883
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,780
Mr. Li.

884
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,620
Mr. Li, you're here.

885
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,980
Great timing. Take a look.

886
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,500
Your seat

887
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,140
is right under the word "ground".

888
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,220
Beside you is our top leader.

889
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,100
Are you satisfied with the position?

890
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,500
Is that so?

891
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,740
You deserve a beating!

892
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,180
Don't try to use me as a joke.

893
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,580
What's wrong, Mr. Li?

894
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,860
Are you here to maintain security today?

895
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,140
No wonder your father still kicks you
from time to time.

896
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,780
You're still joking around at this age.

897
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,940
Where's your father?

898
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,460
He and Cailiang will receive the guests
at the end of the highway.

899
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,140
Wan Village is totally different now.

900
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,780
This square wasn't around

901
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,660
when your father and his workers

902
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,180
harvested ores from the mountains back then.

903
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
I remember that your father
was the head of the village

904
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,060
when they were building this square.

905
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,100
Back then, they...

906
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Enough already.

907
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,300
You're just like my father.

908
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,460
You two keep yapping about the past.

909
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,020
You should talk about the present moment.

910
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,540
What? Does it bore you?

911
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,460
The present moment?

912
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,260
You guys were lucky to be born

913
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,580
in a great era.

914
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,460
You should be grateful.

915
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,700
You have everything.

916
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,860
Although you're considered a farmer,

917
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,940
there's no need to plant crops anymore.

918
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,100
Besides, you don't know how to plant crops.

919
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,980
People should strive to do better, right?

920
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,380
Living conditions are much better nowadays.

921
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,900
No one is planting crops anymore.

922
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,620
You drove an automobile here too, didn't you?

923
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,620
In the past, you guys had to take

924
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,860
three-wheel motorcycles.

925
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,020
They broke down so easily.

926
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,820
When you went after a crook,

927
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,620
you'd have to abandon your bike

928
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,460
if it's an emergency.

929
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,340
You'd have to run after the crook.

930
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,540
Enough already.

931
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,900
Resume your work. Stop chitchatting with me here.

932
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,660
Mr. Li,

933
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,100
I have a serious question for you.

934
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,860
Does my face look swollen?

935
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:27,900
What's wrong?

936
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,500
Is there something wrong with your kidneys?

937
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,380
Last night, I was entertaining a client.

938
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,300
He came all the way from Shanxi.

939
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,980
He insisted on having red wine.

940
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,500
So, I got him two boxes of red wine.

941
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,460
In the end, that coward wanted
to mix his wine with some soda.

942
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,940
He used eight cans of soda
for one bottle of red wine.

943
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,060
I'm sure he was messing around.

944
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,540
I brought 12 bottles of red wine.

945
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,100
Can you imagine the volume of soda I drank?

946
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,100
I feel like

947
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,500
I can't even open my eyes right now.

948
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,140
What a jokester.

949
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,820
Alright, Mr. Li.

950
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,460
I'll stop joking around.

951
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,900
As I'll represent our Wan Village,

952
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,300
I have to wash my face.

953
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,180
You can walk around.

954
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,180
Go now.

955
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,580
You mustn't drink red wine
together with soda in the future.

956
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,940
Kids nowadays.

957
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,540
Zhao.

958
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,180
Come here.

959
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,660
Stay here and monitor the scene.

960
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,180
Call me if anything happens.

961
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,980
What about you?

962
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,740
I'm going to make a return visit.

963
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,260
Call me if anything happens.

964
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,140
Okay.

965
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,740
I'm done arranging them.

966
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,180
It's not tied up properly.

967
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,420
-Should be alright now.
-Is it tight enough?

968
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,140
-The quality is good.
-Is it in the right position?

969
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,860
Our superiors are here!

970
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,180
Our superiors are here!

971
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,780
-Hurry.
-They are here.

972
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,780
The superiors are here.

973
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,740
Hurry.

974
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,660
Coming.

975
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,940
Is anyone home?

976
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,420
Mister, have some water.

977
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,340
Why hasn't the matter been resolved yet?

978
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,060
I thought Shantang
agreed to compensate you guys?

979
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,860
How did the deal fall apart?

980
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,180
We didn't plan to take his money anyway.

981
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,780
We just felt that he went too far.

982
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,220
He was so arrogant.

983
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,660
He thinks he can kick anyone he likes.

984
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,860
That's the only bad thing

985
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,420
about Shantang.

986
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,380
He does the same to Chuanjia too.

987
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,940
He punches him

988
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,060
and kicks him often.

989
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,900
He might not have kicked Qinglai intentionally.

990
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,260
Mister, I understand what you mean.

991
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,620
I know that Mr. Wan didn't do it on purpose.

992
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,340
Even so, we can't just
brush it off like it's a joke.

993
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,740
He's definitely in the wrong for kicking Qinglai.

994
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,900
So, did the deal fall apart because of this issue?

995
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,940
Mainly, it was because of the 60,000 yuan.

996
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,580
My father-in-law went to him after that.

997
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,780
It achieved nothing.

998
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,180
I see.

999
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,500
If so,

1000
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,820
I cannot do anything about it.

1001
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,420
It's not under my jurisdiction.

1002
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,420
That's why we didn't plan on troubling you.

1003
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,700
I've already told my sister about the incident.

1004
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,140
She got a lawyer from the city to help us out.

1005
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,660
A lawyer?

1006
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,220
Are you guys going to file a lawsuit?

1007
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,260
We have no choice but to do so.

1008
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,620
The deal ended up in a stalemate.

1009
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,100
He insisted that he
would not compensate us anymore

1010
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,420
as we have signed the agreement.

1011
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,220
It's 60,000 yuan.

1012
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,540
Where do we get the money?

1013
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,700
Yeah.

1014
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,980
Forget about 60,000 yuan,

1015
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,660
Youde would be heartbroken

1016
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,300
even if it was a mere 600 yuan.

1017
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,540
However,

1018
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,580
going to court isn't a good thing,

1019
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,700
don't you think so?

1020
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,420
You guys are from the same village.

1021
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,580
Didn't you two try to approach Mr. Wan again?

1022
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,020
Both of you are youngsters

1023
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,980
and his juniors.

1024
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,340
You can say something good about him

1025
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,540
and tell him about your bitter reasons.

1026
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,860
Maybe the issue

1027
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,580
would've been resolved by then.

1028
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,980
Am I right? There's no need to file a lawsuit.

1029
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,540
Yeah.

1030
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,740
Actually, Mr. Wan is pretty reasonable

1031
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,340
sometimes.

1032
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,940
You're itching for a beating, aren't you?

1033
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,020
Mr. Li,

1034
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,300
so, according to you,

1035
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,380
there's no need for any rules.

1036
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,380
How could he be in the right
when he kicked my husband?

1037
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,100
We didn't do anything wrong.

1038
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,900
Even the lawyer said

1039
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,100
that they cannot claim our land without reason

1040
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,540
when our contract isn't over yet.

1041
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,460
Anyway, our greenhouses are still there.

1042
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,220
Even if we were to negotiate a deal,

1043
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,940
they should be the ones looking for us.

1044
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,820
We've already prepared
the necessary legal documents.

1045
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,980
If it doesn't work out,
we'll see each other in court.

1046
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,380
We'll accept our fate if we lose the case.

1047
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,340
Fine.

1048
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,060
You guys are better than me.

1049
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,460
My words don't mean anything here.

1050
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,460
Why don't you

1051
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,860
give me another chance?

1052
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,180
I'll talk to Mr. Wan again

1053
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,620
and see if we can resolve this issue peacefully.

1054
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,540
What do you think?

1055
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,700
Actually, that

1056
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,860
was what my dad wanted too.

1057
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,660
But he's just

1058
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,500
too sensitive.

1059
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,260
He's too embarrassed to see them again

1060
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,780
after Chuanjia's wife criticized him.

1061
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,380
Xingfu, what do you think?

1062
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,460
I think we should stick with reasons.

1063
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,580
We can't just let them bully us.
