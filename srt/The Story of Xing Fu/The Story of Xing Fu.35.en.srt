[Episode 35]

3
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,239
Lawyers,

4
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,280
you are finally here.

5
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,079
Look.

6
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,239
These are all the documents on my son's illness.

7
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,719
It's only been slightly over two years

8
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
after the opening
of the health products factory.

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,280
My son has been falling sick after that.

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,719
His temperament changed greatly.

11
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,879
Every now and then, he has headaches,

12
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,959
stomachaches,

13
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,799
and diarrhea.

14
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,159
The hospital gave him drips.

15
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,239
He was okay at times but sick again.

16
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,879
I don't know what to do.

17
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,120
My wife has cancer

18
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,959
and spent more than 400,000 yuan.

19
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
She has had a relapse lately

20
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,959
and needs surgery,

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,640
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,799
Where am I going to get the money?

23
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,560
Now she can only wait to die.

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,599
What can we do?

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
It's been more than five years.

26
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,680
Wait.

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,039
You said she fell sick

28
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,319
five years ago.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,879
When did Wan Village

30
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,319
start the health products factory?

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,639
Three years ago.

32
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,520
Folks,

33
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,800
we are here today

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,639
because of the pollution in Shuiwei Village

35
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,080
caused by the Wan Village's
health products factory

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,080
that has sickened people.

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,159
Therefore,

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,000
if you got sick before the factory
started production,

39
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,719
you would not be

40
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,080
on the consultation list.

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,840
I hope you understand that.

42
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,919
She got worse after the factory started.

43
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,919
Yes.

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,800
Mr. Lawyer,

45
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,159
my kid

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,639
got sick in the last two years.

47
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,280
All of them can testify for me.

48
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,000
This kid

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,039
kept having colds and fevers lately

50
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,080
and complaining about stomachaches.

51
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:15,879
So,

52
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,000
aren't those people from Wan Village

53
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,479
unscrupulous?

54
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,680
They only want to make money.

55
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,479
It's good that you are here now.

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
You must help us

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
get our compensation.

58
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,319
Yes. Make them pay.

59
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,199
Help us.

60
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,680
Folks,

61
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,719
we are

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,960
lawyers.

63
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,639
Like you,

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,240
we don't have

65
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,080
the authority.

66
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,439
Like you,

67
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,800
we also have

68
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,080
a very powerful weapon,

69
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,240
which are laws.

70
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,360
Laws can protect

71
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,639
you and me.

72
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,639
They can also protect your children.

73
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,759
If you have

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,759
legal claims on this issue,

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,159
you can give us the power of attorney.

76
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,680
We can represent you

77
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,039
to file a lawsuit in court.

78
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,840
However,

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,319
sir,

80
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,120
our families

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,599
are not rich.

82
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
I owed a lot of money these few years

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,240
for my kid's treatment.

84
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,840
We do not have the money

85
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,759
to hire you

86
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,759
for the lawsuit.

87
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,560
That's right.

88
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,479
We don't have money.

89
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:15,840
Yes.

90
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't worry about money.

91
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,560
You don't have to pay

92
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,960
until we win the case.

93
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,199
The fee will be five percent

94
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,120
of the compensation.

95
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,000
Folks,

96
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,519
listen.

97
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,480
There is a more worrying

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
matter

99
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,680
than the attorney fee.

100
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,120
We can't guarantee that we will win the lawsuit.

101
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,240
This is about evidence.

102
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
More importantly,

103
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,680
the litigation process is very long.

104
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,079
During this time, many unexpected problems

105
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
can occur.

106
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,519
For example, the other party
may sabotage our lawsuit

107
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
and divide you,

108
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,680
bribe you,

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,399
or threaten you.

110
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,399
As lawyers,

111
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,399
we are afraid that the litigants

112
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,800
may secretly take bribes

113
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,079
without the lawyers' knowledge.

114
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,199
That will

115
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,160
seriously undermine

116
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,720
the lawsuit.

117
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,759
If that happens,

118
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,279
we can't fight for the best interest

119
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,519
of our litigants.

120
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,480
Folks,

121
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,240
a lawsuit

122
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,279
isn't child's play.

123
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,000
It isn't something you can take lightly.

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,639
After you've thought it through,

125
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:18,680
we'll

126
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,800
help you in the court of law.

127
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,319
If you're hesitant,

128
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,120
then I suggest

129
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
that you don't file first.

130
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,480
Do you understand?

131
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,560
Lawyers,

132
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
I wish to state my position.

133
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,040
I definitely want to file the lawsuit.

134
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,680
I'll persevere.

135
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,120
I wish to state my position too.

136
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,240
They've hurt my child.

137
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,800
I have nowhere to retreat.

138
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,040
Sir,

139
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,399
just handle the case.

140
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,360
It's not something that I can just handle.

141
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:51,920
Let us

142
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,279
discuss this.

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,560
Please give us a moment.

144
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,319
What do you think?

145
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,959
Should we sign?

146
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,879
If we want to sign,

147
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,199
we should call Qin

148
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,519
to draw up an agreement and send it to us
as soon as possible.

149
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,519
I think we shouldn't rush it

150
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,879
as if we have motives.

151
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,000
After all, such a lawsuit is a thankless job.

152
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,120
What about you?

153
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,240
I think so too.

154
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,600
Mainly, I think

155
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,959
we should give them some time.

156
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,480
Let them go back, think about it,

157
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,240
and discuss with their families

158
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
before

159
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,360
deciding.

160
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,639
Okay.

161
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,639
We'll wait and see.

162
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:27,839
Folks,

163
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,360
thank you for trusting us.

164
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,279
Well,

165
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,759
everyone should go back and think about it.

166
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,879
Discuss with your family members.

167
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,199
After that,

168
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,000
we can sign the proxy agreement.

169
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,920
Okay?

170
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,199
Okay.

171
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,639
We'll do as you say.

172
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,199
Why is it dragging on?

173
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,959
Poverty must've made them crazy.

174
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,319
They got lawyers.

175
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,800
What do they want?

176
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,079
What do you think?

177
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,519
You're the general manager.

178
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,000
You should know.

179
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,079
Look.

180
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,120
I'm busy every day.

181
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Busy doing what?

182
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,279
Are you as busy as me?

183
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
You were busy giving me trouble.

184
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,319
Well,

185
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,000
is the equipment always on?

186
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,199
Yes.

187
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,800
Mo, let me tell you.

188
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,319
This is a big deal.

189
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,600
Don't you try to fool me.

190
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,000
Mr. Wan,

191
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,959
don't worry. It's switched on.

192
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,120
Okay.

193
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,079
I heard they got
the Ministry of Ecology and Environment

194
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,720
to do a water assessment.

195
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,199
The Ministry?

196
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,399
Even if the water is bad,

197
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,800
we have nothing to do with it.

198
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,240
They want a big company to pay.

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Ignore them.

200
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,319
I want to do that,

201
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,040
but I'm worried.

202
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,959
I heard that many families

203
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,920
have fallen sick.

204
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,519
They want a lawsuit against us.

205
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,360
We should get ready.

206
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,279
I'll call the lawyer.

207
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,560
Who?

208
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,680
He Xingyun.

209
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,439
Don't.

210
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,079
I think

211
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,000
you should call

212
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
Mr. Han about this issue.

213
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,759
Ms. He

214
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,360
only cites legal articles

215
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,240
and always lectures me about laws.

216
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
She is annoying.

217
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,519
Mr. Han

218
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,160
is more experienced.

219
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,639
I think

220
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,800
you should discuss it with him.

221
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:39,000
Mr. Han,

222
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,279
I need your consultation.

223
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,759
It isn't that complicated.

224
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:54,799
Mr. Wan,

225
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,559
isn't Ms. He your legal counsel?

226
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,960
Why don't you ask her?

227
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,320
It stands to reason that she should

228
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,279
provide legal consultation services.

229
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,600
Okay. Let's drop the pretension.

230
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,480
I still want you to take care of this.

231
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,240
How about this?

232
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,360
Drop by here.

233
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,120
Let's meet and talk in detail.

234
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,480
Okay. No problem.

235
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,639
I'll arrange it.

236
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,200
Ms. He and I will go there as soon as possible.

237
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
As soon as possible.

238
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,080
Yes.

239
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,559
We more or less understand the situation.

240
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,279
Mr. Wan and Mr. Mo,

241
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,279
presently

242
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
our country

243
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
always attaches importance

244
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,759
to environmental protection issues.

245
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,679
Some judicial documents
were promulgated recently

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,320
that repeatedly emphasized this.

247
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:48,799
Yes, He,

248
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,360
explain the relevant legal provisions

249
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,120
to them.

250
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,039
Keep it simple.

251
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,519
It's like this.

252
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,000
First,

253
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
the "Tort Law of the People's Republic of China"

254
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,039
took effect in 2010.

255
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,679
Article 66 stipulates

256
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,120
that for disputes arising
from pollution of the environment,

257
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,440
the polluter shall bear the burden of providing

258
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,559
non-liability or diminished liability
in accordance with the provisions

259
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,639
of the law and the non-existence

260
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,320
of a causal relationship between

261
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,720
their actions and the damage.

262
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,639
In 2015,

263
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,840
in the "Interpretation of

264
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,360
the Supreme People's Court
of Several Issues on the Application of Law

265
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,639
in the Trial of Disputes
over Liability for Environmental Torts",

266
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,879
Article One states

267
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,799
that in the damages
caused by environmental pollution,

268
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,759
whether or not the polluter is at fault,

269
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,320
the polluter shall bear the tort liability.

270
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,120
If the polluter complies with the state or local

271
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,399
pollution discharge standards

272
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,919
and claims no responsibility,

273
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,159
the people's court won't support it.

274
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,759
Therefore,

275
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:45,480
it is very hard to fight a pollution lawsuit.

276
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,960
I think

277
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,000
if we can persuade people,

278
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,279
try your best not to take it to court.

279
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,919
If you have to,

280
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,840
don't make it a class action.

281
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,679
After all,

282
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,440
with many people getting sick,

283
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,840
a judge might suspect

284
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,440
if it is due to some special reasons.

285
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
Although we have solid evidence,

286
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,879
there still will be negative effects,

287
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,159
especially now that I hear

288
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,399
that Wan Village

289
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,000
is a participant in a national

290
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,039
Entrepreneurship
in Rural Communities Competition.

291
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,320
Correct?

292
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,759
It's better to be cautious
at this critical moment.

293
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,559
If we don't want to take it to court,

294
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,440
we have to do some work.

295
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,120
Pay more compensation.

296
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,480
Pay money to avoid misfortune.

297
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,679
That's the best,

298
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,200
but

299
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,639
we still have to get ready for the lawsuit.

300
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,200
I suggest

301
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,919
you get an environmental
monitoring department

302
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,639
to give the latest water assessment

303
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,480
report.

304
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,360
Get the previous results also.

305
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:51,960
Okay.

306
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,080
In addition, we'll

307
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,840
find the most authoritative experts

308
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,039
to issue an expert opinion

309
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
that the harmful trace factors in the water

310
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,120
will not cause

311
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,559
illnesses.

312
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:04,960
All right?

313
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,200
Mr. Wan

314
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:16,960
and Mr. Mo,

315
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,080
you

316
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,080
should tell us the truth.

317
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,919
Did you

318
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,720
cause the pollution?

319
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,120
Of course not.

320
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,240
The Department of Ecology and Environment
has been carrying out

321
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,840
regular monitoring.

322
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,679
Well...

323
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,720
Afterwards,

324
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,120
make copies of the assessment

325
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,279
reports

326
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,759
and send them over.

327
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,679
Okay.

328
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay.

329
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,919
That's good.

330
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,159
Mom, Dad,

331
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,240
I am home.

332
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,840
You're home.

333
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,639
Little Dou,

334
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,519
what are you drawing?

335
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,440
A pumpkin.

336
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:58,960
Good boy.

337
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,000
Where's Qinglai?

338
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,279
He is not back yet.

339
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,879
Why did you call me?

340
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,080
Where did you go?

341
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,039
You came back so late.

342
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,120
I visited

343
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,320
Liu in Shuiwei Village.

344
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
His carrots

345
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,600
are infected by flea beetles,

346
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,440
or what we normally call scumbags.

347
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,600
It's out of control.

348
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,799
He insisted that I should check it out.

349
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,840
Do you know?

350
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,559
Dad.

351
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,200
Mom.

352
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,120
Did you notice that Qinglai

353
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,919
seemed to be full of beans lately?

354
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,440
He has been in high spirits.

355
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,320
He is proud now.

356
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,879
Yesterday, the County Agricultural Bureau

357
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
sent someone here

358
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,480
to ask about growing vegetables.

359
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,240
When the guy came,

360
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,919
he called him teacher.

361
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,799
Really?

362
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,159
Use this to draw.

363
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,679
This color.

364
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,519
Life is good now.

365
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,759
Everything is fine.

366
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,960
If Xiuyu comes back,

367
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,720
I'll die happy

368
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
tomorrow.

369
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,600
What are you talking about?

370
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,600
That was demoralizing.

371
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,000
This girl

372
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,759
was so obedient in the past.

373
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,519
She is as stubborn as a mule now.

374
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,919
Fly.

375
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:23,879
Slower.

376
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:26,960
Fly, fly, fly.

377
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,840
Come on.

378
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,600
Xingfu.

379
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,919
Later, you should

380
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,919
talk to

381
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,559
Xiuyu.

382
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,399
Can she not talk to her mom and dad forever?

383
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,679
I talked to her.

384
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,279
She won't listen.

385
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,840
She seems like

386
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,960
she can't get over it.

387
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,159
She won't listen at all.

388
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,320
It's like she lost her soul.

389
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,960
I don't know what to say.

390
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,320
It takes time.

391
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,000
Maybe after some time,

392
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,840
she'll be fine.

393
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,360
Come on, raise your arms.

394
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,000
Did you

395
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,360
call Cai?

396
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,799
Yes.

397
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,840
I was about to tell you this.

398
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,559
Let me tell you.

399
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,200
He said

400
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,320
that many supermarkets want to open

401
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,720
organic vegetable counters

402
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,440
but worry that they won't get the supply.

403
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,639
He also told me

404
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,399
that if we can supply them,

405
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,960
sales won't be a problem.

406
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,159
So?

407
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,519
This is a bit frustrating.

408
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,279
We have vegetable buyers and farmers.

409
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,440
We have sales.

410
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,559
Why are you frustrated?

411
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,600
He wants too much.

412
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,799
I can't

413
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,799
just hire people and get it done.

414
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,639
Let's do it together, then.

415
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,279
Maybe I should start a cooperative

416
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,360
to plant vegetables and fruits.

417
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,480
Sure.

418
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,240
Do you think I can do it?

419
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,799
Why not?

420
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,000
I can't manage people.

421
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:07,799
How about

422
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:08,879
you

423
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,639
help me set it up?

424
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,279
I am busy.

425
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,159
I take care of the family, Little Dou,

426
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
the inn,

427
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,039
and the tourism cooperative.

428
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,200
A bunch of messy things.

429
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,600
I'm not free.

430
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,360
Start one yourself.

431
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,120
You have the experience.

432
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,759
Besides, I want to start one

433
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,480
but don't know how to do it.

434
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,559
You can learn.

435
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,039
I can teach you

436
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,260
if you say something

437
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,860
sweet.

438
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,410
See?

439
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,930
You're full of yourself,

440
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,770
aren't you?

441
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,260
What a buzzkill.

442
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,290
Forget it then.

443
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,290
Okay. I'll say it.

444
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,690
Anything sweet that you prefer?

445
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,380
Just something sweet.

446
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,740
Say some sweet things to me.

447
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,650
Something sweet.

448
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,810
I'll take your shoes off.

449
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,460
No.

450
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,570
Don't change the topic.

451
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,570
Talk.

452
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,140
You...

453
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,220
are very capable.

454
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,980
Everybody knows that.

455
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:13,740
Another one.

456
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:14,980
You...

457
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,980
You are the prettiest.

458
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,700
Why are you turning your head?

459
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,570
Look into my eyes!

460
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:24,900
Say it.

461
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,810
You're the prettiest.

462
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,220
No. That's boring.

463
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,330
Little Dou.

464
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,500
Show your dad.

465
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,980
Mom, I love you.

466
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,460
Look, you're not as good as your son.

467
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,130
You might as well learn from him.

468
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,290
After that, I'll teach you.

469
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,180
Don't you love your dad?

470
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,090
Do you love your daddy?

471
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,610
Tell me. Do you love your daddy?

472
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,740
No.

473
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,020
You won't say it?

474
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,370
Do you want to do this?

475
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,900
Kiss your daddy and I'll know

476
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,570
if you love me.

477
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,330
Cut it out.

478
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,420
Kiss me.

479
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,020
Come on.

480
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,130
Seriously! You two!

481
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,610
Do you want to learn or not?

482
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,130
Yes, I'm bringing you your slippers.

483
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,900
I love you.

484
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,260
Liar.

485
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,500
What?

486
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,330
Just kidding.

487
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,420
Let's go.

488
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,610
Why did Wanjia Group

489
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,900
ask us to come again?

490
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,660
Why else?

491
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,850
Isn't it about the merger?

492
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,260
[Wan Village Professional Tourism Cooperative]
Add a guardrail.

493
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,940
We'll have more tourists

494
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,020
in the future.

495
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,020
This isn't safe.

496
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,020
Ms. He, are you leaving?

497
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,500
Ms. He! Ms. He!

498
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,420
Add it.

499
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,020
Yes? Okay.

500
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,130
Talk later.

501
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,330
I want to talk to you.

502
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,180
What's up?

503
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,740
Gang's mother stole my guests.

504
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,570
Can you intervene?

505
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,530
What do you mean by stealing?

506
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,900
Their house is at the village entrance.

507
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,610
My guest happened to pass by.

508
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,900
She stopped the guest

509
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,900
and took him home.

510
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,330
The guest

511
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,740
booked our room online.

512
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,700
He canceled his booking

513
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,900
after touring her house.

514
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,130
We should help each other in the village.

515
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,050
How can we undermine each other?

516
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,900
Exactly.

517
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,980
Don't fight with each other.

518
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,020
If this gets out,

519
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,610
others will say we have bad customs.

520
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,610
I know, right?

521
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,020
Can you talk to her

522
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,660
on my behalf?

523
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:36,850
Yes.

524
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,260
She only listens to you.

525
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,530
Okay. I'll talk to her.

526
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,220
I can't argue with her.

527
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,220
She'll win.

528
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,810
Remember this.

529
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,290
Okay.

530
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:43,900
Don't forget.

531
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,290
What's wrong with her!

532
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,850
Ms. He.

533
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,370
Your courier.

534
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,980
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

535

[Water Assessment Report]

536
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,020
Please come in.

537
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,610
Yanping.

538
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,900
Mr. Li.

539
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,700
Come on.

540
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,330
Please sit.

541
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,330
Thank you.

542
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,180
Mr. Li.

543
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,330
How are you?

544
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,090
-Mr. Li.
-Hello.

545
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,770
Mr. Mo, make two cups of good tea.

546
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,460
Okay.

547
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,700
Mr. Li.

548
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,090
Yesterday, my father

549
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,900
lectured me on politics

550
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,610
and contrasted past misery
with present happiness.

551
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,940
Here.

552
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,980
Here, sirs.

553
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,090
Here. Drink as we chat.

554
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:00,740
Thanks, thanks.

555
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,980
Here. Excuse me.

556
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,050
He said

557
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,940
that when he started his business,

558
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,740
you helped him a lot.

559
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,530
So,

560
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,130
he still remembers.

561
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,460
Mr. Mo,

562
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,370
you are not from here

563
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,090
and don't know.

564
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,050
Whenever his father

565
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,290
delivered stones those years,

566
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,940
along the way he'd visit my place

567
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,610
to rest and eat.

568
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,260
Yes. Yes.

569
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,220
Yes.

570
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,570
So,

571
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,500
at the village committee,

572
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,500
when he saw

573
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,050
the merger plan of the two villages,

574
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,460
he was very dissatisfied.

575
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:39,460
You see.

576
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,570
He criticized me sternly at the meeting.

577
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,050
He said

578
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,530
that I make trouble and have selfish

579
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
sectionalism.

580
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,460
He said that since the two villages
will be merged,

581
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,460
we'll become a village.

582
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,700
Why should we have grades?

583
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,850
We can't do that.

584
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,020
Governing and blazing trails

585
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,570
are different things.

586
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,420
We should follow the correct order.

587
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,530
Well...

588
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,530
We know the rules.

589
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,420
Yes.

590
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,290
Mr. Li,

591
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,770
you are my uncle.

592
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,850
Don't slap my face

593
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,260
in front of Mr. Mo.

594
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,850
I am full of youthful vigor

595
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,610
but ignorant.

596
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,770
Don't stoop to my level.

597
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,610
In terms of age,

598
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,020
you are older than me.

599
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,050
Seniority-wise,

600
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,050
you are my uncle.

601
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:20,770
Correct?

602
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,740
A great man is kind and magnanimous.

603
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,770
Let me tell you something practical.

604
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,610
The village committee decided

605
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,660
that your annual salary
as the Group's vice president

606
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,900
will be 100,000 yuan more than mine.

607
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,020
Is that okay?

608
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,420
What?

609
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,610
What 100,000 yuan?

610
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,740
Not 100,000 yuan a year.

611
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,660
It's 100,000 yuan more than me a year.

612
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,180
Whatever my annual salary,

613
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,660
you'll have 100,000 yuan more.

614
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,530
When I get a raise, you get it too.

615
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,090
This...

616
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,940
This is inappropriate. Inappropriate.

617
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,500
How so?

618
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,220
It's appropriate.

619
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:53,940
You see.

620
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,940
The two villages

621
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,740
are merging,

622
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,020
but one is on the mountain
and one at the foothill.

623
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,220
In the future, I'll rely on you

624
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,330
to take overall charge

625
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,900
of Shuiwei Village.

626
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,660
You've been the village leader for many years,

627
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,050
so you enjoy high prestige.

628
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,500
Well.

629
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,220
What about

630
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,940
the village committee?

631
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,530
For the village committee,

632
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,610
it's the same for both villages.

633
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,020
Everyone will have a grade according to

634
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,050
his position and age.

635
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,660
For example, Yanping,

636
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,500
you should receive

637
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,290
200,000 to 300,000 yuan per year.

638
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,530
Really?

639
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,770
Definitely.

640
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,980
What about the villagers?

641
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,570
The two villages, well...

642
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:34,610
Hey,

643
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,740
why did I say

644
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,900
two villages?

645
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,460
We are villagers of one village.

646
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,020
Yes, we will merge and become a family.

647
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,050
Family members are all equal.

648
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,370
We are the same.

649
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,700
In addition to that,

650
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,290
I heard that in our village,

651
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,460
the adults and kids of some families are sick.

652
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,530
Yes.

653
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,570
There is an uproar

654
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,180
over water pollution caused by

655
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,700
the health products factory.

656
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,090
That's right.

657
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,260
Take a look.

658
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,020
This is...?

659
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,810
These are

660
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,090
past water assessment reports

661
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,420
from the time

662
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,570
the health products factory opened until now.

663
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,900
These...

664
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,260
These

665
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,940
all passed.

666
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,370
We thought about it.

667
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,370
Maybe the people's

668
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,570
burdens for medical bills

669
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,740
are too heavy.

670
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:19,980
Right?

671
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,260
So,

672
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,850
the Group gave it some thoughts.

673
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,980
It said that although the villages
have not officially merged,

674
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:26,770
right?

675
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,530
In the humanitarian spirit,

676
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,090
the Group decided

677
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,770
to allocate part of its welfare fund

678
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,420
especially for the medical expenses

679
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,770
of Shuiwei villagers.

680
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,500
Other than reimbursements from
the new rural cooperative medical insurance,

681
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,130
the remaining sum

682
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,570
will be borne by the Group.

683
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,420
Also,

684
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,530
these households

685
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,220
would be given additional
nutrition allowances

686
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,290
and subsidies.

687
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,180
More money for them.

688
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,220
What do you think?

689
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,330
Agreed.

690
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,420
Agreed?

691
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:56,810
Chuanjia,

692
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,460
well...

693
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,130
I...

694
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,940
On behalf of all the villagers
of Shuiwei Village,

695
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,900
especially the sick villagers,

696
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,050
I bow to you.

697
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,020
Please don't, or I'll have to kneel.

698
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,090
You

699
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,500
have accumulated great virtues.

700
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,370
Save one life
than building a seven-storied pagoda.

701
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,500
Great virtues for you.

702
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,740
This is what we should do.

703
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,700
Mr. Li,

704
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,850
if these people

705
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,700
still want to sue us in the future...

706
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,740
No way.

707
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,260
Well,

708
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,130
I'll talk to them when I get back.

709
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,940
They will understand, right?

710
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,090
This is a long-term project.

711
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,420
I'm relieved now.

712
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,610
Sit down and talk.

713
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,330
Sit down.

714
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,330
Tea.

715
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,130
I have enough. No more.

716
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,570
Don't.

717
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,770
Hey, hurry up

718
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,660
and get some desserts, tea, and cakes.

719
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,660
Faster.

720
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,810
I trust you absolutely.

721
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,610
I'm counting on you, Mr. Li.

722
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,980
It's settled.

723
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,500
Okay.

724
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,940
You don't have to see me out.

725
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,370
Okay.

726
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,220
Don't see me out.

727
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,660
Okay, Mr. Mo.

728
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,330
Okay.

729
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:54,570
Goodbye.

730
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,290
Mr. Li.

731
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:55,740
Hey.

732
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,770
Xingfu, you have things to do here?

733
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,050
I am here to see Mr. Wan.

734
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,810
Okay.

735
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,020
Go ahead and talk to him.

736
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,660
Okay.

737
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,260
I'm leaving.

738
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,980
-Bye.
-Take care.

739
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,460
Okay.

740
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,610
Yanping, drive slowly.

741
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,370
Take care.

742
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:06,940
Goodbye.

743
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,660
What's up?

744
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,420
Mr. Wan,

745
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,180
here's the water assessment report.

746
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,610
The Ministry of Ecology and Environment

747
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,020
regularly assesses water quality.

748
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,260
Do you have to assess it?

749
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,460
Did you send this

750
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,370
to get a reimbursement?

751
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,130
What do you mean?

752
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,290
What do you think?

753
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,090
Why are you such a busybody?

754
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,810
Without rhyme or reason,

755
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,220
why did you introduce the teacher

756
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,220
to the lawyers?

757
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,700
You also took the lawyers to Shuiwei Village.

758
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:37,460
What?

759
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,260
To show that you know lawyers in the city

760
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,090
and are capable?

761
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,570
Do you know how much

762
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,900
you have cost the village?

763
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,850
A few millions. Do you know that?

764
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,980
A few millions?

765
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,290
Why?

766
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,810
You won't understand.

767
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,660
This report said that the water is fine.

768
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,900
Why must you spend millions?

769
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,900
Would you understand?

770
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,900
Anyway, stop being a busybody.

771
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,740
Are you here to deliver this?

772
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,090
Okay, I got it.

773
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,900
You've all got it.

774
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,980
These are roughly

775
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,180
the conditions

776
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,290
set by Wan Village.

777
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,460
Let's discuss them.

778
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,180
By right,

779
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,570
these conditions are very good,

780
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,220
but what about the villagers who want a lawsuit?

781
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,770
Talk to them.

782
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,500
Settle with them first.

783
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,370
We don't have solid evidence

784
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,570
to guarantee that we can win.

785
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,810
After all the trouble,

786
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,290
I think

787
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,530
even if the factory caused pollution before,

788
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,290
it wouldn't do it again.

789
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,220
The pollution problem is solved.

790
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,740
It doesn't matter whether we sue them.

791
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,700
A lawsuit

792
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,810
takes time and money

793
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,700
and disrupts harmony.

794
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,260
It should be our last resort.

795
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,260
They buckled when we talked about a lawsuit.

796
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,330
That means something is fishy.

797
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,660
Why don't we

798
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,810
keep making a fuss?

799
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,130
Maybe we can get

800
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,260
better conditions?

801
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,220
I doubt it.

802
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,420
If they get annoyed,

803
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,610
it'll be hard

804
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,770
to get a good offer.

805
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,980
We already know

806
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,850
their weakness.

807
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,980
What's there to fear?

808
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,090
We can promise them first.

809
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,420
Later,

810
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,090
if they bully us again,

811
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,500
we can still

812
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,260
touch their sore point.

813
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,610
Let's not rush it.

814
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,810
I have no opinion.

815
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,130
Neither do I.

816
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,900
Okay.

817
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,370
I'll say a few words.

818
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,570
The higher-ups

819
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,530
asked us to merge with Wan Village.

820
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,530
Once we merge,

821
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,130
we are a family.

822
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,090
We eat from the same pot.

823
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,570
If you shed all pretense of cordiality,

824
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,090
in the future,

825
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,700
things can get nasty.

826
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,500
Am I right?

827
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,460
How can we work together?

828
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,500
Since they showed sincerity,

829
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,850
we

830
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,530
should quit while we are ahead.

831
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
As for the villagers,

832
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,020
we should go to them

833
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,980
and do our best

834
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,500
to talk to them.

835
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,740
After all,

836
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,660
we should treasure harmony.

837
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,020
Yes.

838
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,770
It makes sense.

839
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,460
Is that Mr. Guan?

840
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,570
I am Li Maoqin from Shuiwei Village.

841
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,570
You must be the head of Shuiwei Village.

842
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,850
Yes, that's me.

843
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,330
It's like this.

844
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,940
[Shuiwei Village Police Office]
I call you to say

845
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,940
that we won't trouble you

846
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,180
with the lawsuit against Wan Village.

847
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,090
Do you mean

848
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,050
you won't sue them?

849
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,610
Yes, we won't.

850
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,020
Look.

851
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,900
Our two villages

852
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,810
are talking about merging.

853
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:54,940
After we merge,

854
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,370
we are a family.

855
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,090
Many people in our village

856
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,460
want to work at the Wanjia Group.

857
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,700
If we file a lawsuit,

858
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,020
we'll have an acrimonious fall-out
and feel awkward meeting each other.

859
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,610
Maybe we'll lose our jobs.

860
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,850
Many people don't want to file the lawsuit.

861
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,220
I understand.

862
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,850
Good. You understand.

863
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,330
Anyway,

864
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,980
we are very grateful

865
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,610
for the legal advice you gave us

866
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,260
and your assistance.

867
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:23,770
You're welcome.

868
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,610
Mr. Guan, that's it for now.

869
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,500
Thank you.

870
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,420
Okay.

871
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,980
If you need anything in the future,

872
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,940
call me anytime.

873
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,900
Okay. Bye.

874
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,420
Shuiwei Village

875
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,610
will merge with Wan Village soon.

876
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,090
After the merger,

877
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,020
they are a family.

878
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,050
If they drop all pretensions now,

879
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:43,660
the people

880
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,700
of the villages will not get along well.

881
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,530
Therefore,

882
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,460
they decide

883
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,460
not to sue the health products factory.

884
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,660
Thank goodness.

885
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,940
Save us the trouble.

886
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,530
What do you mean?

887
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,330
What do you mean by that?

888
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,130
I seek truth from facts.

889
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,530
You are too idealistic

890
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,980
and spend time on legal aid

891
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,090
and public interest litigation.

892
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,980
You make losses.

893
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,850
You forgot our original intention.

894
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,940
Don't turn law into a business.

895
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,020
Don't worry. I'll never forget,

896
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,700
but what you face daily

897
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,090
are your daily needs.

898
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,180
Idealism

899
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,020
can't turn into rice and noodles, can it?

900
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:21,900
Xingfu.

901
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:22,770
Hello,

902
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,370
Guan.

903
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,180
I have received an assessment report.

904
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,330
Is the result out?

905
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,530
Indisputable.

906
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,180
Up to standard.

907
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,530
Coincidentally, Shuiwei Village

908
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,810
does not want to sue them anymore.

909
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,370
However, it's weird.

910
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,850
Back then the masses were angry.

911
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,940
Overnight,

912
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,020
everyone changed their minds.

913
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Chunjia said

914
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,980
that the village has to spend millions
to solve this problem.

915
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,020
How so?

916
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,980
I don't know.

917
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,940
Let's do this first, Guan.

918
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,180
I'll find out what's going on

919
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,290
and get back to you.

920
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,020
Okay. Take care.

921
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,020
See you.

922
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,570
Xingfu?

923
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,220
I guess that's it for now.

924
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,460
Hello, Mr. Liu,

925
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,740
this is He Xingfu.

926
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,090
Xingfu,

927
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,220
what's up?

928
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,610
I heard that people in Shuiwei Village

929
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,850
don't want to file a lawsuit anymore.

930
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,420
Do you know why?

931
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,290
I do not know.

932
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,610
I'm going for a home visit.

933
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,050
Hello, Mr. Liu.

934
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:21,500
Hello.

935
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,290
How about this?

936
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,020
I'll ask around first

937
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,020
and then get back to you.

938
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:27,770
Okay.

939
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:28,900
Okay.

940
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,610
Can you do it, kid?

941
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,180
Xingfu.

942
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,810
Dad. Mom.

943
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,500
I'm going to the inn.

944
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,570
Do you have anything to give Xiuyu?

945
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,530
-Yes.
-I'll take it with me.

946
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,500
She loves

947
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,900
the hot sauce I marinated.

948
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,740
It's freshly marinated.

949
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,100
I'll take it to her.

950
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,100
I'll fetch it.

951
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,380
What are you counting? You're straining.

952
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,070
I'm exhausted.

953
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,710
I'm counting

954
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,550
the amount that Cai wants,

955
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,860
how much do I have to invest,

956
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,030
who are the right people to hire,

957
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,820
how much more land to rent,

958
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,270
what seeds should I buy,

959
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,420
and the cost of greenhouses.

960
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,950
When I'm working on my field,

961
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,510
my mind is clear.

962
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,140
When I saw this paper,

963
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,100
my brain is a mess.

964
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,030
I can't sort things out.

965
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,180
Don't worry, take your time.

966
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,950
Qinglai,

967
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,750
your hands are like mine.

968
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,310
They can farm

969
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,710
but can't write

970
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,510
with a pen.

971
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,750
If Xiuyu is here,

972
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,620
that will not be a problem.

973
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,860
Yes.

974
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,070
I'll go to Xiuyu.

975
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,340
Xingfu, wait for me.

976
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,950
I'll get my clothes and go with you.

977
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,230
Qinglai.

978
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,510
Qinglai.

979
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,030
You get busy with your work.

980
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,990
I'll go with your dad.

981
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,620
It's cold in the mountain.

982
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,790
Stay home with Dad.

983
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,950
Let's go. Let's go.

984
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,580
He is busy.

985
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:53,860
Yes.

986
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,660
I'll go with her.

987
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,270
You stay home.

988
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,070
No. You can't explain to Xiuyu.

989
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,310
I can explain to her. It's not complicated.

990
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,100
Get ready now.

991
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,710
What else should we bring for her?

992
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,310
I have a lot of stuff in here.

993
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,820
They just want to see Xiuyu.

994
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,030
You both know

995
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,100
that we are talking to Wan Village

996
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,140
about the merger.

997
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,910
Once we merge,

998
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,660
aren't we a family?

999
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,180
We'll bump into each other.

1000
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,990
In addition,

1001
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,990
they agree

1002
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,740
to give health allowance.

1003
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,220
You are very young.

1004
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,620
You

1005
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,950
can work for him for wages.

1006
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,180
Let's stop clamoring

1007
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,140
about the lawsuit.

1008
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,990
If this goes further,

1009
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,030
you get nothing.

1010
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,390
You won't get remunerations.

1011
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,140
Did they pollute the water?

1012
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,070
If they didn't,

1013
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,470
why pay the medical bills?

1014
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,950
They have too much money?

1015
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,300
You've wrongly accused them.

1016
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,430
Chuanjia

1017
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,140
copied all water assessment reports

1018
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,620
for the wastewater treatment plant

1019
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,390
from the time the factory was set up

1020
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,990
to the present.

1021
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,950
They all passed.

1022
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,580
It's not them.

1023
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,700
Why are our kids always sick?

1024
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,550
I'm not a doctor. You have to ask the doctor.

1025
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,140
We must move on.

1026
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,260
We can take our time to find out the cause.

1027
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,430
Over here,

1028
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,950
they are sincere.

1029
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,070
Let's respond first.

1030
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,510
Take the money for the child's medical treatment.

1031
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,180
This is what matters.

1032
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,350
Don't you think?

1033
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,830
Is there anyone at home?

1034
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,700
Meiqin.

1035
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,830
Mr. Liu is here.

1036
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,140
Yancheng.

1037
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,910
Mr. Liu is here.

1038
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,180
Mr. Li, you are here too.

1039
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,830
Mr. Liu.

1040
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,260
Qiang, come out now.

1041
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,070
Mr. Liu is here.

1042
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,430
Hello, Mr. Liu.

1043
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,350
What are you doing at home, Qiang?

1044
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,620
Catch up on homework.

1045
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,620
What about the missed classes?

1046
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:46,910
Those too.

1047
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,510
Okay. Go in first.

1048
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,470
I'll check later.

1049
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,070
Okay.

1050
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,470
Mr. Li,

1051
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,830
I want to ask you something.

1052
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,390
Xingfu told me

1053
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,910
that the villagers

1054
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,990
don't plan to sue Wan Village.

1055
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,390
Who said that?

1056
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,780
I haven't decided yet.

1057
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,740
I have to think it through.

1058
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,830
I've told you

1059
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,950
what is at stake.

1060
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,350
Think about it.

1061
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,390
Okay.

1062
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,780
I'll leave you alone.

1063
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,470
Excuse me.

1064
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,030
Okay.

1065
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,990
Goodbye, Mr. Li.

1066
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,740
I'll see you off.

1067
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,510
Mr. Liu, please sit.

1068
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,700
It's okay. Go ahead.

1069
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,030
It's okay. I'll see you off.

1070
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,300
You must

1071
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,220
take what I said to heart.

1072
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,740
I know.

1073
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,140
Think about it.

1074
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:31,830
Slow down, Mom.

1075
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,580
Xingfu.

1076
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,830
Xiuyu.

1077
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,700
Mom and Dad are here to visit you.

1078
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,470
Mom and Dad, come in.

1079
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,430
She brought you a lot of delicious food.

1080
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,390
Xiuyu.

1081
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,740
Xiuyu.

1082
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,990
Xiuyu, look.

1083
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,700
Look what I made for you.

1084
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,740
Fried chestnuts with sugar

1085
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,390
and your favorite fried dough twists.

1086
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,700
I made a lot of them.

1087
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,260
There are more at home.

1088
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,300
Look.

1089
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,350
Xiu... Xiuyu.

1090
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,070
Your brother has something

1091
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,580
that he wants you...

1092
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,660
His business?

1093
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,780
I don't care.

1094
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,700
Xiuyu.

1095
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,700
Xiuyu.

1096
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,260
Mom, Dad,

1097
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,660
I'll talk to her.

1098
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,550
Sit here first.

1099
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,220
Okay.

1100
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,870
Xiuyu, don't do this.

1101
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,430
Mom and Dad are old now.

1102
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,550
Xingfu,

1103
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,780
why did I sign the contract?

1104
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,180
They forced me to sign it.

1105
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,140
I really can't let it rest.

1106
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,300
Xiuyu,

1107
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,100
this world can offer many other paths.

1108
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,870
It's like in our mountains.

1109
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,430
Mudslides happen in the rainy season.

1110
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,870
The road is blocked.

1111
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,430
If we can't get through for a while,

1112
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,660
what do you do?

1113
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,620
Would you

1114
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,620
cry about the blocked road?

1115
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,780
Can crying unblock that path?

1116
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,580
If this road is blocked,

1117
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,350
take another road.

1118
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,700
It might take you more time to reach
your destination if you take a detour,

1119
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,950
but maybe you will get to see different scenery.

1120
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,990
Maybe the scenery is even better.

1121
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,870
Maybe, as you walk,

1122
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,620
you will suddenly see

1123
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,140
a road that you can take

1124
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,950
and it links to

1125
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,950
the original road.

1126
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,580
Wouldn't that be better?

1127
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,830
You're a smart kid.

1128
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,580
You understand the reasoning.

1129
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,470
Right?

1130
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:25,830
Coming.

1131
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,950
Xingfu.

1132
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,910
Mr. Liu, sorry

1133
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,740
for keeping you waiting.

1134
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,220
It's okay.

1135
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,390
And this is...?

1136
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,430
Let me introduce him.

1137
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,780
He is Li Yancheng.

1138
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,700
He is from Shuiwei Village.

1139
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,180
He is the parent

1140
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,390
of Li Chuanqiang, my student.

1141
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,700
We're here to talk to you about something.

1142
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,070
We wonder if you have time.

1143
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,260
Yes. Take a seat.

1144
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:43,870
Sit down and talk.

1145
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,220
Okay.

1146
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,300
What's up?

1147
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,260
Ms. He,

1148
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,580
it's still about that pollution

1149
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,870
lawsuit.

1150
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,030
I wonder if you can talk to Mr. Guan.

1151
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,260
I thought people from your village
want no lawsuit?

1152
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,830
Yes.

1153
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,780
Those people decided to drop it,

1154
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,470
but I kept thinking about it.

1155
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,990
I think

1156
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,100
Mr. Liu is right.

1157
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,780
In the past, Wan Village

1158
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,140
treated us like stepchildren.

1159
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,510
Our pay was meager.

1160
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,300
After we clamored

1161
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,550
about a lawsuit,

1162
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,100
their attitude changed right away.

1163
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,780
Why is that so?

1164
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,620
I think they have something to hide.

1165
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:22,830
Right?

1166
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,100
Yes.

1167
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,660
Although now

1168
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,300
they are paying

1169
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,580
our medical bills,

1170
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,550
the matter has not been resolved.

1171
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,660
Without getting to the root

1172
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,870
of this pollution,

1173
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,620
if we don't sue them,

1174
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,140
they will very likely

1175
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,180
continue to pollute the water.

1176
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,620
What will happen to our kids, then?

1177
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,220
Qiang is very smart.

1178
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,390
He is a good boy who loves to learn.

1179
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,260
Last year, he won a second-class award

1180
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,260
at the Primary School Students'
Science and Technology

1181
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,660
Little Experts' Competition,

1182
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,870
but

1183
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:55,700
he is weak

1184
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,700
and gets sick often.

1185
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,910
Yancheng,

1186
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,950
let me tell you honestly.

1187
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,910
I got the Ministry of Ecology and Environment

1188
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,220
to secretly assess the water discharge

1189
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,260
at the wastewater treatment plant.

1190
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,140
The result conforms to the national

1191
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,350
wastewater standard.

1192
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,100
Well,

1193
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,070
you didn't test

1194
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,780
for 24 hours, did you?

1195
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,300
Moreover,

1196
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,990
the people from Wan Village

1197
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,580
discharged secretly

1198
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,180
at night when no one was there.

1199
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:19,660
Who would know?

1200
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,350
So,

1201
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,030
Ms. He, we thought

1202
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,830
that since you are from Wan Village,

1203
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,470
we should visit you

1204
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,660
to see if you have any insider information.

1205
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,870
You are right.

1206
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,510
Legally speaking,

1207
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,100
if there is a lawsuit,

1208
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,300
we need assessment proof from a third party

1209
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,300
and uninterrupted monitoring evidence.

1210
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,950
Maybe we can figure out where the problem is.

1211
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,550
A third party?

1212
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,100
Where do we get

1213
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,950
an assessment from a third party?

1214
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,390
Moreover,

1215
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,140
Ms. He,

1216
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,070
the people from Wan Village already stated

1217
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,740
that if someone sues them,

1218
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,580
he or she can't work in their company anymore.

1219
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,510
My child's medical bills

1220
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,030
will probably not be reimbursed.

1221
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,580
I filed a lawsuit against the village before.

1222
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,660
I couldn't stay in the village

1223
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,740
and went to the city to work.

1224
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,100
I met

1225
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,580
many friends, like Mr. Guan.

1226
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,510
I gained knowledge and vision.

1227
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,220
Actually, venturing out

1228
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,950
is not so scary.

1229
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,180
It isn't necessarily a loss.

1230
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,350
We shouldn't see it this way
for the sake of our children.

1231
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,430
Yancheng,

1232
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,070
I think

1233
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,070
she has a point there.

1234
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,990
As parents,

1235
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,870
how can you let your children

1236
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,350
get sick without knowing why?

1237
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,470
They have a long future.

1238
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,950
Don't hold up your children

1239
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:48,950
for a petty profit.

1240
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:55,950
Okay.

1241
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,910
I think you two have a point.

1242
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,660
I want to file

1243
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,030
the lawsuit.

1244
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,740
I'll fight them to the end.
