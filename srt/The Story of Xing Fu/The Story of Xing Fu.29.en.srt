[The Story of Xing Fu]

00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,319
I know about this

4
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,640
but I need some more time.

5
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,400
How much longer do you need?

6
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,640
The Group still has

7
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,480
a lot of outstanding payments
that we haven't managed to collect.

8
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,519
We don't have enough money to fix the road.

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,200
Anyway, the cadres of the village

10
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,840
have already agreed to fix the road.

11
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,599
Yes. I got it.

12
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,200
They have agreed to fix the road.

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,680
I agree with that too.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,040
I only wish for a little more time.

15
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,239
At the moment,

16
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:13,040
our group is not doing very well.

17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,760
Whenever we need
to allocate money for something,

18
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:17,200
we have to go through
strict reviews and assessments.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Can you be more considerate?

20
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,520
Please.

21
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,159
Sure.

22
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,439
But how much longer do you need?

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,400
A month.

24
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,439
How does that sound?

25
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,360
I'll get it done

26
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,800
within a month.

27
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,800
Sure.

28
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
A month.

29
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,719
Xingfu.

30
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,960
Xingfu.

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,120
Coming.

32
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,199
I brought the ingredients. Come and get them.

33
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,360
Coming.

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,159
Did you get the eggs?

35
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,840
I did. They're all in the bucket.

36
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,879
Be careful on the road.

37
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,719
You broke a few eggs the last time.

38
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,599
Don't worry. I won't break any this time.

39
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,439
I placed a lot of rice husks underneath.

40
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,840
Xingfu.

41
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,080
What's the matter?

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,520
Can you come with me?

43
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,280
We received a complaint from a customer.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,360
What's wrong?

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,280
Are you not going to take the ingredients?

46
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,639
Xingfu.

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,759
She's our manager.

48
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,039
Why don't you speak to her?

49
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,080
Hi.

50
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,319
How can I help you?

51
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,240
I only want to know

52
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,199
why don't you provide bottled water here.

53
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,439
I have asked them a few times,

54
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,639
but I haven't got it yet.

55
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,639
Yes.

56
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,360
We don't serve bottled water here.

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,199
We only provide mountain spring water.

58
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,560
All of our guests

59
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,199
drink the mountain spring water.

60
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,479
What do you mean?

61
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,080
Are you telling me

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,720
to drink tap water?

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,360
Should I drink the water
I always use to brush my teeth,

64
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,040
wash my face, and flush the toilet?

65
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,000
You can rest assured.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,600
The water comes directly from the mountain.

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,399
It's safe to be consumed.

68
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,959
Directly from the mountain?

69
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,199
That's exactly why it's not safe to be consumed.

70
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,920
I can't drink any water
without knowing where it's from.

71
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,079
I need bottled water.

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,439
Sure.

73
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,759
Don't worry.

74
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,199
I'll buy you some bottled water.

75
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,240
Liuhua.

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,920
Can you

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,879
-escort the guest to her room first?
-Yes, sure.

78
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,959
I'll go and buy you bottled water now.

79
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,439
Please have some water first.

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Are you really asking me to drink water?

81
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,199
-Mr. Wu.
-Xingfu.

82
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,319
What are you doing?

83
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,199
Madam Qi from room number three
is asking for bottled water,

84
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,240
so I bought a carton for her.

85
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,439
I'm going to send it to her.

86
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,319
She should be drinking the pure spring water,
and not bottled water.

87
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,079
Is she mad?

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,639
Hey.

89
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,560
Madam Qi.

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,360
Let me help you.

91
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,920
My apologies.

92
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,199
I got you some mineral water.

93
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,279
It's on me.

94
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,639
It was our mistake.

95
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,639
Hey.

96
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,800
You're Ms. He, right?

97
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,720
Do you think

98
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,360
I'm a very fussy person?

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,639
No.

100
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,759
Of course, not.

101
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,639
Tell you what.

102
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,040
I get allergies very easily.

103
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,399
I can't drink any contaminated water
even if it's only a little.

104
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,560
I understood.

105
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,000
But the water we serve

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,319
doesn't come from an unknown origin.

107
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,120
It's our specialty.

108
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,120
Many of our guests

109
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
enjoy drinking the mountain spring water.

110
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,959
None of them has run into any problems.

111
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,560
It was just pure luck.

112
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,319
You haven't met anyone who's allergic.

113
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,319
Besides, you're so far

114
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,560
from all the major hospitals.

115
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,800
If anything happens,

116
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,199
causing someone
to suffer from vomiting, diarrhea,

117
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,000
dehydration, and have his or her life at stake,

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,759
do you think you can bear the consequences?

119
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,680
I can't. You're right.

120
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm so sorry.

121
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,920
That's why.

122
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,519
My goodness.

123
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,839
My goodness.

124
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,399
Mr. Wu.

125
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,600
Can someone really get killed

126
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,160
just by drinking water?

127
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,160
I happened to pass by

128
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,720
and overheard your conversation,

129
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,319
so I invited myself to join in.

130
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,839
Madam Qi.

131
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,040
This is Mr. Wu.

132
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,560
-Hi.
-Hello.

133
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,279
Well.

134
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,839
Madam Qi said she was allergic,

135
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,680
and she couldn't drink
the mountain spring water we provided.

136
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,879
I thought it was a pity.

137
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,839
Madam,

138
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,560
let's have a chat.

139
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,399
The water they provide

140
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,560
is pure and natural mountain spring water.

141
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,839
The minerals it carries

142
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,240
are very good for our health.

143
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,120
Can you prove it?

144
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,600
Do you have a test report?

145
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,160
Of course.

146
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,959
Before we started operating,

147
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,079
we had to go through a water quality assessment
and obtain a test report.

148
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,079
That report

149
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,879
only proves

150
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,040
that you meet the requirements
of basic drinking water.

151
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,680
It doesn't prove that you meet the standard
of natural mineral water.

152
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,560
Why doesn't it make much sense to me?

153
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,920
Madam.

154
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,639
Take my advice.

155
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,759
Don't make things difficult for this young lady.

156
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,759
The water they provided

157
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,920
is pure and natural.

158
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,319
I've gone to many places

159
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,920
and have drunk water from different places.

160
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,839
Still, the water here

161
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,079
makes the best tea.

162
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,160
Let me put it this way. I come here

163
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,360
for the water.

164
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,319
It's perfect for making tea.

165
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,120
Ha!

166
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,160
You can say this

167
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,240
to anyone else,

168
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,160
but I'm the technician

169
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,759
of the Water Quality Monitoring Station
of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

170
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:09,920
I see.

171
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,839
This water

172
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,600
does look quite clean.

173
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,199
However, once you put this
into our monitoring device,

174
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,720
you'll see

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,279
all the organic

176
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,639
and harmful substances in the water.

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,639
You get heavy metals,

178
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,839
Escherichia coli,

179
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,160
organic pollutants,

180
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,519
chloroform,

181
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,240
and many others.

182
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Do you know

183
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,199
that drinking this water

184
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,240
is poisonous

185
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,800
in the long run?

186
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,160
Do you know

187
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
why many people don't know

188
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,680
the cause of their illnesses?

189
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,639
It's precisely because they drank unclean water.

190
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,240
These kinds of water

191
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,159
will make people sick.

192
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,480
If anyone gets cancer from this,

193
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,120
their lives will be at stake.

194
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,919
Madam.

195
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,399
I think you've exaggerated it.

196
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,679
Madam Qi.

197
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,919
Where can I get the assessment done?

198
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,039
You can visit our assessment center.

199
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
How much will it cost?

200
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
What you did previously

201
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,639
is just the assessment for basic drinking water.

202
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,879
It would be cheaper.

203
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,200
The assessment for natural mineral water

204
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,240
is more expensive.

205
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,480
If I remember correctly,

206
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,240
it's more than 7,000 yuan.

207
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,759
7,000 yuan?

208
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,480
Madam, I think

209
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,720
your body

210
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,919
is quite different.

211
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,039
You're unlike

212
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,759
the others,

213
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,519
right?

214
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,080
Look at me.

215
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,159
I've stayed here

216
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,960
for quite some time.

217
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,639
I drink this water every day.

218
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,799
Many villagers here drink this water daily too.

219
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,320
We are all doing just fine.

220
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,480
That can only prove

221
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,799
that you're quite different too.

222
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,759
Take this for an example.

223
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,320
You drink water with harmful substances,

224
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,240
but you're fine.

225
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,879
Allergic people like us

226
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,360
can't take unclean water.

227
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,440
For people like you,

228
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,240
it doesn't matter to you

229
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,159
how much filthy water you have consumed.

230
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,360
Your body

231
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,159
can withstand these toxins,

232
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,000
but that can't prove that the water is good.

233
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,000
There are many people

234
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,440
who can't handle these toxins.

235
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,600
They might fall sick

236
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,919
or even lose their lives.

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
Can you bear the responsibility?

238
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,120
Does it make sense to you now?

239
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:00,840
Mr. Wu.

240
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,720
Madam Qi.

241
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:02,919
I think

242
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,440
we should do the assessment.

243
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,240
If the assessment can prove

244
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,720
that the water here

245
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,639
is qualified as natural mineral water,

246
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,639
it can also be a new selling point

247
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,639
for our inn in the future, right?

248
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,120
Such a clever young lady.

249
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,960
You're truly smart.

250
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,759
I can see

251
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,200
how seriously you take this business.

252
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,480
Of course.

253
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,120
I want to introduce the mountain spring water

254
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,240
to more customers.

255
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,039
That's right.

256
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
If the water quality assessment shows

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,759
that the water here

258
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,080
is of superior quality,

259
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,159
I promise you,

260
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,600
I'll make sure the 7,000 yuan is worth it.

261
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll recommend this place to my good friends,

262
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,960
and bring you more customers.

263
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:42,960
Very soon,

264
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,080
you'll be able to earn back the 7,000 yuan

265
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,440
and even more.

266
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,799
Nice!

267
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:48,720
Really?

268
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,840
If the water passes the assessment,

269
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll make good tea

270
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,240
for Madam Qi.

271
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,960
How does that sound?

272
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,960
It's not about the tea,

273
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,720
but the quality of the water.

274
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,120
Li.

275
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,200
This place is surrounded by mountains and water.

276
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,120
The view is pretty good.

277
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,840
Li,

278
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,639
are you tired?

279
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,440
Do you want to take a sip of this
to keep yourself awake?

280
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm not like you.

281
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,080
I can keep myself awake.

282
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,799
It seems like we're being tailed.

283
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,000
This car has been following us
for quite some time.

284
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,759
Really?

285
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,399
Don't look back.

286
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,519
Slow down.

287
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,759
Keep a distance.

288
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,799
Why are they following us?

289
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,600
They're probably scared.

290
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,159
I'm sure there's something wrong
with the water here.

291
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,960
Whenever environmental inspectors like us

292
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,559
go anywhere problematic,

293
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,919
odd things like this happen.

294
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,200
Are you serious?

295
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,159
Li,

296
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,559
you're scaring me.

297
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,559
Sit tight.

298
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,039
Speed up.

299
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:05,960
Follow them.

300
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,200
Faster.

301
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,200
My dad is calling for a meeting this afternoon.

302
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,799
He is surely going to ask about the loss
of the Health Products Factory.

303
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,039
You better think

304
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,360
about how...

305
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:30,725
[Mr. Wu]

306
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,039
Answer it.

307
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,159
Excuse me.

308
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Wait.

309
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,320
I'm not done yet.

310
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,720
Why don't you just answer the call here?

311
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,799
Sure.

312
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,519
Hey.

313
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,840
Mr. Mo.

314
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,960
The Ministry of Ecology and Environment's car
is already at Shuiwei Village.

315
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,200
When did you see the car?

316
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,960
Did it go anywhere else?

317
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,799
We went to the city to run some errands

318
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,879
and we ran into it on our way.

319
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,279
We weren't too bothered at first,

320
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,159
but as we kept driving,

321
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,480
we saw them heading in this direction.

322
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,120
Mr. Mo,

323
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,799
I think

324
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
you should get ready to welcome them.

325
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,360
Who's that?

326
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,840
Who's calling you?

327
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,000
It's nothing.

328
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:17,639
It's...

329
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,200
Wu from the wastewater treatment plant.

330
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,759
They're at the village?

331
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,799
Stop them now.

332
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,240
Okay.

333
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:39,759
I'll be on my way.

334
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,480
Alright.

335
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,600
Stop right there.

336
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,879
Where are you going?

337
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:46,600
Hey.

338
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,200
Wait.

339
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,879
They're not heading to the Group.

340
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,440
They're not going
to the wastewater treatment plant either.

341
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,720
Where are they going?

342
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,879
I'm now

343
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,279
at Mr. Wan's office.

344
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,759
If anything happens,

345
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,679
you'll have to handle it yourself.

346
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,720

that the water is all good,

00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,759
I always keep my promises.

398
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,039
Sure.

399
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,039
Mr. Wu, you heard it, right?

400
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,240
Of course.

401
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,080
I'll be fair.

with the water I love drinking.

404
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,240
Many people

enjoy drinking soft drinks too,

406

that are harmful to our health.

If you can trust your tongue,

409

Ms. He,

415
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,060
since you mentioned
that this is the mountain spring water,

416
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,990
I suggest us

417
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,900
take some samples from the mountain too.

418
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,390
Let's see if the mountain spring water

419
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,150
and the water you serve

420
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,060
are of the same quality.

421
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,150
Sure.

422
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,390
My family grew up drinking this.

423
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,230
I'll bring you to the mouth of the spring
in the mountain.

424
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
I'm the general manager
of the Health Products Factory,

425
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,510
and I must bear the responsibility.

426
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,900
We all know

427
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,300
that since the establishment

428
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,390
of the Health Products Factory,

429
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,110
we haven't managed to make much profit.

430
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,660
It's nothing like what we expected.

431
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,660
However, it has nothing to do
with the quality of our products.

432
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,540
It happens

433
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,780
because

434
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,100
the costs of labor and raw materials

435
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,620
are skyrocketing.

436
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,100
Besides,

437
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,190
we see strong competition in the market

438
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,300
between similar products.

439
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,990
The profit margin is getting lower and lower.

440
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,230
On top of that, there are
a lot of bad practices in the market.

441
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,140
Some refuse to pay their debts,

442
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,780
some pay late,

443
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,950
and some introduce a tripartite agreement,

444
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,430
resulting in the snowballing of the debt.

445
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,620
That's why

446
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,100
we thought...

447
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,780
Since we have found the source of the problem,

448
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,990
do we have a solution for that?

449
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,780
Mr. Wan is really desperate for a solution too.

450
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,140
He's leading the team personally.

451
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,750
Everyone in the company is working together

452
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,540
and we have come up with
many different proposals.

453
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,670
On the one hand,

454
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,620
we're working

455
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,470
on reducing the cost.

456
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,140
We're trying to cut the cost

457
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,510
as much as possible.

458
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,950
On the other hand,

459
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,990
we'll have to work harder
on collecting the outstanding payments.

460
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,140
If the clients can make their payments on time,

461
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,380
we can effectively maximize
our fund utilization rate.

462
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,620
I believe

463
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,190
things will get better very soon.

hoping that we can continue
to represent the county

Being the Outstanding
Entrepreneurship Village

475

Liuhua.

518
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,190
Do you enjoy working here?

519
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,380
It's not bad.

520
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,340
Although I don't earn as much
as when I was working at the factory,

521
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,510
I like the environment here.

522
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,540
It makes me feel really good too.

523
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,580
You're right.

524
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,470
This place is quite pretty.

525
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,910
We got them custom-made locally.

526
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,820
They're made locally?

527
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,300
Yes.

528
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,950
They look like imported goods.

529
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,910
Please wait for a moment.

530
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,230
Madam.

531
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,620
You're here.

532
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,230
Liuhua.

533
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,060
Summarize the first month's sales

534
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,140
and make them into a chart.

535
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:04,990
Sure.

536
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,620
Madam, let's talk in my office.

537
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,190
Sure.

538
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,380
We'll get going.

539
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,860
Xiuyu.

540
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,540
Liuhua.

541
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,820
Try this. It's delicious.

542
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,580
Where's Xingfu?

543
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,780
She's at the office.

544
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,750
Gang's mom is here.

545
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,540
Why is she here?

546
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,100
According to Xingfu,

547
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,990
she intends to hire her as a cook.

548
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,030
Why her?

549
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,820
It tastes quite good.

550
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,470
You can keep it.

551
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,230
I'll go and have a look.

552
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,300
Sure.

553
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,510
Here, Madam.

554
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,780
Here's a drink for you.

555
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,710
Everyone says that you're a great cook.

556
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,780
Do you want

557
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,950
to cook for our customers?

558
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,230
If you work here, you'll be the head of the kitchen.

559
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,510
I'll be your assistant.

560
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,430
Wow.

561
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,140
I'm flattered.

562
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,540
I only know how to cook

563
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,820
simple dishes for the countrymen.

564
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,910
They are nothing you can serve at a restaurant.

565
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,380
I can't do that.

566
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,060
All your guests are from the city.

567
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,270
This won't work.

568
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,950
Madam, you see,

569
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
when the townies are here,

570
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,430
those simple country dishes are all they want.

571
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,710
We only need to work a little more
on the presentation.

572
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,510
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.

573
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,060
Really?

574
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,580
Then...

575
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,670
Will I get paid?

576
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,380
That's for sure. You can't be working for free.

577
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,990
2,000 yuan a month.

578
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,140
You'll have to cook three meals a day.

579
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,140
What do you think?

580
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,060
You get pensions from the village too.

581
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,100
Just consider this your pocket money.

582
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,670
2,000 yuan...

583
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,230
That's not a lot.

584
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,750
Can you offer more?

585
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,710
Your inn

586
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,030
is so far from the village.

587
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,430
I'm too old to be traveling that much daily.

588
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,380
Madam.

589
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,470
You saw it yourself.

590
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,270
I only started operating this inn not long ago.

591
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,860
I'm not earning much.

592
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,100
All my expenses still depend on crowdfunding.

593
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,140
I'm a little tight on money.

594
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,030
Everyone has been showing me great support,

595
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,380
and I don't want to let them down.

596
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,910
I'm only trying to save as much as I can now.

597
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,710
Don't worry.

598
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,100
When I manage to keep the business on track,

599
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,470
I'll definitely give you a raise.

600
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,580
Xingfu.

601
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,780
Xiuyu.

602
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,710
Madam, you're here.

603
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,060
You're getting prettier and prettier.

604
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,540
Don't you work for the Group?

605
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,950
Why are you helping out at the inn too?

606
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,470
I invested some money too

607
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,780
and am considered a minority shareholder.

608
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,990
Xingfu.

609
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,140
Aren't you looking for someone who can cook?

610
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,670
My colleague introduced someone to me.

611
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,140
Why don't we meet her up?

612
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,230
There's no need to keep looking.

613
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,910
I'm right here.

614
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,380
Xingfu and I were discussing this just now.

615
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,270
When can I start?

616
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,030
What about Friday?

617
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,060
We have more guests on weekends.

618
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,140
You can use the coming two days to get prepared.

619
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,540
You can do a blood test and a check-up
at the hospital.

620
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,470
I'll bear the cost.

621
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,620
After all, we're chefs.

622
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,710
We would like others
to enjoy the food with confidence.

623
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,780
Sure.

624
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,030
Having stayed in the city

625
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,860
does make you different.

626
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,100
I can rest assured too after the check-up.

627
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:06,950
Sure.

628
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,860
You should get back to work. I'll get going.

629
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:10,820
Madam.

630
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,540
Here's a menu for you.

631
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,270
You can study it at home.

632
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,190
I'm wondering if you can add

633
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,140
a few signature dishes of yours to it.

634
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,750
Of course.

635
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,030
I'll study it later.

636
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,470
-Sure. I'll consider the deal sealed.
-Okay.

637
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,190
Madam.

638
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,860
Sure.

639
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,860
I'll get going.

640
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,470
Sure.

641
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,190
I've got to go.

642
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,060
Then...

643
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,380
I'll be here on Friday.

644
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,190
Sure.

645
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,060
Bye, Madam.

646
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,030
Goodbye.

647
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,300
Why did you insist on hiring her?

648
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,300
What's wrong?

649
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,820
I dislike her.

650
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:44,990
Why?

651
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,030
You can easily hire another cook.

652
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,910
I can get you someone from the city.

653
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,030
Every time there's a special occasion
in the village,

654
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,340
everyone approaches her
and asks her to help prepare the food.

655
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,820
She cooks really well.

656
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,430
That's a taste you can only get in our village.

657
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,270
The chefs from the city are different.

658
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,510
This is for the greater good, okay?

659
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,990
I...

660
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,710
I dislike the old woman.

661
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,380
I won't be in the same place as her.

662
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,540
Hello.

663
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,580
Xingfu Inn.

664
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,910
Sorry. We don't need any of that.

665
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,710
We don't need it. Thanks.

666
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,580
Ms. He.

667
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,140
Madam Qi, why are you here?

668
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,030
I'm here to admit that I was wrong.

669
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,190
And I'm here to fulfill my promise.

670
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,100
Have you gotten the test results already?

671
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,470
Did it pass the assessment?

672
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,670
It didn't only pass the assessment,

673
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,270
but it's also way above the standard.

674
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,380
Above the standard?

675
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,710
From now on,

676
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,300
this will be your inn's best selling point.

677
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,140
I suggest you

678
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,750
frame this page

679
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,340
that comes with the parameters.

680
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,470
Those who know

681
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,670
will be able to tell how good it is at a glance.

682
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,710
Sure.

683
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,100
Thanks, Madam Qi.

684
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,510
See?

685
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,190
I told you the water wasn't bad.

686
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,340
Yes, you were totally right.

687
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,030
In fact, it's really good.

688
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,300
I forgot to introduce him to you.

689
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,820
This is my husband.

690
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,190
I promised

691
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,380
that I would introduce customers to you.

692
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,580
His company

693
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,230
organizes a lot of events.

694
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,860
For instance, team-building,

695
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,230
client meetings,

696
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,060
seminars, and so on.

697
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,670
The only trouble they have
is not getting the perfect place.

698
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,750
I introduced your inn

699
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,670
to him,

700
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,910
and he said he wanted to come and take a look.

701
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,780
Welcome.

702
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,100
Ms. He.

703
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,750
It's nice to meet you.

704
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
Nice meeting you too.

705
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,300
It would be great if Qingzhi could proceed
with his wedding.

706
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,780
It should be done as soon as possible.

707
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,030
Qingzhi's wedding

708
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,140
will be another major event for our family.

709
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,950
Qingzhi's father-in-law

710
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,030
is a reputable man.

711
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,140
We can't save on our dowry.

712
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,190
We also need a grand wedding.

713
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,380
We need his father-in-law

714
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,470
to take care of Qingzhi in the future.

715
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,100
According to Qinglai,

716
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,230
Qingzhi hasn't met

717
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,950
his mother-in-law's standard yet.

718
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,470
That's why

719
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,030
we must not be stingy.

720
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,340
Didn't they say they didn't want any dowry?

721
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,820
They were just saying.

722
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,100
Even if they don't want any dowry,

723
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,470
we still need to do a grand wedding.

724
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,750
I have asked around.

725
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,100
It takes hundreds of thousands of yuan

726
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,950
to organize a wedding in the city.

727
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,270
What?

728
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,710
Why is it so expensive?

729
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,430
If I have that much money,

730
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,990
why don't I use it to live a good life?

731
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,060
That's ridiculous.

732
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,270
What do you suggest we do, then?

733
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,860
It's a competition between families.

734
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,140
Some even borrow money just to save faces.

735
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,100
Tell you what.

736
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,990
The two of us

737
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,430
have been working really hard

738
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,990
to save some money,

739
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,060
but it's still far from enough.

740
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,030
What should we do then?

741
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,430
Mom.

742
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,190
Do we still have eggs at home?

743
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,910
We still have a few.

744
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,380
Just a few?

745
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,060
Didn't you already bring them to the inn?

746
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,580
We're running out

747
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,540
of eggs again.

748
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,670
If you keep consuming the eggs like this,

749
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,820
we won't be able to sustain.

750
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,860
They are rushing me,

751
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,380
telling me to get the eggs and vegetables.

752
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,100
I'll have to head to the wet market then.

753
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,860
Drive safe.

754
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,620
Mr. Wan.

755
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,670
I've sent someone to ask around.

756
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,100
Mr. Xie

757
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,990
is not short of cash.

758
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,860
He simply wants to hold the goods

759
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,820
and delay the payment.

760
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,820
It's something he usually does.

761
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,470
I got it.

762
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,030
I've hired a lawyer.

763
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,620
I'll first send him a letter of demand.

764
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,470
If it still doesn't work,
I'll file a lawsuit against him.

765
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,190
This guy

766
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,990
has our products' distribution rights

767
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,910
in all the five provinces of the South.

768
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,030
If things get ugly between us,

769
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,860
it will not only affect our sales performance,

770
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,750
but we might also

771
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,620
find it difficult to sell our products

772
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,860
in these five provinces in the future.

773
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,860
I'm desperate, Mo.

774
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,750
I can't be bothered by the future.

775
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,950
The market is not doing well right now.

776
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,190
It's not an issue we can solve so easily.

777
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,670
Tell my father that.

778
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,340
You're telling me these,

779
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,620
but do you think I dare say the same words to him?

780
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,540
Stop laughing.

781
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,910
Everything he said the last time

782
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,380
was aimed at me.

783
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,540
From the very beginning,

784
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,190
I've been in charge of
the Health Products Factory.

785
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,190
Now that we're at a sales plateau,

786
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,030
we have run into problems.

787
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,340
Of course,

788
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,910
he wants to throw

789
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,030
all the problems at me.

790
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,380
He won't be that mean, right?

791
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,620
After all, he's your dad.

792
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,750
He won't act so unreasonably, right?

793
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,140
That's not funny.

794
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,430
If there's anything that affects

795
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,780
the results of the selection,

796
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,430
he won't even bother being reasonable with me.

797
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,580
He's my dad and I know him the best.

798
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,300
For the past years,

799
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,820
all he has cared about the most

800
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,100
are those useless titles.

801
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,270
He would rather give his son up

802
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,780
than give those titles up.

803
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,060
Then tell me.

804
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,270
What do you mean?

805
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,060
Wait, Mo.

806
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,100
We've been talking for so long.

807
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,710
What do you think I mean?

808
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,540
You.

809
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,750
I don't care whatever you do.

810
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,780
You need to collect the outstanding payments

811
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,190
as soon as possible.

812
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,100
Come in.

813
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,100
Ms. He.

814
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,510
Mr. Mo.

815
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,430
I'll leave you guys to have a chat.

816
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,580
Get it done as soon as possible.

817
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,340
I got it.

818
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,470
Have a seat.

819
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:15,780
Xingyun.

820
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,380
I asked you here

821
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,510
because I want to ask you for a favor.

822
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,580
Let me repeat this again.

823
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,100
Call me Ms. He.

824
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,380
Oh, come on.

825
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,140
There's no need to put on an act
when you're with me.

826
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,270
We're not strangers.

827
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,950
Yes, we are.

828
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,510
How can I help you?

829
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,270
Cut straight to the chase,

830
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,580
or I'll get going.

831
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:36,670
Hey.

832
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,820
Why are you in a hurry to leave?

833
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,300
Have a seat.

834
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,190
Have a seat and we can talk.

835
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,430
Look at your temper.

836
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,780
I try my best not to embarrass you

837
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,230
when others are around.

838
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,190
Now that you're in my office,

839
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,100
behind a closed door,

840
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,100
can't you just show me

841
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,750
a little respect?

842
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,230
After all, I spent money hiring you.

843
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,430
Don't you consider me your God?

844
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,620
Fine.

845
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,300
What about this?

846
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,910
Help me book two rooms

847
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,910
at Xingfu Inn.

848
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,670
I'm having a meeting with a very important client.

849
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,340
What's wrong with you?

850
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,950
Do you consider this an important matter?

851
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,380
You can get one of your secretaries

852
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,510
to give them a call.

853
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,060
Do you really need to ask me
to come here from the city?

854
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,620
Calm down.

855
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,860
I called you here

856
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,670
because I intended to hire you as my attorney.

857
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,230
But I changed my mind at the eleventh hour.

858
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,270
I want to be as polite as I can.

859
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,430
I don't get it.

860
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,670
Make it clear.

861
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:36,910
This is what happened.

862
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,990
There's a client

863
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,190
of ours

864
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,030
who still has a lot of outstanding balance to pay.

865
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,100
I'm thinking

866
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,580
maybe you can have a meal with the client.

867
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,430
Then...

868
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,670
Dream on.

869
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,910
I'm not your sales representative.

870
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,190
What's on your mind?

871
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,710
Ms. He.

872
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,540
Listen to me.

873
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,470
There's a misunderstanding.

874
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,780
We are a big group.

875
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,580
Of course, we have
our own sales representatives, right?

876
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,100
Moreover,

877
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,950
I will never tell you

878
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,670
to entertain my clients.

879
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,710
You've misunderstood me.

880
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,030
I want you

881
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,510
to be my attorney.

882
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,340
I want you to be there
when I talk to my client over the meal.

883
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,030
That's just a statement from me, alright?

884
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,780
Why are you always being stubborn
when others are being nice?

885
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,470
Didn't you say it yourself?

886
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,510
You know that I'm an attorney,

887
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,100
not your staff.

888
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,710
At most,

889
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,510
we're just an agent and a client.

890
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,580
Accompanying you to have a meal with your client

891
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,540
is not part of my job description.

892
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,750
You're right.

893
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,140
Whatever you said

894
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,140
makes perfect sense.

895
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,030
However...

896
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,100
Never mind.

897
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,300
What?

898
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,330
However, the agreement

899
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,540
between your law firm

900
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
and our group

901
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,170
seems to be expiring soon.

902
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,500
And?

903
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,810
What does that have anything to do with me?

904
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,780
It has everything to do with you.

905
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,090
What are you trying to say?

906
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,940
For these past years,

907
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,460
I've come in touch

908
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,940
with many different law firms.

909
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,090
I have never seen

910
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,500
a lawyer

911
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,780
as young as Ms. He

912
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,090
who gets to be

913
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,850
the attorney of any large groups.

914
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,610
There are many things you haven't seen before,

915
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,300
but that doesn't mean
it has never happened before.

916
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,370
Do you really want me to say it out loud?

917
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,650
You owe everything you have today

918
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,370
to the fact that you won
the legal representative rights of our group

919
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,370
on behalf of your law firm.

920
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,060
What are you trying to say?

921
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,940
I'm only trying to tell you

922
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,370
that this is a very simple task.

923
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,060
You.

924
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,850
Ms. He.

925
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,780
I need you

926
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,980
to help me get back this money

927
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,370
because our group needs the money urgently.

928
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,090
We need it to improve our sales performance.

929
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,780
If you can do this,

930
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,090
I'll renew the legal agreement

931
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,890
between our group and your law firm.

932
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,020
You can continue

933
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,130
being Ms. He, the great lawyer.

934
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,130
Look at what you have today.

935
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,410
Do you really want

936
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,260
to go back to being a trainee?

937
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,300
Don't get mad.

938
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,700
You're a girl.

939
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,060
You shouldn't be angry all the time.

940
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,330
Think about it.

941
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:41,690
Hello.

942
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,500
Where's Xingfu?

943
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,770
She's away.

944
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,420
Hey, Xingfu.

945
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,250
Where are you?

946
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,420
I'm at home sorting out the finances of the inn.

947
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,650
I'll talk to you later.

948
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,570
Xingfu, I need to talk to you.

949
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,900
I'll see you at your place.

950
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,340
See you later.

951
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,210
Bye.

952
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,980
You can just give me a call

953
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,420
if you wish to book rooms.

954
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,130
There's no need to come here personally.

955
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,500
Who wants to book the room?

956
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,540
Why did you go to this extent to help them?

957
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,820
The southern distributor
of the Health Products Company.

958
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,690
We're going to ask for the outstanding payments.

959
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,340
You're a lawyer.

960
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,570
Why do you care about the outstanding payment?

961
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,570
This...

962
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,210
No.

963
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,610
If we manage to collect the payment,

964
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,060
the factory will earn a good profit.

965
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,380
Then, I'll earn money too.

966
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,460
Isn't that a win-win situation?

967
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,090
You shouldn't sacrifice anything
just to earn money.

968
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,980
I didn't.

969
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,820
I thought

970
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,290
I could drop by and pay you a visit,

971
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,730
while I bring you some businesses too.

972
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,860
Think about it.

973
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,770
I'm working for them.

974
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,650
I can only do better if they do well.

975
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,940
Am I right?

976
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,690
Business is business, Xingfu.

977
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,460
Can I book the rooms?

978
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,650
There shouldn't be a problem, right?

979
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,770
Of course. It's just a few rooms.

980
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,170
I suppose this is good.

981
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,210
If you manage to collect the debts,

982
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,500
they will allocate a budget
to fix the roads to the inn too.

983
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,460
Exactly.

984
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,500
Now, it will benefit all three parties.

985
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,820
Good morning, Xingfu.

986
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:09,820
Morning.

987
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,250
What's wrong?

988
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,170
Did you not sleep well?

989
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:14,730
Yes.

990
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,020
Something's bothering me.

991
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,690
Here's a piece of good news.

992
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,730
I hope this can cheer you up.

993
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,090
Our inn is fully booked for this coming weekend.

994
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:22,820
What?

995
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,250
All rooms have been reserved?

996
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,210
That's right.

997
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,730
Other than the rooms

998
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,730
that are permanently rented

999
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,540
to Madam Qi's husband and Mr. Wu,

1000
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,820
all the other rooms have been reserved.

1001
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:32,730
Really?

1002
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,290
Are they all booked

1003
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,690
by our acquaintances?

1004
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,420
No.

1005
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,860
They booked the rooms through phone calls.

1006
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,650
They claimed to be Mr. Wu's fans,

1007
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,690
wishing to pay our place a visit
after reading his Weibo.

1008
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,090
Weibo?

1009
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,340
You've read it?

1010
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,130
I have.

1011
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,900
Look at this.

1012
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:47,770
This is the one.

1013
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,650
He talked
about the water quality assessment incident

1014
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,420
and his personal experience with this place.

1015
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:54,900
Look.

1016
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,250
He uploaded many photos too.

1017
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,770
These photos look really nice.

1018
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,420
He makes it sound
as if this is where the fairy lives.

1019
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:03,570
Wow.

1020
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,570
There are so many comments.

1021
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,650
Our place is going to be really famous soon.

1022
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,650
That's right.

1023
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,380
Let's go.

1024
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,170
Let's send our gratitude to Mr. Wu.

1025
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:12,770
Sure.

1026
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,170
Mr. Wu.

1027
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,730
Good news.

1028
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,420
Sure.

1029
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,570
Our place has been fully booked
for the coming weekend.

1030
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,730
All thanks to the post you uploaded on Weibo.

1031
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,380
Really?

1032
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,420
Many guests claimed

1033
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,090
that they want to pay this place a visit

1034
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,460
after reading that article.

1035
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,980
I'm indebted to you.

1036
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,540
You have no idea

1037
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,610
how worried I was when the business was slow.

1038
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,380
I wrote the article

1039
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,980
because I wanted your inn to keep operating.

1040
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,020
Where should I live

1041
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,610
if you shut down your inn?

1042
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,500
Right?

1043
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,980
Can I ask for another favor?

1044
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,650
Sure.

1045
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,380
I wonder if I can print

1046
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,690
hard copies of the article,

1047
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,210
and show them to our guests.

1048
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,500
I'm sure the marketing will be helpful.

1049
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,420
After our guests

1050
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,060
read your article,

1051
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,170
they will surely have a different experience

1052
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,420
living here.

1053
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,730
Sure.

1054
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,250
This is the latest Cloud Fog Tea.

1055
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,060
I just brewed a pot for you.

1056
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,980
Okay.

1057
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,900
How nice.

1058
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,570
The men only know how to enjoy wine,

1059
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,500
but no one appreciates the fragrance of the tea.

1060
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,340
How nice.

1061
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:31,980
Hi.

1062
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
Xingfu Inn.

1063
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,460
Next Friday?

1064
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,610
Let me check for you.

1065
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,690
Sorry.

1066
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,060
It's fully booked for next Friday.

1067
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,690
We only have rooms

1068
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,980
for the coming Thursday.

1069
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,570
It's fine.

1070
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,940
You can only come on weekends, right?

1071
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,570
Sure.

1072
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,020
Why don't you leave me your phone number?

1073
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,690
I'll take it down.

1074
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,610
I'll get back to you
when we have rooms available.

1075
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:08,940
Sure.

1076
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,020
I've noted it down.

1077
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,420
Sure.

1078
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,130
I'll let you know once there are rooms available.

1079
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,500
Sure. Bye.

1080
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,420
Over here.

1081
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:20,900
Xingfu.

1082
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:23,690
Mr. Xie.

1083
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,460
She's my sister.

1084
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,060
You're here.

1085
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,290
She's also the owner of the inn.

1086
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,090
Make yourself at home.

1087
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,090
-Let her know if you need any help.
-Hi.

1088
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:31,940
Xingfu.

1089
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,060
They are the honored guests of the Group.

1090
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,500
Mr. Xie and his assistant.

1091
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,380
So,

1092
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,340
can you help me to take good care of them

1093
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,570
for the coming two days?

1094
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,770
Can I have your ID cards?

1095
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,020
-They're with me.
-Please register here.

1096
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:44,540
Xingfu.

1097
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,820
This is the test report
of the water quality assessment

1098
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,090
done by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

1099
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,820
Mr. Xie, it's your first time here, right?

1100
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,090
How do you feel about this place?

1101
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,090
This is an article written by Mr. Wu

1102
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,460
about his living experience in this place.

1103
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,380
He compliments the water here
for its superior quality.

1104
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,170
Xingfu, we're all done.

1105
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,420
Sure.

1106
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,860
Mr. Xie, it's done.

1107
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,980
Give me the room key.

1108
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:30,980
I'll lead the way.

1109
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,420
Xingfu.

1110
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,730
I'll come with you.

1111
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,940
Mr. Xie, this way, please.

1112
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,980
This is your room.

1113
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,170
I got you a room at the top of the mountain.

1114
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,130
This is the best room here.

1115
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,340
You'll get a pretty view.

1116
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,420
Look at your surroundings.

1117
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,770
How amazing the view is.

1118
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,650
This is it.

1119
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,460
Please come in.

1120
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,730
I hope you'll like it.

1121
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,500
Yes.

1122
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,250
Then...

1123
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,090
Mr. Xie,

1124
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:06,570
have a good rest.

1125
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,340
This is your room key.

1126
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,340
Mr. Wan and Mr. Mo

1127
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,820
will be here in a while to invite you for...

1128
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,900
What's wrong with him?

1129
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,460
You saw it yourself.

1130
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,980
That's why

1131
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,060
it's difficult

1132
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,770
to please him.

1133
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,540
Make sure

1134
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,770
you serve him the best food later.

1135
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,610
Everything has to be top-notch.

1136
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,020
After all, the group is paying the bill.

1137
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,610
What do you mean by top-notch?

1138
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,900
Serve him the most expensive things on the menu.

1139
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,500
It seems like

1140
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,500
the inn

1141
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,770
has been doing

1142
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:42,770
pretty well.

1143
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,170
Do you think

1144
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,610
we can get some money

1145
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,650
from them?

1146
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,210
My cute son.

1147
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,250
Come and give me a hug.

1148
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,290
How do you know I'm here?

1149
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:55,940
Qinglai.

1150
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,380
Good boy.

1151
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,090
What's the matter, Mom?

1152
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,500
I need to tell you something.

1153
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,060
The inn

1154
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,250
is doing pretty well recently.

1155
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,170
Do you think we can use some of the money

1156
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,420
to plan Qingzhi's wedding?

1157
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:13,820
Little Dou.

1158
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,170
Go and play by yourself.

1159
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,420
Ride the bicycle.

1160
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,130
Qingzhi is not in a hurry to get married,

1161
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,570
so why are you so anxious?

1162
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,610
He needs money,

1163
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,250
and he's too shy to ask for money.

1164
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,460
All the money in the inn is from crowdfunding.

1165
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,730
All the transactions are transparent

1166
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,020
and everyone is monitoring it.

1167
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,650
Moreover,

1168
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,860
we can't withdraw the cash anyway.

1169
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,690
Are you not going to help your family?

1170
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,610
You're the elder brother.

1171
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,290
Do you not care for your younger brother?

1172
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,500
Do I look like I don't care for him?

1173
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,090
We're too old,

1174
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,290
and we can't be of help.
