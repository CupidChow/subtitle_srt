[Episode 26]

3
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,860
Good boy.

4
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,500
Mom and Dad are leaving now.

5
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,420
We're leaving.

6
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,810
Take this.

7
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,620
I would love to take you along.

8
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,060
We're leaving now.

9
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,780
Xingfu.

10
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,620
You don't have to come back in such a rush.

11
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,980
I'll give you another day off.

12
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,340
Stay home with your child.

13
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,420
No way.

14
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,090
We came out in a rush.

15
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,530
There are things to be done.

16
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,370
I must go back.

17
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:56,860
Qinglai.

18
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,220
Are you busy at the construction site?

19
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,860
Why don't you stay here for another day?

20
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,620
Both of you just leave.

21
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,370
Little Dou doesn't have a fever anymore.

22
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:03,980
-It's fine now.
-That's right.

23
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,500
Go back. Don't delay your work.

24
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,580
Yes. Just leave.

25
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,090
Mr. Guan.

26
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,650
Leave together.

27
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,690
Thank you.

28
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,780
You've been busy all night.

29
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,690
It's fine. I slept well last night.

30
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,130
Dad, take him.

31
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,180
Here, come to Grandpa.

32
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,740
Dad, make sure he drinks enough water.

33
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,460
Okay.

34
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,180
I'm leaving now. Be good.

35
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,370
-Don't cry.
-Don't cry.

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,370
Bye, good boy.

37
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,060
Say bye to Mom.

38
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,620
Take care of yourself.

39
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,900
-Bye.
-Bye.

40
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,500
Drive safe.

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,410
Goodbye, Mr. Guan.

42
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,220
Okay, goodbye.

43
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,740
Goodbye.

44
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,570
-Take care.
-Okay.

45
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,340
Okay.

46
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,300
This is our workplace.

47
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,620
The New Fangyuan Law Firm.

48
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,940
Have a look.

49
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,650
Isn't it big?

50
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,020
Qinglai.

51
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,970
Look.

52
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,940
Your job is divided into two parts.

53
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,740
One is cleaning.

54
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,220
Such as the windowsills

55
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,300
and the sofa.

56
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,850
They need to be cleaned.

57
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,340
Remember the vacuuming.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,410
You must clean the floor daily.

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,740
And this.

60
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,460
The client left this yesterday.

61
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,940
It must be cleaned.

62
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,410
This is the bar.

63
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,620
Here's where the glasses are.

64
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,410
There are tea and coffee here.

65
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,340
When there are clients, make them

66
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,460
tea or coffee.

67
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,460
You can either come earlier like today

68
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,900
or leave later.

69
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,250
They work overtime sometimes.

70
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,180
It's unsure when they leave.

71
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,130
You may leave first

72
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,500
and come earlier the next day to clean.

73
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,460
This is the office of Mr. Wang.

74
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,020
This is the office of Mr. Guan.

75
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,060
Look at their

76
00:03:59,130 --> 00:03:59,900
tables

77
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,850
and bookshelves.

78
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,530
All need to be cleaned.

79
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,460
But beware when you clean,

80
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,500
move things away to clean

81
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,940
then put them back.

82
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,740
Don't touch their things.

83
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,130
Hey,

84
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,250
I won't do that.

85
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,250
So long as you know the rules.

86
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,370
They may not be happy if you touch their stuff.

87
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,540
The bookshelves

88
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,300
need to be cleaned daily.

89
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,860
Wipe all of them.

90
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,210
These books are expensive.

91
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,540
Who is this?

92
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,250
None of your business.

93
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,740
Just don't touch it.

94
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,810
We can't afford anything here.

95
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,690
Okay.

96
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,810
Be careful when you clean.

97
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,660
Wipe the tables carefully.

98
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,690
Look at how clean I keep this place.

99
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,500
It's dusty.

100
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,010
Nonsense.

101
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,210
This is a copier.

102
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,250
A copier?

103
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,300
What does it do?

104
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,300
It's quite complicated.

105
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,570
I'll teach you soon.

106
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,100
This place may look big,

107
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,660
but it requires much less work than before.

108
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,690
You call this less work?

109
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,250
We don't need to clean the toilets.

110
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,620
It's all under property management.

111
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,540
Where do you work normally?

112
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,980
Here.

113
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,770
This is my workplace.

114
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,570
Here?

115
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,250
The reception.

116
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,300
Seems like a comfortable position.

117
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,100
I'll be more comfortable when you're here.

118
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,540
So I'm here to save you from the workload.

119
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,500
Let me tell you.

120
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,010
The people who work here are all well-educated.

121
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,100
They may look young,

122
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,500
but they're very capable.

123
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,810
So please be aware.

124
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,300
You must respect them.

125
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,370
Respect?

126
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,860
You mean mutual respect.

127
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,210
Where do I stay when there's no work?

128
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,500
Where?

129
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,740
No work?

130
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,330
You have a lot of work.

131
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,980
When someone needs you,

132
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,180
make sure you attend to them well.

133
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,250
When you really have no work to do,

134
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,210
you can come in here.

135
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,450
This is our tool room.

136
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,860
All the tools are here.

137
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,210
When you're free,

138
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,570
you may rest here.

139
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,210
Okay.

140
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,130
Good morning, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang.

141
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:56,860
Good morning.

142
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,370
Morning.

143
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,500
Good morning.

144
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,740
-Good morning, Xingfu.
-Morning.

145
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,300
Good morning.

146
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,060
Good morning.

147
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,860
Good morning, Mr. Guan.

148
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,620
Hey.

149
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,620
You're here.

150
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,450
Mr. Guan.

151
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,180
Welcome.

152
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,860
I'm here.

153
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,420
Mr. Guan.

154
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,940
I gave him a tour and

155
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,860
told him what to do.

156
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,420
I'll teach him the details

157
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,450
gradually.

158
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,450
Okay.

159
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,370
From now on, you're in charge of reception only.

160
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,980
You'll handle the rest of the work, Qinglai.

161
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,690
Thank you.

162
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,450
-Okay.
-Okay.

163
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,370
Let me introduce you to everyone.

164
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,010
Mr. Guan.

165
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:34,980
Can you

166
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,770
not tell them about our relationship?

167
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,450
Why?

168
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,450
Xingfu is close to everyone here.

169
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,660
We're like a family.

170
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,660
There's no problem.

171
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,010
I don't want them to know about our relationship.

172
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,980
It's bad for work, right?

173
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,770
I'm fine. As he wishes.

174
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,810
Okay, I'll tell them

175
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,980
you're the new handyman.

176
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,500
And I won't say anything else?

177
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,570
Okay. Sure.

178
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,210
Come on.

179
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,010
Let me introduce a new colleague to you.

180
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,500
This...

181
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,250
Qinglai, come here.

182
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:09,860
Here.

183
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,420
This is our new handyman.

184
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,940
From now on,

185
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,690
Xingfu is only in charge of the reception.

186
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,330
If you need anything,
you can ask Qinglai for help.

187
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,770
-Okay.
-Alright.

188
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,060
Say hello to everyone.

189
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,180
I'm Wang Qinglai.

190
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,250
Okay, let's get back to work.

191
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,010
Feel free.

192
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,740
Okay.

193
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,300
Make way.

194
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,330
Here.

195
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,750
[Mr. Guan Tao]

196
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,250
There are many law books on the bookshelves.

197
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,570
You can read them when you're free.

198
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,690
Why should I read those?

199
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,330
I'm not a lawyer.

200
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,890
You don't need to be a lawyer to read law books.

201
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,180
If you know the law,

202
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,010
you can protect yourself.

203
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,810
What if it comes in handy?

204
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,010
You're here to protect me.

205
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,980
The law is a way of thinking.

206
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,420
It helps us to see the world

207
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,740
in another perspective.

208
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,060
Look.

209
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,940
Where did you

210
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,210
learn all this from?

211
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,300
From books.

212
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,140
You're turning into a bookworm.

213
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,900
You believe everything in the books.

214
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,260
Yes, I do.

215
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,380
It's such a great opportunity
to work in a law firm.

216
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,450
Yet you don't learn.

217
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,570
Leave me alone, okay?

218
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,900
Manage your own business.

219
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,660
They're coming to work soon.

220
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,730
Are you done?

221
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,450
I'm done.

222
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,140
Xingfu.

223
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,850
Come and soak your feet.

224
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:16,850
Hey.

225
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,210
What are you doing?

226
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,570
It's already 121,000 yuan.

227
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,210
We save 3,000 yuan per month.

228
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,780
In another three months,
we'll have 130,000 yuan.

229
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,900
I'm going to soak my feet if you don't.

230
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,020
Come on, the temperature is just right.

231
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,330
Come on.

232
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,690
Is it good?

233
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,090
I'll add in more hot water.

234
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,540
A bit more.

235
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,730
Alright now.

236
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,540
Have a look at this.

237
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,450
Say Daddy, Little Dou.

238
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,450
Say Daddy and Mommy.

239
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,660
Baby, come on.

240
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,020
Say Mommy.

241
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,970
(Daddy, Mommy.)

242
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,780
-Good morning.
-Morning.

243
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,140
Good morning.

244
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,970
-Good morning.
-Morning.

245
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,490
-Good morning.
-Morning.

246
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,210
-Good morning, Mr. Guan.
-Morning.

247
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,540
Good morning.

248
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,420
-Morning, Xingfu.
-Morning.

249
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,060
Oh right, is there a post?

250
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,420
Yes.

251
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,450
Here you go.

252
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,970
The case of PAX Crowdfunding.

253
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,420
Thank you.

254
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,540
Mr. Guan.

255
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,780
What does PAX Crowdfunding mean?

256
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,730
PAX is a noun.

257
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,490
Crowdfunding is a verb.

258
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,090
In a nutshell,

259
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,180
crowdfunding is...

260
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,540
For example, if you have a project

261
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,140
but you don't have enough capital,

262
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,660
you can upload the overview of your project

263
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,690
online.

264
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,020
If there are netizens

265
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,940
who are interested in your project,

266
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,780
and if they trust you

267
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,300
at the same time,

268
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,810
they'll help you

269
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,730
in raising the fund.

270
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,210
Once you have the money,

271
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,610
you can do the project you want.

272
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,260
This is quite a good thing.

273
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:41,970
Yes.

274
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,450
It's a good thing.

275
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,780
But the people aren't always good.

276
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,180
Nowadays,

277
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,180
some people

278
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,780
use crowdfunding as a guise

279
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,060
to do things

280
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,490
like fundraising scams.

281
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,810
For example,

282
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:55,900
this case.

283
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,690
I get it now.

284
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,180
Comrade Xingfu, may I go to work now?

285
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,300
Go ahead.

286
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,300
Morning, Mr. Guan.

287
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:08,780
Good morning.

288
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,260
Morning, Xingfu.

289
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,060
Here we are.

290
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,140
Let's go.

291
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,940
Walk faster.

292
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,180
What's going on?

293
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,660
It's broken.

294
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,210
The flower is still good.

295
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,180
Why is it thrown away?

296
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,570
Don't pick up flowers on the roadside.

297
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,610
Hold on.

298
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,570
Let's go.

299
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,850
This is good.

300
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,850
Go through it again.

301
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:47,660
Okay.

302
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,060
Qinglai, what are you doing?

303
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,420
Hey, Mr. Guan.

304
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,140
I picked up a pot of plants.

305
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,450
I'm fixing it.

306
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,260
Oh, right.

307
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,090
Do I have a post?

308
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,180
The client said it was delivered.

309
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,610
Yes, there's one.

310
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,900
Here.

311
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,210
Qinglai, remember,

312
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,450
whenever there's a post,

313
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,690
pass it to me instantly.

314
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,570
Lest it's something important.

315
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,090
You weren't here,

316
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,140
so I just left it in the storeroom.

317
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,380
Then I forgot about it.

318
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:32,970
Sorry.

319
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,490
Leave it at the reception next time.

320
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,940
Okay.

321
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,090
Besides,

322
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,810
can you not

323
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,970
do this here?

324
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,450
The coffee table is full of dirt.

325
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,690
What if a client

326
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,450
walks in and sees it?

327
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,330
It's okay. I'm going to tidy up.

328
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,420
I'll clean it up soon.

329
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,490
Very soon.

330
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,460
This...

331
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,250
Wow.

332
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,530
Isn't this the pot of plant
you picked up by the roadside?

333
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,130
Yes.

334
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,730
How do you like it?

335
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,100
You fixed the pot.

336
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,220
That's amazing.

337
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,490
It's just fixing the pot. No big deal.

338
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,490
Let's place it here.

339
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,980
Whose flower is this?

340
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,580
It looks good.

341
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,980
He did it.

342
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,370
Why is it placed here?

343
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,100
It looks better on my table.

344
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,060
It looks good here.

345
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,460
Whoever comes in can see it.

346
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,250
Qinglai.

347
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,490
Are you trying

348
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,940
to impress Xingfu?

349
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,100
This...

350
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,900
Isn't this the pot of flower you fixed?

351
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,770
Yes.

352
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,420
Do you like this kind of work?

353
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,380
Yes.

354
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,330
Then don't waste your talent.

355
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,490
Get some money from the accountant later.

356
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,330
I'll approve of it.

357
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,330
Decorate the firm.

358
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,140
Having some plants make

359
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,330
the place look lively.

360
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,090
Okay.

361
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,140
But the premise

362
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,770
is not to have dirt everywhere.

363
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,700
Sure thing.

364
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,290
Do you like it?

365
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,660
What? Get back to work.

366
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,570
Okay.

367
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,530
Leave it.

368
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,420
I'll place it here.

369
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,730
Xingfu,

370
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,380
are you opening a flower shop?

371
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,860
Qinglai did it.

372
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,220
He once picked up a flower pot

373
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,090
and it survived.

374
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,620
After being encouraged

375
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:58,980
by Guan Tao,

376
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,860
he turned the law firm into a garden.

377
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,090
And then he turned this place into a garden.

378
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,810
Whenever he has time,

379
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,220
he either digs a bag of soil

380
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,730
or looks for some plants.

381
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,770
I told him to come home after work,

382
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,140
yet he went to the park for more plants.

383
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,460
Isn't this good?

384
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,290
Think about it.

385
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,290
Everyone has something he likes to do.

386
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,180
Since he likes this, let him be.

387
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,180
I'm not stopping him.

388
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,900
Besides,

389
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,050
ever since

390
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,420
he started growing these plants,

391
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,290
he became more spirited.

392
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,380
He doesn't grumble anymore.

393
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,770
Isn't it great?

394
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,420
Yes.

395
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,770
I'm thinking

396
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,140
about opening a plant nursery for him.

397
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,660
So he can work there.

398
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,290
It must be better than working in a law firm.

399
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,660
I think that's a good idea.

400
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,050
Qinglai

401
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,220
likes to work

402
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,090
with dirt and soil.

403
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,980
I finally

404
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,330
know Qinglai.

405
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,140
He's indeed a countryman.

406
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,010
You're gossiping about me again.

407
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,460
How is it possible, Qinglai?

408
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,530
What's in that bag?

409
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,090
Soil.

410
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,860
Wash your hands and eat.

411
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,420
Stop taking plants from the park.

412
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,900
That's public property.

413
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,290
I was just pruning their branches.

414
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,940
The plants don't grow well without pruning.

415
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,180
The guard of the park, Du,

416
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,940
is also a gardener.

417
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,290
Every time I prune the plants,

418
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,940
he serves me good tea and cigarette.

419
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,730
Or else he would need to prune them.

420
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,980
I'm helping him by pruning the plants.

421
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,220
Don't talk nonsense if you don't understand.

422
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,730
Okay, I don't understand.

423
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,050
I'm wrong.

424
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,010
Exactly. You don't know gardening

425
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,530
as good as Qinglai.

426
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,140
I don't know if he has other talents,

427
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,730
but gardening is his expertise.

428
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,050
Although they're lawyers,

429
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,140
they have to ask me about plants.

430
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:00,220
Do you know?

431
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,140
They often ask me about their plants at home,

432
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,250
which are badly planted.

433
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,090
I don't ask for money for that.

434
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,900
Qinglai is very popular in our firm.

435
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,730
They even gave him a raise.

436
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,140
Awesome, Qinglai.

437
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:19,900
Mr. Liu.

438
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,900
I changed the soil

439
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,010
of your plants.

440
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,050
Water it once a week.

441
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,570
Don't water it like you used to.

442
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,460
Okay, thank you.

443
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,010
You're welcome.

444
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,730
There's a spider.

445
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,250
A red one.

446
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,050
Let me do it.

447
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,490
It's in the notebook.

448
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,490
Okay, it's settled now.

449
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:46,900
It's gone now.

450
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,900
Qinglai.

451
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,050
Ever since

452
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,700
we have so many plants here,

453
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,250
there have been a lot of insects.

454
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,250
Can you spray some insecticide?

455
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:54,810
Indeed.

456
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,140
The plants can't be sprayed.

457
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,380
Besides,

458
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,220
an insecticide doesn't work universally.

459
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,940
It can't be solved so easily.

460
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,140
I think

461
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,180
the plants look good from afar.

462
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,050
When I get closer to them,

463
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,730
they smell pungent.

464
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,180
[Chief's office]
It's the fertilizer.

465
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,700
If you want the plants to look and smell good,

466
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,810
you can't leave out the fertilizer.

467
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,050
Besides, without the smell of fertilizer,

468
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,660
the flowers won't be fragrant.

469
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:17,770
You don't understand.

470
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:18,900
Smell it, and see how fragrant it is.

471
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,250
That's enough, Qinglai.

472
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:20,730
That's enough.

473
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,090
-It's fine.
-Don't you have work to do?

474
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,140
Qinglai.

475
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,660
Mr. Guan.

476
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,730
I happened to be looking for you.

477
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,570
This is the receipt

478
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,250
for the fertilizers and pots I bought.

479
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,420
Please sign it

480
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,090
so I can reimburse it.

481
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,050
Here.

482
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,620
Thank you.

483
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,220
Qinglai.

484
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,490
It's good

485
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,220
that you like plants.

486
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:51,860
However,

487
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,460
you shouldn't delay your regular work.

488
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:57,810
Here.

489
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,220
Okay.

490
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,220
By the way,

491
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,980
please send this out.

492
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,980
Okay, I'll water the plants first.

493
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,860
Then I'll send it.

494
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,730
No, I...

495
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,010
I'll send it.

496
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,330
Xingfu.

497
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,010
Come to see me

498
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,330
when you're done.

499
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,530
Okay.

500
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,810
Thank you.

501
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,940
Why did you hit me?

502
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,460
Xingfu.

503
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,490
You should talk to Qinglai.

504
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,900
This can't go on this way.

505
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,770
After all,

506
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,570
he should do his job.

507
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,980
He can't only be caring for the plants.

508
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,460
Yes. You said it casually once,

509
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,140
yet he's getting more and more into it.

510
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,380
Mr. Guan.

511
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,140
It's mainly because

512
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,330
Qinglai has always

513
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,530
liked to plant and farm.

514
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,330
He's happy when he does these things.

515
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,730
Things haven't been going well
in the city for him.

516
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,940
Since he's happy,

517
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,090
I didn't stop him.

518
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,220
I can tell

519
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,900
that he really likes

520
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,180
to take care of those plants.

521
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,250
But after all, this is a law firm,

522
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,490
not a greenhouse.

523
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,810
In the beginning, people found it interesting,

524
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,250
they liked it,

525
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,010
and were happy about it.

526
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,730
But recently,

527
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,290
Qinglai has been doing things wrong.

528
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,530
He can't make gardening his main business

529
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,570
and ignore his real job.

530
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,700
This is not okay.

531
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,980
I know he has his pride.

532
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,090
He doesn't even want people here to know

533
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,330
about your relationship.

534
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,490
I understand that.

535
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,220
He doesn't want others to look down on him

536
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,420
for making less money than you.

537
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,220
Therefore,

538
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,180
I didn't tell anyone.

539
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,050
But you saw it today,

540
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,380
he didn't even take my order seriously.

541
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,140
Yes.

542
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,730
Besides,

543
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,940
you're the one
who has been buying lunch for him, right?

544
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,460
He leaves on time

545
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,290
during lunch break.

546
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,660
I'm very sure

547
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,380
that he's not in the law firm now.

548
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,330
Mr. Guan.

549
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,180
I'll keep an eye on him

550
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,770
so he doesn't delay his work

551
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,420
and put you in a difficult position.

552
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,900
Xingfu.

553
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,010
You must understand me.

554
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,900
We have more employees now.

555
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,140
It's not the same
as when there were the four of us.

556
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,570
If I allow him

557
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,730
to work like this,

558
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,010
how can I manage the others?

559
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,660
Besides kindness,

560
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,180
a team also requires

561
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,090
discipline.

562
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,180
Yes, I get it.

563
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,140
I'll talk to him at home.

564
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,330
Hello.

565
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,250
Yes?

566
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,530
I am.

567
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,420
What?

568
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,250
Okay, I'm coming.

569
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:08,530
What's going on?

570
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,010
Qinglai is arrested by the police.

571
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,530
What happened?

572
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,490
They insisted that I stole the plants.

573
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,900
The pruning is good for the plants.

574
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,180
The plants are still right there.

575
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,770
I propagated

576
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,860
the cut branches.

577
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,180
Otherwise, they would have thrown them away.

578
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,220
Isn't this a win-win situation?

579
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,420
In the countryside,

580
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,660
we could pluck any flowers.

581
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,570
It's no big deal.

582
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,530
Yet this is considered stealing in the city.

583
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,700
What win-win situation?

584
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,330
I told you many times

585
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,730
to stop doing it.

586
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,180
Are you happy now?

587
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,660
They arrested you as a thief.

588

Who's Wang Qinglai's family?

589
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,380

Hello, officer.

I'm Wang Qinglai's employer

May I know what happened?

595
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,530
It wasn't a huge issue actually.

596
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,090
He was cutting plants in the public garden.

597
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,090
He also took away some branches.

598
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,180
The guards found out.

599
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,090
They started arguing and fighting.

600
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,660
We've mediated between them just now.

601
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,180
By the way,

602
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,050
pruning is a good thing.

603
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,290
But taking away the cut branches

604
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,090
can cause unnecessary suspicion.

605
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,570
Please take him back to educate him.

00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,010
From what I heard,

607
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,940
this isn't his first time doing this.

608
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,460
Sorry, officer.

609
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,490
Sorry for the trouble.

610
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,330

Legally speaking,

617
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,460
the plants in the public garden
are state property.

618
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,330
No one can touch them without permission.

619
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,810
Not to mention that you actually pruned them.

620
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,770
You shouldn't have done this.

621
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,700
In that case,

622
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,090
many plants

623
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,770
in the law firm were propagated by me.

624
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,090
Does it mean that the law firm

625
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,140
is a place to hide the stolen?

626
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,860

00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,420
it may not seem to be a big problem

00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,380
Thank you.

870
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,170
Qinglai.

871
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,210
Great timing. Here.

872
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,250
Please post this for me.

873
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:25,570
Okay.

874
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,050
Hurry up, alright?

875
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,380
Qinglai, tidy up the table.

876
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,210
A client is coming.

877
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,210
I have to post this first.

878
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:35,980
He's coming soon.

879
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,780
Please tidy it up now.

880
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:37,690
Okay.

881
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,340
I'm sorry.

882
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:05,940
This way, please.

883
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:13,860
Xingfu.

884
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,900
Are you having problems

885
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,020
with your husband?

886
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,530
What?

887
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,130
I can tell.

888
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,250
You usually help him

889
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,500
and he's quite relaxed.

890
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,170
Now that you don't help him, he's clumsy.

891
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,210
He deserves it.

892
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,460
He needs a lesson.

893
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,940
You're just saying it.

894
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,090
All your eyes are on him.

895
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,690
Look at you.

896
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,730
You're more tired while not helping him.

897
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,690
Qin.

898
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,300
It's working hours.

899
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,020
Go back to work.

900
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:50,690
I'm leaving.
