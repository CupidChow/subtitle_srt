3
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,719
Hey!

4
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,560
Where are you going

5
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,640
in a hurry?

6
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,799
I'll need an explanation from them.

7
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:41,799
From who?

8
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,000
Mr. Ma.

9
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,959
He needs to tell me

10
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,760
why he arrested Mr. Wan.

11
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,719
There is no misunderstanding whatsoever.

12
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,680
We have investigated

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
thoroughly.

14
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:03,920
No need

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,840
to panic.

16
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,280
You are not involved in it at all.

17
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,439
You keep saying that I'm not involved.

18
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,840
But I am!

19
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,120
Didn't all this happen

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,319
because of my letter?

21
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,680
You were there.

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,599
When you guys came,

23
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,439
we were celebrating

24
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,400
my child's hundred days birthday.

25
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,520
It was peaceful.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,560
Nothing bad was happening.

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,319
Why did you arrest him?

28
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,319
How is my family

29
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,599
going to face other villagers?

30
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,840
How will the others

31
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,639
view us?

32
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,919
How awkward will it be?

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,759
Xingfu.

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,159
You worry too much.

35
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,240
Come, have a seat.

36
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,759
Don't you worry.

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,759
We

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,759
will explain

39
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,800
to the other village leaders

40
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,080
in person.

41
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,800
Of course.

42
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,080
It's inadequate

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,439
to dismiss your involvement

44
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,479
in this matter.

45
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,599
However, it's mostly

46
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,719
because Mr. Wan Shantang

47
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,800
exercises almost no caution

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,759
in handling

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,319
the grassroots administrative work.

50
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,120
He can't just

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,199
resort to any means

52
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,520
in order to maintain top efficiency.

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,400
We have also

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,280
collected your husband Wang Qinglai's
medical report

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,319
and medical history

56
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,719
from the county hospital.

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,240
Legally speaking,

58
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,800
he sustained a minor injury.

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,080
After being transferred to the police,

60
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,960
they've decided

61
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,319
Mr. Wan Shantang's penalty

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,280
will be administrative detention.

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,360
Meanwhile,

64
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,919
the higher-ups from our party

65
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,319
will also

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
give a warning to Wan Shantang.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,199
The higher-ups

68
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,400
also wish

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,039
to use this as a cautionary tale

70
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,960
for other front-line members

71
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,039
so that they are more careful

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,360
with their working approach.

73
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,319
Why can't you just reprimand him?

74
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,319
Also,

75
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,120
Qinglai is fully healed now.

76
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,800
We don't want to sue him.

77
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,400
Can't we do this another way?

79

you are not involved in this.

and the fact

84
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,159
cannot be anymore clearer.

Why are you here?

91
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,919
Didn't I ask you to go to the county?

92
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,319
This

93
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,319
is the least of your worry now.

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,839
You two

95
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,199
should focus on your work.

have to act tough?

I'll leave the village in your hands.

If the villagers are worried,

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,480
you need to explain to them.

106
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,600
Explain?

107
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,240
Why bother with that?

108
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,639
Who can explain to me then?

109
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,759
Why don't you go

110
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,759

Everyone thinks

113
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,360
the Wangs took great advantage of you.

114

The Wang family

115
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,720
are greedy

116
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,639
and they schemed

117

to put you in here.

118
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,560
They are repaying your kindness with pain.

119

Enough.

Stop complaining.

If you didn't cause trouble all the time

122

and get sued

124

into one word,

134
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,720
domineering.

All villagers of Wan Village

138

think highly of you.

139
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
And you know

140
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,519
I never abuse my power.

141
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:06,959
Never.

142
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,120
Nothing of the sort.

143
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,560
Perhaps

144
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,079
I am too self-important.

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,519
I always feel like

146
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,399
Wan Village depends on me.

147
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,279
It's quite a responsibility.

148
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,319
Ever since

149
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,879
I started my own business,

150
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,439
everyone followed my lead.

151
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,639
They do

152
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,879
what I tell them to.

153
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,079
And it's been three decades.

154
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,160
How did I manage to do that?

155
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,600
By being domineering?

156
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm stumped now.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,240
I don't get it.

158
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,360
So I'm supposed to be selfish

159
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,360
and ignore others' interests?

160
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,199
When I see people trying to take advantage
of the group,

161
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,839
should I just turn a blind eye

162
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,879
and let them go ahead with it?

163
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,879
Is that what they want?

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,839
Mr. Wan.

165
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,199
Calm down.

166
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,279
Everyone knows

167

what you have done for us

168
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,279
all these years.

They all

170
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,000
remember your good deeds.

171
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,560
I'm not angry.

172
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,920
I just don't get it.

173
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,240
I remember

174
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,519
that one time,

175
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,480

with the county leader.

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,040
For my passport,

177
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,240
I needed to show

178
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,480
that I had no criminal record.

179
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,480
I turned to Officer Li.

180
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,759
He joked with me.

181
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,519
He said

182
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,279
that I

183
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,920
could never ever

184
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,000
commit a crime.

185
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
And now,

186
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,879
my record is stained.

187
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,319
I have had enough.

188
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,839
Go back now.

189
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,040
Dad!

190
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,560
Mr. Wan!

191
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,439
-What's happening?
-What's going on?

192
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,279
Mr. Wan!

193
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,000
Dad!

194
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,079
Dad!

195
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,639
-Come out now!
-Come out now!

196
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,480
Why sue Mr. Wan?

197
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,279
He's nothing but kind to us.

198
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,920
-Come out now.
-Come out now.

199
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,560
-Come out!
-Come out!

200
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,879
Come out now, He Xingfu!

201
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,759
-Come out!
-Come out!

202
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,919
-Show yourself.
-Come out.

203
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,679
-Come out!
-Come out!

204
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,679
-Come out!
-Come out!

205
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,120
Xingfu, where are you going?

206
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,840
Come out.

207
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,120
-Show yourself.
-Come out.

208
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,600
Stop.

209
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,799
Hear me out.

210
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,200
We have nothing to do with Mr. Wan's arrest.

211
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,240
I even spoke to the investigation team

212
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
and explained to them.

213
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,600
Go ask them if you don't believe me.

214
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,039
Don't you try to put the blame on someone else.

215
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,759
You repaid his kindness with pain.

216
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,000
You took advantage of him
then you put him in jail.

217
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,000
Give back the money you got

218
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,480
from Mr. Wan

219
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,440
and clear his name!

220
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,399
-Clear Mr. Wan's name!
-Clear Mr. Wan's name!

221
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,759
Quick. Go back in.

222
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,519
Clear his name!

223
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,240
Are you all right?

224
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,399
Come out now.

225
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,240
Move aside.

226
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,720
Chuanjia is here.

227
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,960
Chuanjia is here.

228
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,919
He Xingfu!

229
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,000
Come out now!

230
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,679
You like to reason, don't you?

231
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,360
Then come out and I'll reason with you.

232
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,399
-Come out.
-Come out!

233
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,879
Take down their gate.

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,039
Take it down!

235
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,519
He Xingfu.

236
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,200
Take it down!

237
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,639
Come out.

238
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,440
We can't open this gate.

239
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,240
Just take it down.

240
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,960
Order, please!

241
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,879
Move aside.

242
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,720
Move aside.

243
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,240
He Xingfu!

244
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,720
Chuanjia!

245
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,279
Why are you causing a scene here?

246
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,399
Mr. Li, please step aside.

247
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,600
This has nothing to do with you.

248
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,840
I am a police officer.

249
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:04,639
Officer Li?

250
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,399
You are having an illegal assembly.

251
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,360
-I have to be here.
-Officer Li is here.

252
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,120
This is my job.

253
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,279
My dad has a brain hemorrhage.

254
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,320
He's undergoing an operation in the hospital.

255
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,600
It's all thanks to them.

256
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,360
I came today

257
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,279
to settle the score with them.

258
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,080
-Yes!
-Settle the score with them!

259
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,639
Enough!

260
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,919
Quiet!

261
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,919
Chuanjia.

262
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,000
Your father fell ill in the detention center.

263
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,559
How does it have anything to do with them?

264
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,759
Stop making a scene here

265
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,360
and go back.

266
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,799
My dad is in his current condition
because of them!

267
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,159
Yes, my father kicked Wang Qinglai.

268
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,159
He was already arrested.

269
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,440
And now, he has a brain hemorrhage.

270
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
How should we settle this?

271
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,279
-Exactly!
-How should we settle this?

272
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Your father is bed-ridden now

273
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,320
and you're here causing a scene

274
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,200
instead of staying by his side.

275
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,440
Are you even his son?

276
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,399
Move aside, Mr. Li.

277
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,080
I don't want to hurt you because of this family.

278
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,080
I dare you!

279
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,360
Back off!

280
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,320
I will stay here today. Touch me if you dare.

281
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,039
Back off!

282
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,559
Is this what you want?

283
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,240
Yes!

284
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,240
Is this truly what you want?

285
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes!

286
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,679
Fine!

287
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,960
Stay here

288
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,000
with your people

289
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,279
forever.

290
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,600
Don't ever leave.

291
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,519
He Xingfu.

292
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,639
If something bad happens to my father,

293
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,759
no one can protect your family.

294
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,120
Mark my words!

295
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Are you done?

296
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,159
Leave!

297
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,120
Stay here forever then!

298
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:14,960
Forever!

299
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:15,799
-All of you, leave now.
-Leave.

300
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,000
-Leave.
-Leave.

301
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,879
Leave now.

302
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,360
Qinglai.

303
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,360
Xingfu.

304
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,960
Open the door.

305
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,000
They are gone now.

306
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,000
Open the door. They are gone.

307
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,799
Come.

308
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,279
Officer Li.

309
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,000
Thanks, Mr. Li.

310
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
You came just in time.

311
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,600
Any later

312
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,360
and something grave might have happened.

313
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
Cailiang called me

314
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,320
and said Mr. Wan had a stroke
in the detention center.

315
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,399
I thought something might happen

316
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,600
so I came with my people.

317
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,559
Thanks, Mr. Li.

318
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,720
How did everything become like this?

319
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,120
What should we do next?

320
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,639
In my opinion,

321
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,120
these villagers

322
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,279
will not let you

323
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,639
off the hook too easily.

324
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,960
Mr. Li, how is Mr. Wan doing now?

325
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,720
He's safe now,

326
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,960
but he's kept in ICU.

327
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,240
We'll see if he manages to recover.

328
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,480
Don't worry about him.

329
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,879
What about you guys?

330
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,440
Wang,

331
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,799
go back with the others.

332
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,840
We still have many things to do at the station.

333
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,039
I'll join you guys soon.

334
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,039
-Noted.
-Okay.

335
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,759
Don't stand still.

336
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,639
Let's tidy up the place.

337
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,240
Right.

338
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,720
Come inside.

339
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,000
Let's hope that Mr. Wan

340
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,320
makes a full recovery

341
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,480
and can be discharged soon.

342
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,879
Either way,

343
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,279
he's a reasonable

344
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,559
secretary.

345
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,120
He won't do what Chuanjia did.

346
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,559
What if he can't make a full recovery anytime soon?

347
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,639
Xingfu.

348
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,279
Do you

349
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,840
want to stay with your mother for a few days?

350
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,399
No.

351
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,159
I can't drag my mother

352
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,519
into this.

353
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,960
Her village is close to ours.

354
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,320
I can't possibly hide from the crowd.

355
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,000
Can't you just talk some sense into Wan Chuanjia?

356
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,279
There, there.

357
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,919
Who did it?

358
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,559
What is going on?

359
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,440
Who's there?

360
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,200
Look.

361
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,240
This is dangerous.

362
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,919
Qinglai, you can't stay here.

363
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,879
Go to the city with your wife

364
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,279
and stay with Qingzhi.

365
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,559
That's a good idea.

366
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,039
You guys should lay low.

367
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,919
Don't hesitate.

368
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,200
Just go to the city.

369
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,120
What is it?

370
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,080
Why aren't you eating?

371
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,559
The dishes are getting cold.

372
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,720
Xingfu.

373
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,159
Bring me the half bottle of wine.

374
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,639
I want to drink with Qinglai.

375
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:41,720
Dad.

376
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,360
I don't want to drink.

377
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,200
You can drink it some other time.

378
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,919
Drink it.

379
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,440
There's no better occasion than now.

380
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,600
Xingfu, go get it.

381
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,200
Xiuyu.

382
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,360
You work for Wanjia Group.

383
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,919
Did someone give you any trouble?

384
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,919
And on your way back?

385
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,279
It's fine.

386
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,159
There were only some people
who yelled at me from afar.

387
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:09,960
I see.

388
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,440
Just take two days' leave

389
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,360
and stay at home.

390
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,000
But why should I?

391
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,039
If I skip work for three days,

392
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,600
half of my monthly salary will be deducted.

393
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:40,720
Come.

394
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,840
Come.

395
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,519
Dad.

396
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,519
This is serious.

397
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,159
If we...

398
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,120
Enough.

399
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,559
Stop talking about it.

400
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,600
As long as both of you

401
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,960
are safe.

402
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,080
Come.

403
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,919
Your father may be timid

404
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,120
but he's also right.

405
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,159
You must stay safe

406
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,000
in the city.

407
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,960
Mom.

408
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:11,919
Don't worry.

409
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,279
Qingzhi is in the city.

410
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,320
He will take good care of us.

411
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,440
Xingfu.

412
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,620
You're leaving soon.

413
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,060
I have some advice for you.

414
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,660
You need to keep

415
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,540
your temper in check in the city.

416
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,340
Knowing when to make a compromise
will do you good.

417
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,140
Otherwise,

418
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,780
it'll be hard for you to survive anywhere.

419
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:37,780
Okay.

420
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,660
Eat. Dig in.

421
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,940
They are not warm anymore. Eat.

422
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,460
Qinglai.

423
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,940
I have packed something for Qingzhi.

424
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,180
Come with me to get it.

425
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,580
Come.

426
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,060
Here. Come over.

427
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,460
It's here.

428
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,580
What's the matter, Mom?

429
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,500
It's getting cold now.

430
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,500
The city is not as warm as here.

431
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,540
Bring more of these.

432
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,580
Take these.

433
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,780
Don't worry, Mom.

434
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,900
We can take care of ourselves.

435
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,860
I also have some advice for you.

436
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,300
Keep an eye

437
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,180
on your wife in the city.

438
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,820
For what?

439
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,140
She may have a say here in the village,

440
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,340
but not in the city.

441
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,260
That's not what I meant.

442
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,980
Xingfu is quite ambitious.

443
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,940
When she sees the hustle and bustle of the city,

444
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,700
her mind might change.

445
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,660
She might have some other thoughts.

446
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,100
Pay close attention to her.

447
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,300
One, she might get into trouble,

448
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,060
and two,

449
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,140
she might be enticed.

450
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,820
Look.

451
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,740
I sewed a hidden pouch

452
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,060
in your boxers.

453
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:01,860
See?

454
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,460
Look.

455
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,340
Don't tell her. All right?

456
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,500
Mom.

457
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,180
Take it.

458
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,500
Don't forget.

459
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,580
Go now.

460
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,620
The dawn is about to break.

461
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,740
The eggs. Here.

462
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,180
Come. Let me take care of the baby.

463
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,740
Come.

464
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,060
There, there.

465
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,580
Don't worry.

466
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,300
Xingfu. Let's go.

467
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,220
Go.

468
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,900
Let's go.

469
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,540
Mind the trucks!

470
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,180
Dad, Mom.

471
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,740
Goodbye.

472
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,020
Bye.

473
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,540
Qinglai!

474
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:17,980
Qinglai!

475
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,780
Xingfu.

476
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,540
Qinglai, Xingfu.

477
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,340
You came all the way here by bike.

478
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,060
Are you tired?

479
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,660
Not at all.

480
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,860
Let's settle down first.

481
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,180
Let's go then.

482
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,020
Where should I park?

483
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,620
Over there.

484
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,620
There.

485
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,300
Xingfu, you must be exhausted.

486
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,300
Is this a hotel?

487
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,300
[Hanting Hotel]

488
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,340
Qinglai, let me help you.

489
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,900
Wait.

490
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,100
Qingzhi.

491
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,860
This is a hotel. Right?

492
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,420
Why are we here?

493
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,060
We...

494
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,820
Don't you

495
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,900
own an apartment?

496
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,660
Qinglai,

497
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,700
my apartment is under renovation.

498
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,940
This hotel is clean.

499
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,860
I thought

500
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,380
you two could stay here for the moment.

501
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,820
So what if it's under renovation?

502
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,180
We stayed in our house

503
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,940
even though

504
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,380
it was under renovation back then.

505
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,620
We don't care about that.

506
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,660
But Qinglai,

507
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,180
my apartment just finished

508
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,500
renovating.

509
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,460
There's formaldehyde.

510
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,740
It stinks

511
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,900
and is poisonous.

512
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,860
It's fine. We're not afraid.

513
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,500
Let's go.

514
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,300
Don't, Qinglai.

515
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,020
Just listen to me.

516
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,220
Stay here.

517
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,380
It's temporary anyway.

518
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,380
Right, Xingfu?

519
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,780
Maybe we should listen to Qingzhi.

520
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,460
Yes, Qinglai.

521
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Come. Let me unload it.

522
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,340
Xingfu.

523
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:36,860
Qinglai.

524
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,620
What do you think?

525
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,740
How much does it cost per day?

526
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,740
It's not very expensive.

527
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,380
I already paid for three days.

528
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,740
Qinglai.

529
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,500
Now that you moved in,

530
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,300
I'll leave.

531
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,340
Yani

532
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,620
invited me to her place for dinner.

533
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,660
Go then.

534
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,180
We'll deal with the dinner ourselves.

535
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,380
Yeah. Don't worry about us.

536
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,860
All right, Qinglai.

537
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,060
I'll leave then.

538
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,540
If you two are hungry,

539
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,940
there are restaurants downstairs.
They are not expensive.

540
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,100
Call me if anything.

541
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,660
Okay.

542
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,260
Go.

543
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,940
Bye, Xingfu.

544
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,260
You must be tired.

545
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,460
I'll take out the towel

546
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,340
and you can wash your face.

547
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,660
Don't move.

548
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,900
Take everything with us.

549
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,900
Take everything with us and leave.

550
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,620
We won't stay here?

551
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,140
Let's go.

552
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,540
Here.

553
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,620
Here you go.

554
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,500
Thank you.

[Hotel Fee Regulations]
Miss,

556
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,700
how much does our room cost per day?

557
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,860
Which room, may I ask?

558
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,060
8220.

559
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,740
Yes.

560
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,740
8220?

561
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,660
150 yuan per night.

562
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,460
What?

563
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,540
150?

564
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,020
Yes.

565
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,180
That's expensive.

566
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,860
We won't stay here then.

567
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,300
Can we ask for a refund?

568
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,220
Mister.

569
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,860
I can't do this.

570
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
You have checked in

571
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,500
and you also entered the room.

572
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,460
But we didn't touch anything.

573
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,700
You'll still be charged.

574
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,860
It's the rule here.

575
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,500
What kind of rule is this?

576
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,460
How can this be?

577
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,660
You're just taking advantage of us.

578
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,500
We didn't touch anything.

579
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,780
Why would we be charged?

580
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,940
Who's taking advantage of who?

581
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,060
You chose to stay here.

582
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,500
We didn't force you.

583
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,980
But we didn't touch anything.

584
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,020
Well,

585
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,540
we did enter the room

586
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,020
but we stayed only for a few minutes.

587
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,860
We didn't touch anything and we were charged.

588
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,300
And you won't give us a refund.

589
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,940
How is that fair?

590
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,180
The hotel's regulations

591
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,060
and complaint hotline are written there.

592
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,980
Are they just for decorations?

593
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,540
If you charge us illegally,

594
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,260
we will call the complaint hotline.

595
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,540
Madam.

596
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,380
You see.

597
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,740
You have checked in

598
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,060
today.

599
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,860
I can't change that in our system either.

600
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,940
But if you don't want to stay

601
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,980
for the next two days, you can ask for a refund.

602
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,540
I'll have to charge you for today either way.

603
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,580
No.

604
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,500
This won't do.

605
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,420
We won't stay here.

606
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,420
Forget it.

607
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,980
We won't get a refund anyway.

608
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,420
Just stay here for a night then.

609
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,900
We shouldn't let Qingzhi's kindness go to waste.

610
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,540
Just stay.

611
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,420
Fine.

612
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,540
We'll spend a night here.

613
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,380
Okay.

614
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,500
Just one night.

615
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,900
Don't charge us anymore.

616
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,660
Let's go.

617

618
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,060
So expensive.

00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,780
Hello.

620
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,420
Dad.

621
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,140
We have arrived.

622
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,460
Qingzhi has arranged everything for us.

623
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,420
Wonderful.

624
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,580
How is Qingzhi?

625
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,180
He's doing well.

626
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,260
How is Little Dou?

627
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,780
He's doing well too.

628
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,620
Your mom is carrying him now

629
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,740
to put him to sleep.

630
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,820
Okay.

631
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,940
Talk to your parents.

632
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,620
Mom.

633
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,980
Did Chuanjia and the others

634
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,820
bother you again?

635
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,820
Not at all.

636
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,740
Don't worry.

637
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,180
He won't do anything to us.

638
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,380
I told Xiuyu

639
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,900
to ask around

640
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,860
in the company

641
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,220
so that we can get some news about Mr. Wan.

642
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,380
Just stay in the city.

643
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,020
We'll call you

644
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,380
if we have any updates.

645
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:02,900
Yes.

646
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,980
Sleep early then.

647
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,540
Who's there?

648
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,660
You're late.

649
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,660
I went to buy something.

650
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,780
What did you buy?

651
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,900
Roasted duck.

652
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,980
It was a random thought but you took it seriously.

653
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,860
What are you doing?

654
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,140
Mom, Dad.

655
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,020
Qingzhi is here.

656
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,380
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Xu.

657
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,260
Qingzhi is here?

658
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,300
Wash your hands before dinner!

659
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,900
Wait.

660
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,420
Mrs. Xu.

661
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,860
I bought Mr. Xu some roasted duck.

662
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,980
He doesn't eat roasted ducks.

663
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,620
He never likes anything with legs.

664
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,700
Also,

665
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,740
duck is rich in fats.

666
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,940
He has high cholesterol, blood pressure,
and blood sugar.

667
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,140
He can't eat it.

668
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,820
Who knows where you bought it?

669
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,620
Do ducks have a lot of fats?

670
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,940
There is a lot of lean meat in a roasted duck.

671
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,500
Roasted duck is also his favorite.

672
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,460
Let me bring Qingzhi downstairs.

673
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,300
You won't have dinner?

674
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,260
I'll be back soon.

675
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,420
Okay.

676
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,220
Hurry up.

677
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,900
Slow down.

678
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,700
-You're so slow.
-It's chilly outside.

679
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,740
Put on a jacket.

680
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,140
I'm not cold.

681
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,180
Put it on.

682
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,820
Do you

683
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,380
like this car?

684
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,500
Well...

685
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,060
It is beautiful.

686
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,020
The color is a tad too sharp.

687
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,060
You bought a new car?

688
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,940
Try it.

689
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:53,940
Catch this.

690
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,700
Go and try it out.

691
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,700
Careful.

692
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:09,860
I bought

693
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,700
this car for you.

694
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,700
Test drive it.

695
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,380
Come on.

696
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,660
You know very well

697
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,500
that your mom doesn't like me.

698
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,340
If I drive the car you bought me,

699
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,020
I'll get an earful from her.

700
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,260
Why do you keep saying "your mom"?

701
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,580
It sounds so rude.

702
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,660
I...

703
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,580
That's not what I meant.

704
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,460
My apologies.

705
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,780
It's just

706
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
I hope

707
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,180
we can pitch in

708
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,620
together

709
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,620
to buy a car...

710
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,980
And a house.

711
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,580
But didn't you buy a house already?

712
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,020
And I bought a car.

713
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,060
Isn't that fair?

714
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,140
Why are you complaining?

715
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,460
Right.

716
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,300
This is what I think.

717
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,340
A girl

718
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
like you

719
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,020
can easily

720
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,380
find someone

721
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,660
richer than me.

722
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,820
You could have owned

723
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,340
a more expensive car

724
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,180
or lived

725
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,540
in a bigger house.

726
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,140
Qingzhi.

727
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,500
You might think that everyone

728
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,020
wants to have a big house

729
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,260
and an expensive car.

730
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,020
But I believe

731
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,060
people around me are more important.

732
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,100
Also,

733
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,660
knowing your personality,

734
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,420
a big house and an expensive car

735
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,380
are but a matter of time.

736
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,580
Don't sell yourself short.

737
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,340
-Right.
-You hear me?

738
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,020
Yes.

739
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,700
Yes.

740
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,020
Today,

741
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,100
I realized

742
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,900
that you have

743
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,820
a huge plus point.

744
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,020
And what is that?

745
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:39,980
You

746
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,540
have very good taste when it comes to

747
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,940
choosing a boyfriend.

748
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,020
Look at you.

749
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Cheeky.

750
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,300
But in all seriousness,

751
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,540
when we go back up,

752
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,260
my mom will comment on this car.

753
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,860
Don't take it to heart.

754
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,340
Don't worry.

755
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,540
I am immune to your mom...

756
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,500
Your mother.

757
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,460
I am immune

758
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,860
to your mother's complaints.

759
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,260
Whatever she says,

760
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,820
I will ignore it.

761
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,820
And

762
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,660
my heart

763
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,540
belongs to you.

764
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,300
Look at you.

765
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,700
So adorable.

766
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,700
You deserve a kiss.

767
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,460
My office is close to my place.

768
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,260
I think Yani should take the car.

769
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,140
Also, its color

770
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,540
suits Yani a lot.

771
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,260
Also, I believe

772
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,980
I should be the one

773
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,580
to buy Yani a car.

774
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,820
Then she'll never have a car

775
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,740
for the rest of her life.

776
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,140
Mom,

777
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,940
you told me

778
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,260
that if I married Qingzhi,

779
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,420
you would have to buy us a house.

780
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,260
And now?

781
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,100
Have you gotten
the property ownership certificate?

782
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,340
Not yet.

783
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,700
Then, whose name

784
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,980
will appear on the certificate?

785
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,620
Mom.

786
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,180
Qingzhi bought it.

787
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,460
So his name, of course.

788
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,700
But when you two get married,

789
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,660
you have to settle the debt together, don't you?

790
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,780
Also,

791
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,500
we paid for the renovation.

792
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,260
Mom,

793
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,020
as you said,

794
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,420
once we get married, we'll be a family.

795
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,900
So why dwell on this?

796
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,700
This is for your own good.

797
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,140
Mrs. Xu.

798
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,500
I...

799
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,580
Mrs. Xu, you know what?

800
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,660
When we're applying for the certificate,

801
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,820
I'll do

802
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,100
what Yani wants me to.

803
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,540
You hear that?

804
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
-He'll do what I want.
-It's done.

805
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,060
I added my personal touch.

806
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,820
It will at least be as good as Bianyifang's.

807
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,540
Eat up.

808
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,020
I don't want to heat it up again.

809
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,380
Okay.

810
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,180
Hurry.

811
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,900
Treat what was said

812
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,020
as a joke.

813
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,980
Well...

814
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,700
Put your chopsticks down.

815
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
I have a warning for you.

816
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,380
A serious one.

817
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,620
I know

818
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,140
you are the top candidate

819
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,220
from the civil service exam.

820
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,980
But from now on,

821
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,540
wherever you are,

822
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,020
do not get...

823
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,820
How do the young people put it again?

824
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,260
Cocky.

825
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:50,900
Yes.

826
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,900
Do not get cocky.

827
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,260
Of course not, Mr. Xu.

828
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,580
I just joined the workforce not long ago.

829
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,380
Also,

830
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,940
for the sake

831
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,900
of Yani

832
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,340
and you,

833
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,700
I won't let you down.

834
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,540
What about Mrs. Xu?

835
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,060
Of course.

836
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,420
Oh, my.

837
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:11,900
Look.

838
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,620
He's a typical village kid.

839
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,540
Very pragmatic.

840
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,780
Regardless,

841
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,180
those who come from the rural area

842
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,940
will have to

843
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,060
work extra hard.

844
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,780
Careful.

845
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,540
I know.

846
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,700
Let me reverse it a little.

847
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,820
There's one over there.

848
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,100
[Yufengyuan Motel]

849
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,380
Ask for their rate.

850
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,700
Can you handle it?

851
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,900
Don't worry.

852
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,700
This is the cheapest one.

853
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,940
I'll charge you

854
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,500
30 yuan per night.

855
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,340
Okay.

856
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,380
This room

857
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,660
is next to the toilet and the water house.

858
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,620
It might smell

859
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,700
and it is humid.

860
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,020
No one likes this room.

861
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,420

The trick is

that if the client looks desperate

00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,740
and is from another region,

1071

you charge higher.
