Okay, let's eat.

19
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,879
Why are you here?

20
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,960
Aren't you preparing the materials
at Wan Village?

21
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,879
Mr. Han.

22
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,840
There is illegal discharge
at the wastewater treatment plant.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,240
Illegal discharge, you say?

24
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,719
Did they tell you themselves?

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,919
No.

26
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,520
I found out while going through the materials.

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,159
In the past three years,

28
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,439
particularly this year,

29
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,639
the treatment plant's quantity

30
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,479
and purchase frequency
of chemicals have obviously declined.

31
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,599
It's the same for the plant's operation cost.

32
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,400
That too shows an obvious decline.

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,360
I've suspected it since long ago.

34
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,039
So Mr. Mo is indeed capable of such acts.

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,240
What should we do now, Mr. Han?

36
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Did you come here because of this?

37
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,080
What's so hard?

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,719
So long as the plaintiff
does not have the evidence,

39
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,120
it won't be much of a threat to us.

40
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,439
But...

41
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,520
But they are discharging illegally.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,319
So? What about it?

43
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,721
Alright, I'll remind Mr. Mo

44
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:26,920
to redo the data

45
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
as soon as possible.

46
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,800
If they find out, we'd have to yield.

47
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,681
But what they're doing is illegal!

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,520
Keep your voice down.

49
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,040
What is with the fuss?

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,441
This isn't a big deal.

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,960
Just go back and get the materials ready.

53

I heard that the people of Shuiwei Village

54
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,721
aren't exactly united.

As long as she doesn't push it,

57
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,760
the lawsuit probably won't proceed.

58

we went over the evidence in detail

these are our opinions.

263

The plaintiffs believe

264
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:07,681
that as the defendant is located
upstream of Fushui River

265
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:10,720
and the wastewater treatment plant
is built beside Fushui River,

266
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,761
it is the only wastewater treatment facility
in the area.

The plaintiffs are located
downstream of Fushui River.

Their residences are near Fushui River.

According to the evidence,

270

the characteristics of the pollutants
discharged by the defendant

271
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:26,600
are a match with the pollutants
found in the plaintiffs' well water.

272
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,921
This shows

273
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,521
that the defendant's wastewater management
has a causal relationship

274

than those who used both well water and tap water.

This shows

287
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,960
that the plaintiff's high blood lead level

288
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,521

Although the plaintiffs drink
well water all year round,

Before the court came into session,

346
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:32,891
the defendant has

347
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:34,171
had villagers' blood tested.

348
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:36,371
He then provided medical aid to those

349
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:37,741
who showed higher blood lead levels.

350
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:39,131
In the future,

351
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,501
the defendant will continue

352
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,501
to extend humanitarian medical aid.

353
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,261
However,

354
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:47,371
the defendant stands by his stance

355
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:50,541
that his method of discharging wastewater
has no causal relationship

356
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,891
with the well water pollution.

357
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,171
Thus, he shouldn't have to bear

358
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:55,891
any liability for the dispute
regarding the water pollution.

As a veteran member of the CPC,

I want you to know.

383
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:44,261
Regarding the factory
illegally discharging wastewater,

384
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:47,651
I really didn't know about it at the start.

as the factory's legal person and chairman,

389
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:06,171
you've failed to do your job.

390
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,741
Then when you knew and chose to keep quiet,

391
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,301
you became guilty of concealment.

392

For that,

393
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:20,821

00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:38,891
we would've committed an even more serious sin.

517
00:29:40,301 --> 00:29:41,891
People would have had a severe loss

518
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:43,781
of life and property.

519
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,021
Everyone here

520
00:29:47,131 --> 00:29:48,301
should be grateful to her.

521
00:29:50,061 --> 00:29:51,021
I humbly implore

522
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:52,131
everyone

523
00:29:52,821 --> 00:29:54,091
to seriously consider my proposal.

524
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:13,741
Dad.

525
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:20,691
I'm home.

526
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:25,061
Okay.

527
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:27,741
Good that you're home.

528
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:29,501
You've probably heard.

529
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:33,091
We lost the lawsuit.

530
00:30:34,581 --> 00:30:36,781
We also lost in the Entrepreneurship
in Rural Communities Competition.

531
00:30:38,581 --> 00:30:40,891
I've resigned as the village secretary.

532
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:43,651
Your father, I,

533
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:45,581
is a prideful man.

534
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:48,891
Who would've thought

535
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:51,981
I would end up in such a pitiful state?

536
00:30:55,851 --> 00:30:56,411
Dad.

537
00:30:57,501 --> 00:30:58,501
I've heard.

538
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:05,821
But I don't think failure has to be a bad thing.

539
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:09,371
In the past, I was afraid of failure.

540
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,091
That's why I made such a big mistake.

541
00:31:18,091 --> 00:31:19,171
So you've decided to come home?

542
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:23,371
I've resigned.

543
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:26,691
I'm going to the village where I once taught.

544
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:28,611
I want to do what you did before,

545
00:31:29,451 --> 00:31:30,651
leading the villagers out of poverty.

546
00:31:31,741 --> 00:31:32,451
There,

547
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,451
I'm going to start a spotless life

548
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:36,411
that belongs solely to Wan Chuanmei.

549
00:31:41,581 --> 00:31:42,891
That's my good daughter.

550
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:46,371
I came back this time

551
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:49,171
to sever my ties with the past.

552
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:51,091
Dad,

553
00:31:52,021 --> 00:31:53,171
I hope you can help me.

554
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:55,501
Sure.

555
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:10,541
Let's begin.

556
00:32:14,931 --> 00:32:16,171
Everyone, quiet down.

557
00:32:17,091 --> 00:32:17,821
Today,

558
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:21,021
as requested by our secretary,

559
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:23,411
I've called for

560
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:24,851
this special meeting.

561
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:27,021
The attendees today

562
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:28,221
include the cadres

563
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,651
of Wan Village and Shuiwei Village

564
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:32,411
as well as the core party cadres.

565
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:34,371
We're not the cadres.

566
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:35,301
Why are we here?

567
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:36,371
I don't know what's going on.

568
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:36,821
Now, let's have...

569
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:37,691
I'm not sure either.

570
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:38,781
Mr. Wan asked us to come.

571
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:39,651
Let's just sit in.

572
00:32:57,381 --> 00:32:58,171
Today,

573
00:32:59,171 --> 00:33:01,021
I've invited everyone here personally

574
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:02,891
as Wan Shantang.

575
00:33:05,021 --> 00:33:06,411
You've probably heard.

576
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:08,341
I have officially tendered

577
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:09,211
my resignation

578
00:33:09,341 --> 00:33:09,861
with

579
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:10,731
the Wan Village committee

580
00:33:11,261 --> 00:33:12,341
and village party branch.

581
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:15,861
Now,

582
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:17,211
on behalf

583
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:18,651
of myself

584
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:20,021
and my son,

585
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:21,821
Wan Chuanjia,

586
00:33:22,691 --> 00:33:24,491
I'd like to apologize to the villagers

587
00:33:25,691 --> 00:33:27,261
who have suffered due to

588
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:29,101
the pollution incident.

589
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:34,381
In addition,

590
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:37,021
I have something else to announce.

591
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:43,061
Chuanmei.

592
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:05,651
Hello, everyone.

593
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:08,301
I am Wan Chuanmei.

594
00:34:09,061 --> 00:34:10,301
Today I stand here

595
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:13,381
to publicly apologize to someone.

596
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:17,611
Wang Xiuyu.

597
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:21,531
I'm sorry.

598
00:34:25,821 --> 00:34:26,931
Ten years ago,

599
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:29,781
I went to university using your name.

600
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:30,931
What?

601
00:34:31,891 --> 00:34:33,011
Went to university with another person's name?

602
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:37,341
I had wondered why Xiuyu
didn't get into university

603
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:38,571
with her good grades.

604
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,451
Today,

605
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:41,411
in front of everyone here,

606
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:43,931
I wish to apologize formally to you.

607
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:50,821
Xiuyu.

608
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:53,491
I'm sorry.

609
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:10,011
Xiuyu.

610
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:12,971
You don't have to forgive me.

611
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:14,821
I know

612
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,221
my apology is years too late.

613
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:18,891
But

614
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:20,741
I finally understand now.

615
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:23,011
No one can steal another person's life.

616
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:26,141
And no one can live like how another person lives.

617
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:29,091
We can only be ourselves.

618
00:36:20,051 --> 00:36:20,411
Hey.

619
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:21,381
Mr. Wan.

620
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:22,051
Xingfu.

621
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:23,341
These are books for Chuanjia.

622
00:36:23,451 --> 00:36:24,381
Please pass them to him.

623
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:26,411
Sorry for troubling you.

624
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:27,971
Every time it's visiting day,

625
00:36:28,341 --> 00:36:29,261
you'd always remember.

626
00:36:29,381 --> 00:36:30,741
Thanks for your concern.

627
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:32,971
Also, pass a message to him for me.

628
00:36:33,301 --> 00:36:35,221
Tell him to think of the prison term
as a learning period.

629
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:36,781
Once he graduates and comes back,

630
00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:37,821
he can continue where he left off.

631
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:38,661
Alright.

632
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:40,051
Those are uplifting words.

633
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:42,181
Sure, I'll pass on the message.

634
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:43,491
He mentioned

635
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,531
he's enjoying the books you brought for him.

636
00:36:46,301 --> 00:36:47,971
He said he did not

637
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:48,971
like reading before.

638
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:49,971
But now,

639
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:52,341
once he starts, he can't stop.

640
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:54,661
He said he must have had

641
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:55,971
an enlightenment.

642
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:58,781
His enlightenment sure came late.

643
00:36:58,781 --> 00:36:59,451
Indeed.

644
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:01,491
The car is ready. Let's get going.

645
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:02,661
Oh.

646
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:04,661
Sorry for troubling you, Xingfu.

647
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:05,571
Not at all.

648
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:06,931
Xingfu.

649
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:07,971
So,

650
00:37:08,181 --> 00:37:09,661
Chuanmei called.

651
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:10,381
She said

652
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,741
she wants to

653
00:37:11,781 --> 00:37:12,891
run a homestay

654
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:14,181
at the place she teaches.

655
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:15,051
But she has no experience.

656
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:17,341
She's hoping you could go
and provide some guidance

657
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:18,051
to give your thoughts.

658
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:20,221
Sure. I'll call her later.

659
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:20,661
Okay.

660
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:22,261
How is she? Has she been well?

661
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:23,341
Not too bad.

662
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:24,571
The condition there is not too great.

663
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:26,011
It's much tougher compared to here.

664
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:28,301
But still, she's happy to be there.

665
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:30,011
That's good.

666
00:37:30,741 --> 00:37:32,261
Xiuyu is doing well, I hope?

667
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:34,891
Is she used to auditing classes
at the university?

668
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:36,701
Yes, she is. She's also doing well.

669
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:38,821
She said once she gets her bachelor's degree,

670
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:40,701
she'll continue with postgraduate studies.

671
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:42,221
Very ambitious.

672
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:44,261
That's what "good days" are.

673
00:37:44,411 --> 00:37:45,611
They get brighter the farther you go.

675
00:37:52,589 --> 00:38:01,771
[Congratulations to Wan Village for winning
the title of "The Most Beautiful Highland Village"]

676
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:02,821
Oh my.

677
00:38:03,011 --> 00:38:04,411
Look at this wide forehead.

678
00:38:04,861 --> 00:38:06,091
It's just like Xingfu.

679
00:38:07,341 --> 00:38:08,051
Ms. Lin.

680
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:11,261
You two must already have your hands full
raising Little Dou.

681
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:12,221
You should take a break.

682
00:38:12,221 --> 00:38:14,261
I can look after Little Juhua. Okay?
(*chrysanthemum)

683
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:15,141
It's fine.

684
00:38:15,341 --> 00:38:16,261
You can rest.

685
00:38:16,821 --> 00:38:17,971
He's no trouble at all now that he's older.

686
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,381
He and his little sister are inseparable.

687

00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:25,261
he'll wreak havoc in the house.

689
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:26,491
Ask him.

690
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:28,181
Little Dou.

691
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:31,531
Can I take Little Juhua away?

692
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:33,051
No.

693
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:33,741
No?

694
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:35,181
She is my sister.

695
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:36,451
I'll raise her.

696
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:39,091
You're going to raise her?

697
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:40,661
Okay, alright.

698
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:43,221
I won't take your sister away.

699
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:45,261
Tell your grandma.

700
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:46,821
Next time,

701
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:48,891
we'll bring Little Juhua to visit her often.

702
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:49,571
Yes.

703
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:50,411
Yes, that's right.

704
00:38:52,051 --> 00:38:52,531
Qinglai.

705
00:38:52,821 --> 00:38:54,931
How is your organic produce cooperative

706
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:55,571
coming along?

707
00:38:55,861 --> 00:38:57,261
It's good. Very good.

708
00:38:57,451 --> 00:38:58,931
We're struggling to keep up with demands
from supermarkets.

709
00:38:59,141 --> 00:38:59,861
That's awesome.

710
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:01,491
Qinglai, I saw Little Juhua just now.

711
00:39:01,491 --> 00:39:02,221
She's adorable.

712
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:02,931
She is, isn't she?

713
00:39:04,221 --> 00:39:05,341
When will you two become parents?

714
00:39:05,491 --> 00:39:06,931
When can I become the elder uncle?

715
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,971
Qingzhi, you better hurry up.
Know your priorities.

716
00:39:09,051 --> 00:39:10,181
Spend more time with Yani, you hear?

717
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:10,971
Yes, I will.

718
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:20,611
Qingzhi.

719
00:39:20,821 --> 00:39:21,411
Qinglai.

720
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:23,091
-You're here, Mr. Guan.
-Mr. Guan.

721
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:25,011
Guan Tao, Xingyun. What brings you here?

722
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,451
We are organizing

723
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:27,381
a monthly talk

724
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:29,411
on law popularization with Wan Village.

725
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:30,861
Today is the first session.

726
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:31,781
Yes.

727
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:33,141
I registered for it.

728
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:34,451
I'm going to attend it in the afternoon.

729
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:36,261
Mr. Wang.

730
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:38,051
I've been wanting to talk to you.

731
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:39,781
My cabbages

732
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:40,891
have bugs.

733
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,451
I don't know what to do.

734
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:43,891
Don't fret.

735
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:45,741
I'll go and take a look tomorrow.

736
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:46,891
It's an easy fix.

737
00:39:47,571 --> 00:39:48,221
Excuse me.

738
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:50,091
Everyone, please quiet down.

739
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:52,451
Quiet down and get ready to start the meeting.

740
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:53,861
Please gather around.

741
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:56,571
Looks like we've got a big crowd today.

742
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:58,781
Not just villagers of Wan Village,

743
00:39:59,011 --> 00:39:59,661
but also

744
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:01,261
our friends, relatives,

745
00:40:01,261 --> 00:40:02,821
and people from neighboring villages.

746
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:05,451
You must have heard about the good news.

747
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:06,971
Firstly,

748
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:09,091
we'll invite our county head, Mr. Liu,

749
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:11,341
to give a speech.

750
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:12,181
Put your hands together!

751
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:24,611
Greetings, villagers of Wan Village.

752
00:40:25,411 --> 00:40:26,381
I am Liu Zhaofeng.

753
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:27,861
Everyone must have heard.

754
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:29,181
Recently,

755
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:30,741
Wan Village

756
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:32,781
was awarded a great honor.

757
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:34,221
The honor

758
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:36,091
was not only a testament

759
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:37,301
to the success

760
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:39,891
of Wan Village's efforts in alleviating poverty

761
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:42,261
and creating a well-off society,

762
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:44,091
it also meant

763
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:45,451
that Wan Village

764
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:48,571
managed to accrue good results

765
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:51,531
in promoting cultural
and ideological progress

766
00:40:51,661 --> 00:40:53,491
and rule of law in the countryside.

767
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:00,221
This honor

768
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:01,611
didn't come easy.

769
00:41:02,221 --> 00:41:03,141
It took a lot of effort.

770
00:41:03,411 --> 00:41:06,051
You could say it was well-earned.

771
00:41:06,571 --> 00:41:09,381
It's not only an honor for Wan Village,

772
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:11,611
but it's also an honor for the whole county.

773
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:14,301
On behalf of the county party committee
and government,

774
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:17,221
I'd like to congratulate Wan Village

775
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:19,741
for receiving the national title
of "The Most Beautiful Highland Village".

776
00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:21,781
Wonderful!

777
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:23,971
-Good.
-Good.

778
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:28,411
I won't take up any more time.

779
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:29,611
Now,

780
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:31,011
I'd like to invite

781
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:33,451
the new Wan Village party secretary on stage

782
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:35,091
to say a few words.

783
00:41:35,381 --> 00:41:36,301
Let us welcome her.

784
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:37,971
Good!

785
00:41:48,491 --> 00:41:49,181
Go on.

786
00:41:49,531 --> 00:41:49,971
Okay.

787
00:42:00,741 --> 00:42:01,491
Good day, everyone.

788
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:03,011
I am He Xingfu.

789
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:06,971
Congratulations to Wan Village

790
00:42:07,051 --> 00:42:09,341
for being awarded
"The Most Beautiful Highland Village".

791
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:12,411
It wasn't easy to be given this honor.

792
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:15,971
It's the result of the hard work

793
00:42:15,971 --> 00:42:18,181
from the cadres and people of Wan Village.

794
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:21,451
But I wish to remind everyone

795
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:24,491
that this honor only represented yesterday.

796
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:27,741
Today, after this celebratory event,

797
00:42:28,571 --> 00:42:29,971
we have to put this honor aside

798
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:33,341
and get ready to set out once more

799
00:42:33,341 --> 00:42:35,221
to reach new heights

800
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:37,301
and create a better tomorrow!

801
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:37,891
Yes?

802
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:39,661
Yes!

803
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:43,931
-Yes!
-Great!
