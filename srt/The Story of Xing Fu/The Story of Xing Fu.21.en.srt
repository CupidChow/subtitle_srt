[Episode 21]

3
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,000
Chicken.

4
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,719
Where's the chicken?

5
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,520
There you are.

6
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,039
Yani!

7
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,400
Goodness.

8
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:28,840
Get back here.

9
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,120
Get over here.

10
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,759
Yani.

11
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,599
Aren't you on a business trip?

12
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,240
It's okay.

13
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,319
Don't be scared.

14
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,120
Okay.

15
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
I'll put it away.

16
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,159
Didn't Qinglai and Xingfu

17
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,479
already move out?

18
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,039
Move out?

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,960
Why?

20
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,639
Anyway...

21
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,800
Did you buy this for Qingzhi's birthday?

22
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,000
It must be expensive.

23
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,159
Ms. Lin.

24
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,479
Did you take the towel from the bathroom?

25
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:21,919
Yes.

26
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,280
Yes, I did.

27
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,520
This is to wipe the toilet bowl.

28
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,719
Put it back.

29
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,439
You need to wipe the toilet bowl?

30
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,240
It's pretty clean.

31
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,759
Look, it's clean.

32
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,599
It's no problem.

33
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,039
Ms. Lin, tell Qingzhi

34
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,080
that I dropped by.

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,599
I have something to do.

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,039
I'll leave first.

37
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,520
Yani...

38
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,080
Oh.

39
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,840
Look at me.

40
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,599
Well...

41
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,319
I could tell.

42
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,960
Is it an inconvenience for you
that his brother and sister-in-law

43
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,199
are staying here?

44
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,439
You don't like it, right?

45
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Not at all.

46
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,159
Qingzhi owns this house.

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Who he invites here

48
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,639
is not up to me.

49
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,039
Listen to you.

50
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,199
But it's true.

51
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,319
Qingzhi owns this house.

52
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,560
To be frank,

53
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,319
the whole family

54
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,039
had to fork out our savings

55
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,240
to help him buy the house.

56
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,520
Where else would he find the money?

57
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,879
I know, Ms. Lin.

58
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,439
Good that you do, Yani.

59
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,839
Qingzhi made it clear to us.

60
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,040
That the two of you are truly in love.

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,720
Then tell me,

62
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,399
you've chosen him

63
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,519
and he's marrying you.

64
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,079
Aren't we one family then?

65
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,120
In a family,

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,759
when one of us

67
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,800
is in trouble,

68
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,879
the rest

69
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,480
should come out and help.

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,279
No?

71
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,920
I get it, Ms. Lin.

72
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,000
Then...

73
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,600
I have something to do.

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,759
I have to go.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,439
No, no.

76
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,199
Stay and eat.

77
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,160
I'm about to cook.

78
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,519
See?

79
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,839
It's fine. I have an urgent matter.

80
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,240
I'll treat you to a meal next time, Ms. Lin.

81
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,399
What is so urgent?

82
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,560
I'm off, Ms. Lin.

83
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,199
Bye.

84
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,720
When will you come and eat?

85
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,360
Yani.

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,519
Wang Qingzhi.

87
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,000
Didn't you say your brother and sister-in-law

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,160
have moved out?

89
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,399
Yes, they have.

90
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,040
You liar!

91
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,199
I just left the house.

92
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,759
It's a mess!

93
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,360
You're back?

94
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,079
Aren't you supposed to be away for a week?

95
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,639
So you lied to me?

96
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,600
I wanted to come back earlier

97
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,639
to surprise you.

98
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,600
I guess it was my own wishful thinking.

99
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,920
Right now,

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,399
you're not showing me any respect.

101
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,720
One more thing.

102
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,720
I'm done with the house.

103
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,160
Wait, Yani. Let me explain.

104
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,519
(Hello. The number you've dialed is unavailable.)

105
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,079
(Please try again later.)

106
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:34,959
Mom.

107
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:36,800
Hey.

108
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,480
I came home as soon as I got your call.

109
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,600
You're back.

110
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,480
Where is Little Dou?

111
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,439
He's outside.

112
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,480
His grandpa took him down to play.

113
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,959
I see.

114
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,480
Take this.

115
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:05,959
Dad.

116
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,240
Xingfu.

117
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,360
Little Dou, let me hold him.

118
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,959
-He sleeps soundly.
-How is he?

119
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,160
He's grown, right?

120
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,079
Yes, he looks different.

121
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,480
My Little Dou.

122
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:40,879
What's the matter?

123
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:41,839
What's with you?

124
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,279
Why are you back today?

125
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,399
You said it was for a week, right?

126
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,360
Today is Qingzhi's birthday.

127
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,360
I came back earlier

128
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,160
hoping to surprise him.

129
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,120
So why did you come home?

130
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,839
We had a fight.

131
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,199
Talk to me.

132
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,839
What did he do?

133
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,720
Tell me he's being an idiot.

134
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,360
The whole time I was away,

135
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,279
he kept telling me

136
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,639
that Qinglai and Xingfu had moved out.

137
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,879
Why did he lie to me?

138
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,360
Just tell me they didn't move out.

139
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,560
Today, his parents came too.

140
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,959
The moment I opened the door today,

141
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,519
the house was practically inhabitable.

142
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,160
It was reeking of cigarette smoke.

143
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,040
They were going to slaughter a chicken inside.

144
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,560
One by one.

145
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,240
Listen.

146
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,439
Back then,

147
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,600
when your uncles from the countryside

148
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,560
came to our house,

149
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,839
they threw their dirty socks

150
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,279
onto the sofa.

151
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,360
They were smoking

152
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,560
and almost burned the house down.

153
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,079
You're exaggerating.

154
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,600
It's true.

155
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,399
Only you

156
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,560
will get irritated easily.

157
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,800
-Who said so?
-Yani.

158
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,879
I'm telling the truth.

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,519
Perhaps he lied

160
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,039
for a reason, right?

161
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,399
It could be a white lie.

162
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,519
That's acceptable.

163
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,679
So why did he lie?

164
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,240
It's about his character.

165
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:41,879
Understand?

166
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,679
You...

167
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,679
There's something more ridiculous.

168
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
When I went to the house,

169
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,279
his mother gave me a whole lecture
about how their family

170
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,519
went through so much.

171
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,360
She said Qingzhi was the one who bought the house.

172
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,559
If we're going to be family,

173
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,759
we should do this and that.

174
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,519
She kept lecturing me.

175
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Like I said, it's the same.

176
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,360
Back then, your grandma

177
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,559
also preached the same thing.

178
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,600
Before she passed away, she grabbed my hand

179
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,279
and held it tight.

180
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,000
She insisted that I look after your uncles

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,240
and all their kids.

182
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,279
Her grandma...

183
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,799
She died so many years ago.

184
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,720
Are you still bringing that up now?

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,919
Yes, I am.

186
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,879
I will forever remember it.

187
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
I felt so wronged

188
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,639
marrying you back then.

189
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,639
Listen up.

190
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,799
I'm not letting Yani make the same mistake.

191
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,840
Yani, listen to me.

192
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,879
You must not make the same mistake.

193
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,440
If you make the wrong choice,

194
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,240
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

195
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,879
The girl is already upset.

196
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,639
Why must you make things worse?

197
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,000
Making things worse?

198
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,360
I'm just telling Yani

199
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
about my grievances

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,799
and what I went through back then.

201
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,759
Yani, listen.

202
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,039
Do you know what happened to me?

203
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,519
When I was pregnant with you,

204
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,679
your dad was away for business.

205
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,720
I didn't have any warm meals.

206
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,440
Your dad shirked his responsibility

207
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,759
and got your grandma to come

208
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,759
and take care of me.

209
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,639
In the end,

210
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,840
do you know what happened?

211
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,919
Not only

212
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,200
did your grandma come,

213
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,679
but she also brought along

214
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,720
all your uncles.

215
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,559
Who understands

216
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,679
my suffering?

217
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,799
Was it easy for me?

218
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,639
Also,

219
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,600
your second uncle was working
in another province,

220
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,679
and he wanted me to get him a transfer.

221
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,679
Now, you go and choose

222
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,600
a guy like Qingzhi.

223
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,200
Tell me.

224
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,679
A guy like Qingzhi.

225
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,000
How do you expect me to be okay with it?

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,120
I can't accept it.

227
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,039
His age...

228
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,480
What are you doing?

229
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,639
Where are you going?

230
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm fine now, Mom.

231
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,360
I'm going to get changed.

232
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,759
Goodness.

233
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,080
Baby.

234
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,799
Are you just going to stare at your son?

235
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,039
It's time to eat.

236
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,120
I haven't seen him for so long.

237
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,200
I miss him.

238
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,679
I want to be with him a little longer.

239
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,200
If you can't bear to leave him,

240
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,960
then go back with us.

241
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,200
Go back?

242
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,480
We came here

243
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,840
to talk to you about this.

244
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,080
Baby, let your mother eat.

245
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,519
He's a good kid just like Qinglai.

246
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,919
Go eat. Food's getting cold.

247
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,840
Let's go.

248
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,759
Go and eat.

249
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,879
Come on.

250
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,720
Nice, right?

251
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,279
Mr. Wan visited the family

252
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,000
and brought gifts.

253
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,919
It's this chicken.

254
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,320
Your dad and I brought it here.

255
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,639
Come on, dig in.

256
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,320
Drinking in a place like this,

257
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,279
even the wine tastes better.

258
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,720
Qinglai, come on.

259
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,320
Qingzhi.

260
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,039
Come on, let's drink.

261
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,879
Qingzhi.

262
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,879
We've been busy looking for a house.

263
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,720
We forgot it's your birthday.

264
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,679
Allow me to offer a toast

265
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,879
and wish you a happy birthday.

266
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,879
Thanks, Xingfu.

267
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,080
Don't thank me.

268
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,159
Your brother and I

269
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,759
have caused you and Yani enough trouble.

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
We should thank you instead.

271
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,480
But don't worry.

272
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,039
We'll move out very soon.

273
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,360
Qingzhi.

274
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,639
Qinglai and Xingfu are staying here just fine.

275
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,639
I don't get why

276
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,519
they have to move out.

277
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,639
That's right.

278
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,519
The house is spacious.

279
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,720
It's big enough to house everyone.

280
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,159
Dad, Mom.

281
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,440
Yani and Qingzhi will live here
after they get married.

282
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,519
It's not proper for us to stay here.

283
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,799
That's true.

284
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,919
Qingzhi, Yani must have said something to you,

285
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,519
didn't she?

286
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,600
She didn't.

287
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,600
Don't lie to me.

288
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,519
I'm not dumb.

289
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,799
I will be the voice of reason.

290
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,840
What right does Yani have to be upset?

291
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,360
This house isn't hers.

292
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,519
It's ours.

293
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,000
Your brother and sister-in-law

294
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,600
only came to you

295
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,879
because they're in a pickle.

296
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,279
Why can't they stay here?

297
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,240
People say, a pica pica with its long tail,

298
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,559
marries a wife and forgets the mother.

299
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,000
You haven't even gotten married yet

300
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,120
and you've forgotten your family.

301
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,039
Mom.

302
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,799
Yani wants to break up with me.

303
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,039
What?

304
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,600
What did you say?

305
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,639
Just break up then.

306
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,919
It might be hard to find a three-legged toad,

307
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,440
but two-legged humans are everywhere.

308
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,559
A woman that doesn't get the realities of life

309
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,360
will only become a burden if you marry her.

310
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,399
What are you saying?

311
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,519
-Qinglai.
-What's wrong with you?

312
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,120
If you're unhappy with me,

313
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,159
just say it to my face.

314
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,000
But don't criticize Yani.

315
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,120
Our family's problem

316
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,919
is my own to bear.

317
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:33,799
It has nothing to do with her.

318
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,720
Qingzhi.

319
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,200
Ignore what your brother said.

320
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,960
Yani is a good lady.

321
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,600
Don't let this matter

322
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,919
come between you two.

323
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,960
We'll pack our things later

324
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,840
and move out tomorrow.

325
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,240
Okay?

326
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,759
Sigh.

327
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,799
Goodness.

328
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,080
If I had known how difficult it is

329
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,000
to live in the city,

330
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,000
I would've urged you to go back.

331
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,399
Dad.

332
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,759
We have already signed the lease

333
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,759
for that house.

334
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,639
We also paid half a year's rent.

335
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,480
We can't cancel it.

336
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,159
What do you think, Qingzhi?

337
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,000
I

338
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,159
respect Qinglai and Xingfu's decision.

339
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,720
You two decide.

340
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,519
It's fine with me.

341
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,919
I'd love to go back.

342
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,039
But right now,

343
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,279
I already have a job.

344
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,559
Everyone treats me well.

345
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,320
Besides,

346
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,879
I'll be a permanent employee in a month.

347
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,120
It'll be a shame to go back now.

348
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,080
Why not...

349
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
I think we will go back

350
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,279
sooner or later.

351
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,039
Our roots are there.

352
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,519
Yes.

353
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,679
I'd like to stay in the city

354
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,799
and learn more.

355
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,679
Do what I can now

356
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,440
and see more things.

357
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,480
Besides,

358
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,200
both of us

359
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,360
have stable jobs.

360
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Maybe a while longer.

361
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,080
We're only just starting out.

362
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Mr. Wan said this.

363
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,080
If they prefer to stay in the city,

364
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,559
they should stay.

365
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,799
You're free to come and go.

366
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,720
That's right.

367
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,600
It's just Little Dou.

368
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,559
Your dad and I will look after Little Dou.

369
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,399
Rest assured.

370
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,759
Alright?

371
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,840
Okay.

372
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,600
Okay.

373
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:17,639
Eat.

374
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,000
Eat up. It's getting cold.

375
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,080
Eat.

376
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,679
What's the matter?

377
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,840
Skipped dinner again?

378
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,039
Are you angry with me again?

379
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,799
I'm not angry at you.

380
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,279
Take a seat.

381
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,240
Mom.

382
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:02,919
Yes.

383
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,360
Can I ask you something?

384
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,000
What is it?

385
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,720
Well,

386
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,720
you had all the goods back then.

387
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,360
Why did you end up choosing Dad?

388
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,519
Didn't your mom oppose it?

389
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,580
I

390
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,270
was indeed the creme of the crop.

391
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,030
And I was a beauty.

392
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,470
I had many suitors.

393
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,470
My mom

394
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,470
opposed it of course.

395
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,030
However,

396
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,820
I was

397
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,540
blinded by love.

398
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,110
Your affection for Qingzhi is real, isn't it?

399
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,990
After you get married,

400
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,150
you'll understand.

401
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,060
Affection

402
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,940
and love.

403
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,420
Those things can't replace real life.

404
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,870
All the good and bad.

405
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,750
But I think

406
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,870
although you always bicker with my dad,

407
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,110
you two are still in love with each other.

408
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,230
You seem happy.

409
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,990
That's true.

410
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,190
Your dad is quite good.

411
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,620
And he cooks well.

412
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,580
Sometimes,

413
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,300
I tend to be a little willful,

414
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:16,990
aren't I?

415
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,860
A little?

416
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,470
You have the worst temper.

417
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,710
Gosh.

418
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,950
But still,

419
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,230
I feel like I need to tell you.

420
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,820
It's not

421
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
that Qingzhi is not good.

422
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,300
I think Qingzhi

423
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,750
is practical.

424
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,340
And

425
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,510
he has the drive.

426
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,820
But if you marry him,

427
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,820
you're not marrying only him.

428
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,580
You're marrying into his whole family.

429
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,190
My situation is different from yours.

430
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,230
The gap between urban and rural areas

431
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,710
isn't as big as before.

432
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,030
Today, I got so upset

433
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,190
not because Qingzhi's parents came.

434
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,380
It's because he wasn't being honest with me.

435
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,990
Mom.

436
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,430
What's the matter, Mom?

437
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,580
Don't cry.

438
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,140
Trust me.

439
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,380
I will be happy.

440
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,430
I really want you to be happy.

441
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,190
You are my heart and soul.

442
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,430
You know that?

443
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,270
Alright, I know.

444
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,860
I have you.

445
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,510
I feel so blessed because I have you.

446
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,540
I know.

447
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,140
Mom.

448
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,270
Leave them here.

449
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,230
I'll do the dishes.

450
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,430
Leave it.

451
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,060
Qinglai.

452
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,780
I know

453
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,190
you're upset

454
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,670
about the current living arrangement.

455
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
I mentioned it to Qingzhi just now.

456
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,580
He's not an unreasonable person.

457
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,860
It's just that Yani is also in the equation.

458
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,820
If you ruin

459
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,030
Qingzhi's relationship because of this matter,

460
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,230
as his older brother,

461
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,100
won't you feel regretful?

462
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,580
Besides, Yani's father

463
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,620
got you your job,

464
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,860
right?

465
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,270
If because of this,

466
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,780
he loses his family,

467
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,140
that would be a shame.

468
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,470
Qinglai.

469
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,060
Listen to me.

470
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,620
Move out, okay?

471
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,510
Mom.

472
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,950
I didn't say I won't move out.

473
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,140
Alright.

474
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,430
It's all good.

475
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,910
Little Dou.

476
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,300
It's Mommy.

477
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,540
How I wish to be with you every day.

478
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,670
But if I

479
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,190
go back like this,

480
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,340
I will feel bad.

481
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,540
Since I've been in the city,

482
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,100
I've met a lot of people

483
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,780
and experienced a lot.

484
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,060
It's not easy.

485
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,910
But right now,

486
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,230
I finally see the light.

487
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,780
I hope

488
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,540
you can be

489
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,670
like the kids in the city.

490
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,030
Get an education.

491
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,430
Widen your horizons.

492
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,580
This way, you'll have more opportunities

493
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,670
in the future.

494
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,060
You'll have a better life

495
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
than me.

496
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,340
Don't you agree?

497
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,580
Please wait a bit longer for me.

498
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,470
I will do my best.

499
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,820
I'll live with gusto.

500
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,100
What is it?

501
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,470
Yani.

502
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,340
Qinglai and Xingfu

503
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,510
have found a place.

504
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,100
They're moving out tomorrow.

505
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,780
My parents

506
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,190
are also going back tomorrow.

507
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,820
Yani, I'm sorry.

508
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,030
I shouldn't have

509
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,140
kept this from you.

510
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,540
Can you not lie to me

511
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,670
again?

512
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Why can't you

513
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,340
just talk to me?

514
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,710
Yani.

515
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,340
I promise there won't be a next time.

516
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,190
Please give me one more chance.

517
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,990
There you go again.

518
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
The same old trick.

519
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,230
I'm going to bed.

520
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,710
What are you doing here?

521
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,430
Am I not allowed to be here?

522
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,470
Have your parents left?

523
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,710
Yes.

524
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,270
They left in the morning.

525
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,380
Put the things in the car.

526
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,300
Go on.

527
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,540
Xingfu.

528
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,430
Qinglai.

529
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,300
Qinglai, this way.

530
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,470
Yani.

531
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,780
Why are you here?

532
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,990
Qingzhi said you broke up with him.

533
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,270
It was like he had lost his soul.

534
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,300
I'm not here for him.

535
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,780
I'm here for you.

536
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,030
I come to see

537
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,860
if there's anything I could help with.

538
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,820
So you two made up?

539
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,580
I guess.

540
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,190
That's good.

541
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,380
-I'll take that.
-That's good.

542
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,540
Let me tag along.

543
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,910
You guys go ahead and settle in.

544
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,540
Okay.

545
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,230
Sure.

546
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,620
Here's the key.

547
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
Call me if there is anything.

548
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,910
Sure thing.

549
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,780
Thank you.

550
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,430
No worries.

551
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,620
Qingzhi.

552
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,230
How could you let them

553
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,380
stay in such a place?

554
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,910
Xingfu.

555
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,430
Yes?

556
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,190
Why don't

557
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,540
you move back to our house?

558
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,270
Yes.

559
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,750
That won't do.

560
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,030
We can't keep

561
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,860
living there.

562
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,060
This place isn't bad.

563
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,300
It will look different

564
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,510
once everything is tidy.

565
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,190
Thank you for bringing us here.

566
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,950
You guys should go.

567
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,860
Why don't we help

568
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,540
to tidy up?

569
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:18,950
Yes.

570
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,780
It's okay, really.

571
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,860
This place is only so big.

572
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,270
It'll take only a minute to clean up.

573
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,100
You two should go home.

574
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,190
Xingfu, what else do you need?

575
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,030
We'll buy it for you.

576
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
Need you to ask?

577
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,750
We'll just go first.

578
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,430
Go.

579
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,060
What's with you?

580
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,950
Yani is already being very nice,

581
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,820
going out of her way.

582
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,990
Look at that face of yours.

583
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,510
You're pulling a long face.

584
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,270
I'm not upset with Yani.

585
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,470
I'm upset with Qingzhi.

586
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,100
What a wimp.

587
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,030
He's going to be led

588
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,950
by his wife.

589
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,540
Meanwhile, you're all that.

590
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,380
You're no pushover.

591
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,580
Me?

592
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,620
Am I a pushover?

593
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,820
Get working.

594
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,710
I'm working.

595
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,340
Here.

596
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,470
You got that?

597
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,620
We bought enough, right?

598
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,270
I think so.

599
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,190
We can always get more.

600
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:34,950
Okay.

601
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,710
Let me see.

602
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:38,750
It should be enough.

603
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,060
Qinglai.

604
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,620
Qinglai.

605
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,190
Qinglai.

606
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:42,710
Xingfu.

607
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:43,470
Coming.

608
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,300
We bought these for you.

609
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,190
You got so much.

610
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,750
It's heavy.

611
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,670
It's okay. I'll take it.

612
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:54,990
You bought a lot.

613
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,510
There's vinegar.

614
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,060
Xingfu.

615
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,300
Can I have a word?

616
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,470
Qingzhi.

617
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,540
Tidy up the outside.

618
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,030
Okay.

619
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,030
Well...

620
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,100
Here's 3,000 yuan.

621
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,230
It's a little something from us.

622
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,060
Please take it.

623
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:07,780
What?

624
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,780
We can't take it.

625
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,140
Xingfu, just put it in your pocket.

626
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,910
No, I won't take it.

627
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,270
I won't.

628
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,470
Take it, Xingfu.

629
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,860
Yani, listen to me.

630
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,270
Now that Qinglai and I are here,

631
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,100
we'll undoubtedly

632
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,380
trouble you in the future.

633
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,540
But,

634
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,820
we can't always rely on you.

635
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,540
Otherwise,

636
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,620
you and Qingzhi

637
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,340
might not last long.

638
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,780
Qingzhi is a good kid.

639
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,540
His heart is set on you.

640
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,670
I wish you two well.

641
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,380
Keep the money.

642
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,380
Think of it as my saving with you.

643
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,990
Next time, I'll ask when I need it.

644
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:35,990
Alright?

645
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,750
Xingfu.

646
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,380
Xingfu.

647
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,190
I'm done tidying up.

648
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,860
Do you need anything else?

649
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,910
I need you to treat Yani better.

650
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,820
Okay. It's all good.

651
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,860
You guys have been out the whole day.

652
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,950
Go home early.

653
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,780
Okay. We'll leave then.

654
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,140
Okay. Call me if you need anything, Xingfu.

655
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:54,950
I will.

656
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,430
Qinglai.

657
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,950
Yani and I are leaving.

658
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,950
Qinglai, we're leaving.

659
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,100
Okay. Come visit often.

660
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,430
Bye, Qinglai, Xingfu.

661
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:00,780
Bye-bye.

662
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,580
Thank you.

663
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,190
I didn't do it for you.

664
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,510
I only came because I like Xingfu.

665
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,470
Okay. So long as

666
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,780
there's one person in my family you like.

667
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,620
It won't be you.

668
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,750
I like you though.

669
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,510
Here, have noodles.

670
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,270
I'm exhausted.

671
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,430
From now on,

672
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,030
this will be our home.

673
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,820
If only Little Dou

674
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,380
could be with us.

675
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,990
Easy for you to say.

676
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,190
Who's going to look after him?

677
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,380
Are you going to stay at home?

678
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,510
Or should I not work?

679
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,750
The rent and utilities need to be paid.

680
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,270
That's true.

681
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,190
Let's hang in there a while more.

682
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,910
When we're able to make 5,000 or 6,000 yuan a month,

683
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,540
we'll bring Little Dou here

684
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,860
and attend kindergarten here.

685
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,780
You make it sound so easy

686
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,670
and effortless.

687
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,270
How long is "a while more"?

688
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,620
Soon.

689
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,300
I'm currently studying to become a receptionist.

690
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,190
A receptionist earns more.

691
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,190
You said

692
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,620
your salary would be increased

693
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,670
once you finish probation, right?

694
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,860
That's what they said.

695
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,540
Who knows if that's actually the case?

696
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,300
It will get better.

697
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,060

you can show to yourself and others.

873
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,950
Really?

874
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,260
So am I a career woman right now?

875
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,740
If you earn your own money to raise your family,

876
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,830
then you're a career woman.

877
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:35,950
Okay.

878
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,830
Then I'll follow the standard

879
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,220
set for a career woman.

880
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,430
Add the blush.

881
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,740
Good morning, Mr. Guan.

882
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,070
What's wrong?

883
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,910
Nothing is wrong with me.

884
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,390
What's wrong with you?

885
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,620
What's that on your face?

886
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,580
I...

887
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,100
I put on some makeup.

888
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,660
If it's bad,

889
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,220
I can remove it.

890
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,510
Xingfu.

891
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,550
Listen to me.

892
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,470
You're already beautiful.

893
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,140
Just be yourself.

894
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,100
You don't have to follow others.

895
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:31,870
I know.

896
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,220
You wish to be the receptionist.

897
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,510
But you don't have to do this

898
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,430
just to be one.

899
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,990
Okay, I get it.

900
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,350
Xingfu.

901
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,510
Come here.

902
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,550
I didn't mean

903
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,740
anything bad just now.

904
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,660
I just want you

905
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,620
to stay true to who you are.

906
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,740
Maybe the way I said it

907
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,510
was a little harsh.

908
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,870
I apologize.

909
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,780
Mr. Guan.

910
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,830
Am I laughable?

911
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,220
You want an honest answer?

912
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,870
A tiny bit.

913
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,580
Now that you can't be the receptionist,

914
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,510
can you help me look for someone?

915
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,620
Look for someone?

916
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,430
Who?

917
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,030
The person is very skilled.

918
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,510
I learned a lot from the person.

919
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,220
You even learned a lot?

920
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,780
That's amazing.

921
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,100
Is the person your mentor?

922
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,140
You could say that.

923
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,070
This person is

924
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,350
very brave,

925
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,550
strong-willed,

926
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,510
studious,

927
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,660
and smart.

928
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,740
No.

929
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,470
Not smart, really.

930
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,220
But...

931
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,180
not bad.

932
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,660
Well...

933
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,390
Where does

934
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,660
this person live?

935
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,830
No.

936
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,220
Is the person a man or a woman?
How old is the person?

937
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,300
Same as you,

938
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,030
a woman.

939
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:09,780
Right.

940
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,220
Once you find her,

941
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,950

00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,990
She's studying law?

Give me the address then.

945
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,220
I'll deliver this to her.

She

947
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,700
used to live in Wan Village.

948
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,990
Currently,

949
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,510
I think she works

950
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,510
at a law firm.

951
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,030
Are you talking about me?

952
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,830
Did you really mean me?

953
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,140
Yes.

Hey, time to change shifts.

I have a favor to ask.

00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,660
My younger brother has just
graduated from college

and hopes to be introduced to the organization.

If you are free,

could you talk to Mr. Xu?

Okay.

Please accept.

No, it's okay.

How could I accept? Save it.

you made things difficult for him.

Yet you still think that's okay?

Isn't that the rule?

Couldn't you be more flexible?

I was just following the rules.

Moreover,

You're always so lackadaisical.
