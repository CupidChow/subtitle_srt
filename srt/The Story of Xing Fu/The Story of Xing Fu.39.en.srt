[The Story of Xing Fu]

00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 39]

3
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,140
Xingyun,

4
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,420
you're not young anymore.

5
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,780
You can't be busy

6
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,670
with work all day.

7
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,060
You should get a boyfriend.

8
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,590
Otherwise, you'll have
a hard time having children later.

9
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,860
Mom,

10
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,470
I'm so busy.

11
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,110
I don't have free time at all.

12
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,950
Gosh.

13
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,220
Look at you.

14
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,470
You are no busier than your sister.

15
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,700
Look at Xingfu.

16
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,190
She is the head of the company,

17
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,110
runs an inn,

18
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,190
and has a family of elderly and children.

19
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,550
She got married

20
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,750
and gave birth to her child.

21
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,030
She didn't delay anything.

22
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,540
Yeah, I'm wondering about that too.

23
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,030
Mom, why does my sister have so much energy?

24
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,620
I'm as tired as a dog

25
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,870
when I get home

26
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,820
from work every day,

27
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,060
and I don't want to do anything but sleep.

28
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,270
Who knows what you've been up to all day?

29
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,030
And you still keep saying you're tired.

30
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,340
I'm really tired.

31
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,190
Mom, I'm back.

32
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,150
Xingfu.

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,910
You're back.

34
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,870
You haven't eaten, have you?

35
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,660
Perfect timing.

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,220
Come and have some noodles.

37
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,620
Why do you want to see me?

38
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,430
Did Wan Chuanjia tell you to see me?

39
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,940
If it's about Shuiwei Village,

40
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,030
you can't forget about it.

41
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,030
Xingfu,

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,100
I was talking to Mom about you.

43
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,430
I wonder

44
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,660
how you can be so energetic all day long.

45
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,870
You have a hand in everything.

46
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,380
It's not our business,

47
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,270
why do you care about other people's business?

48
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,310
All right, stop it.

49
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,310
I know what you want to say.

50
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,870
I'm really not here to advise you
on anyone else's behalf.

51
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,150
We are sisters.

52
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,780
I'm doing this for your sake.

53
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,590
I am sincerely advising you.

54
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,220
It's none of your business,

55
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,100
and there's no need to offend so many people.

56
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,340
Why do you have to do that?

57
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,190
Xingyun,

58
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,060
I'm tired of repeating myself to you.

59
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,270
But I advise you

60
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,030
that although you are their lawyer,

61
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,990
if they have done

62
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,340
something unethical,

63
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,190
you must stick to

64
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,620
your principles and bottom line

65
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,030
and not be complicit

66
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,940
in their actions.

67
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,590
Xingyun,

68
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,870
Xingfu is right.

69
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,990
You must listen to her.

70
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,910
Mom, you don't know anything.

71
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,190
Why do you agree with her?

72
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,270
Xingfu,

73
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,310
what if you're wrong?

74
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,870
I wish I'm wrong.

75
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,190
I wish they didn't do it.

76
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,150
What if I'm right?

77
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,710
All the more reason for you to stay out of it.

78
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,990
Do you know what it would mean

79
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,310
if they did cause personal injury

80
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:04,820
and pollution

81
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,310
by

82
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,150
illegally discharging wastewater?

83
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,030
The perpetrator of the crime

84
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,340
is to be sentenced to prison.

85
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,380
Can they not fight with you?

86
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,990
I really don't mean to scare you.

87
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,060
Mr. Han

88
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,340
is a vicious person.

89
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,820
I really don't know what kind of
bad ideas he can come up with.

90
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,430
The shot hits the bird that pokes its head out.

91
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,750
Stay out of it, will you?

92
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,630
Xingfu.

93
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,540
If that's the case,

94
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,150
let them press charges if they want to.

95
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,100
Yes.

96
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,390
Don't get involved in this.

97
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,270
Okay?

98
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,660
You heartless betrayer.

99
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,860
I'll smash you to death!

100
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,100
Coward!

101
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,270
Don't run if you have guts!

102
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,590
Are you okay?

103
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,070
Why are you here?

104
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,710
I...

105
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,300
I'm passing by.

106
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,910
You're bleeding.

107
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,980
Get to the hospital now.

108
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,220
Nothing serious.

109
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,100
Just a minor injury.

110
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,270
When you get home,

111
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,100
rest well

112
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,150
and keep the wound away from water.

113
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,180
Okay.

114
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,780
I got it.

115
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,980
Did you see the man who hit you?

116
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:04,980
No.

117
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,710
But I know why they hit me.

118
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,150
Why?

119
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,660
Because I am helping the people
of Shuiwei Village to sue them,

120
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,070
and that conflicts with their interests.

121
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,830
So don't you hate the people who hurt you?

122
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,420
Why should I hate them?

123
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,910
That's because they all don't know it.

124
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,340
I believe

125
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,420
that they will understand one day

126
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,470
that I am actually doing it
for the good of everyone.

127
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,740
So I understand that they hold a grudge

128
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,740
against me now.

129
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,420
Gang should get married earlier.

130
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,100
I'm so worried.

131
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,270
I can't find a good match for him.

132
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,390
I'm really worried.

133
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,590
I envy you.

134
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,300
I think she's back. Let me take a look.

135
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,630
Xingfu,

136
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,590
Gang's mother is here.

137
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,630
She said she wanted to see you.

138
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,340
Xingfu.

139
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,150
Madam.

140
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,980
What happened to you?

141
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,220
Nothing.

142
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,590
Someone threw stones at me.

143
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,830
Sit down.

144
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,780
Is this serious?

145
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,950
Who's so immoral?

146
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,980
How did they throw the stones?

147
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,300
What if you are badly hurt?

148
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,470
It's okay, Mom. The doctor has dressed it up.

149
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,100
Nothing serious.

150
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,950
This must be a deliberate act of evil.

151
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,270
How immoral.

152
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,780
Madam,

153
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,910
what can I do for you?

154
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,660
I just want to persuade you

155
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,630
not to bother about

156
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,340
Shuiwei Village.

157
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,180
Now everyone is hoping that Wan Village

158
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,630
will win the Entrepreneurship
in Rural Communities Competition.

159
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,390
When Wan Village becomes famous,

160
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,180
those of us who run homestay businesses
can benefit from it.

161
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,830
But if you take the case to court,

162
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,660
you'll ruin it

163
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,540
and everyone won't get a fortune out of it.

164
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,740
Madam,

165
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,340
tell everyone

166
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,780
that if the water is good, the fish can be kept,

167
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,980
but if the water is polluted, no fish can be kept.

168
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,630
You're right.

169
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,070
But how can we talk about the future

170
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,510
when we can't even take care
of things at the moment?

171
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,420
Alright, stop it.

172
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,070
Protect yourself first.

173
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,590
Go back to your room and rest.

174
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,510
Yes.

175
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,510
Go and lie down now.

176
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,950
Don't go out in the next couple of days.

177
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,270
What happened?

178
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,660
Nothing.

179
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,710
What nothing?

180
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,510
Someone threw stones at her.

181
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,910
It's about Shuiwei Village.

182
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,630
Stay out of this from now on.

183
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,150
Nothing serious.

184
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,100
Qinglai.

185
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,270
Qinglai, where are you going? Qinglai!

186
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,540
Mr. Wan!

187
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,100
Coming.

188
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,780
Who is it? It's late at night!

189
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,100
Coming.

190
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,220
Mr. Wan.

191
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:42,910
Qinglai.

192
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,990
Chuanjia, I want to see Mr. Wan.

193
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,060
He's inside.

194
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,940
Mr. Wan.

195
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,540
-What happened?
-Qinglai.

196
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,150
Mr. Wan.

197
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,420
What's wrong?

198
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,820
Someone threw stones at Xingfu.

199
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,300
Are you going to take care of this?

200
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:53,820
This...

201
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,060
If you don't take care of it,
I'll take care of it myself.

202
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,180
Even if I have to turn the Wan Village upside down,

203
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,350
I have to find this person.

204
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,660
I'll give him a taste

205
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,780
of what it's like

206
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,180
to be smashed with stones in the dark.

207
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,300
No... When did it happen?

208
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,390
Just now.

209
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,270
I know that Xingfu

210
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,750
is helping the people of Shuiwei Village

211
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,060
to bring a lawsuit against the factory.

212
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,060
Someone's mad at her.

213
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,540
But we can talk about it.

214
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,030
Why threw stones at her?

215
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,780
You... Don't... Don't be mad.

216
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,420
Qinglai.

217
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,540
Do you know who did it?

218
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,150
I don't know.

219
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,460
Find out who did this at once!

220
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,990
How wicked!

221
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,910
Wan Village

222
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,350
is a model village in the province

223
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,060
and a civilized village.

224
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,030
How dare someone do such a dirty act?

225
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,940
What's it?

226
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,420
This is a disgrace to the village officers

227
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,990
and to the villagers as a whole.

228
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,110
Alright.

229
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,510
Calm down.

230
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,510
I'll investigate it.

231
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,870
Qinglai, don't worry.

232
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,460
I know about this.

233
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,540
I'll definitely get to the bottom of it.

234
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,030
But you should go back

235
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,300
and talk to Xingfu too.

236
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,390
I guess someone who's just pissed off

237
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:51,750
and that he...

238
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,460
Who's pissed off?

239
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,350
Who?

240
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,420
How do I know who's pissed off?

241
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,150
I'm just guessing.

242
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,270
Then, I'll see

243
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,110
who the person you guess is.

244
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,420
I wanted to try to

245
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,300
mediate this matter

246
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,580
and not take it to court.

247
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,660
In this case,

248
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,270
they have my support in taking the case to court.

249
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,820
I just want to see

250
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,940
if there's anything untoward going on here.

251
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,180
Come closer.

252
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,270
What's wrong?

253
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,630
Come.

254
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,700
Stamped. A reward for you.

255
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,350
You know to protect your wife now.

256
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,350
Don't worry.

257
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,580
With me around,

258
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,780
no one will bully my wife and kid.

259
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,510
You're arrogant after being complimented.

260
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,060
Anyway,

261
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,990
you didn't have to

262
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,030
go to Mr. Wan.

263
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,460
How about I go to Mr. Wan tomorrow

264
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,820
and tell him to let it go?

265
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,780
Since I already got smashed

266
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,630
and it's nothing serious,

267
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,700
don't investigate it.

268
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,270
But why?

269
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,580
Because I don't want to make a big deal out of it.

270
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,630
The main purpose of the lawsuit is
to find out the source of the pollution,

271
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,580
nothing more.

272
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,060
I know.

273
00:10:59,460 --> 00:10:59,940
But

274
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,940
it's outrageous that someone

275
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,940
would do something like this.

276
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,580
Even Mr. Wan thinks there's
something fishy going on here.

277
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,110
He also said

278
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,990
he supports the people from Shuiwei Village
to take the case to court.

279
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,150
He did?

280
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,700
Why would I lie to you?

281
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,460
Before you came back,

282
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,460
I was worried

283
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,940
if I was really being nosy,

284
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,030
if I was really doing something wrong.

285
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,270
What made you think so?

286
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,540
I thought

287
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,510
the villagers who're victims
would be very active

288
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,700
in joining the class action.

289
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,870
I didn't expect they were usually

290
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,990
so enraged about it,

291
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,350
but when it comes to lawsuits,

292
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:39,940
they all

293
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,910
have concerns.

294
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,870
This is very normal.

295
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,150
After all, Shuiwei Village
is under the control of Wan Village

296
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,510
after being merged into Wan Village.

297
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,750
It's normal for them

298
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,660
to have all sorts of worries,

299
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,230
isn't it?

300
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:50,700
Alright.

301
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,150
Stop thinking about it.

302
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,630
Rest early tonight.

303
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,660
Hurry.

304
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:55,750
Come on.

305
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,150
Sleep now.

306
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,300
Be good.

307
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,780
Hurry.

308
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,270
Close your eyes.

309
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,540
All of them are from Shuiwei Village?

310
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,630
Yes.

311
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,780
There's a big crowd here.

312
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,110
They heard you were hurt

313
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,180
and came to see you.

314
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:07,630
Xingfu.

315
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,230
Why don't you wear your jacket?

316
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,230
Don't catch a cold.

317
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:10,910
Come on.

318
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,660
Xingyun?

319
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,540
Why are you here?

320
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,270
How is your injury?

321
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,580
It's fine. It's just a scratch.

322
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,390
I told you to stay out of it,

323
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,350
but you wouldn't listen.

324
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,780
Mom was very anxious when she heard about it

325
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,750
and wanted to come and see you.

326
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,750
I spent so much effort
before I managed to stop her.

327
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,580
Mom also said

328
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,420
you must never take the lead again.

329
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,230
I got it.

330
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,820
Gosh.

331
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,030
Come on, everyone.

332
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,180
Xingfu is awake.

333
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,820
Hurry up.

334
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,230
Hurry up.

335
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,300
Madam Li.

336
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,110
Slow down.

337
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,660
Madam Li, you're here too.

338
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,660
I'm fine.

339
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,350
How did you get hurt?

340
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,030
I'm really fine.

341
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,460
I'm fine. I've almost recovered.

342
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,270
It doesn't hurt anymore.

343
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,030
Ms. He,

344
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,150
let me tell you,

345
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,940
we were so furious when we heard

346
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,630
that you had been attacked for our sake.

347
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,350
Yes.

348
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,150
Ms. He,

349
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,150
we've discussed it.

350
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,510
Just tell us who it is

351
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,150
and we'll rush to his house now
to settle the score with him.

352
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180
Yes.

353
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,700
Ms. He,

354
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,630
tell us who did it.

355
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,540
We're going to beat him up.

356
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,750
I couldn't see clearly in the dark.

357
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,660
I'm fine with this small injury.

358
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,870
Don't worry.

359
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,580
I'm fine.

360
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,390
That can't be.

361
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,580
Ms. He,

362
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,990
many people from our village
wanted to come and see you.

363
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,940
But they were too embarrassed to come here

364
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,180
because of the class action last time.

365
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:29,990
Look,

366
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,350
now that you have got

367
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,460
your head hurt for us,

368
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,780
we all think

369
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,510
that we can't be cowards anymore.

370
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,420
-Yes.
-That's right.

371
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,150
They've gone too far.

372
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,750
Right?

373
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,350
At first, we were not sure if we wanted to

374
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,060
take this case to court.

375
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,230
But since they did that to you,

376
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,510
they have made us decide

377
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,660
that we must take it to court.

378
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:46,870
Am I right?

379
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,870
We can't let Xingfu

380
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,150
get hurt for us for nothing,

381
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,750
can we?

382
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,750
Your blood must not be shed in vain.

383
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,230
Yes.

384
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,150
We must take this case to court.

385
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,060
Your blood must not be shed in vain.

386
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,630
We must take it to court.

387
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,150
So you're really going to do it?

388
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,580
Yes.

389
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,390
Don't worry, Ms. He.

390
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,420
We have agreed

391
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,750
that every household will sign.

392
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,870
Yes, we'll sign.

393
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,510
I'll sign too.

394
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,030
You say you don't know?

395
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,510
I don't care if you really don't know about it

396
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,460
or you're just pretending,

397
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,540
but this time, my father is really angry

398
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,460
and has asked for a thorough investigation.

399
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,580
You have to get me an explanation,

400
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,700
or I won't be able to face him.

401
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,270
Well,

402
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,350
how am I going to get you an explanation?

403
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,030
There are not just one or two people
in Wan Village

404
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,180
who hate He Xingfu.

405
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,750
Who doesn't get annoyed with her nosiness?

406
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,820
Everyone is afraid that she will
stop them from getting a fortune.

407
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,540
I can ask one by one.

408
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,270
But

409
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,180
I'm not free.

410
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,350
I don't care if you're free or not.

411
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,060
Shuiwei Village is suing us

412
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,910
because of the health products factory.

413
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,780
You know very well

414
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,390
whether you are involved in this or not.

415
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,350
Why?

416
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,820
Now,

417
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,820
you want to just walk away

418
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,030
and leave me with a mess for myself to clean up?

419
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,870
No way!

420
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,750
Why are you looking at me this way?

421
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,990
Am I wrong

422
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,030
or are you not convinced?

423
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,820
Alright.

424
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,820
I'll investigate it.

425
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,630
I'll investigate it.

426
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,110
Youde.

427
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,870
Mr. Wan.

428
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:12,630
You're here.

429
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:13,910
Guizhi,

430
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,700
Mr. Wan is here.

431
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,870
I came to visit Xingfu.

432
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,700
Have a seat inside.

433
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,870
Mr. Wan.

434
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,390
Mr. Wan, please help us.

435
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,630
Luckily, it's just small stones this time,

436
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,110
but if she's hit with a stick next time,

437
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,060
it could cost her her life!

438
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,660
How much of a grudge is it
that they have to go to such lengths?

439
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,350
Madam, don't worry.

440
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,700
I've sent someone to investigate it.

441
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
As long as I am the secretary,

442
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,700
this will never happen again

443
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,580
on the land

444
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,670
of Wan Village.

445
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,820
Thank you, Mr. Wan.

446
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,700
Take me to see Xingfu.

447
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,500
She's not around.

448
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,460
In the morning, a lot of people
from Shuiwei Village came to see her,

449
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
and then,

450
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,030
she went to Shuiwei Village again.

451
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,150
I couldn't even stop her.

452
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,550
Your daughter-in-law

453
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,580
is really stubborn.

454
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,460
Not to mention a small stone,

455
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,580
when she is determined to do something,

456
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,100
even ten bulls can't pull her back.

457
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,580
Mr. Mo.

458
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,500
Come on, have a drink.

459
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,860
Wu,

460
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,580
I feel oppressed.

461
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,740
Look, I am

462
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,340
not an employee of the Wan family,

463
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,300
I'm a representative of the joint venture,

464
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,430
the general manager
of the health products factory!

465
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,350
What's wrong with me doing this?

466
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,350
Of course I have the power to do this.

467
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,300
To be honest,

468
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,190
why did we

469
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,460
discharge wastewater illegally

470
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,430
in the first place?

471
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,060
Isn't it for the sake

472
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,260
of saving costs

473
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,780
and generating

474
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,830
more profit for the company?

475
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,910
But now,

476
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,590
before anyone says anything,

477
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,590
he shifted the blame

478
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,700
and made it all our fault.

479
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,950
He takes credit

480
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,500
where there's any,

481
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,590
but he hides

482
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,980
when there's trouble.

483
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,060
So,

484
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,220
why should we

485
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,110
work with such a leader?

486
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,700
We get so tired of working hard,

487
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,190
and he ends up selling you out.

488
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,910
Mr. Mo,

489
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,910
we feel secure

490
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
when following a leader like you.

491
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,540
You wouldn't put the blame

492
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,350
on your subordinates like Mr. Wan Junior did,

493
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,060
would you?

494
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:08,780
Come on, Mr. Mo.

495
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,430
Here's to you.

496
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,220
Wu,

497
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,150
you're very good at conversing now.

498
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,020
I'm still learning.

499
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,150
Alright.

500
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,780
Stop talking about useless things.

501
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,220
I asked you out today

502
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,780
because I wanted to talk to you

503
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,910
about how to cover this up.

504
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,150
How can I cover it up?

505
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,540
Don't you know Mr. Wan's temper?

506
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,060
He doesn't tolerate anything unreasonable.

507
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,700
If you don't cover it up well,

508
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,870
you'll get yourself into trouble.

509
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,390
What should I do then?

510
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,350
One word

511
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,630
to solve it.

512
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,060
One word?

513
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,500
Delay.

514
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:56,980
Delay?

515
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,060
Delay?

516
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,630
What if Wan Chuanjia

517
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,260
wants an explanation from me?

518
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,590
Just tell him you haven't figured it out yet.

519
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,350
What can he do to you?

520
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,260
As for Mr. Wan,

521
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,980
just let the father and son fall out.

522
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,460
You don't have to worry about it.

523
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,430
You...

524
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,220
Your idea is brilliant indeed.

525
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,950
Delay.

526
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,300
Right,

527
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,950
are those guys

528
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,980
you got

529
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:35,980
reliable?

530
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,390
Don't worry.

531
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,980
You don't have to worry about them.

532
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,350
I know how to

533
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,350
manage my men.

534
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,910
I have my own way.

535
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,020
Have you heard

536
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,980
that He Xingfu

537
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,950
doesn't seem to be giving up yet?

538
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,300
She always

539
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,670
goes to Shuiwei Village.

540
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,260
We need to find a way

541
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,950
to stop her.

542
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,870
Once she's taken care of,

543
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,260
the rest will be easy.

544
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,060
That's not easy.

545
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,630
This woman

546
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,110
had injured the head of Mr. Wan Junior

547
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,260
on the day she married into Wan Village.

548
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,060
In my opinion,

549
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,260
there's nothing she is afraid to do.

550
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,390
That's strange.

551
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,460
With Wan Chuanjia's temper,

552
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,220
he shouldn't have given in to that woman.

553
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,260
But he really doesn't seem

554
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,020
to have dared to pick a fight with her.

555
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,390
Besides,

556
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,430
he's really polite to that Wang family.

557
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,350
That's true.

558
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,460
The Wang family

559
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,870
is in the minority.

560
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,500
They used to have the lowest status
in Wan Village.

561
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,460
It's strange

562
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,670
that ever since He Xingfu
married into the Wang family,

563
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:42,110
they've turned their luck around.

564
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,700
They have earned both money and fame.

565
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,150
I think this woman

566
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,910
has brought luck to the Wang family.

567
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,980
My foot!

568
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:51,980
I would like to see

569
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,350
if her luck would bless her own.

570
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,150
Yes,

571
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,150
this time,

572
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,780
let's give her something even more serious.

573
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,830
But

574
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,910
Wan Chuanjia may have to suffer a bit.

575
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,780
But he deserves it.

576
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,020
Who told him to put the blame on us?

577
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,020
It's only fair

578
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,460
that he gets some blame too.

579
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,060
Mr. Mo,

580
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,590
what's your idea?

581
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,390
Just don't ask.

582
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,460
Take care of your own business.

583
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:29,780
Then,

584
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,950
just wait and see what will happen.

585
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,430
I'm giving you red envelopes today.

586
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,110
You all know why

587
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,500
you are being given red envelopes.

588
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,870
Learn from Wallflower.

589
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,980
Don't just drink all the time

590
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,540
and talk nonsense when you get drunk.

591
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,910
Keep your mouth shut!

592
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,540
I'm warning you today.

593
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,020
Don't blame me if anyone

594
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,020
leaks any information.

595
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,430
I'm sure

596
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,540
you'll be the first

597
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,980
to get into trouble

598
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,260
when something goes wrong.

599
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,780
Think about what I have said.

600
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,500
Alright.

601
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,190
Okay, you can have this.

602
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:43,950
Alright.

603
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,220
Leave this with me.

604
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:45,950
Alright.

605
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,630
Come here, my dear. Come with Grandma.

606
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,500
Mr. Wang,

607
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,460
have a glass of water.

608
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,260
Okay.

609
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,060
Don't get busy, Xingfu.

610
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,700
Ms. He.

611
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,590
Hello.

612
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,430
What do you think it means?

613
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,060
Okay.

614
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,950
Party B accepts Party A's assignment...

615
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,670
Sign and put your fingerprint

616
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,060
on your name.

617
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,670
Mr. Wang.

618
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,260
Here are all the 25 proxy agreements

619
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,910
in total.

620
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,830
Xingfu,

621
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,110
thank you for your hard work.

622
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,260
It's not hard.

623
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,110
This is what I should do.

624
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,740
The rest is in your hands.

625
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,870
Don't worry.

626
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,780
We'll do our best.

627
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,020
Okay.

628
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,590
Alright, I'll get going now.

629
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,220
I'm back.

630
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,670
You're finally back.

631
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,190
Go and check on Xiuyu.

632
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,740
She locked herself

633
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,150
in the room as soon as she came home.

634
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,780
She doesn't eat

635
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,540
or talk.

636
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,350
What happened?

637
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,020
Really?

638
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,430
Xiuyu.

639
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,870
It's me.

640
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,540
What happened? Tell me.

641
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,260
What happened?

642
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,220
What happened?

643
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,740
What's going on?

644
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,740
You didn't read the messages

645
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,350
on the official website of the inn
and the cooperative, did you?

646
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,980
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.

647
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,430
What's wrong?

648
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:37,950
You

649
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:38,540
take a look first.

650
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,260
What is it?

651
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:51,430
[Xingfu Inn attracts business by sexual appeal.]
[This is their courtesan.]

652
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,780
These scoundrels.

653
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,500
What nonsense are they talking about?

654
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,540
They say that I'm fake

655
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,540
and that I'm an inferior product

656
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,260
produced by a consortium
of township enterprises.

657
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,830
They also say Xingfu Inn

658
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,870
attracts business by sexual appeal.

659
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,980
The more they talk, the worse it gets.

660
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,910
Read it yourself.

661
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,780
They're simply accusing us.

662
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,910
I think someone is deliberately
hiring the Internet Water Army

663
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,390
to smear us.

664
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,260
Just ignore them.

665
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,020
We are not afraid of smears.

666
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
We are innocent.

667
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,260
Can they smear us and make the smears true?

668
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,540
You don't know

669
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,630
that it's not easy

670
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,460
to prove a smear is a smear on the internet,

671
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,020
but it's easy to make a smear out of innocence

672
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,020
in no time.

673
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,190
In your opinion,

674
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,220
who do you think is smearing us?

675
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,020
Wan Chuanjia?

676
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,700
I'll go to him.

677
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,390
No.

678
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,300
Wan Chuanjia said he's also smeared.

679
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,630
He's also smeared?

680
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:57,275
[I heard that she is having an affair with Mr. Wan.]

681
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,590
I saw it.

682
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,780
Xiuyu,

683
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,910
don't be sad.

684
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,590
You have me.

685
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,700
I'm going to find out who this rascal is.

686
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:11,870
Forget it.

687
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,110
Consider it a dog bite.

688
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,780
If it's a dog, I'll let it go.

689
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,190
This kind of person is worse than a dog.

690
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,630
If you don't find this evil person

691
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,500
and don't teach him a lesson,

692
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,060
he will harm others.

693
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,300
You don't know

694
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,910
that the more you argue
with the Internet Water Army,

695
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,910
the more aggressive they become.

696
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,150
But we can't just let them talk nonsense, can we?

697
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,740
I'll hire Internet Water Army too.

698
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,830
I'll hire a bunch of Internet Water Army.

699
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,630
I must reason with him.

700
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,460
I will scold him back.

701
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,190
What if you piss them off?

702
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,700
If they dox me on the internet,

703
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,060
then they'll bring up Chuanmei's matter again.

704
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,430
I'm fine with that,

705
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,870
but what if something happens to Chuanmei?

706
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,950
I always thought I could make a way out of it.

707
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,350
I didn't realize

708
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,110
that there was an invisible rope holding me,

709
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,540
and I could never get out.

710
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,350
Whoever tied the rope for you

711
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,110
must untie it for you.

712
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,260
Tell me honestly,

713
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,500
did you do this?

714
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,220
If you let me find out

715
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,500
that you have something to do with this,

716
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,190
Mo,

717
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,590
you'll be dead!

718
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,350
How could I possibly do such a thing?

719
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,780
I don't know anything about the internet.

720
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,780
Who else could it be if not you?

721
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,870
Don't you do a lot of dirty things?

722
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,060
No, it's really not me.

723
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,740
It's just some silly things

724
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,060
said by some boring people on the internet.

725
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,830
Why do you have to get so worked up?

726
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,700
Why do you think I got so worked up?

727
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,390
Someone must be behind this.

728
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,190
You don't have to say that.

729
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,460
Who let you in?

730
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,830
Ms. He,

731
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,060
your sister

732
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,430
brought it on herself

733
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,670
by offending so many people

734
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,350
over Shuiwei Village.

735
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,870
Doesn't she like to be in the limelight?

736
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,300
Now she gets what she wants.

737
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,350
Enough. Keep your mouth shut.

738
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,300
Stop being sarcastic here.

739
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,670
You, go

740
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,830
and settle this matter for me.

741
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,780
It's not easy.

742
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,780
It requires money.

743
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,020
Anything that money can solve is not a problem.

744
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,950
Spend as much as you need to.

745
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,830
Go and settle it now.

746
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,220
Okay.

747
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,460
Since you say so,

748
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,590
I'm on it now.

749
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,980
What do you want?

750
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,460
I am preparing documents for the court case.

751
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,740
But the people in the factory office said

752
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,910
there are some documents that Mr. Mo
had asked for that I'm not allowed to read.

753
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,670
Let me make it clear first.

754
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,910
Don't blame us

755
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,870
if we lose the lawsuit

756
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,740
due to inadequate documents.

757
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,350
Mr. Mo had asked for
that you're not allowed to read them?

758
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,350
What he said doesn't count.

759
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,220
You tell the people in the office

760
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,110
that this is what I told you to do,

761
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,110
that I said

762
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,910
that everyone must cooperate with you

763
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,870
in preparing all the documents for the case.

764
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,540
Anyone with any questions
should come to me directly.

765
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,260
Okay.

766
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,220
That's all I need from you.

767
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,500
Right,

768
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,260
Wan Chuanjia,

769
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,700
you need to urge Mr. Mo

770
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,590
to put the chaos on the internet to rest.

771
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,300
It is scary that once the chaos on the internet

772
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,220
gets out of hand.

773
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,430
Chuanmei's matter

774
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,500
may be brought up again.

775
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:23,950
This...

776
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,670
What's all this nonsense?

777
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,390
Who wrote all this?

778
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,350
I think someone has hired
the Internet Water Army

779
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,780
to smear us online.

780
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,670
I've made it clear

781
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,220
that I'm with you on the lawsuit.

782
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,150
Why

783
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,830
are so many people still talking nonsense?

784
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,190
Xingfu,

785
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,700
don't be afraid.

786
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,980
I'll have someone look into it right away

787
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,980
to see who did it.

788
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,630
Mr. Wan,

789
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,910
I didn't come to you for this,

790
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,910
but for Chuanmei.

791
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,150
What does this

792
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,350
have to do with Chuanmei?

793
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,300
You may not be familiar
with the internet environment.

794
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,500
But you've heard of the word "dox", right?

795
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,870
Dox?

796
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,780
Dox is

797
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,300
something like a search, right?

798
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,110
It's hard to control public opinion
on the internet

799
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,980
once it gets out of hand.

800
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,780
Xiuyu is also considered an influencer.

801
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,910
I'm afraid

802
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,430
that if they dox Xiuyu,

803
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,980
it will involve that incident.

804
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
Xiuyu is fine with that,

805
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,430
but I'm worried that Chuanmei

806
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,460
might not be able to handle the pressure.

807
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,870
Xingfu,

808
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,350
you're really kind.

809
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,630
At such time,

810
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,390
you can still think of Chuanmei.

811
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,830
Our family

812
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,110
truly feels embarrassed.

813
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,830
If Chuanmei

814
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,020
hadn't been so distressed
the last time she came back,

815
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,500
I would not have

816
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,700
tried so hard

817
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,870
to cover up for her

818
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,870
and let Xiuyu suffer so much.

819
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,540
Mr. Wan,

820
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,630
I understand how you feel as a father.

821
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,190
It's in the past.

822
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,110
Please give me Chuanmei's phone number.

823
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,460
I'll have a chat with her later.

824
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,300
Even if I couldn't be of any help,

825
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,870
I could at least tell her in advance

826
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,190
so that she would be prepared.

827
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,190
And of course,

828
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,780
we will certainly do our best

829
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,390
to get things under control.

830
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,020
That's great.

831
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,870
I would also like you

832
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,150
to talk to her in person.

833
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,260
I would have been content

834
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,430
if my two children had been a tenth

835
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,260
as big-hearted as you are.

836
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,540
I'm not a good father.

837
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,020
[Costs of Wastewater Treatment Plant]

838
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,020
Ms. He,

839
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,150
here's the information you asked for.

840
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,430
Well...

841
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,060
I have something to do.

842
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,780
I'm going back to the city.

843
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,780
So are you coming back tomorrow?

844
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:27,870
Not sure.

845
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,630
Shantang.

846
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:36,670
I've arrived.

847
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,060
Shantang.

848
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,220
Buddy.

849
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,910
I've arrived.

850
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,950
You're really my best buddy.

851
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,190
You really brought it to me.

852
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,780
Of course.

853
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,260
Here.

854
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,020
Have a seat.

855
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,870
I'll get the drink.

856
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:47,693
I knew you'd need a drink.

857
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,020
I've got spiced beef and cold dishes for you.

858
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,460
Here.

859
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,050
It's just you and me this time.

860
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,250
Have some drink.

861
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,420
You really bought it from Ma.

862
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,660
How can I lie to you about this?

863
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,290
Where are your children?

864
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:08,860
They're not at home?

865
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,700
Chuanjia hasn't come back yet.

866
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,420
My daughter-in-law has taken the kids
back to see the elderly.

867
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,860
That's why you called me

868
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,250
for lamb soup from Ma.

869
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,700
No one cooks for you, right?

870
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,940
Nonsense.

871
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,940
Not really.

872
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:24,860
I'm

873
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,380
feeling a bit depressed

874
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,250
and would like to talk to a friend
who knows me well.

875
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,250
What is it? What's wrong?

876
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,810
Have a drink.

877
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:42,940
Is it about Shuiwei Village?

878
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,220
It is

879
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,180
and it isn't.

880
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:48,900
Buddy.

881
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,980
What do you think

882
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,700
of Chuanjia?

883
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,330
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

884
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,660
You're

885
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,940
an experienced police officer.

886
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,570
They all say that you're a good judge

887
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,330
of character.

888
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,290
I would like to listen to your view.

889
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,700
Don't listen to their nonsense.

890
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,180
Good judge?

891
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,050
It's just

892
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,420
that I've met a lot of people,

893
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,730
so I have some instincts.

894
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,180
Then, tell me your instincts.

895
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,650
Chuanjia

896
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,490
is smart, capable,

897
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,610
and quick-witted.

898
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,490
His temper

899
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,820
follows yours.

900
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,820
In fact, I think

901
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,740
he's been trying to learn from you,

902
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,490
but he's just learned a little bit.

903
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,130
Go ahead.

904
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,490
He is more

905
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,610
tender-hearted

906
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,610
in nature than you.

907
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,460
But he thinks

908
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,300
he needs to be

909
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,820
as fierce and decisive as you are

910
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,210
to be as convincing as you are.

911
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,010
It's just bluff, then.

912
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,860
In the face of difficulties,

913
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,780
he is not as determined as you are.

914
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,650
In the face of principle,

915
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,210
he is not as firm as you are.

916
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,530
Do you know why?

917
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:20,820
Why?

918
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,130
Because he is not as selfless as you are.

919
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,130
So,

920
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,300
you can be free of worldly desires,

921
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,820
but he can't.

922
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:38,820
Look.

923
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,090
You can stare at people,

924
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,210
get angry,

925
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,260
and scold them.

926
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,300
They are really afraid of you,

927
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,210
but they respect you.

928
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,010
When he gets angry and scolds people,

929
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,090
they are just afraid of him,

930
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,490
but they don't respect him.

931
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,300
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

932
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,260
The truth doesn't sound nice.

933
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,900
Some people love to listen to it,

934
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,490
and some people don't.

935
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,300
Sometimes, it's a waste of time to talk about it,

936
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,090
and it annoys people.

937
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,300
I'd say you're slick.

938
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,460
So tell me more of the truth.

939
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,300
What do you think about the lawsuit

940
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,050
of Shuiwei Village?

941
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,260
Chairman Mao said

942
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,130
that the eyes of the masses are discerning.

943
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,170
So their suspicions are true?

944
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,490
I didn't say that.

945
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,210
But don't take people for fools.

946
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,340
The wisdom of the masses
exceeds that of the wisest individual.

947
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,610
You...

948
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,650
You are not troubled about this at all,

949
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,300
let alone

950
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,900
the competition,

951
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,780
but Chuanjia.

952
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,780
You're worried about whether Chuanjia

953
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,460
can handle this properly.

954
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,490
If it's not handled properly,

955
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,210
will Chuanjia still be able

956
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,380
to continue to be

957
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,340
the Group's general manager?

958
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,900
As a secretary,

959
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,090
you are examining him.

960
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,900
But as a father,

961
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,210
you're really worried
about your son falling short.

962
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,090
You are a very slick old man indeed.

963
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,050
A good judge of character too.

964
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,610
You're so cheerful.

965
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,740
You go around being a peacemaker
and mediating disputes.

966
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,650
You're like a mute who eats dumplings,

967
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,820
you know everything in your heart.

968
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,860
You...

969
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,570
Mediate this for me.

970
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,940
Help me to see

971
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,130
if he has any hope

972
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,300
of becoming better.

973
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,130
Haven't you been examining him for a while now?

974
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,340
You know better than anyone whether your son

975
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,380
will fall short or not.

976
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,380
Why are you asking me for help?

977
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,690
Eat up, it's getting cold.

978
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:07,940
Here's to you.

979
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,130
Chuanmei.

980
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,340
Xingfu.

981
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:43,690
Sit down.

982
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,820
What would you like to drink, miss?

983
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,650
Coffee, thank you.

984
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:58,690
Okay.

985
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,210
I've heard

986
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,010
Mr. Wan talked about you before.

987
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,300
He said you were brought up by your brother

988
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,900
and that it was not easy for both of you.

989
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,010
Is it hard for you to live

990
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,980
with the name Xiuyu

991
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,610
for all these years?

992
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,260
Xingfu,

993
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,570
I got promoted

994
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,490
to be the head of the finance department today.

995
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,570
My colleagues congratulated me and said,

996
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,210
"Xiuyu,

997
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,650
congratulations!"

998
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,740
Do you know how I feel inside?

999
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,090
I'd rather they just ignored me.

1000
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,940
I would love to hear

1001
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,780
someone call me Chuanmei very much today.

1002
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,490
I didn't expect

1003
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,690
this person to be you.

1004
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,530
I even didn't expect

1005
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,740
that I would be shocked

1006
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,460
to hear my name.

1007
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,010
It's good of you to think so.

1008
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,010
It's okay.

1009
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,300
It's okay to make mistakes.

1010
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,090
We just need to correct them.

1011
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,650
Xingfu,

1012
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,130
do I have a chance to correct it?

1013
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,300
You do.

1014
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,090
If you really want to correct it,

1015
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,690
you will have a chance.

1016
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,860
Thank you.

1017
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,460
Right, Xingfu,

1018
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,490
I've been concerned about Xiuyu.

1019
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,860
I visit the official website almost every day

1020
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,130
to see her updates.

1021
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,570
I'm really happy for her

1022
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,260
now that she's an influencer.

1023
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,210
But why

1024
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,570
doesn't she respond
to the accusations against her

1025
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,130
and Xingfu Inn online?

1026
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,050
Because she is afraid to provoke those people.

1027
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,740
What if those netizens

1028
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,170
dox Xiuyu

1029
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,740
and bring up your matter?

1030
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,490
Can you take it?

1031
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,980
So she chose to remain silent.

1032
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,460
She would rather be scolded,

1033
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,940
she would rather be bullied

1034
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,530
than talk back

1035
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,690
or come forward to explain.

1036
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,010
Xingfu,

1037
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,300
in fact, I've been living

1038
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,010
in fear and guilt all these years.

1039
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,900
Ever since I started studying at university,

1040
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,610
I've been afraid to go home

1041
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,530
every time I go on holiday.

1042
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:32,980
I went

1043
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,420
to the northwest to teach in the mountains.

1044
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,340
Looking at

1045
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,210
those cheerful and innocent children

1046
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,010
and their bright smiles,

1047
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,940
I really envied them.

1048
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,050
Only when I was with them,

1049
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,050
I could feel I was really relaxed.

1050
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,460
If Heaven could give me another chance,

1051
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,210
I wouldn't do such a stupid thing again.

1052
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,260
But I don't have the courage...

1053
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,570
I don't have the courage to face it all.

1054
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,340
I am so scared

1055
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,490
at the thought of having to face all this.

1056
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,690
I wish I could just die.

1057
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:16,740
Chuanmei,

1058
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,690
who doesn't have something
happen to them in their life?

1059
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,380
Life

1060
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,420
is just like a TV drama

1061
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,420
with its ups and downs.

1062
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,170
Just get over it
when you encounter difficulties.

1063
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,170
Yes.

1064
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:31,900
It can be tough

1065
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,340
in the beginning.

1066
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,130
But if you grit your teeth,

1067
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,860
you'll be free after getting over it.

1068
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,690
Both you and Xiuyu will be free.

1069
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,260
You have a long journey ahead.

1070
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,740
You can't spend your life

1071
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,340
living as someone else.

1072
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,170
Or else, this mistake

1073
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,860
will be like a block of ice in your heart.

1074
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,130
Only when you take it out
and put it in the sunlight,

1075
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,210
it will melt away

1076
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,650
and you will be able to smile brightly.
