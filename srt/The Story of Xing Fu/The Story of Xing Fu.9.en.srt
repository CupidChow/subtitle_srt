00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,359
Why did you come out before lunch was ready?

4
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,760
Come. Take a rest and eat something.

5
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,840
All right.

6
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,920
I'll come out soon.

7
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,199
Eggs and sweet potatoes.

8
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,039
Sigh.

9
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,240
We planted the vegetables too late.

10
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,840
The land is no longer ours now.

11
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,879
I wonder if we can sell
another batch of vegetables

12
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,080
before the greenhouse is removed.

13
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,400
Didn't Mr. Wan say this?

14
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,840
They'll build the factory first

15
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,280
and the wastewater treatment plant later.

16
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,639
I'm sure they will inform us in advance
before they remove the greenhouse.

17
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,680
I think we can definitely

18
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,639
sell one batch of vegetables.

19
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,159
-You're going back?
-Yes.

is really doing his best
to help you in this matter.

23
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,479
The village committee

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,199
have discussed in another meeting

25
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,560
and decided

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,280
to give each family

27
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,879
another

28
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,840
20,000 yuan as compensation.

29
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,879
This is something that has never happened.

30
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,520
I'm sure you are all satisfied now.

31
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,560
Take a look at the contract.

32
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,520
Sign it if there's no problem with it.

33
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,840
Why isn't Qinglai's family here?

34
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,319
Their situation

35
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,759
is more complicated.

36
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,080
It's different from all of yours.

37
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,319
It involves some fees from the Group.

38
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,680
It's already sorted.

39
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:54,919
Did his family

40
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,120
get more compensation then?

41
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,000
His family doesn't get any compensation.

42
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,159
I'm telling you this as well.

43
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,960
You don't have to return
the rental fee for the land

44

about this matter anymore.

No. Mr. Cailiang.

51

Thank you. We've troubled you.

52

Why don't we

53

sign it then?

54
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,720
There are two copies of the contract.

55
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,759
Sign both of them.

56
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,160
Later, I'll ask

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,279
the accounts department
to send the money to you all.

58

-Sure.

The pen.

61
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,639
You already gave us 20,000 yuan.

62
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,000
Will giving us a pen kill you?

67
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,959
Come back.

68
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,519
What did you write here?

69
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,879
What do you mean?

70
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,959
What could I possibly mean?

71
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,360
It's exactly what I've written there.

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,879
I don't agree.

73
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,800
Are you here to cause trouble purposely?

74
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,560
I'm not.

75
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,399
I think all of you

76
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,120
settled the matter on Caiqing's land

77
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,000
behind our backs.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,800
Something fishy

79
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,639
is going on here.

80
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,560
What's fishy about this?

81
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,399
What makes you say that?

82
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,959
Besides, didn't I already tell you

83
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,480
Qinglai's family's situation is different?

84
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,920
The village does things according to a policy.

85
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,480
If you don't believe it,
just go to the county office

86
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,639
and check the regulations.

87
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,120
I'm not going.

88
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,199
I'll leave it to the staff in the village.

89
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,240
I want as much compensation

90
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,680
as Qinglai gets.

91
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,199
Hey. Are you

92
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,839
trying to haggle with me here?

93
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm not.

94
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,879
I'm just being reasonable.

95
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,519
Reasonable?

96
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,079
You're being absurd!

97
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,959
You...

98
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,079
I'm telling you.

99
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480
If you are doing this,

100
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,360
I'll really

101
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,680
stay out of this matter.

102
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,720
Whatever!

103
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,399
I'll really ignore it!

104
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,199
Go and find someone else!

105
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,879
What's wrong with him?

106
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,959
Xingfu. Thank you.

107
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll continue working.

108
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,680
Qinglai!

109
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,879
Qinglai!

110
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Cai, why are you here?

111
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,040
I heard

112
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,959
the village wants to acquire your land.

113
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,439
Yes.

114
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,040
The village wants to build

115
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,800
a wastewater treatment plant here.

116
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,759
Then does our agreement
on the organic vegetable supply

117
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,839
still remain effective?

118
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,680
Of course. I'll still be planting them.

119
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,480
How can you still plant the vegetables

120
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,639
when you don't have any land?

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,959
Calm down.

122
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,240
The village wants our land.

123
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,079
We have no choice.

124
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,680
But the village compensated us.

125
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
We are planning

126
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,120
to find new land to keep farming.

127
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,240
Xingfu.

128
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,879
How long do I have to wait?

129
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,800
I've signed the contract with the supermarket.

130
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,000
They also prepared the shelves
for organic vegetables.

131
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,000
Reasonably,

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,120
your vegetables

133
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,519
should be in the market after a few days.

134
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,240
I've had everything planned

135
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,800
but why did you do this?

136
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,639
This batch won't be a problem in a few days.

137
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,600
The village won't acquire our land immediately.

138
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,920
What about your veggies after that?

139
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,439
You might have to wait a few months for them.

140
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,439
Qinglai.

141
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,600
Are you joking with me?

142
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,920
No. What's the problem?

143
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,920
Sell our vegetables first.

144
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,240
Get your supply from someone else after that.

145
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,959
Before they set up
the selves for organic vegetables,

146
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,120
didn't the supermarket sell any vegetables?

147
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:28,759
I...

148
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,439
Fine. I won't argue with you.

149
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,639
Xingfu.

150
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,879
You are a cultured person.

151
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,439
What should we do about this?

152
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,560
I don't know.

153
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,319
Do you have any way

154
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,759
of helping us make up for this?

155
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,360
I-I really have no way.

156
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,680
I have a contract with the supermarket.

157
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,120
I can't breach the contract.

158
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,480
It's exactly the same as the contract we signed.

159
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,079
If a party causes another party's loss,

160
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,439
we'll have to compensate the full damages.

161
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,160
With the current situation,

162
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,279
I need to pay the few supermarkets

163
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,601
a damage compensation
worth more than 60,000 yuan.

164
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,480
If you don't believe me,

165
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,519
I'll bring you a copy of the contract in a few days.

166
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,279
I don't want to be seen as a scammer.

167
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,759
No. How can you blame me for that?

168
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,319
We don't want that either, Cai.

169
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,120
Who can I turn to then?

170
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,639
Enough. Stop talking to me.

171
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,800
No, you...

172
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,920
We'll do it according to the contract.

173
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,480
This

174
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,959
-is not our fault.
-Follow the contract.

175
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,040
Follow the contract!

176
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,480
Let's talk it out.

177
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,319
-Cai.
-I don't care. You'll pay for the damages.

178
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,040
No need to be so anxious.

179
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,000
Cai!

180
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,959
No. That's...

181
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,279
What should we do?

182
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,959
How can he take money from us?

183
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,199
It's written in the contract.

184
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,160
I was careless.

185
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,319
What should we do?

186
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,759
60,000 yuan.

187
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,039
We finally got

188
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,840
70,000 yuan back

189
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,919
and we'll have to pay 60,000 yuan.

190
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,720
Calm down.

191
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,320
I remember Mr. Cailiang said

192
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:51,047
the party acquiring the land
needs to compensate the loss we incur

193
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,919
from our land being acquired
as long as we inform them.

194
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
This is even easier to explain than the bill.

195
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,679
We also have the supermarket
and Cai as our witnesses.

196
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,440
I'll go back and inform them later.

197
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,159
What's wrong?

198
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:13,919
What's wrong?

199
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,519
It's fine.

200
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,360
I had a sprain. I think.

201
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
You had a sprain?

202
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,840
Is it serious?

203
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,159
I'm fine. I just need a rest.

204
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,519
Do you need to go to the hospital?

205
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:23,639
No need.

206
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,879
Give it to me.

207
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,600
Do you need me to...

208
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,240
I'll send you back.

209
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,080
Look at you.

210
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,039
Why did you sprain your waist

211
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,440
on the last day of the year?

212
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,519
Mom. It's nothing serious.

213
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,000
I just have to lie down for a while.

214
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,600
I want to finish everything

215
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,960
before the end of the year.

216
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,279
Tomorrow is the first day of the Chinese New Year.

217
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,399
Everything should start anew.

218
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,399
You are indeed ambitious.

219
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,320
-Slowly.
-Slowly.

220
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,600
Are you really fine?

221
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,960
Yes.

222
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,360
I'll go and find them now.

223
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,360
I don't want to drag this issue out.

224
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,679
Do you want to wait for me to get better?

225
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,080
Let's go together.

226
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:14,480
It makes no difference.

227
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,759
I've been there many times.

228
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
I know how to handle it.

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,879
As you said,

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,879
we won't leave this year's issue to next year.

231
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,080
Lie down properly.

232
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Let him go.

233
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,679
Let him practice how to solve issues.

234
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,039
So that he won't be like his father

235
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,799
who can't handle any issues outside

236
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,360
but only knows to throw a tantrum at home.

237
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,440
It's easier to begin construction
on the quarry land.

238
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,480
Large machines can be brought in easily.

239
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,200
Within a month's time,

240
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
we can build the basic facilities.

241
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,039
We can begin after the 15th day
of the Chinese New Year.

242
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,039
All right.

243
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,879
When this area is almost done,

244
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,639
we will start building
the wastewater treatment plant.

245
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,440
Currently, I think

246
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,639
Mr. Liu's plan is quite good.

247
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,360
What do you think?

248
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,919
-Yes.
-It's good.

249
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,000
When did you come in?

250
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,000
Mr. Wan. I have something to tell you.

251
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,279
Go ahead.

252
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,039
It's still about

253
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,960
the compensation.

254
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,399
Cai came to find me today.

255
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,399
He said there's another agreement

256
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,399
with the supermarket.

257
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,879
Who is Cai?

258
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,679
That Cai who buys vegetables from us.

259
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,679
He's surname is Cai

260
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,320
so we called him Cai.

261
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,480
Seriously. I'm having a meeting right now.

262
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,399
Go and look for Chuanjia.

263
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,360
Tell Chuanjia about it.

264
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,200
Fine.

265
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,840
I'm going, Mr. Wan.

266
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,480
Hurry up.

267
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,279
I don't understand.

268
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,639
What kind of fee is this again?

269
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,279
The damages
that Cai had to pay to the supermarket.

270
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,720
Cai said we need to pay the damages.

271
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,039
But I think

272
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,279
we are in this situation

273
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,600
because the village wants to acquire our land.

274
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,559
Fine.

275
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,080
I understand.

276
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,840
You mean

277
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,440
if there's anything

278
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,360
related to your land,

279
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,320
you'll come and ask me for compensation, right?

280
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,000
No. That's not what I meant.

281
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,799
What do you mean then?

282
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,200
I shouldn't have paid you 70,000 yuan.

283
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
What now?

284
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,679
You scammed us for 70,000 yuan

285
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,000
and now you are asking for 60,000 yuan again?

286
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,279
Haven't you had enough yet?

287
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,759
How can you say that it was a scam?

288
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,759
What is it if it's not a scam?

289
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,559
Where's the bill?

290
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,039
That was an agreement
between my father and Mr. Wan.

291
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,320
Yes. You are right.

292
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,000
Isn't that all your family can do?

293
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,320
You know my father cherishes old friendships

294
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,639
so you acted pitifully.

295
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,559
Qinglai, I'm telling you.

296
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,280
We need to be honest.

297
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,759
Know when to stop.

298
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,600
No. This money is different.

299
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,440
I can explain it clearly for this.

300
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,360
Fine.

301
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,759
Tell me about it.

302
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,679
Be clear.

303
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,879
We signed a contract with the supermarket.

304
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,039
Uncle.

305
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Why are you here again?

306
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Isn't it Lunar New Year's Eve?

307
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
I see you still working hard for the villagers

308
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,639
and I feel bad for you.

309
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,480
I brought you some dates.

310
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,240
What are you trying to get in exchange

311
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,559
for those dates of yours?

312
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,200
Well, it's still about

313
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,679
the compensation for the land.

314
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,519
Didn't I compensate every family

315
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,919
with an extra 20,000 yuan?

316
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes.

317
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,919
Well...

318
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,799
Yes.

319
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,600
But that's

320
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
still ways apart

321
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,799
from what Qinglai received.

322
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,799
How dare you compare

323
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,480
your land with Qinglai's?

324
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,399
His land is covered in rich soil.

325
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,639
Yours is just asphalt.

326
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,399
What do you mean?

327
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,679
Should I see your land

328
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,000
as the same as Qinglai's?

329
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,960
No, Uncle.

330
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,720
I'm not that foolish.

331
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,039
What do you want then?

332
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,559
I was wondering.

333
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,600
Since the village can compensate
another 20,000 yuan,

334
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,759
I'm sure they can compensate another 40,000 yuan

335
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,200
or 50,000 yuan.

336
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,279
You really let your imaginations run wild.

337
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,399
Sure. You decide.

338
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,320
You'll make the decision.

339
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,240
I'll let you sit here.

340
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,159
No. I can't make the call.

341
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,840
You are the boss.

342
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,080
Please sit down.

343
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,080
If I pay you,

344
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,600
what will you use it for?

345
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,600
Uncle.

346
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,000
My body is weak.

347
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,879
I don't make much money.

348
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,440
My wife

349
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,879
and the two children

350
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,480
are very pitiful.

351
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,639
Since there's an opportunity,

352
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,120
I want to get more money

353
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,399
to make my life better.

354
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,159
Make your life better?

355
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Don't you think I know you?

356
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,720
You'll either drink or gamble with the money.

357
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,639
I feel sorry for your wife

358
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,039
for marrying you.

359
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,039
How dare you use them as an excuse.

360
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,960
I'm telling you.

361
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,440
I'll tell Cailiang to make sure

362
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,399
that you don't get any of the money.

363
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,679
I'll give them all to your wife.

364
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,360
No.

365
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:52,360
Why did you get angry suddenly, Uncle?

366
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,639
Even if you can't give another 50,000 yuan,

367
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,399
another 30,000 yuan will be enough.

368
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,759
Even if it's not as much as what Qinglai gets,

369
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,799
I'll be happier to get more

370
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,200
than Chunxian and Fusheng.

371
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,519
You don't deserve to be happy.

372
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,360
Let me tell you.

373
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,960
People like you can't be rich.

374
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,279
You'll get worse when you have money!

375
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,360
Uncle, look what you are saying.

376
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,519
I just want some more money from you.

377
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,120
Even if you don't do it for me,

378
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,790
just think of it as a favor to my father

379
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,440
who used to work with you in the quarry.

380
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,639
Why don't I call my father here?

381
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,159
Didn't Qinglai get more compensation

382
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,679
by calling his father here to beg you?

383
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,879
You need to be fair and just.

384
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,759
My father is weak too,

385
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,600
let alone my mother.

386
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,399
I'm weak too.

387
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,159
Why don't I eat with your family

388
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,879
today for the Lunar New Year's Eve reunion dinner?

389
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,639
You are really a rascal.

390
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,320
Darn you.

391
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,240
I'll help your father teach you a lesson today!

392
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,440
Why does the Wan family
have a descendant like you?

393
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:48,879
Uncle!

394
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:49,279
Shameless!

395
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:49,639
Uncle!

396
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,679
Get lost. Get lost!

397
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,399
Uncle!

398
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,799
A good man doesn't use violence.

399
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,320
-Get lost!
-Stop throwing things at me, Uncle!

400
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,720
Stop it!

401
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,039
I'll come and greet you tomorrow!

402
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,399
I'm leaving!

403
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,120
Hello.

404
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,440
Mr. Wan.

405
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,919
Cailiang.

406
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,159
Guancai came to me again

407
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,639
for the land acquisition.

408
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,399
Mr. Wan.

409
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,879
Your nephew is very troublesome.

410
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,200
Everyone has agreed and signed

411
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,460
except for him.

412
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,410
I know.

413
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,220
I just chased him out.

414
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,050
Listen.

415
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,410
Bring the agreement

416
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,410
and the accountant

417
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,260
to his house.

418
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,650
If he doesn't sign it, get his father to sign.

419
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,770
I don't believe I can't deal with him.

420
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
When you get the money,

421
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,100
don't give him a single cent.

422
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,290
Give it all to his wife.

423
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,460
Come to me if there's a problem.

424
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,690
Yes. I understand.

425
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,340
Come in!

426
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,930
What's going on today?

427
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,020
Mr. Wan, today...

428
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,220
What's the matter?

429
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,180
Mr. Wan.

430
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,290
It's still the same issue.

431
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,290
Regarding

432
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,180
the compensation for the land.

433
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,130
Didn't I ask you to find Chuanjia?

434
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,260
I've talked to Chuanjia.

435
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,570
Chuanjia said

436
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,370
I've already signed the agreement.

437
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,570
The debt...

438
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,260
The debt is cleared.

439
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,090
He won't be responsible for anything else.

440
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:36,980
That's right.

441
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,330
You signed the agreement
after you read it carefully.

442
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,940
You wouldn't have signed it
if you didn't read it properly, right?

443
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,290
I also did what your father asked me to.

444
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,570
What else do you want?

445
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,260
But the 60,000 yuan problem

446
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,740
appeared after I signed the agreement.

447
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,900
60,000 yuan?

448
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,420
Where did it come from?

449
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,700
You already signed the agreement

450
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,810
and you are causing a problem again?

451
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,500
Do I have to pay you 80,000 yuan
if you ask me again?

452
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,090
You are all so greedy.

453
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,940
Because of you guys,

454
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,700
I even told the Group

455
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,090
and village committee to take care of you.

456
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,980
I've given you the highest compensation
according to the standard.

457
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,570
You have a big appetite now.

458
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,940
You're so shameless for money.

459
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,660
The old came after the young

460
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,740
and the young came again after the old.

461
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,330
Who do you think you are?

462
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,460
No, Mr. Wan.

463
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,260
How can you say that?

464
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,850
My father didn't offend you.

465
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,420
Besides, other people are asking us for money.

466
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,900
Go and talk to them!

467
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,050
Why did you come to me?

468
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,050
I took care of your father

469
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,850
because he is old!

470
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,050
Why are you causing trouble as well?

471
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,090
Get out!

472
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,610
Mr. Wan.

473
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,260
Why are you being unreasonable?

474
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,570
You asked me to find Chuanjia.

475
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,460
He won't help me with it so I came back to you.

476
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,810
Now you are chasing me away again.

477
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,130
Both of you are pushing me around.

478
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,050
Are you taking me for a fool?

479
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,770
Nonsense!

480
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,570
I have many things to do every day.

481
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,700
Do I have time to fool around?

482
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,660
Brat.

483
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,460
Get lost!

484
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,610
I won't.

485
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,770
I won't leave if you don't give me an answer.

486
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,610
Will you leave or not?

487
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,220
I...

488
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,660
Leave!

489
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,290
Xingfu, didn't you sprain your waist?

490
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,940
This is not a lot of work. Go and rest.

491
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,570
I applied a plaster. It's much better now.

492
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,180
Just peel some peanuts then.

493
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,810
Dad! Mom!

494
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,810
Why are you shouting?

495
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,660
It's terrible!

496
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,050
What's wrong?

497
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,900
My brother was injured from a kick by Mr. Wan.

498
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,940
Where is he?

499
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,050
He's at the Village Health Center!

500
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,130
Hurry up!

501
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:45,700
Oh, no!

502
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:46,660
Oh, no!

503
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,180
-Dr. Liu!
-Doctor!

504
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,460
How is it?

505
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,260
It doesn't look too good.

506
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,090
It was swelling badly.

507
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,770
I helped reduce the swelling

508
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,700
and we need to observe his situation.

509
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,530
All right.

510
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,500
Qinglai.

511
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,460
How are you?

512
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,090
Why did this happen?

513
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,180
I don't know either.

514
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,180
I said

515
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,980
I wanted to get compensation
for the damages we have to pay.

516
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,980
He got angry

517
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,570
and kicked me.

518
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:21,980
Are you all right?

519
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,290
Mr. Wan.

520
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,980
Why did you kick Qinglai?

521
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,850
He came here to cause trouble

522
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,020
and wouldn't leave

523
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,370
so I kicked him.

524
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,900
A youngster

525
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,570
shouted at me.

526
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,020
Couldn't I teach him a lesson?

527
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,610
Couldn't you just talk to him normally?

528
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,660
Why did you kick him?

529
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,460
Do you know he is screaming in pain

530
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,740
at the hospital now?

531
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,460
Is that...

532
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,020
Is that how the leaders of Wan Village

533
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,130
educate people?

534
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,090
You are right.

535
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,290
That is how Wan Village educates people.

536
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,530
Spare the rod, spoil the child.

537
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,940
A bad kid deserves to be beaten.

538
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,020
Not to mention

539
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,570
Qinglai and Chuanjia's generation.

540
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,740
Go ask Wang Youde.

541
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,020
Which of us hadn't been beaten before?

542
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,740
Go and ask your husband's father.

543
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,120
If he says

544
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,020
I can't beat Qinglai,

545
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,500
I will go to your house

546
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,900
and apologize

547
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,020
to Qinglai.

548
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:58,850
[Wanjia Group]

549
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,570
Hello.

550
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,290
What?

551
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,610
Qinglai.

552
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,260
-Qinglai.
-Qinglai.

553
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,660
Qinglai, can you take it?

554
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,420
It hurts.

555
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,530
Doctor!

556
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,900
Come and have a look. He's in pain.

557
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,290
Doctor, he can't pee. What's wrong?

558
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:15,810
Let me have a look.

559
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,130
Come.

560
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,220
Doctor, it's bad to hold it in like this.

561
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,810
Give him an extra dose of medicine.

562
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,500
Xingfu.

563
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,260
Is it so serious?

564
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,090
What's wrong with him?

565
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,290
He can't urinate.

566
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,220
Looking at the x-ray,

567
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,050
it's not too bad.

568
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,180
That's not bad?

569
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,330
He can't even get his urine out.

570
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,660
Sir.

571
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,940
There's no use after two doses of painkillers.

572
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,420
You still need to think of another way.

573
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,570
If it's just because of the urination problem,

574
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,420
we can just drain the urine.

575
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,980
I beg you, Dr. Zhao.

576
00:22:56,371 --> 00:22:58,460
It's bad for him if we wait any longer.

577
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,610
The problem is,

578
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,130
he got kicked.

579
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,900
We dare not operate on him

580
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,260
in case of secondary damage.

581
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,500
I'm sure you know

582
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,290
that we are just a Village Health Center.

583
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,460
Our doctors lack experience

584
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,570
and we lack equipment.

585
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,980
A small illness is won't be a problem

586
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,130
but we are not confident

587
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,810
in handling the complicated ones.

588
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,370
Are you saying that we have to
transfer him to a bigger hospital?

589
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,460
It's like this.

590
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,130
I think

591
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,090
we should keep observing.

592
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,610
Maybe there's a chance he'll be fine.

593
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,660
If you transfer him,

594
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,940
the cost will go up.

595
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,220
You have to pay all the costs yourself.

596
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,090
There's no problem with that.

597
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,220
We can't let him just sit here and wait.

598
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,500
Sir.

599
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,050
Please make a call.

600
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,130
We'll be transferring hospitals.

601
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,900
Mom!

602
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,900
How's Qinglai?

603
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:48,900
He's fine.

604
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,850
He's able to urinate now.

605
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,570
The doctor said there's no big issue.

606
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,260
They just need to observe him for a few days.

607
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,330
Where's your father?

608
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,850
The doctor says it's better
to have someone there at night

609
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,020
in case the patient needs anything

610
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,020
so Dad stayed there.

611
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,850
Look at all this mess.

612
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,980
Right?

613
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,530
Just talk it out.

614
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,900
Why kick him?

615
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,420
When I went to look for Mr. Wan in the afternoon,

616
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,770
he acted like he was in the right

617
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,460
to kick someone.

618
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,530
How could he do that?

619
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,180
Let's eat first.

620
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,260
Let me bring the dish over.

621
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,020
There's another dish.

622
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,940
Mom, I'll go.

623
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,740
This dinner.

624
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,530
Why did you bring medicines back?

625
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,370
I was in the hospital the whole day.

626
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,900
I think I have the flu.

627
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,020
Oh, no.

628
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,770
Look at you.

629
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:36,610
Give it to me.

630
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,570
You should put on a few more layers.

631
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,180
Look at you.

632
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,980
Be careful, my dear.

633
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,420
Drink it.

634
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,610
Finish it and sleep early tonight.

635
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,740
We've been busy for the whole day.

636
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,610
Nothing good happened today.

637
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,570
What about their dinner?

638
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,420
I bought it for them.

639
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,900
Good.

640
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,850
Mom, what's wrong?

641
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,370
It's the Chinese New Year.

642
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,570
Qinglai

643
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,900
is lying in the hospital.

644
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,980
Qingzhi

645
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,220
is working in the city.

646
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,900
Only the three of us
are eating the reunion dinner.

647
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,900
I remember many things from the past.

648
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,020
I feel sad.

649
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,420
Mom, don't cry.

650
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,180
Xingfu.

651
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,370
When I married into this family at your age,

652
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,850
Qinglai's father was younger than him now.

653
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,610
My father-in-law was similar to Qinglai's father.

654
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,700
He was more useless than Qinglai's father.

655
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,020
He was a coward.

656
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,900
That was how a small family like us
lived our life.

657
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,700
Why did Qinglai

658
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,980
end up like this?

659
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,020
He stutters when he speaks

660
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,530
because he was bullied

661
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,530
when he was a child.

662
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,050
Well,

663
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,610
in a kid's fight,

664
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,220
no one knows

665
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,900
who is really at fault.

666
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,090
But it was me

667
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,090
who took Qinglai

668
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,330
to apologize to other people every time.

669
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,980
I was thinking

670
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,090
if Qinglai

671
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,610
isn't willing to communicate with others,

672
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,770
he could be a worker at the factory.

673
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,220
But he refused to do that.

674
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,530
That's all because those kids bullied him.

675
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,050
His father still won't admit this until now.

676
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,180
When I had Qingzhi and Xiuyu,

677
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,370
I was more careful.

678
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,290
I protected them

679
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,850
so they wouldn't get bullied.

680
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,020
They had no problems after they grow up.

681
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,660
Qinglai was the one who suffered.

682
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,980
No wonder Qinglai is timid

683
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,700
and afraid of talking to people.

684
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,500
I've always felt bad about it.

685
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,460
Qinglai was always beaten up by other kids.

686
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,700
He's now married

687
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,900
and will become a father soon.

688
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,500
Why did he still get beaten up?

689
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,420
What kind of fate does he have?

690
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,660
Mom, don't worry.

691
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:52,850
I'll definitely

692
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,260
get an explanation from them

693
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,180
regarding Qinglai's injury.

694
00:27:58,850 --> 00:27:59,900
Xingfu.

695
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,610
It makes me sad

696
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,810
to see Qinglai getting injured as well.

697
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,940
But didn't it happen because of the land?

698
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,810
All of you don't know.

699
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,570
Many people

700
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,740
were talking and spreading rumors

701
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,570
in the Group.

702
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:15,180
They say our family

703
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,130
got a lot of money

704
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,810
like we took advantage of them.

705
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,810
They were pointing fingers at us.

706
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:21,042
Xingfu

707
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,900
also argued twice with Chuanjia.

708
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,770
Everyone in the Group stays away

709
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,850
from me now.

710
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,980
If this goes on,

711
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,770
I won't be able to stay in the Group for long.

712
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,530
If we offend

713
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,220
the village and the secretary,

714
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,980
nothing good will come to our family.

715
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,090
Just forget about it.

716
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,370
How can we do that?

717
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,050
That's your brother, Xiuyu.

718
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,020
Didn't you see how sad Mom is

719
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,700
because of him?

720
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,850
Xingfu.

721
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,940
You might not want to hear what I have to say,

722
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,220
but you just got here
and you don't know much about Wan Village.

723
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,370
Don't think it's a big deal

724
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,700
for Mr. Wan to post a notice last time.

725
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,020
Wan Village has its own rules

726
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,520
after being here for many years.

727
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,770
Mr. Wan always

728
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,740
hit people

729
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,500
in the Group.

730
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,940
Everyone knows about that.

731
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
I'm sure

732
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,330
he didn't injure Qinglai on purpose.

733
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,900
You know

734
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,500
Qinglai was bad at talking too.

735
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,610
Perhaps what he said offended Mr. Wan

736
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,940
so he kicked him.

737
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,130
He just accidentally kicked his groin.

738
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,090
I'm sure he is regretting his actions now.

Xiuyu.

740
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,420
Dad and Mom are old

741
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,330
so I understand
why they don't want to cause a scene.

742

But you are young.

How can you think like that?

744
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,500
Is beating people up

745
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,460
the right thing to do?

746
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,420
You don't think for Qinglai

747
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,850
and find excuses

748
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,290
to persuade me to forget about this instead?

749
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,940
I grew up here.

750
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,500
I know Wan Village more than you do.

751
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,220
That's how Wan Village is.

752
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,940
If everyone can live here peacefully,
why can't we?

753
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,090
Also, Wan Village is officially recognized

754
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,610
as the best place to live in this area.

755
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,260
Be optimistic.

756
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,130
Didn't the doctor say

757
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,740
Qinglai's injury isn't that serious?

758
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,370
He'll be fine after a few days.

762

make a compromise

763
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,330
regarding the compensation.

Are you afraid

that I will affect your job

767
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,130
by talking to them about Qinglai?

768

Why can't you see the big picture?

But why do you

777

sound exactly the same as Mr. Wan?

778

Mom, what do you think we should do?

Do you need my help?

839
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,180
Yes.

840
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,850
They said everything in our village
falls under your jurisdiction.

841
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,700
Sure.

842
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,050
Let me park my bike.

843
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,050
We'll talk in the office.

844
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:41,570
I heard about it.

845
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,260
Many things have happened since you got married.

846
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,500
Here.

847
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,710
What is it?

848
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,070
Mr. Li.

849
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,140
Qinglai was kicked by Mr. Wan.

850
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,140
He is injured

851
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,790
and can't even get out of bed now.

852
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,750
What should I do?

853
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,900
Mr. Wan kicked him?

854
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,030
Where?

855
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,420
His groin.

856
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,990
Qinglai can't even pee because of the swelling.

857
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,990
He is lying in the hospital now.

858
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,900
Why did he kick Qinglai?

859
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,710
Because he wants to acquire our land

860
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,990
to build a factory.

861
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:16,828
My family incurred a heavy loss

862
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,510
and had something to say
regarding the compensation.

863
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,380
Qinglai went to discuss it with him

864
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,950
and he got kicked.

865
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,380
This Wan Shantang

866
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,750
has a bad temper.

867
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,580
That's all?

868
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,310
He doesn't need to take responsibility?

869
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:41,900
Xingfu.

870
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,140
Mr. Wan is definitely wrong for kicking someone.

871
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,860
Go back first.

872
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,660
I'll ask him about it.

873
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,950
I'll definitely ask him
to give you an explanation.

874
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,820
All right?

875
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,950
Promise me.

876
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,950
You have to go

877
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,420
and get him to give me an explanation.

878
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,340
Otherwise, I won't forgive him.

879
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,620
Actually,

880
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,860
I know

881
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,070
Mr. Wan well.

882
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,230
He is not a bad person.

883
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,710
But when a person is capable,

884
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,030
he'll have a bad temper.

885
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,990
Speaking of which,

886
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,860
if he has no temper,

887
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,580
he won't be able to lead Wan Village

888
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,550
to its glory now.

889
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,780
Right?

890
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,070
Why are you saying that as well?

891
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,030
What's so great about having achievements?

892
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,100
Can he kick someone because of that?

893
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,470
Is it right to kick someone
when you have achievements?

894
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,700
No.

895
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,510
All right.

896
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,470
I won't talk much about this.

897
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,580
Don't worry.

898
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,260
I will definitely investigate this

899
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,180
and...

900
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,910
I will solve this issue for you.

901
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:44,990
All right?

902
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,470
Sure.

903
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,990
I'll be waiting for your news.

904
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,390
Go back for now.

Hello.

Xingfu, what's wrong?

908
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,870
How are you? Do you have enough money?

909

Xingfu, don't worry.

910
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,990
I am already an apprentice lawyer.

911
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,740
I can earn money

912
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,550
from accepting cases.

913
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,740
Xingfu, how are you recently?

914
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,910
Did your belly get bigger?

Be careful.

916
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,030
Don't run around.

00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,910
I'm tough.

I'm fated to work hard.

I have to go to the hospital

to visit Qinglai later.

921
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,990
What happened to Qinglai? Is he OK?

922
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,030
He was injured two days ago.

923
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,180
The doctor said it wasn't serious.
He will be fine.

924

Don't be anxious regarding your work. Take it slow.

It'll get better.

Don't hide from me if you have any difficulties.

Now that I've achieved what I said,

997

00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,660
Wan Village

1007
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,430
will handle all of Wan Village's problems.

1008
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,660
We won't cause trouble for society

1009
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,100
and the government.

1010
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,030
Still, you're here.

1011
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,780
About Wang Qinglai

1012
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,510
who's from your village...

1013
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,550
His family went to see you?

1014
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,950
The wife came to find me.

1015
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,620
Shantang.

1016
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,550
I'm not complaining.

1017
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,870
You

1018
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,910
are an executive

1019
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,700
that leads a huge group.

1020
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,070
Why did you stoop to the level of a villager?

1021
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,430
You could just talk it out.

1022
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,140
Why did you kick him?

1023
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,510
What's so serious about it?

1024
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,030
Didn't you get kicked by your elders
when you were young?

1025
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,220
I got kicked often.

1026
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:26,910
Exactly.

1027
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,550
But you need to control your strength.

1028
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,660
I'm telling you.

1029
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,740
Before I came here,

1030
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,740
I went to the county hospital
to check his medical record.

1031
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,430
Your kick inflicted a heavy injury.

1032
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,300
You...

1033
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,620
If they file a report,

1034
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,990
you might

1035
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,870
be speaking with me somewhere else.

1036
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,950
Are you trying to scare me?

1037
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,830
Sure. Come.

1038
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,180
Arrest me now.

1039
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,180
What?

1040
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,430
I'm telling you.

1041
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,220
You are a party member.

1042
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,910
You are an official.

1043
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,100
I'm also his elder.

1044
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,140
What's wrong with an elder educating the young?

1045
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,030
What's wrong with that?

1046
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,430
What are you saying?

1047
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,660
His wife came to me.

1048
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,990
You need to make things clear.

1049
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,580
Tell me, what will you do about it?

1050
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,510
Really?

1051
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,300
Is it that serious?

1052
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,580
You.

1053
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,780
How old are you now?

1054
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,660
Don't you know how serious it is?

1055
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,030
You don't know.

1056
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,700
Recently,

1057
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,740
I was very annoyed.

1058
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,260
There was the land acquisition loan

1059
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,100
and I signed many contracts.

1060
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,350
I was so busy.

1061
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,910
At a time like that,

1062
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,390
a few villagers came and caused trouble

1063
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,220
because of the land acquisition compensation.

1064
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,510
That day, many things happened.

1065
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,910
Guancai came first

1066
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,660
then Qinglai came right after that.

1067
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,470
He's a good kid

1068
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,910
but he caused me trouble as well.

1069
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,140
The money wasn't much

1070
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,140
but he annoyed me.

1071
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,510
What's in it for me?

1072
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,620
I did it

1073
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,300
for Wan Village's development.

1074
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,700
If Wan Village is prosperous,

1075
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,910
everyone benefits from it.

1076
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,780
I was building a foundation for young people.

1077
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,910
Why don't they understand?

1078
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,300
No matter what you say,

1079
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,830
kicking people is wrong.

1080
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,430
His wife came to make a report.

1081
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,830
It's a public safety issue now.

1082
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,550
It involves you

1083
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,830
so you need to tell me where you stand.

1084
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,620
You came here after visiting the Wang family?

1085
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,350
Are you trying to be the peacemaker here?

1086
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,620
What are you talking about?

1087
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,740
I'm trying to solve a civil dispute

1088
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,990
to create a harmonious society.

1089
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,990
Fine.

1090
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,260
With our friendship, I'll listen to you.

1091
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,870
I'll make a decision for you then.

1092
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,550
Sure.

1093
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,070
Public safety fine

1094
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,070
of 1,000 yuan

1095
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,990
and all of their medical expenses.

1096
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,620
Sure.

1097
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,300
Is anyone here?

1098
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,430
Officer Li?

1099
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,780
Mrs. Wang.

1100
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,350
Hurry. Come and sit inside.

1101
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,390
Mr. Li. Let's chat inside.

1102
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,390
No need.

1103
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,300
I'll be quick.

1104
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,550
I went to visit Mr. Wan just now.

1105
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,260
His attitude was good

1106
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,390
and it was easy to deal with him.

1107
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,620
Xingfu.

1108
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:24,100
You came to me to solve your issue.

1109
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,030
I won't be making an official report.

1110
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,870
Shantang

1111
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,780
has accepted the public safety penalty.

1112
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,830
He agreed

1113
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,780
to compensate Qinglai 1,000 yuan.

1114
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,660
He will also pay for Qinglai's medical expenses.

1115
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,830
Later,

1116
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,070
both of you go and visit him.

1117
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,260
It'll be over

1118
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,990
when both parties meet and talk about it.

1119
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,620
Are you happy with the result?

1120
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,350
Sure. It's good.

1121
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,580
Where are Youde and Qinglai?

1122
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,070
Youde went to the field.

1123
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,300
Qinglai

1124
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,830
needs a few more days

1125
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:54,740
to rest and recover.

1126
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,740
Sure.

1127
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,830
Tell them about it later.

1128
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,510
I have things to do at the police station.

1129
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,260
I'll be leaving now.

1130
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:01,950
Sure, Mr. Li.

1131
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,580
All right. Take care.

1132
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,140
Sure.
