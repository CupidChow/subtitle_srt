3
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,159
Hello, Hello.

4
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:44,760
Hello.

5
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,840
I'll carry your luggage.

6
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,439
Alright. Thanks.

7
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:46,879
-Thanks.
-No worries.

8
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,439
You provide spring water here, don't you?

9
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:48,879
Yes.

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,959
Did you find us online

11
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,959
or through friends?

12
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,280
-Online.
-Online.

13
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,319
Oh, that's good.

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,359
Nice environment.

15
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,200
Yes.

16
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,359
Liuhua, guide the guests.

17
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:57,840
Let me.

18
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,799
When did you start operating the inn?

19
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,920
Not long ago.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,359
Thanks.

21
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,000
Enjoy your stay.

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,879
Thanks.

23
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,799
Madam, you are busy.

24
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:20,759
Madam,

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,719
normally, only you and Gang

26
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,159
are at home.

27
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:25,719
So,

28
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,719
who cleans the house?

29
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,479
Me.

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,120
It must be hard for you to work on both sides.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Do you have a spare room at home?

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,919
Yes.

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,280
We have quite a few vacant rooms.

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,639
Really?

35
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,919
That's great.

36
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,560
Madam,

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,639
you know

38
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,639
Mr. Wu, right?

39
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,840
He injured his leg.

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,080
His friend wanted to visit him.

41
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,319
However, our inn

42
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,759
is fully booked.

43
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,319
I wonder if you can spare a room in your house

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,960
to let his friend stay?

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,560
Sure.

46
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,319
And his friend can take showers at your place?

47
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,599
Yes.

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,520
Good, good.

49
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,800
When it's time, I'll send over

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,240
the stuff

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,360
for the accommodation.

52
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,159
Okay. Sure.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,560
Alright.

54
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,319
What about the fee?

55
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,639
Don't worry about that.

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,759
Of course,

57
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,960
we'll settle it according to our standard

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
for the rooms in the inn.

59
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,199
Okay?

60
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,840
Okay, that's great.

61
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,240
I'll inform you in advance

62
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
about when they'd arrive.

63
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,479
Don't worry.

64
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,680
-Okay.
-That's good.

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,319
My house is very clean.

66
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,840
I renovated it last year

67
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,159
to get Gang a wife.

68
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,120
That's great.

69
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,159
Thank you, madam.

70
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,840
I'll inform Mr. Wu immediately.

71
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,400
Okay.

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,800
I'll go home and clean my house
after I finish cooking.

73
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,000
Qinglai.

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,199
Where are you going?

75
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,159
To pick vegetables in the field.

76
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,599
We're going to Mr. Wan's house soon.

77
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,479
You're coming along.

78
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm not going.

79
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,520
No way.

80
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Only your dad and I...

81
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,039
I'm too ashamed to go.

82
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,840
Aren't you eating with us?

83
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,560
No. I feel too ashamed.

84
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,400
Slow down.

85
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,959
Xiuyu.

86
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,319
Get up.

87
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,000
Get up and eat.

88
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,920
We'll visit Mr. Wan in a while.

89
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,560
We have an appointment with him.

90
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,360
Xiuyu.

91
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,759
Xiuyu.

92
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,040
I know

93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,680
you can hear me.

94
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,680
You hate me.

95
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,720
I love you.

96
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,519
You are my flesh and blood.

97
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,920
How could I not love you?

98
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,279
You feel aggrieved.

99
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,040
I know that in my heart

100
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,360
but that's fate, my dear.

101
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,319
You cannot relive those lost years.

102
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,040
Am I right?

103
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,079
I've thought of

104
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,399
the best remedy.

105
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,079
Xiuyu,

106
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,519
you can blame your dad and me.

107
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,160
We can't give you a good life.

108
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,360
You've suffered a great grievance.

109
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,879
My darling girl.

111
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,680
Do it for me.

112
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,519
Xiuyu.

113
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,199
I'll kneel for you.

114
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,000
I kneel on behalf of the Wang family,

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Xiuyu.

116
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:01,920
Mom!

117
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:02,879
Get up!

118
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,040
Good girl.

119
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,199
Good girl. Listen to me.

120
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,319
Do as I say.

121
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,360
Come.

122
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
Do as I say.

123
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,519
We are here. Come.

124
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,800
Come.

125
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,680
Come on.

[Outstanding Public Servant]

127
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,720
Mr. Wan.

128
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,399
Mr. and Mrs. Wang.

129
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,399
I brought these two unfilial children here.

130
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,480
Come, you two.

131
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,240
Kneel

132
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,240
before Mr. and Mrs. Wang

133
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,319
and Xiuyu.

134
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,399
Kneel.

135
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,759
You're the culprit.

136
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
Say something.

137
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,439
Mr. Youde

138
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,519
and Mrs. Wang,

139
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,680
I was confused.

140
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,240
I made a big mistake.

141
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,439
I admit it.

142
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,360
Xiuyu.

143
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,560
I am sorry.

144
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,600
Vent your anger

145
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,480
and hatred

146
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,839
on me.

147
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,240
It was my idea.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,399
I will make it up to you.

149
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,160
Mr. and Mrs. Wang.

150
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,079
They've done the deed

151
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,519
and committed a grave mistake.

152
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,600
It's too late to say anything.

153
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:36,839
At the moment,

154
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
we can only

155
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,000
try our best

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,919
to compensate Xiuyu.

157
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,120
What do you think...

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,799
Mr. Wan.

Xiuyu.

161
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,240
Don't.

162
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,879
Keep quiet.

163
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,559
Did you ask her to come here?

164
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,200
No. She doesn't know about this.

165
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,320
Why is she here?

166
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,879
Mr. Wan.

167
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,120
Coming.

168
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,919
Mr. Wan.

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,799
Xingfu.

170
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,039
What brings you here?

171
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,559
Sorry to bother you.

172
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,320
You were not at the village committee.

173
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,759
So, I came to your house.

174
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,840
It's like this.

175
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,159
Xingfu told me

176
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,200
a swell idea.

177
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,679
I want to ask about your opinion.

178
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,080
I called but you didn't answer the phone.

179
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,639
So, I came here directly.

180
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,519
Why don't we go inside to discuss it?

181
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,440
Let's go to the village committee.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,279
How about our inn?

183
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,639
Since our inn opened,

184
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,679
you've visited only once.

185
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,200
A lot has changed.

186
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,440
I just got a new batch of tea leaves.

187
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,519
Come over for tea

188
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,720
while I report things to you.

189
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,720
Okay. Okay.

190
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,679
Let's go.

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,519
Let's go.

192
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,440
You came here suddenly, I'm a bit...

193
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,519
Chuanjia.

194
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,960
Don't kneel anymore.

195
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,879
Get up quickly.

196
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
We'll get down to business.

197
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,840
Okay?

198
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,639
Quickly.

199
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,480
Get up. Get up.

200
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,559
Okay.

201
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,519
Then,

202
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
we'll get down to business.

203
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,879
Okay.

204
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,960
Mr. and Mrs. Wang.

205
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,720
This is the agreement.

206
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,679
As we agreed earlier,

207
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
I will make

208
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,600
a one-time compensation of 300,000 yuan.

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,559
Okay.

210
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,159
Then,

211
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,799
there is Xiuyu's job

212
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,279
and salary adjustment.

213
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,240
I'll get it done within a month.

214
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:47,960
Okay.

215
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
We've made a small change to the agreement.

216
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,879
We added

217
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,080
a confidentiality clause.

218
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,000
We can't expose this issue.

219
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,360
If you expose it

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,519
and cause bad consequences,

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,600
you have to pay triple the compensation,

222
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,600
in other words, 900,000 yuan.

223
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,480
You'll also

224
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,000
bear the consequences.

225
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,440
This...

226
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,600
If you have no problem with this,

227
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,840
you can sign it.

228
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,960
Chuanmei has signed it already.

229
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,000
Chuanjia,

230
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,200
what do you mean

231
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,519
by 900,000?

232
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,919
Well,

233
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,759
this is just

234
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,080
the habit of professional lawyers.

235
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,039
They said that this agreement

236
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,440
must have a confidentiality clause

237
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,000
in case you expose the issue

238
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
and cause a very bad effect.

239
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,879
Then, you have to return the 300,000 yuan

240
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,960
and pay us 600,000 yuan more.

241
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:38,919
Chuanjia,

242
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,480
does this mean

243
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,600
that if we do not expose

244
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,480
this matter,

245
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:45,840
the 300,000 yuan

246
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,840
is ours?

247
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,480
Of course.

248
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,360
Think about it.

249
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,960
We certainly

250
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,120
want to keep this a secret.

251
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,759
Exactly.

252
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,200
So, after you sign this agreement,

253
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,840
you can't expose the matter.

254
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,360
True. I won't tell anyone.

255
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,080
So,

256
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,159
just disregard the clause.

257
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,080
Xiuyu,

258
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,679
do you need more time?

259
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,919
Xiuyu, look.

260
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,919
I added

261
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,240
another clause here.

262
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,080
As long as I work in the Group,

263
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,000
the Group will give the two of you

264
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,840
the highest pension,

265
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,600
allowance, and other treatment for old folks.

266
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,679
Good.

267
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,519
Take your time.

268
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:27,960
Xiuyu,

269
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,519
you can read it again and think about it.

270
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,320
Xiuyu,

271
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,360
sign it after you've decided.

272
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,240
My dear,

273
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,799
sign it.

274
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,320
Xiuyu,

275
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,879
sign it.

276
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,159
Sign it.

277
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,080
Good girl.

278
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,919
What did I say to you?

279
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,480
Come.

280
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,440
Sign it,

281
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,000
Xiuyu.

282
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,639
Sign it.

283
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,080
Your mom and I have thought it through

284
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,960
and this would be the best outcome.

285
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,480
Yes.

286
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,720
Sign it. Don't feel aggrieved.

287
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,080
Sign it. Here.

288
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:04,960
Here.

289
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,200
Sign it.

290
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,320
Hold it.

291
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,720
-Sign it.
-Sign it.

292
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:19,840
You sold me

293
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,639
for so little money.

294
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:25,960
Sign it.

295
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,480
Okay.

296
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:29,519
I'll sign it.

297
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:53,650
[Wang Xiuyu]

298
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,039
(That was my dream for so many years.)

299
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,039
I've signed everything.

300
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,759
Are you satisfied?

301
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,799
Are you all satisfied?

302
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,320
Satisfied?

303
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,960
Wan Chuanmei,

304
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,799
I hate you.

305
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,440
I hate all of you!

306
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,799
Xiuyu.

307
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,360
Mr. Wan,

308
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,440
this is the new Yunwu tea.

309
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,440
Try it.

310
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,840
Actually, we can link it

311
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,679
with Wan Village products

312
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,360
and give our tea producers

313
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,519
some hope.

314
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,840
I honestly think

315
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,720
that Xingfu

316
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,000
is good at doing business.

317
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,039
Mr. Wan?

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
This tea is good.

319
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,919
I just remembered

320
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,399
when Xingfu just arrived at Wan Village,

321
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,320
she was a stubborn girl.

322
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,480
She has changed a lot now.

323
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes.

324
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,559
I can change everything

325
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,200
except for my stubbornness.

326
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,600
True.

327
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,720
I heard that your business

328
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,159
is booming.

329
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,960
It was difficult before.

330
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,039
Later, thanks to the help

331
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,279
of fundraisers

332
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,279
of our inn,

333
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,279
and the publicity that was given

334
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,519
by the health products factory's Mr. Xie

335
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,200
in particular.

336
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,840
When Mr. Xie promoted
his health products outside,

337
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,159
he would mention the stunning views
and quality water here.

338
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,960
Now, tourists from all over the country
are visiting us.

339
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,679
Our rooms are fully booked every day.

340
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,919
Naturally, the business is booming.

341
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,559
Xingfu,

342
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,720
forget about the health products.

343
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,039
Hurry up

344
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,559
and tell Mr. Wan about the idea

345
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,840
you mentioned to me.

346
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,440
Okay.

347
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,180
I'll tell you now, Mr. Wan.

348
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,660
Now,

349
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,420
more and more tourists are coming here

350
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,110
but my inn is the only one in the village.

351
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,420
I only have six rooms.

352
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,990
We can't cater to all customers.

353
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,780
Earlier, many of our villagers

354
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,940
consulted me about building homestays.

355
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,270
I think that those restaurants,

356
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,700
tourist souvenir sellers,

357
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,150
and local specialties sellers

358
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,580
in our village were all stragglers.

359
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,660
The prices

360
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,420
and quality were not standardized.

361
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,820
Everyone wanted to do well

362
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,630
but funding was a general problem.

363
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,350
Perhaps

364
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,510
our village

365
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,940
can set up a professional tourism cooperative.

366
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,940
Like a business alliance.

367
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,750
Yes.

368
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,540
I was happy when Xingfu
mentioned that to me just now.

369
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,580
Wasn't this

370
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,910
what you wanted to do?

371
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,380
You two have the same idea.

372
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,670
This way, we can give financial

373
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,910
and resource support to village entrepreneurs

374
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,060
and prevent

375
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,710
disorderly market competition and chaos.

376
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,430
Of course,

377
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,710
we still have to formulate a set of rules.

378
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,670
For the quality of services

379
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,860
and product quality,

380
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,140
we should set some requirements

381
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,990
but I can't guarantee our growth

382
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,990
in the future.

383
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,990
That being said,

384
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,060
we can at least combine the resources

385
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
of Wan Village first.

386
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,140
Isn't Xingfu different

387
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,990
after she went to the city?

388
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,710
She doesn't just care about her own business.

389
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,710
She also thinks for

390
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,060
the folks in Wan Village.

391
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,270
She can see the bigger picture now.

392
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,580
I learned from you, Mr. Wan.

393
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,470
Me?

394
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,510
You used to tell me

395
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,140
that Wan for all

396
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,580
and all for Wan.

397
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,430
You actually remember that.

398
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,990
She has changed a lot indeed.

399
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,510
Indeed.

400
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,430
Good!

401
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,380
I like your idea.

402
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,670
Dad.

403
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,540
I'm seeing Chuanmei off.

404
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,510
Dad.

405
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,100
I'm leaving.

406
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,270
Dad,

407
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,030
I'm leaving.

408
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,140
Take care of your health.

409
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,540
Take care of yourself.

410
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,710
Don't worry about me.

411
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,030
I'm leaving.

412
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,380
Dad.

413
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,580
Get up.

414
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,380
Go.

415
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,620
Burn a joss stick for mom.

416
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,910
Your mom would feel ashamed

417
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,780
for what you did.

418
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,140
I let your mom down too.

419
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,140
I haven't educated you properly
when you were little.

420
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,620
I am responsible.

421
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,710
However, Chuanmei,

422
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,270
the Chinese term for reputation

423
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,380
consists of the word name and then voice.

424
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,750
For a person, the most important thing
is reputation.

425
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,750
If you owe people,

426
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,430
you will feel bad.

427
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,060
You may leave now.

428
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,030
Go.

429
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,510
Dad,

430
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,510
sorry.

431
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,910
I embarrassed you.

432
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,950
Go.

433
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,950
Go far away

434
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,270
and find a place

435
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,230
to start all over.

436
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,950
Learn to be a good person.

437
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,270
Don't come back.

438
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,990
Never come back again.

439
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,470
Even if I die, don't come back.

440
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,030
Go.

441
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,860
Go.

442
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,820
Go.

443
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,580
Let's go.

444
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,510
Time is running out.

445
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,950
Go.

446
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,580
Let's go.

447
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,910
Chuanjia,

448
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,620
when I came back this time,

449
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,910
I noticed that dad had a lot more gray hair.

450
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Is it because I haven't seen him for a long time?

451
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,670
Why do I feel

452
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,910
that he has suddenly grown old?

453
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,380
I didn't sleep last night.

454
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,670
I tossed and turned

455
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,670
and kept thinking about our childhood.

456
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,380
Once,

457
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,380
when you

458
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,710
were in sixth grade or just starting junior high,

459
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,140
you wanted a school bag.

460
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,860
I didn't have the money to buy it.

461
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,670
When the boss wasn't paying attention,

462
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,950
I took the school bag back for you.

463
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,860
Dad found out about it

464
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,540
and beat me so hard.

465
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,030
Then, he hauled me

466
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,230
to the boss and made me apologize.

467
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,270
He also paid for it.

468
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,340
That was not all.

469
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,710
He took me to the quarry

470
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,540
to work for three days.

471
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,910
He told me

472
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,100
that whatever I wanted,

473
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,580
I must earn it with my own hands.

474
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,060
However,

475
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,860
I didn't learn my lesson.

476
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,910
From my childhood

477
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,510
until now,

478
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,670
you and Dad have always taken care of me.

479
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,300
You two let me have my way.

480
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,540
When I was leaving today,

481
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,470
dad told me

482
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,990
to never come back.

483
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,300
I never thought

484
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,470
that dad would say that to me.

485
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,860
What he said

486
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,910
made me feel very bad.

487
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,300
Chuanjia,

488
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,750
in the future,

489
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,990
take good care of our dad.

490
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,470
Don't worry.

491
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,540
He is healthy.

492
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,820
Just take care of yourself

493
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,510
when you

494
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,430
are out there alone.

495
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:19,990
Where's Xiuyu?

496
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,270
She looked depressed lately.

497
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,140
Why?

498
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,060
Well,

499
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,340
because our mom

500
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,990
kept trying to marry her off.

501
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,100
Why is she so annoyed with Gang's mother?

502
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,580
Gang's mother

503
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,780
wants Xiuyu to be her daughter-in-law.

504
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,470
What is she thinking about?

505
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,540
Xiuyu doesn't like Gang.

506
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,060
Not just Xiuyu.

507
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,190
I don't like him either.

508
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,540
Our guests

509
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,140
praised the freshness of the vegetables.

510
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,820
I think

511
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,540
we should organize a vegetable harvest.

512
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,910
Harvest?

513
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,430
The guests can pick what they want to eat.

514
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,470
It is fresh and fun.

515
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,750
You grow organic vegetables anyway.

516
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,620
Right?

517
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,910
That's a great idea.

518
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,990
Not bad. How did you come up with this?

519
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,860
Then,

520
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,580
I have to do some preparation.

521
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,620
You really can do everything.

522
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,670
What else do you need?

523
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,030
I need a plate.

524
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,710
It's in the cupboard.

525
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,990
Here. Sign here.

526
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,990

00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,030
I...

703
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,270
Was I sneaky?

704
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,140
Did you hear some rumors?

705
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,860
I asked you here.

706
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,070
Just tell me.

707
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,380
Mr. Wan,

708
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,790
don't take me wrong.

709
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:17,990
I...

710
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,950
I kept it from you

711
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,100
to protect you.

712
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,470
So there really was something.

713
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,700
Tell me quickly.

714
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,390
It's not a big deal.

715
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,100
The profit

716
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,390
of the health products factory

717
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,180
has not grown for a few years.

718
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,660
I was anxious.

719
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,740
I thought

720
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,870
about how to lower the cost.

721
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,870
I...

722
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,220
told Mr. Wu and the others

723
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,580
to turn off the equipment every now and then.

724
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,300
What...

725
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,220
What?

726
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,140
Did you ask them to turn off

727
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,070
the sewage treatment plant equipment?

728
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,910
Not all the time.

729
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,660
Just for a while before we turn it on again.

730
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,620
Are you crazy, Mo?

731
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,030
If the Ministry of Ecology and Environment
finds out,

732
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,300
do you know what problem we'll have?

733
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,510
I already thought about that.

734
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,660
Listen.

735
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,470
I sent people to monitor the village entrance.

736
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,550
If anyone suspicious come,

737
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,870
I will be the first to know.

738
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,070
Why didn't you tell me first?

739
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,550
Do you still take me seriously?

740
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,950
Mo, let me tell you.

741
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,620
I'm officially warning you.

742
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,260
Don't do this anymore.

743
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,910
If this gets exposed,

744
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,510
you, the general manager,

745
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,220
and I, the chairman, will be implicated.

746
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,470
Mr. Wan,

747
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,390
don't worry.

748
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,430
In the last two years,

749
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,910
many companies have done this.

750
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,740
Not many were caught.

751
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,700
Even when they were exposed,

752
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,350
if they didn't overdo it

753
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,350
and apologized sincerely,

754
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,260
they'd only get a fine at most.

755
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,550
Mo, let me tell you again.

756
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,030
Even if you are daring,

757
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,140
you should bear clearly in mind

758
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,990
what you can't do.

759
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,550
Others eat shit.

760
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,430
Should we?

761
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,300
I'm furious.

762
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:03,780
Now,

763
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,350
is the equipment on or off?

764
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,430
On.

765
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,100
They turned the equipment on earlier.

766
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,430
It's on and we'll be fine.

767
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,140
Don't worry.

768
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,140
Nobody knows about this.

769
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,140
Come in.

770
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,660
Mr. Wan,

771
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,180
your father asks for you.

772
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,660
Okay, you go out first.

773
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,390
I'll be there soon.

774
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,260
Okay.

775
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,180
Why would he ask for me now?

776
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,140
Did he hear about anything?

777
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,430
No way.

778
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,350
Xingfu, that's a good idea.

779
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,780
We'll discuss it

780
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,740
and get back to you.

781
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,390
Okay.

782
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,300
The cooperative
is developing relatively smoothly.

783
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,070
So, you could charge us

784
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,830
according to the law firm's previous standard.

785
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,870
Our practice

786
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,260
is to keep the initiative

787
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,660
of serving farmers and promoting laws.

788
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,350
We'll give you guys a 10% service fee discount.

789
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,470
Xingfu Inn!

790
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,620
Xingfu, you are doing quite well, huh?

791
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,700
You've upgraded your vehicle to a new car.

792
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,510
[Xingfu Inn]

793
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,550
I must reconsider the service fee.

794
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,100
About the discount,

795
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,620
I think...

796
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,220
How do I open it?

797
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,260
Correct.

798
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,620
I need to reconsider the discount.

799
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,700
Don't do that.

800
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,700
We're not that rich.

801
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,070
How about

802
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,990
on top of the original price,

803
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,430
I give you 10 cuts of cured meat?

804
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,470
Fifty cuts

805
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,430
plus fruits and vegetables
for the lunar new year.

806
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,220
Oops,

807
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,580
I feel dizzy.

808
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,030
Xingfu.

809
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,510
You've done well.

810
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,260
Take care.

811
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,910
You too, Guan.

812
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,180
See you.

813
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,140
See you.

814
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,510
Here.

815
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,830
Come in.

816
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,260
Chuanjia.

817
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,740
Did you read the report
from the health product factory?

818
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,580
What's wrong?

819
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,740
What do you mean?

820
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,620
I am asking you.

821
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,180
As a leader in charge,

822
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,140
don't you know about its situation?

823
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,070
Did

824
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,580
something happen?

825
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,910
Why are you so negative?

826
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,870
I read it.

827
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,390
The performance has improved.

828
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,780
Looks like Xingfu's idea

829
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,910
works.

830
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,140
Yes.

831
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,870
The plan

832
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,350
for a new round of promotion

833
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,220
includes a promotion slogan and other things.

834
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,780
It has helped boost sales a lot.

835
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,870
Work harder.

836
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,700
Strive to do better.

837
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:35,700
Okay.

838
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,030
I will work even harder

839
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,180
to improve sales performance.

840
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:38,950
Okay.

841
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,830
That's all.

842
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,350
Don't you have a report there?

843
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,220
Yes, I do.

844
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,180
I read it.

845
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,030
I thought...

846
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:46,870
You read it.

847
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,700
You asked for me.

848
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,950
Why didn't you tell me?

849
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,260
Seriously.

850
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,510
Do you want some more water?

851
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,220
No.

852
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,260
Don't worry about me.

853
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,180
I'll get back to work then.

854
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:56,870
Go.

855
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:03,740
Xingfu.

856
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:04,780
Yani.

857
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,030
What brings you here?

858
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,620
I came to the city to run errands and see you.

859
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,260
I brought you
some homegrown vegetables and fruits.

860
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,740
Let your parents have a taste.

861
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,100
Thank you, Xingfu.

862
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,140
That's pretty heavy.

863
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,870
Put them on the floor.

864
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,390
I just called Qingzhi.

865
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,350
He's in a meeting. So, I came to see you.

866
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,470
You two are both quite busy.

867
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,430
We are making advances in our careers.

868
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,780
So we are busy with our own stuff.

869
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,620
Isn't it nice?

870
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,030
When will you ever be free then?

871
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,220
Have you thought about marriage?

872
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,780
These years, either I was
on business trips or he was.

873
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,470
I never thought about it.

874
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,740
I really don't care about this actually.

875
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,070
I'll have fun for another few years.

876
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Stop having fun.

877
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,300
I came here to tell you this.

878
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,100
You've been together for so long.

879
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,780
Settle down quickly.

880
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,580
That way, you will feel more assured.

881
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,950
So will your parents.

882
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,550
I want to discuss this with you.

883
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,620
Shall we make an appointment

884
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,180
to invite your parents to our inn for a few days?

885
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,910
The parents of both parties
should talk face to face.

886
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,780
Qingzhi did tell me about this.

887
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,070
How about this, Xingfu,

888
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,660
I'll discuss this with my parents

889
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,550
and get back to you.

890
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,300
Okay.

891
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,870
Go back and discuss with them.

892
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,430
Meet face to face?

893
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,510
Are you sure about this?

894
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,030
This meeting will lead straight to marriage.

895
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,390
Yes. That's the plan anyway.

896
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,620
We've bought the house and the car.

897
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,100
Why?

898
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,740
You have ulterior motives?

899
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,580
You hope I'll regret this in a few years?

900
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,740
Let me tell you.

901
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,740
I'll only marry Qingzhi and no one else.

902
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,620
-Look at her.
-Not getting married?

903
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,030
No, you must get married.

904
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,660
How old are you?

905
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,700
If you don't get married,

906
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,740
you will have to stay with us forever.

907
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,580
It's as if no one wants to marry my daughter.

908
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,140
Okay.

909
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,350
My daughter has grown up.

910
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,030
Listen.

911
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,430
Since you're getting married,

912
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,990
let's do it properly

913
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,220
and hold a grand banquet.

914
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,830
I have only one daughter.

915
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,660
We must be serious

916
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,430
about the wedding.

917
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,430
These years,

918
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,390
we only attended others' weddings.

919
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,510
I don't know how many red packets I've given out.

920
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,300
I have to rely on Yani's wedding

921
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,140
to get my money back.

922
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,390
Dad, listen to Mom. What is she talking about?

923
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,430
I didn't hear it.

924
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,580
I was watching TV.

925
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,950
Listen.

926
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,740
I don't want a wedding.

927
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,580
I've discussed it with Qingzhi.

928
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,660
We

929
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,390
will find a getaway place and get married.

930
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,260
A honeymoon

931
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,030
without a wedding.

932
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,030
No way.

933
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,390
My daughter is dating a villager.

934
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,390
My friends look down on me.

935
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,990
If you don't have a wedding,

936
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,350
what will that be?

937
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,070
Is that getting married or eloping?

938
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,260
That sounds nasty.

939
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,740
Didn't you say you didn't hear her?

940
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,350
I heard this sentence though.

941
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,070
I don't care.

942
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,620
I don't want a wedding.

943
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,620
Why should I spend so much money
just to torture myself?

944
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,580
I think

945
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,300
it's weird to see both parties' parents.

946
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,700
I like my sister-in-law's idea.

947
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,550
It's more natural.

948
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,430
Aren't you shameless?

949
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,430
You called her sister-in-law.

950
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,100
What should I call her instead?

951
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,580
Yes. What should you call her instead?

952
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,830
You are not married yet.

953
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,700
She runs an inn on the mountain

954
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,950
with nice scenery.

955
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,260
She invited us there

956
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,510
to meet Qingzhi's parents.

957
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,870
Isn't that nice?

958
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:21,950
Take it as a trip.

959
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,430
Am I right, Dad?

960
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,990
How can the woman's side initiate the visit?

961
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,990
Doesn't that make us look too desperate?

962
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,580
I can get his family to come to our place then.

963
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:32,470
No. No.

964
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,180
Never.

965
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,070
If they know how to come to our place,

966
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,510
they'll come whenever something happens.

967
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,180
I can't take it.

968
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,220
Moreover,

969
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,780
your father has a big family.

970
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,550
Look at this.

971
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,030
The scenery in the countryside these days

972
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,300
is great indeed.

973
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,950
We can take this opportunity

974
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,180
to go on a trip

975
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:55,830
and go hiking.

976
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,620
It's quite nice.

977
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,830
It's settled then.

978
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,430
Hey.

979
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,100
Seriously.

980
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:02,990
Let's not argue.

981
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,100
Look at the scenery.

982
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,740
You!

983
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:07,620
I'm so mad.
