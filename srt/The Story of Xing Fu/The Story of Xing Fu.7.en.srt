[The Story of Xing Fu]

2
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,850
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,439
Here you go,

4
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:49,920
Senior.

5
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,000
The documents have been stamped.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,519
That was fast.

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,159
I told him it was a new case he had signed,

8
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,159
and he stamped it.

9
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,040
He already issued a letter yesterday
for that case,

10
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:57,959
but he forgot about it.

11
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,560
Did something good happen to you?

12
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,319
You look rather happy.

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,000
Mr. Han said he would take me
on a business trip to meet a client.

14
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,840
I can finally work on cases now.

15
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,959
Congratulations.

16
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,239
But a piece of advice.

17
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,080
Be careful.

18
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,960
What do you mean?

19
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,879
He often brings

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,680
female employees with him

21
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,719
on business trips.

22
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,719
So look after yourself,

23
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,759
all right?

24
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,520
Got it.

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,759
All right.

26
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,240
Thank you, Senior.

27
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,800
Don't mention it. Go on.

28
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,680
So sorry, Mr. Han.

29
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,960
I have gifts for Mr. Ma in those suitcases.

30
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,960
Be careful.

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,039
Yes, sir.

32
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,120
Mr. Han,

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,639
is there anything else?

34
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,439
If not,

35
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,120
I'll head over to the second-class seating area.

36
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,520
What's the hurry?

37
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,879
Have a seat here first.

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,680
I...

39
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,960
Someone will be sitting here later,

40
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,680
sir.

41
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,719
The business class carriage is rarely full.

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,159
Just take a seat. Don't worry about them.

43
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,879
Even so, it's not proper, Mr. Han.

44
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,599
Sit down.

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,919
Let's have a chat.

46
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,560
Oh, right.

47
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,520
Did you bring clothes?

48
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,599
Yes.

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
I brought a few changes of clothes.

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,719
Change?

51
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,319
Didn't I tell you

52
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,960
to bring some nice clothes?

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
You're supposed to represent our law firm.

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,199
Mr. Han,

55
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,520
I would like to buy nice clothes,

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,240
but I would need to have the money for them.

57
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,120
You only give me so much every month.

58
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
I simply can't afford nice clothes.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,879
Is that a complaint I hear?

60
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,400
Of course not.

61
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm only stating the facts, sir.

62
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,879
He,

63
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,000
so many at our law firm

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,879
would love to get a chance
to go on a business trip with me.

65
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,720
Why do you think I picked you?

66
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,480
Because I'm your assistant

67
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,240
and you want to train me.

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,240
If you want to be a lawyer,

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,600
you need to get to know all sorts of people

70
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,720
from all walks of life.

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,560
We're meeting a big client this time.

72
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,800
If things go well,

73
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,839
that'll give us two to three million yuan a year.

74
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,519
Mr. Ma

75
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,800
doesn't have many interests,

76
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,879
but he is very fond of drinking.

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,279
You get it, don't you?

78
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,759
I... I don't quite understand.

79
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,720
What do you mean, sir?

80
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,120
Nothing.

81
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,079
Just make sure

82
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,000
you drink more with him

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,920
and make sure he is satisfied.

84
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,480
Mr. Han,

85
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
I will do my best at work,

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,639
but...

87
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,000
Drinking...

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,040
I can't hold liquor well, sir.

89
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,560
Well,

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,439
it doesn't matter
if you can hold your liquor or not.

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,759
What matters is that you satisfy the client,

92
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,000
understand?

93
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,240
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,360
Is this your seat?

95
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,439
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,240
Um...

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,560
Here's your seat.

98
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll be going now,

99
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,920
Mr. Han.

100
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,839
Mr. Wan. Mr. Zhang.

101
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,000
You suggested we build
the wastewater treatment plant

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,319
over here.

103
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,519
I thought it was a good idea as well.

104
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,319
But there seems to be a problem.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,519
The area isn't big enough.

106
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,759
After building the health products factory,

107
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,439
there won't be enough space
for the wastewater treatment plant.

108
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,079
Can't we build a smaller plant?

109
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:06,720
No.

110
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,480
Mr. Wan,

111
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
that would be

112
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,360
as if you installed a large faucet

113
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,519
but a very narrow sewer.

114
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,240
You can imagine what will happen if the sewage

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,399
is not discharged in time.

116
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,000
In the past, farmers were poor,

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,639
and we weren't particular about this.

118
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,439
We would just let the sewage water

119
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,839
flow out.

120
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,279
But we can't do that now.

121
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,519
Our country is paying more attention
to environmental protection now.

122
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,040
Our superior said it, didn't he?

123
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,279
Lucid waters and lush mountains
are invaluable assets.

124
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,639
So

125
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,279
if we can't build a wastewater treatment plant

126
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,879
that is up to standard,

127
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,319
the health products factory
won't pass the acceptance testing.

128
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,600
I wonder if we can sort that out with some money.

129
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,959
Well,

130
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,399
that probably won't be so easy either.

131
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,439
Do you guys have any other ideas? Do tell.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,439
There is another way.

133
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,439
But it'll cost money.

134
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,160
Mr. Liu,

135
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
go on.

136
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,879
I studied this area carefully.

137
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,040
I think we can build the plant here.

138
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,639
The area is big enough.

139
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,160
There's a good distance
between the factory and the residential area,

140
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,199
and the terrain is flat and relatively low.

141
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,199
It'll be easier to discharge the treated water

142
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,759
into the river.

143
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,720
I did some research.

144
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,439
This piece of land is a riverbank wasteland.

145
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,399
It's not typical land for farming.

146
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
There should be no problems
in getting the approval.

147
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,800
If we build the plant here,

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,959
not only will it solve
the factory's sewage treatment,

149
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,519
but the villagers' domestic sewage treatment
will also be taken into account.

150
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,839
In the long term,

151
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,879
this is a great thing

152
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,480
that will benefit future generations to come.

153
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,319
You mentioned it would cost more money.

154
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
How much would it cost?

155
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,519
Including domestic sewage treatment,

156
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,199
it'll probably cost more than 100 million.

157
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,040
Mainly because of the additional cost
of land acquisition

158
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,160
for the wastewater treatment plant.

159
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,839
Also,

160
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,839
we'll need money to lay out the pipe network

161
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,120
between the factory

162
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,319
and the residential area.

163
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,759
I understand what you mean.

164
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,600
That'll require

165
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,480
much more money
than we initially planned to invest.

166
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,720
That won't do.

167
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,800
Mr. Wan,

168
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,120
we won't be able to carry out this project then.

169
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,360
It's not that I don't want to cooperate with you,

170
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,800
but I can't afford the liabilities.

171
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,360
Environmental pollution

172
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,199
is subject to criminal liability now.

173
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,920
We can afford not to make money,

174
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,839
but

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,120
we can't sacrifice lives.

176
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,360
Don't you agree, Mr. Wan?

177
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,600
This is our village's land.

178
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,680
We can sort things out.

179
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,639
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Mo, and Mr. Liu,

180
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,879
we'll go back,

181
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,360
discuss the matter again,

182
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,639
and give you an answer as soon as possible.

183
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,519
Is that all right?

184
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,920
All right.

185
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,000
So

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
that is the situation.

187
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,039
Now, we have to decide if we're going

188
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,399
[Wanjia Group]
to go on with this project.

189
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,120
If we don't,

190
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,559
we'll have to re-green

191
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,559
the quarry.

192
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,679
That'll cost us quite a sum.

193
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,120
It won't be easy to get done either.

194
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,799
If we carry on with this project,

195
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,480
then we'll need to solve the problem
with the wastewater treatment plant.

196
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
There isn't enough space

197
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,559
if we build it on the mountain.

198
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,519
But it'll cost too much to build it

199
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,360
at the bottom of the mountain.

200
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:03,960
How about this?

201
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,879
Discuss this

202
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,200
with Mr. Liu again

203
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,960
and figure out

204
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,799
the exact amount we need.

205
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,799
Try to save as much as you can.

206
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,519
If we still can't manage,

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,159
I'll talk to Mr. Chu, the branch manager of the bank,

208
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,240
to get a loan.

209
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,759
Chairman Wan, I...

210
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,360
Enough.

211
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,240
This matter is settled.

212
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,639
We need to develop the village's economy.

213
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,840
This concerns the selection

214
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,320
of the most beautiful village

215
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,320
as well as

216
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,639
Wan Village's reputation and future.

217
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,960
We can't let this matter mess everything up.

218
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,039
(The materials cost over 580,000 yuan.)

219
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,360
(The machines cost over 130,000 yuan.)

220
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
(Maybe)

221
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,440
(even more.)

222
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,840
The cost of management
is a little over 120,000 yuan.

223
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,840
Where's Mr. Wan?

224
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:48,960
Mr. Cailiang.

225
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,759
My father said he wasn't feeling well.

226
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,639
He went back after lunch.

227
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,360
What's the matter?

228
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,000
It's about

229
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,639
the location for the construction
of the wastewater treatment plant.

230
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,840
I checked.

231
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,399
The location and area

232
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,440
are good.

233
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,759
It's about 20 mu of land.

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,320
But there's a problem.

235
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,399
There are four families

236
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,440
using the land for cultivation right now.

237
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,840
Youde's family,

238
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,200
Chunxian's family, Guancai's family,

239
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,000
and Fusheng's family.

240
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,879
I don't understand.

241
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,639
What's the problem?

242
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,559
Well,

243
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,559
some time ago,

244
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,840
Qinglai took over the other three families' land

245
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,399
and built a big greenhouse.

246
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,279
He said something about growing vegetables.

247
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,559
And it sounds like
he has already signed a contract

248
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,480
with a supermarket in the city.

249
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,279
The biggest problem now

250
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,120
is that it might be hard to expropriate

251
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:39,679
that land.

252
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
So I thought

253
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,000
maybe we should discuss this with Mr. Wan

254
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,120
and have Mr. Liu select another piece of land

255
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,679
around that area.

256
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,840
What's the big deal?

257
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,879
We're building the factory for the village,

258
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:52,440
right?

259
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,600
A wastewater treatment plant
is necessary for the factory.

260
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,279
The land belongs to the country.

261
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,799
It's not private property.

262
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,360
You know how long we've been delayed

263
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,840
by the matter

264
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,879
of the wastewater treatment plant.

265
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
Mr. Liu went through the area

266
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,600
over and over

267
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,720
before finally settling on that area.

268
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,600
And now, you want him to choose another area?

269
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,039
Maybe you should discuss this with your father.

270
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,879
Discuss what?

271
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,080
It's not a big deal.

272
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,559
He isn't feeling well.

273
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,159
He might ask why we bothered him
with such a trivial matter later.

274
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,200
Just do what we discussed.

275
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,039
All right.

276
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,679
Mr. Ma.

277
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,679
All right. Here.

278
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,600
Thank you.

279
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,279
You're most welcome.

280
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,919
Good wine.

281
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,279
Here.

282
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,279
He, don't just keep eating.

283
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,240
Give Mr. Ma a toast.

284
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,879
Mr. Han, I...

285
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,159
Mr. Ma,

286
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,080
let me give you a toast.

287
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,879
I'm new.

288
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,200
I'm sure I'm still inexperienced
and have lots to learn.

289
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,440
Please excuse me

290
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,600
if I make any mistakes,

291
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,279
and do give me your guidance.

292
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,600
A toast to you.

293
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,120
All right.

294
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,480
I'll finish this glass. You do as you please.

295
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,039
All right.

296
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,360
Mr. Han,

297
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,799
are all your female lawyers so beautiful?

298
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Well,

299
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,320
I have lots of female lawyers working for me,

300
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,559
but I brought you the prettiest one.

301
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,600
Oh, you.

302
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,519
Come.

303
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:39,960
Here.

304
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,080
Have a good drink with Mr. Han.

305
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,200
Youde.

306
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,240
You're here, Mr. Cailiang.

307
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,200
Oh, you're eating.

308
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:48,360
Have you eaten?

309
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,519
If you haven't, join us.

310
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,000
No, that's all right. You guys enjoy your meal.

311
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,080
I just came to let you guys know

312
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,519
that we'll be having

313
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,039
a villagers' representative conference
tomorrow morning.

314
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,360
They informed us over the loudspeaker.

315
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,399
My dad will be going.

316
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:00,799
Yes.

317
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,240
I'll be going.

318
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,360
I think you should come as well.

319
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,480
Um,

320
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,879
isn't one family
supposed to send one representative?

321
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,559
Yes.

322
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,600
But I think both of you should come.

323
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,759
It can't hurt to have another pair of ears.

324
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,559
We'll do as you say then.

325
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,440
Don't worry.

326
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,720
-You guys enjoy your meal. I'll take my leave now.
-We'll both be there.

327
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,600
You're not staying?

328
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,480
Take care.

329
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,159
You should both come.

330
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:21,840
-Take care.
-All right.

331
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,080
We'll both go.

332
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,600
Take care!

333
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,799
He could have just called us.

334
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,759
But he came all the way here instead.

335
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
Mr. Han, have some fruits.

336
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,000
Both of you, get the liquor

337
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,360
and have a drink with Mr. Han!

338
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,080
Go on!

339
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,679
Thank you.

340
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Here. Have some fruits.

341
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,559
Okay.

342
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,080
-Bottoms up!
-Here's a toast to you.

343
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,279
Drink!

344
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,440
Good!

345
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,600
Bottoms up!

346
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,879
Come on!

347
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,440
You're up!

348
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,120
Young people must live a little.

349
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,759
A toast to you, Mr. Ma.

350
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,720
-Cheers.
-Drink with him.

351
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,159
All right.

352
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,039
I have some here.

353
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,240
He,

354
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,519
have more spirit.

355
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,320
You can hold your liquor!

356
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,039
Drink! Good!

357
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,360
Come on.

358
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,159
I think

359
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,480
I drank a little too fast.

360
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,879
Careful.

361
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,000
We're here.

362
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,080
Your bag, sir.

363
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,840
Come in.

364
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,440
I...

365
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,480
Get some rest, sir.

366
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,679
I'll go back to my room now.

367
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,200
It's still early.

368
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,639
Come inside for a chat.

369
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,200
I'm not going to do anything to you.

370
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,879
Let's talk about work.

371
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,080
I'm going to get mad
if you stand there any longer.

372
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:18,960
Come in.

373
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,039
Sit anywhere you like.

374
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,879
Mr. Han,

375
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,759
you've certainly had quite a bit to drink tonight.

376
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,360
Let me tell you something.

377
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,960
Back when

378
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
I used to work as the secretary for the mayor,

379
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,320
I had to drink for him all the time.

380
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,039
With my alcohol tolerance...

381
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,519
I can handle

382
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,279
at least

383
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,120
500ml of baijiu.

384
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,440
You can hold your liquor well, sir.

385
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,559
Have some water to help with the hangover.

386
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,120
Have a seat.

387
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,879
No, that's all right, sir.

388
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,960
It's late.

389
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,000
You should get some rest.

390
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,600
I'll turn in early tonight after I get back too.

391
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
No, no. Don't leave.

392
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,240
Sit.

393
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,559
It's early.

394
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,600
Have a chat with me.

395
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,120
Sit down.

396
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,720
We can't talk if you're standing.

397
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,260
If you stay by my side,

398
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,410
you'll have to learn from me.

399
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,260
You need to learn by analogy.

400
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,220
You need to know

401
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,220
what I like.

402
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,860
I wouldn't know what you like, sir.

403
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,740
I'll tell you then.

404
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,140
I

405
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,650
like you.

406
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,290
Sir,

407
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,810
what... What are you doing?

408
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,570
I don't understand what you mean.

409
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,290
Xingyun,

410
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,380
I've fallen for you

411
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,850
from the first moment I saw you.

412
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,660
Don't jest, Mr. Han.

413
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,260
Aren't you usually so strict with me?

414
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,740
That's because I like you.

415
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,700
That's why I'm so strict with you.

416
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,020
It's true.

417
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,530
I've liked you since the first moment I saw you.

418
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:33,980
If not,

419
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,850
your bachelor's degree
couldn't have possibly gotten you

420
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,220
into Yidao Law Firm.

421
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,660
Right?

422
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,770
Do you know why I like you?

423
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,570
Because

424
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,050
I think

425
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,740
the two of us

426
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,050
are of the same kind.

427
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,500
You and I are both people

428
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,090
who will do anything it takes to get what we want.

429
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,570
Not at all, sir.

430
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,940
You are far better than me.

431
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,770
No.

432
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,180
I'm being honest with you.

433
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,220
From the first moment I saw you,

434
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,290
I saw them within your eyes.

435
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,740
Your

436
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,260
determination.

437
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,290
Your passion.

438
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,220
It instantly reminded me of my younger self.

439
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:25,570
I meant it.

440
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:26,740
Xingyun,

441
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,500
I would like you

442
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,700
to be my girlfriend.

443
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,660
Please

444
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,980
allow me

445
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,460
to help you

446
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,940
in your life.

447
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,530
Trust me.

448
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,500
You will surely stand out
from the rest in no time.

449
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,260
(Let go of me!)

450
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:46,740
Sir!

451
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,090
What... What are you doing?

452
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,370
I don't understand.

453
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,940
What do you mean by "girlfriend"?

454
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,260
You're married, aren't you?

455
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,330
That old hag?

456
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,660
Well,

457
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,740
my family decided that for me
when I was in the army.

458
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,610
I'll be frank with you.

459
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,980
Everyone has their woes in life.

460
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,810
We just have to live with them.

461
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,810
And we had two kids.

462
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,700
Two sons even.

463
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,980
That makes it even more impossible
for my parents to let me leave her.

464
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,460
They love them to bits.

465
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,770
Well, they're happy.

466
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,370
But who understands my pain?

467
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,660
Right?

468
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,770
Of course.

469
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,500
Um...

470
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,420
As the old saying goes,

471
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,740
a wife who shares her husband's hardship
must never be cast aside.

472
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,740
I can't abandon her

473
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,900
just because I'm well-off now.

474
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,660
I abide by that moral principle, at least.

475
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,330
That's why

476
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,220
I'm only looking for girlfriends.

477
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,460
Can you understand what I mean?

478
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,180
What do you mean?

479
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,370
So you're saying

480
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,050
that you want me to be your girlfriend

481
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,850
and you won't even give me any promises
or take any responsibility?

482
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,180
No. Of course, I would.

483
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,530
I will give you my promise.

484
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,660
There's no way I wouldn't take responsibility

485
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,610
for you

486
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,770
if you became my girlfriend.

487
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,420
Right?

488
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,660
You wanted to be a lawyer, right?

489
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,810
All right. You'll become an intern lawyer
at our firm right after we get back.

490
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,130
One year later,

491
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,220
you'll officially become

492
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,130
a full-time lawyer.

493
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,810
What are lawyers most worried about?

494
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,610
Having no cases.

495
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,660
But if you accept my offer

496
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
and become my girlfriend,

497
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,220
you won't have to worry about that.

498
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,260
So long as I have a case,

499
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,330
you'll have a case.

500
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,570
We'll work together in harmony

501
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,500
and be a wonderful couple.

502
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,610
I mean,

503
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,980
with your wits

504
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,130
and your beauty,

505
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,290
in less than two years,

506
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,130
you'll be a famous lawyer.

507
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,290
This is inappropriate, sir.

508
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,700
You're my boss. You can't do this.

509
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,980
What's inappropriate about this?

510
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,370
This is one of the perks

511
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,290
that a boss can get.

512
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:54,660
What are you doing?

513
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,500
I don't like the smell of alcohol on you!

514
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,740
Help!

515
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,660
What are you doing? Let go of me!

516
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,900
Stop right there.

517
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,220
Let me tell you something.

518
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,220
If you walk out that door,

519
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,810
you won't be able to stay in Yidao.

520
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,570
You can forget about
making it in Yuzhong City as well.

521
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,180
Let's just talk about this...

522
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,940
Don't come any closer!

523
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
If you do, I'll yell!

524
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,260
I'll sue you for sexual harassment.

525
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:25,900
No, I...

526
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,330
We're the only ones in this room.

527
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,330
You accuse me of sexual harassment.

528
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,610
I say it was consensual.

529
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,980
Who do you think the judge will believe?

530
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,770
I have proof.

531
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,610
(Xingyun.)

532
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,180
(I've fallen for you
from the first moment I saw you.)

533
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,770
(Please be my girlfriend.)

534
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,290
(Please allow me...)

535
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,130
Now, now... We must be sincere and honest.

536
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,980
Why did you record our conversation?

537
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,460
Hurry up and delete that.

538
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,130
I won't.

539
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,370
You...

540
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,290
Don't come any nearer!

541
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,220
(No. Believe me.)

542
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,610
(Believe me...)

543
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,900
(You are sure to stand out
from the rest in no time...)

544
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,770
Come on.

545
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,370
Tell me what you want.

546
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,660
I don't want anything.

547
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,570
As for a girlfriend,

548
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,980
you already have Ms. Yu, don't you?

549
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,770
Aren't you afraid she'll get mad at you?

550
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,900
You're trying to blackmail me, aren't you?

551
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,130
I'm not.

552
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,290
This is just a form of protection

553
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,260
for me.

554
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,260
It's late.

555
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,220
Get some rest. I'm leaving.

556
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,460
Attention, everyone.

557
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,660
Quiet, please.

558
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,850
Take your seats.

559
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,900
Those who aren't here yet, please hurry up.

560
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,050
Hurry.

561
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,220
This meeting is about to begin.

562
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,420
The villagers' representative conference...

563
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,570
Do you know what this meeting

564
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:13,980
is about?

565
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,290
-will officially begin now.
-No.

566
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,330
We have only one topic

567
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,900
for today's meeting.

568
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,090
We will be conducting a vote

569
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,530
on a matter

570
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,330
related to the health products factory.

571
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,460
I hope all of you will actively participate

572
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,180
and speak up.

573
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,500
Next, we will have
the secretary of our village party branch,

574
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,090
Comrade Wan Shantang, give us a few words.

575
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,090
-Great!
-Great!

576
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,900
Earlier,

577
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,420
I mentioned this to Chuanjia.

578
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,050
Look.

579
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,740
When other villages hold meetings now,

580
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,050
the attendees are mostly

581
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,770
women, children,

582
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,050
and the elderly.

583
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,850
Only Wan Village is different.

584
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:00,660
Look.

585
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,530
At a glance,

586
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,850
most of our attendees are strong young men.

587
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,050
Of course.

588
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,130
What a pleasing sight.

589
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,610
What does that say about us?

590
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,020
It shows that our villagers
has good foresight and awareness.

591
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,370
They support the village party branch

592
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,130
and the work of the Wanjia Group.

593
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,500
It also shows

594
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,460
that Wanjia Group

595
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,370
has provided employment opportunities
for the people.

596
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,090
The people don't need
to leave their homes to find a job.

597
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,020
You can start a business
and make a fortune at home.

598
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,220
I'll say it again.

599
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,700
All for Wan,

600
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,370
Wan for all.

601
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,980
And on behalf of the village party branch

602
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,330
and Wanjia Group,

603
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,220
I thank all of you.

604
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,260
-Great!
-Great!

605
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,770
As I've said in our last meeting,

606
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,900
the Wanjia Group

607
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,500
is not content with our current status.

608
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,980
We must develop further

609
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,260
and engage in a variety of businesses.

610
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,370
Mr. Cailiang mentioned

611
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,020
the health products factory.

612
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,460
That is one of our key projects.

613
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,900
It will be

614
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,500
our village's

615
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,660
new Guanyin!
[* It means lifesaver]

616
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,460
A few days ago, after a hard negotiation,

617
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,940
the agreement was finally signed.

618
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,500
Once the factory is built,

619
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,220
it will become another project

620
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,700
that will generate money for us.

621
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,940
-Great!
-Great!

622
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,900
Now,

623
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,900
I have brought Guanyin to us.

624
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,260
But we must make proper preparations

625
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,330
to welcome a deity.

626
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,370
What does that mean?

627
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,660
It means we need land to build the factory.

628
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,130
After getting the approval from the experts

629
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,740
and our team of leaders' discussion,

630
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,570
we have decided on the location.

631
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,900
It will be built on the now ruined land

632
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,810
where we used to quarry.

633
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,180
But we have another problem to solve

634
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,850
before

635
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,260
we can build the factory.

636
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,980
To build the health products factory,

637
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,020
we need to build

638
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,610
a wastewater treatment plant.

639
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,370
Why?

640
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,050
To protect our environment.

641
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,500
Environment protection

642
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,260
is our priority.

643
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,530
It concerns the health of our villagers.

644
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,130
The health of our children.

645
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,220
We must have lucid waters and lush mountains

646
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,420
before we can have gold and silver.

647
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,050
So we must find

648
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,290
another piece of land

649
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,500
to build the wastewater treatment plant.

650
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,220
Now, we invite the representative
of Wanjia Group,

651
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,090
the general manager, Wan Chuanjia,

652
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,700
to talk about the site selection
for the construction

653
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,570
of the wastewater treatment plant.

654
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,330
-Great!
-Great!

655
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:53,220
After repeated field surveys and consulting

656
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,330
with our partners, Mr. Zhang, Mr. Mo,

657
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,810
and Mr. Liu,

658
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,940
we have decided

659
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,220
to build the wastewater treatment plant

660
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,260
in this location.

661
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,090
This area is located right next to the river.

662
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,660
It's close to the health products factory...

663
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,940
-and not far from our village.
-Look.

664
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,090
From all the aspects,

665
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,020
it is the best location...

666
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,130
No wonder he wanted both of us to be here.

667
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:15,940
to build the plant.

668
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,290
-The cost of building the factory will be lower.
-Oh, dear.

669
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,130
Mr. Cailiang,

670
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,570
which families are using that land right now?

671
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,810
Fusheng's family,

672
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,700
Chunxian's family,

673
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,660
Guancai's family,

674
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,900
and Qinglai's family.

675
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,660
Are the representatives all here?

676
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,020
Please stand up.

677
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,900
Darn you!

678
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,980
How about you guys go ahead
and settle your fight first?

679
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,770
He made me fall.

680
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,700
Everyone is here, right?

681
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,090
Well, I have a few things to say then.

682
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,180
Mr. Wan made it very clear earlier.

683
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,050
The health products factory

684
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,260
and the wastewater treatment plant

685
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,330
concern the future development

686
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,850
of our village.

687
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,530
To put it in more serious terms,

688
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,610
whether the villagers will be able

689
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,420
to live a good life in the next few decades

690
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,900
depends entirely on this factory.

691
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,770
Since you guys are here,

692
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,610
please tell us where you stand

693
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,090
before everyone.

694
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,130
All right?

695
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:16,660
Who wants to go first?

696
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,700
Me. I'll go first.

697
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:19,850
Um...

698
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,570
As long as you give me enough compensation,

699
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,460
I'll do anything.

700
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,850
I strongly support this.

701
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,500
My... My piece of land isn't that big.

702
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,050
I've rented it to Qinglai.

703
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,940
I'm not using it anyway.

704
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,420
If Qinglai doesn't have a problem,

705
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,500
then I'm all for it.

706
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,850
I just want to ask this.

707
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:37,660
Um...

708
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,530
Will I still be compensated?

709
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,660
Of course.

710
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,220
What about you, Ms. Chunxian?

711
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,570
I rented my land to Qinglai as well.

712
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,290
I don't have anything against it.

713
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,530
It's up to Qinglai.

714
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,740
They all rented their land to Qinglai.

715
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,900
Wang Qinglai.

716
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,940
Speak up.

717
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,770
I...

718
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,900
I need to discuss it with my dad.

719
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,460
With your dad?

720
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:03,900
Wang Youde.

721
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,020
Is Wang Youde here?

722
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:09,740
Wang Youde,

723
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,940
stop trying to hide.

724
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,370
Come on.

725
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,610
You're a resident of our village too.

726
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,460
Stand up.

727
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,500
Get up and say a few things.

728
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,940
Go on.

729
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,180
If you ask me,

730
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,770
I think it's your blessing

731
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,420
that your land has been chosen

732
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,980
to build the factory.

733
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,370
It's like winning the lottery.

734
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,220
You guys have won the jackpot.

735
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,770
Not only will you be compensated,

736
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,980
but the young ones

737
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,420
will be able to work at the factory too.

738
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,900
Right? You guys can become workers.

739
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,420
Youde,

740
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,660
you're up in years.

741
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,700
In a few more years, you can retire.

742
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,420
Right?

743
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,420
You can stop working if you want

744
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,530
and receive a pension.

745
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,260
That's better than working in the fields, right?

746
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,740
Our piece of land

747
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,420
is different from the others.

748
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,700
It's just land.

749
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,130
It's all dirt and sand.

750
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,330
What's so special about it?

751
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,900
Youde says his family grows gold.

752
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,980
Say... Say something.

753
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,900
I... I was planning

754
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,420
to expand my farm and grow organic vegetables.

755
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,420
I already built the greenhouse.

756
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,020
Oh, you built the greenhouse.

757
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,460
That is a big deal.

758
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,090
It's actually more important

759
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,530
than the development of the village, huh?

760
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,770
Wang Qinglai,

761
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,770
I asked you to state your stance

762
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,530
to help you save face.

763
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:43,570
What?

764
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,940
Is the Wang family going to be

765
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,460
the reason Wan Village cannot develop?

766
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,850
-Don't be ungrateful!
-Chuanjia.

767
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,050
Watch your attitude.

768
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,090
Qinglai,

769
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,700
take a seat first.

770
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,810
I know you and your father love farming.

771
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,570
But Chuanjia made it clear, didn't he?

772
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,740
It's true

773
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,610
that this piece of land
is the most suitable at the moment.

774
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,180
The Wan Village

775
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,700
has made a great effort to secure

776
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,420
the title of the most beautiful village.

777
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,530
The construction
of the wastewater treatment plant

778
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,940
concerns

779
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,530
the well-being of the entire village as well.

780
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,370
As the old saying goes,

781
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,660
when big rivers have water,
the small ones are filled.

782
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,260
Sometimes,

783
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,530
the big river is filled.

784
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,530
To store more water in the big river,

785
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,980
we need to build a dam

786
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,180
or a canal.

787
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,940
We must consider the big picture.

788
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,810
Isn't that right, everyone?

789
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,090
-Yes.
-Yes.

790
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,810
Well,

791
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,610
if there are no other issues,

792
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,700
let's conduct

793
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,420
a vote.

794
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,500
All right?

795
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,290
-Those in favor...
-Yes.

796
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,340
of building the wastewater treatment plant
in this location,

797
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,820
please raise your hand!

798
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,710
-We agree!
-We agree!

799
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,660
Bear with me, everyone.

800
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,660
Don't be so quick to lower your hands.

801
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,470
Take a look

802
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,420
at the people around you

803
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,140
as well.

804
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,550
Is there anyone who's so stubborn

805
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,900
that they refuse to raise their hands?

806
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,580
There is!

807
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,620
Qinglai and his dad didn't raise their hands!

808
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,620
Put your hands up.

809
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,340
The development of the collective
is more important.

810
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,420
Put your hand up.

811
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,140
That's right.

812
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:19,860
Raise your hand.

813
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,620
He put his hand up!

814
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,340
They raised their hands!

815
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,310
All right.

816
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,030
That'll do.

817
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,180
Good.

818
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,420
It's unanimous!

819
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,790
-Great!
-Great!

820
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,380
Qinglai and his father
are aware of the importance of this matter.

821
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,660
We must remember

822
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,140
the Wang family's contribution to our village

823
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,510
as well.

824
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,900
On behalf of the village branch party
and Wanjia Group,

825
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,620
I thank these families
for sacrificing their personal interests

826
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,270
for the sake of the village.

827
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,550
Thank you.

828
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,230
-Well said.
-Well said.

829
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,580
All right.

830
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,270
That concludes this meeting.

831
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,230
-We must drink to this.
-We're going to be rich.

832
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,740
Leave it.

833
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,390
The water is cold.

834
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,220
I'll wash them.

835
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:22,990
It's okay, Mom.

836
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:23,620
I'll wash them.

837
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,350
Don't worry. It'll be done in no time.

838
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:28,830
You're back.

839
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,780
What did they talk about at the conference?

840
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,910
What's the matter?

841
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:48,870
What happened at the conference?

842
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:49,990
Why aren't you guys saying anything?

843
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,350
They're going to build a factory in our village.

844
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,830
They want to expropriate our land.

845
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,580
If our land

846
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,550
gets expropriated,

847
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,990
we won't be able to make a living anymore.

848
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,100
Did they take anyone else's land?

849
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,660
No.

850
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,830
There is a lot of land in the village
that isn't being used.

851
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,030
Why did they only take

852
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,950
ours?

853
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,830
They said ours was the most suitable.

854
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,740
Suitable? Who knows?

855
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,620
They're the ones who get

856
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,510
to decide which plot of land is "suitable".

857
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,660
I'll go and ask Mr. Wan then.

858
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:23,990
No need to hurry.

859
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,660
Let's find out what exactly happened first.

860
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,700
Qinglai.

861
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,950
Are they going

862
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,140
to expropriate our land just like that?

863
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,990
Without any compensation?

864
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,350
They made it sound nicer than it is.

865
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,470
They would compensate us for the land.

866
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,220
They want my dad to retire with a pension.

867
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,140
They want me to work
at the factory they're building

868
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,300
and get a worker's salary.

869
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,070
That's fine, isn't it?

870
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,430
I think we should let them take the land.

871
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,510
But is a farmer still a farmer

872
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,990
without land?

873
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,220
I don't want to work at the factory.

874
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,620
I want to grow vegetables.

875
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,620
You two are rare specimens.

876
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,140
Who else in the village wants
to keep growing vegetables?

877
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,030
Only you two would take the land so seriously.

878
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,350
As if it doesn't matter to you?

879
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,260
You are provided and fed by this land as well.

880
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,700
Aren't you ashamed to say such things?

881
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,350
Hear that?

882
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,950
You wouldn't dare to say a word out there.

883
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,660
But in the house, you act all high and mighty.

884
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,580
If you ask me,

885
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,140
you're getting up in years as well.

886
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,390
Farming isn't something
you can keep doing for your entire life.

887
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,910
Our kids are all grown up.

888
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,300
It's time you take a break.

889
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,430
So you're saying

890
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,550
I should do nothing

891
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,100
and wait to die?

892
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,910
You're so unreasonable!

893
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,510
You raised your voice at me.

894
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,100
But why won't you raise your voice at Mr. Wan?

895
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,260
Mom...

896
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,740
Listen to me, Xingfu.

897
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,700
Would you believe this?

898
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,950
He is loud now.

899
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,100
But if there had been a vote
at the meeting earlier,

900
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,510
he would've gone along with them for sure!

901
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,430
Mom. Dad. Don't worry.

902
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,470
I'll talk to Mr. Wan.

903
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,740
We have so much land in the village.

904
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,260
They can build the factory at any of those places.

905
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,510
Why must they use our land?

906
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,580
That's easy to figure out.

907
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,030
We're a small, no-name family.

908
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,180
And we got on bad terms with Chuanjia
because of the hazing incident.

909
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,910
We thought that matter was in the past.

910
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,950
But clearly, it's not over for him.

911
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,430
I heard Chuanjia was in charge of this project.

912
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,430
He is sure to milk us for all we're worth!

913
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,180
That's all the more reason
I have to talk to Mr. Wan then.

914
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:11,990
Xingfu. Xingfu!

915
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,990
Xingfu!

916
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:26,025
[Wanjia Group]

917
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,470
Excuse me. What business do you have here?

918
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,300
I'm looking for Mr. Wan.

919
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,740
Please wait here.

920
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,580
I'll notify them.

921
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,740
Mr. Zhang.

922
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,510
The matter of the land has been settled.

923
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,260
It's the piece of land

924
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,550
Mr. Liu chose, of course.

925
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,470
Don't worry about that.

926
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,870
But, um,

927
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,430
with all these changes,

928
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,390
our cost has increased significantly.

929
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,780
Can we split the costs

930
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,830
between us

931
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,580
accordingly?

932
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,990
Come in.

933
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,990
Don't worry about the money.

934
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,350
My dad went to the city today

935
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,180
to sort that out.

936
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,070
That'll be all, Mr. Zhang.

937
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,950
Keep in touch.

938
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,910
What's the matter?

939
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:11,780
Why are you here?

940
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,350
I came to see Mr. Wan.

941
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,740
They brought me here.

942
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,180
He went to the city to handle some matters.

943
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,350
I'm the general manager of the company.

944
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,220
You can talk to me instead.

945
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,620
All right, then.

946
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,470
I just wanted to ask

947
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,700
why did you guys have to take our land

948
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,660
out of all the land in the village.

949
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,580
We explained this during the conference.

950
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,260
Wang Youde and Wang Qinglai were there.

951
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,260
All they said was that the village
needed to expropriate land.

952
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,430
They didn't explain the details.

953
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,870
All right. I'll explain it to you again.

954
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,140
The Group wants to develop the village.

955
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,620
We want to build a health products factory

956
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,950
and a wastewater treatment plant.

957
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,180
The plans have been approved.

958
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,260
After much survey and consideration,

959
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,220
your family's plot of land
happened to be the most suitable.

960
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,470
It's not just your family's.

961
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,950
The other families' lands were expropriated too.

962
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,870
That's different.

963
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,100
We just sorted out our land

964
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,430
and prepared a greenhouse to plant vegetables.

965
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,430
If you take the land now,

966
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,350
what are we going to do?

967
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,550
Well, that's not for me to answer.

968
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,870
I'm not the one who wanted your family's land.

969
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,870
The engineer decided

970
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,660
that it was the most suitable piece of land

971
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,950
after conducting multiple field surveys.

972
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,300
It's just a coincidence.

973
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,550
We held the conference.

974
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
All those people were there.

975
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,620
Wang Youde and Wang Qinglai
raised their hands in front of everyone.

976
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,470
The matter has been settled.

977
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,910
Why are you still harping on it here?

978
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,100
There were so many people

979
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,300
at the conference.

980
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,030
How could they not raise their hands?

981
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,510
My father-in-law and my husband are honest men.

982
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,910
It's only because I wasn't there at the time.

983
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,580
Why don't we hold another meeting?

984
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,830
I'll be there this time.

985
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,430
Is something wrong with you?

986
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,300
Do you think you get to decide
if we hold a conference?

987
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,140
Who do you think you are?

988
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,300
I'm from the He family.

989
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,740
Your father-in-law, Wang Youde,

990
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,350
and your husband, Wang Qinglai, are adults.

991
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,260
If they didn't want to raise their hands,

992
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,180
no one could force them.

993
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,620
You're a woman.

994
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,580
You should stay at home.

995
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,180
If you were half as meek

996
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,830
as Wang Qinglai,

997
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,220
we wouldn't have all this trouble.

998
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,140
What?

999
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,140
You want all of us

1000
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,510
to be meek and docile

1001
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,580
so you can take advantage of us?

1002
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,580
What did I do to you guys?

1003
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,430
You took our land.

1004
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,300
Either way...

1005
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,300
Either way,
the matter of the land has been decided.

1006
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,830
Your family declared their stance.

1007
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,870
This matter is settled

1008
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,910
no matter if you like it or not!

1009
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,660
Come in.

1010
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,220
Mr. Han.

1011
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,740
The bill for this trip to Shanghai.

1012
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,830
Please sign it so we can claim reimbursement.

1013
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Anything else?

1014
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,300
I've completed my two months of internship.

1015
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,700
When will I be able

1016
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,700
to start my internship as a lawyer?

1017
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,780
If I refuse,

1018
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,550
are you going to sue me
with that recording you have?

1019
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,552
[Delete]

1020
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,180
I've deleted it.

1021
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,470
Who knows if you have a backup copy?

1022
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,910
Do you think that's the kind of person I am?

1023
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:34,950
Good.

1024
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,430
You've got guts.

1025
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,580
You dare to put your words into action.

1026
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,700
This is the kind of talent we need in Yidao.

1027
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,950
I like you.

1028
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,990
Fine.

1029
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,950
Prepare the application materials

1030
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,580
for the lawyer internship.

1031
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,910
From now on,

1032
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,910
we'll officially be boss and employee.

1033
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,950
I'll be expecting from you

1034
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,390
what I expect from others.

1035
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,470
Thank you.

1036
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,740
Usually, intern lawyers don't get a base salary.

1037
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,950
But we look after the young.

1038
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,300
Your base salary is 800 yuan a month.

1039
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,260
It's 700 yuan less than when you were an assistant.

1040
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,820
You'll need to earn

1041
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,230
the rest of the money by getting cases yourself.

1042
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,340
All right?

1043
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,300
Yes.

1044
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,420
He.

1045
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,510
This means you've passed

1046
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,230
the first test, right?

1047
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,510
I suppose so.

1048
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,590
Well, I bet you'll be coming to me again

1049
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,380
when it's time for you
to become an official lawyer.
