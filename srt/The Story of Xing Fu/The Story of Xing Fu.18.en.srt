00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,950
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,519
Xingfu.

4
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,680
What?

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,040
Which traffic police brigade?

6
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,599
Okay, I'll head there now.

7
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,239
Mr. Li.

8
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,640
Where are you going?

9
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,879
Something came up.

10
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,280
I have to go settle it.

11
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,599
Have you finished the report?

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,719
Not yet.

13
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,159
I need it tomorrow.

14
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,239
Don't worry.

15
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,799
It will be on your desk tomorrow.

16
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
It better be.

17
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
Illegal operation?

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,159
Yes.

19
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,039
It's illegal.

20
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,000
According to

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,400
our Road Transport Legislation,

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,560
you cannot transport passengers

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,639
without a Road Passenger Transport License.

24
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,400
He's given his statement.

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,120
They've been doing it for a while.

26
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,400
It's all illegal.

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,240
So,

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,879
it is pretty serious.

29
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,000
Officer.

30
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,479
There were many other people there

31
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,680
peddling their services.

32
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,840
That's right.

33
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,120
Other people were doing business there too.

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,879
Why did you only confiscate our motorcycles?

35
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,800
Like I said,

36
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,400
that is an illegal act.

37
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,879
You can't deem it to be legal

38
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,039
just because many people are doing it.

39
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:41,960
Am I right?

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,840
It's not a matter of how many are involved.

41
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,319
Sooner or later, we will seize

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
every one of those illegal motorcycles.

43
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,520
Officer,

44
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,039
we came from the countryside

45
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
and were unfamiliar with the city regulations.

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,840
We won't do it again.

47
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,719
Couldn't you show us some leniency

48
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,599
and let him go this once?

49
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,319
No matter where you're from,

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,879
it is still an illegal act.

51
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,919
What you guys did

52
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,879
not only disrupted

53
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,360
the normal public transportation operation,

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,159
but it is also

55
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,039
a very serious traffic safety hazard.

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,479
Not knowing the law

57
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,360
doesn't mean

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,520
you get a pass from punishment.

59
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,319
Don't you think?

60
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,919
Qinglai.

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,360
Qingzhi.

62
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,319
You're finally here.

63
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:13,759
Qinglai.

64
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:14,960
Good day, officer.

65
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,840
I am his younger brother.

66
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,560
My name is Wang Qingzhi.

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,039
Hello.

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:17,919
Qingzhi, hurry

69
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,680
and tell the officer here

70
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,639
what you do for a living.

71
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,560
Qinglai.

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,479
Give it a rest.

73
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,039
Officer.

74
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,039
We accept the punishment.

75
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,479
That's how it should be.

76
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,960
[Traffic Police Detachment]
I paid the fine.

77
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,159
The motorcycle is seized.

78
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,879
I spent a few thousand on it.

79
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,360
Qingzhi, you work for the government, right?

80
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,840
How could they not give you any face?

81
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,879
Qinglai.

82
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,000
The law is unbiased.

83
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,919
Not to mention, people who work
for the government

84
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,919
should obey the rules even more.

85
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,120
Qinglai.

86
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,199
Take this as a lesson.

87
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,479
Just don't do it again.

88
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,479
Again?

89
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Taking the high road, are you?

90
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,159
The family was in a good place.

91
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,439
If weren't for you,

92
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,759
we wouldn't have sacrificed our family business

93
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,120
and come here to be at the mercy of others.

94
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,319
Wang Qinglai.

95
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,400
What are you trying to say?

96
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,520
Qinglai, watch your words.

97
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,879
Who is Xingfu doing this for?

98
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,599
She's angry now?

99
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,240
It wasn't easy to find a way to make money.

100
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,439
Now it's gone.

101
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,759
You're back.

102
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,199
Xingfu.

103
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,520
When did you guys move here?

104
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,519
That place was too expensive.

105
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,000
I spoke with Qinglai.

106
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,920
We decided to cancel the stay

107
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,000
and move here.

108
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,519
Xingfu.

109
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,759
Return the refund for the room

110
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,560
to Qingzhi.

111
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,560
Qinglai.

112
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,279
This place is inhabitable.

113
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,000
It's so small and damp.

114
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,519
I think you should go back.

115
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,879
Whoever wants to move can move.

116
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,959
I'm not moving.

117
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,560
That place is too expensive.

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,680
Money is easy for you, huh?

119
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,399
Do you have to talk to your brother like that?

120
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,360
Qingzhi wasn't the one

121
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,279
who seized your motorcycle.

122
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,199
Qingzhi

123
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,319
even paid for the fine.

124
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,399
Qingzhi.

125
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,399
Your brother and I

126
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,439
aren't fussy people.

127
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
We can make do with any place.

128
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,560
A phoenix in trouble is worse than a chicken.

129
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:00,879
Qingzhi.

130
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,199
Try talking to them.

131
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,800
If I agree to do time,

132
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,879
can they return the motorcycle

133
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,639
and money to me?

134
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,319
Xingfu.

135
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,519
Qinglai.

136
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,800
Pack your things.

137
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,040
Move in with me.

138
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,720
Thanks, sir.

Qinglai.

140
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,279
We're here.

141
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,639
This is it.

142
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,120
Such tall buildings.

143
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,480
There's an elevator.

144
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,399
Let's go, Qinglai.

145
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,279
Which one?

146
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,240
This way.

147
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,680
Here.

148
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,040
Qinglai, Xingfu.

149
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:05,839
This way.

150
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,399
Qinglai.

151
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,360
Slippers.

152
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,399
Change into slippers.

153
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,600
Xingfu.

154
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,399
Aren't you renovating the house?

155
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:17,759
Well...

156
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,839
It just

157
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,959
got done today.

158
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,560
It still smells a little.

159
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,000
As if.

160
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,600
It's done up nicely.

161
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,920
Yani did everything.

162
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,000
I have no clue.

163
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,360
Hey.

164
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,199
Qinglai.

165
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:35,800
Xingfu.

166
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,319
I...

167
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,399
Well...

168
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,600
Let me show you around.

169
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,120
This is the dining room.

170
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,360
And,

171
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,160
this is the master bedroom.

172
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,240
And here's the second bedroom.

173
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,839
Yani likes children.

174
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,079
She's planning to turn this

175
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,920
into the kid's room in the future.

176
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,240
Xingfu, Qinglai.

177
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,319
You two can stay here for now.

178
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,920
It's okay, Qingzhi.

179
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,399
This is the kid's room.

180
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,920
Yani is particular about cleanliness.

181
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,439
It's not nice if your brother and I

182
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,319
stay in this room and dirty it.

183
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,120
Let's check other places.

184
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,920
Xingfu, there are only two rooms.

185
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,439
I noticed this spot.

186
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,399
I think it's pretty good.

187
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,759
We can sleep on the floor.

188
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,879
No, Xingfu. That won't do.

189
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,759
I can't have visitors

190
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,480
come to the house

191
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,639
and sleep on the balcony.

192
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,199
It's not damp or chilly.

193
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,759
We have our own bedding.

194
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,160
Say something, Qinglai.

195
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,759
Xingfu.

196
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,879
You're making things awkward for me.

197
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,800
We can make do.

198
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,360
Don't worry about it.

199
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,279
Listen to me, Xingfu.

200
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,759
Honestly.

201
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,720
It's okay to take the room.

202
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,480
Come on, don't fret.

203
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,360
Where's the kitchen?

204
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,319
I'll make something for you.

205
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,879
The kitchen is over there.

206
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,720
But, Xingfu,

207
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,279
we don't have anything at home.

208
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,199
I do.

209
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,319
Okay.

210
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,639
Qinglai, don't sit there

211
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,480
waiting to be served.

212
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,560
Go and set the bed.

213
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
What a nice kitchen.

214
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,240
Look at this.

215
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,519
I brought free-range eggs.

216
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,040
Where's the bag?

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,839
Here.

218
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,240
I also have vermicelli.

219
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,279
You really packed everything, Xingfu.

220
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,680
When you're traveling,

221
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,839
it's always good to save where you can.

222
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,480
Go and talk

223
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,160
to your brother.

224
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,319
I can manage on my own.

225
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,759
Okay.

226
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,720
I'll leave it to you.

227
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:25,680
Go on.

228
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,960
Qinglai.

229
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,200
I think you should sleep in the room.

230
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
It's vacant anyway.

231
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,120
It's okay.

232
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,399
It's fine.

233
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,039
We'll sleep here.

234
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,480
I've got nothing in the house.

235
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,600
Not even a bottle of water.

236
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,120
Let me go and buy some water.

237
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,519
No, no need.

238
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,600
I can drink

239
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,559
the tap water.

240
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,320
It's okay.

241
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,759
Qinglai.

242
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,240
What will you

243
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,559
and Xingfu

244
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,039
do next?

245
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,919
What can I do?

246
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,919
I thought I could

247
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,120
make some money through a motorcycle taxi.

248
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,000
Now the motorcycle is gone.

249
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,399
What else can I do?

250
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,799
Qingzhi.

251
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,320
You seem to be doing well

252
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,399
in the city.

253
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,679
Qinglai.

254
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,879
What you see is just a mirage.

255
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,440
I've actually got a lot of pressure.

256
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,240
Take this house for instance.

257
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,440
I have a monthly loan to pay.

258
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,159
The loan is quite a big chunk.

259
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,519
You might not believe me.

260
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,000
But I eat instant noodles a lot.

261
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,799
At least you have

262
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,200
a county magistrate as an in-law.

263
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,559
Didn't they

264
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,600
offer you any help?

265
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,679
Yani would sometimes

266
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,279
buy me things.

267
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,720
Sometimes, she'd give me money.

268
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,039
But,

269
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,679
I'm a man after all.

270
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,360
I have my pride.

271
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,159
Only you have pride?

272
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,840
What about me?

273
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,480
I have pride too.

274
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,360
Qingzhi.

275
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,039
Help me

276
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,039
look for something to do.

277
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,320
I can't drive a motorcycle taxi now.

278
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,759
I can't just sit around

279
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,799
and wait to be fed.

280
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay.

281
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,879
But I need to warn you beforehand.

282
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,720
Getting a job is quite tough

283
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,639
in the city.

284
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,840
Even for graduates,

285
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,759
they

286
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,480
aren't guaranteed

287
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
to find a job.

288
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,519
I'm not asking you to find me

289
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,000
a white-collar job or anything.

290
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,080
As long as I can do something

291
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,320
that pays for my daily necessities.

292
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,240
I can still manage

293
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,360
manual labor, can't I?

294
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,039
Qinglai.

295
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,159
I know that.

296
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,720
I know you're physically capable.

297
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,879
I'll ask around.

298
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,360
Isn't your

299
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:58,879
father-in-law

300
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,720
a high-ranking official in the county?

301
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,320
You might not have an idea.

302
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,519
But does he not have a way either?

303
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,120
Try asking him.

304
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:05,639
Ask him

305
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,159
to help me get a good job.

306
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,919
For him,

307
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,600
such a small matter

308
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,799
should be as easy as pie.

309
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,360
No?

310
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,200
Remember

311
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,080
Gao Taiming from the neighboring village?

312
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,320
One of his sons

313
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,879
got into university.

314
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,919
Then,

315
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,559
he became a county official.

316
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,200
He got the whole family out.

317
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,039
Even...

318
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,360
Even their

319
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,240
sister-in-law

320
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,639
managed to get a job

321
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,879
at the county's guesthouse.

322
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,200
I brought some money

323
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,320
on this trip.

324
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,720
The city folks

325
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,840
are about showing courtesy, right?

326
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,240
How about

327
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,679
we pay them a visit?

328
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,600
We should introduce ourselves.

329
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,519
And we could also ask them

330
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,720
to help us out.

331
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,960
Qinglai.

332
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,879
If you're talking about rank,

333
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,240
Yani's father is indeed on the county level.

334
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,720
But in a big city like this,

335
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,559
her father

336
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,720
is only a director.

337
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,960
He isn't on the same level as the county head.

338
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,200
It's totally unrelated.

339
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,360
Qingzhi, we haven't even asked them yet.

340
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,519
Why are you already

341
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,039
leave him aside?

342
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,759
Qinglai.

343
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,639
You don't know

344
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,639
Yani's father.

345
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,600
He is quite an old-fashioned man.

346
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,759
Forget about

347
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,120
his ability for now.

348
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,799
Even if he could,

349
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,600
I don't think

350
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,639
her father would help.

351
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,240
You haven't even asked.

352
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,879
How would you know if he'd be willing

353
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,639
to help or not?

354
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:24,600
You're...

355
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,279
I think

356
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,519
you're being evasive right now.

357
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,080
So much

358
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,320
for sending you

359
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,879
to university and all.

360
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,080
Now the family is in a pinch.

361
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,600
And you won't

362
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,679
even lift a finger.

363
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,000
Qinglai, please.

364
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,919
Don't say that.

365
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,039
I will...

366
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,399
I will think of a way.

367
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,600
Let's eat.

368
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,399
We can talk after we eat.

369
00:12:57,853 --> 00:13:04,500
[Wan Village Health Center of Fushui Town]

370
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,840
You're recovering well.

371
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,440
Mr. Wan.

372
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,799
We'll let you rest.

373
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,120
Officer Li.

374
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,399
We'll leave you be.

375
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,799
Shantang.

376
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:18,879
How are you?

377
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,720
Feeling better?

378
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,679
I'm here to see you.

379
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,240
Bu...

380
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,159
Buddy.

381
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,720
Thank you.

382
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,320
Thank you.

383
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,279
What are you talking about?

384
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,000
We can omit the pleasantries between us.

385
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,440
Shantang.

386
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,159
Don't take it too hard.

387
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,120
The Wan Village residents

388
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,399
are all speaking up on your behalf.

389
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,320
Their feelings for you

390
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,480
are undeniable.

391
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:55,840
They all respect you.

392
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,960
I...

393
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,679
Because I

394
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,279
sat on the fence,

395
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,399
I was criticized by my superior.

396
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,639
I was called out for being partial

397
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,759
and disregarding principles.

398
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,320
I failed to handle the matter properly.

399
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,200
It's my mistake.

400
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,840
I...

401
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,159
I also did wrong.

402
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,720
I...

403
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,039
was wrong.

404
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,240
Qinglai and his wife

405
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,440
couldn't take the pressure.

406
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,600
Because of the incident,

407
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,840
they went to the city to look for work.

408
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,440
Xingfu.

409
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,600
Can I discuss something with you?

410
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:03,600
My brother

411
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,440
is asking Yani's father to help get him a job.

412
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,480
To be frank,

413
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,639
it's putting me in a tough spot.

414
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,879
It's really hard for me to bring this up.

415
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,919
I had thought

416
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,360
this wouldn't be a problem for Yani's father.

417
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,120
You might not know

418
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,200
about her family.

419
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,039
Yani's father

420
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,159
also came from the countryside.

421
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,759
From her side of the family alone,

422
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,080
the father already has his hands full.

423
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,360
Today,

424
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,440
one comes looking for work.

425
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,600
Tomorrow, one comes seeking medical help.

426
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,720
The next day, another comes asking for money.

427
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,720
Because of such matters,

428
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,120
Yani's parents have had lots of arguments.

429
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,399
Okay.

430
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,840
Don't you fret, Qingzhi.

431
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,559
Just do what you can.

432
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,679
It's okay if you can't help.

433
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,240
We don't want to trouble you.

434
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,600
Well then,

435
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,159
please

436
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,320
help me talk to Qinglai.

437
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
Your brother is acting up

438
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,679
because his motorcycle

439
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,840
was seized by the police today.

440
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,519
He's in a bad mood.

441
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:46,440
He felt helpless,

442
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,360
so he spoke a little harshly.

443
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,600
Don't take it to heart.

444
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,159
Thanks, Xingfu.

445
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,679
Xingfu.

446
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,960
I really think

447
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,720
that him marrying you

448
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,399
is his biggest find in life.

449
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,360
Don't flatter me.

450
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,080
We're a family.

451
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,240
No need to be so polite.

452
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,039
Come in, gentlemen.

453
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,840
Okay.

454
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,440
Slippers?

455
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,159
It's fine.

456
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,279
We're going to clean up later.

457
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:06,879
Okay.

458
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,840
Qinglai?

459
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,840
It's Yani.

460
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,960
Yani.

461
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,360
My brother and sister-in-law are here.

462
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,240
I wasn't able to inform you

463
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,960
beforehand.

464
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,000
-Yani.
-Xingfu.

465
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,799
Let me get you slippers.

466
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,360
It's okay.

467
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,440
Excuse me, ma'am.

468
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,720
Where should we measure first?

469
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,960
You can do the living room first.

470
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,200
Then move to the bedrooms.

471
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:27,799
Okay.

472
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,679
Here.

473
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,440
Be careful.

474
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,639
Need help?

475
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,200
No, it's okay.

476
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,759
Xingfu.

477
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,919
You're wearing my slippers.

478
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,240
Am I?

479
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,480
I didn't know.

480
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,399
Let's switch, then.

481
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,200
No, no, it's okay.

482
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,080
I won't wear them.

483
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,159
I have to clean the house anyway.

484
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,840
Yani.

485
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,720
My brother and sister-in-law

486
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,759
could no longer stay in the village

487
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,120
because of some land issue.

488
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,200
So...

489
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,879
So you never

490
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,480
tell me anything

491
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,399
and treat me like an outsider.

492
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,639
Qingzhi.

493
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,240
You shouldn't have.

494
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:56,960
How could you

495
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,600
not have informed Yani

496
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,759
about us being here?

497
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,240
That's right.

498
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,799
I'm glad your sister-in-law is here.

499
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,600
Yani.

500
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm sorry.

501
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,799
We caused trouble for you.

502
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,640
Don't say that.

503
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,759
Make yourselves at home.

504
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,370
Hey,

505
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:07,850
Yani.

506
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,090
I had booked an express inn

507
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:09,850
for Qinglai

508
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,570
and Xingfu,

509
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,330
but they think it's too expensive.

510
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,660
So they moved to

511
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,900
a tiny and damp room.

512
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,290
What's wrong with you, Qingzhi?

513
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,180
The house is big enough.

514
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,700
Why did you ask them to stay at an inn?

515
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,090
Right.

516
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:22,610
Sir.

517
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,420
Please don't hang it too low.

518
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,530
I don't want the curtains to touch the floor.

519
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,460
It might get dirty.

520
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,500
Okay, I'll move it higher by 2 cm.

521
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,130
Okay.

522
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:29,530
Sure.

523
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,900
Hang it higher.

524
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,460
Okay, sure.

525
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,020
Qingzhi.

526
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,050
Don't you know any manners?

527
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,020
You asked Qinglai and Xingfu
to sleep on the balcony?

528
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,530
I asked them

529
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,700
to sleep in the kid's room.

530
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,770
But Xingfu didn't want to mess it up

531
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,740
and insisted on bunking here.

532
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,530
It's alright. We can sleep wherever.

533
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,610
Xingfu, that room is vacant.

534
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,810
How could you sleep here?

535
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,130
I'll move these inside.

536
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,090
It's fine.

537
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,740
Don't worry about it, Yani.

538
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,180
We can sleep here. It's fine.

539
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,260
It's okay.

540
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,090
Just listen to me.

541
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,850
Sleep in there.

542
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:58,980
Here is fine.

543
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,530
Xingfu.

544
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,050
Make yourselves at home.

545
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,130
I don't come here often anyway.

546
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,090
We're just staying here temporarily.

547
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,050
Not long-term.

548
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,180
It's fine.

549
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,370
Here.

550
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,130
Your pillow.

551
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,180
Yani.

552
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,020
You go ahead.

553
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,570
We can make the bed ourselves.

554
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,180
Okay.

555
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,420
How could he

556
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,900
smoke in the house?

557
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,530
I hate the smell of cigarettes.

558
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,770
I'll remind Qinglai later.

559
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,900
I'll tell him not to smoke indoors.

560
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,570
Excuse me.

561
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,610
We've taken the measurements for the living room.

562
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,610
As for the bedrooms...

563
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,610
The bedroom is that way.

564
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,090
Okay.

565
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,810
You can measure it.

566
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,020
Go and take the measurements.

567
00:18:59,050 --> 00:18:59,810
I'll go over these with our client.

568
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,370
Okay.

569
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,530
For the renovation package,

570
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,500
only the curtains are left.

571
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,810
These are our product samples.

572
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,700
Take a look.

573
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,020
This has all the info.

574
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,570
May I know

575
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,180
what price range you're thinking of doing?

576
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,700
What prices are there?

577
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,330
For us,

578
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,610
we provide all price ranges.

579
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,220
It's down

580
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,130
to your own choice.

581
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,500
I reckon you two are renovating this

582
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,940
because you're getting married, right?

583
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,660
Yes, we are.

584
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,500
Judging from the style

585
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,220
you've chosen for the house,

586
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,050
I'd recommend

587
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:25,770
this set.

588
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,850
To do the whole house,

589
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,330
20,000 would be sufficient.

590
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,220
20,000 for curtains?

591
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,940
That's not very expensive.

592
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,220
There are people who spend 10,000

593
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,500
on just one set.

594
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:36,980
That's right.

595
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,500
It's too expensive.

596
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,500
My mom agreed to pay for it.

597
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,220
Let's go with this.

598
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:41,810
No, don't.

599
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,610
If your mother pays for it,

600
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,180
I'll only feel more awkward visiting your family.

601
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,530
Then I'll pay.

602
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,220
You just have to pick the color, okay?

603
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,900
Is there

604
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,530
anything cheaper?

605
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,220
Did you hear that?

606
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,180
20,000 yuan just to make curtains.

607
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,500
20,000 yuan to make curtains?

608
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,740
Does Qingzhi have too much money to burn or what?

609
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,090
You better not

610
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,460
bring this up in front of Qingzhi.

611
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,500
It's not easy to get a wife in the city.

612
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,180
What's so hard about that?

613
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,180
He's a postgraduate.

614
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,220
He works for the government.

615
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,020
What's so hard?

616
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,530
Don't talk so much

617
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,460
when you're a guest here.

618
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,290
Don't be a nuisance.

619
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,610
Open that up.

620
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,290
We'll be going now.

621
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,260
Thank you, sirs.

622
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,290
No worries.

623
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,050
Take care.

624
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,530
Thanks.

625
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,220
Goodbye.

626
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,180
Xingfu.

627
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,850
I'm leaving too.

628
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,770
Yani.

629
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,940
You're leaving?

630
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,050
I'll see you off.

631
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,050
It's okay.

632
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
I can see her off.

633
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,460
Take care, Yani.

634
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,940
Let's have a meal together next time, Qinglai.

635
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,660
Xingfu.

636
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,500
Okay.

637
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,500
Why did it feel

638
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,900
as if I was the guest?

639
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,290
Isn't that our home?

640
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,330
Yani.

641
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,220
Never mind.

642
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,610
Forget I said anything.

643
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,180
Look,

644
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,900
my brother and sister-in-law
just arrived in the city.

645
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,940
They need a place to stay

646
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,940
while looking for work.

647
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,850
How will they manage?

648
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I know.

649
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,370
I should've expected it.

650
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,740
My family's main melody

651
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,810
is playing again.

652
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,610
My father still has

653
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,610
several family members to serve.

654
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,370
Yani.

655
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,850
You and I are not the same.

656
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,850
You know

657
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,130
I was only able to attend university

658
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,180
with the help of my entire family.

659
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,570
I cannot disregard them.

660
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,460
If you think...

661
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,610
There you go again.

662
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,330
Qingzhi.

663
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,050
We've been through

664
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,660
a lot together.

665
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,420
I do

666
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,290
like your family.

667
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,220
Especially your sister-in-law.

668
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,020
But,

669
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,900
they suddenly

670
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,460
show up like this

671
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,330
without notice...

672
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,260
I need some time to get used to it.

673
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,290
When I have the time,

674
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,130
I can help

675
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,090
look for places and jobs too.

676
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:07,850
I'm going.

677
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,330
Okay.

678
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,330
Dad, I'm home.

679
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,570
You're back.

680
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,610
You're back.

681
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:25,660
Mom.

682
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:26,940
How did it go?

683
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,940
Have you ordered the curtains?

684
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,420
Yes.

685
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,740
I chose the set that costs 20,000 yuan.

686
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,090
But Qingzhi insisted that the one

687
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,130
that costs 9,000 yuan is better.

688
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,260
So I went with his idea.

689
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,130
9,000 it is, then.

690
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,370
9,000 is good.

691
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,370
This is

692
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,330
the good thing about countryside kids.

693
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,420
They are frugal.

694
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,460
What about 9,000 yuan?

695
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,570
We're the ones paying for it anyway.

696
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,660
Even though he bought the house,

697
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,220
taking account of the renovations,

698
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,500
the money we've spent

699
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,290
is more than what he spent.

700
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,610
Why don't you get it?

701
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,220
When they get married,

702
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,660
it all belongs to your daughter anyway.

703
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,700
What are you doing?

704
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,090
Are you

705
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,570
trying

706
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,420
to make our daughter pay for it?

707
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,770
I'm doing this for her own good.

708
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,370
Dad.

709
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,700
Can you come to my room?

710
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,050
I have something to ask you.

711
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:14,570
Seems to me

712
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,610
like you're in a bad mood.

713
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,220
What's wrong?

714
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,940
Qingzhi's brother and sister-in-law are here.

715
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,570
So are they staying temporarily,

716
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,220
or...?

717
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,090
I think

718
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,660
it's most likely going to be a while.

719
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,570
Why?

720
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,940
That's quite tricky.

721
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,330
They don't have other relatives in the city.

722
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,290
Who else could they go to for help?

723
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,420
I came from the countryside too.

724
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,330
It's not easy

725
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,610
for kids from the countryside
to get into university.

726
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,810
Every one of them

727
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,980
had support

728
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,530
from the family

729
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,980
and even the whole clan.

730
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,740
Then when you've become capable,

731
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,980
you disregard the problems at home.

732
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,740
That's wrong.

733
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,570
Even crows know to take care of their old parents.

734
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,500
A kid lamb

735
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,420
knows to eat on its knees.

736
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,700
So humans

737
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,940
should know better than animals.

738
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,530
Right?

739
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,700
I know.

740
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,220
Think about it.

741
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,090
If you decide not to choose him

742
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,290
because of his family,

743
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,370
it's not too late.

744
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,050
But

745
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,610
once you make the choice,

746
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,020
you have to be

747
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,090
prepared

748
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,460
to bear the responsibility with him.

749
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:42,700
Actually...

750
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,420
What are you talking about?

751
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,020
What?

752
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,700
Why should Yani

753
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,740
bear the responsibility with him?

754
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,090
What has Yani got to do with anything?

755
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,370
Mom, how could you

756
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,530
eavesdrop on our conversation?

757
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,020
I knew what was going on

758
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,220
when you asked for your dad.

759
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,610
We're having a heart-to-heart.

760
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,420
Is that a problem?

761
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,180
So what were you talking about?

762
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,130
What's the story?

763
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,900
I told you before.

764
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,420
What did I say?

765
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,810
You haven't gotten married yet.

766
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,220
And trouble's already come knocking.

767
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,020
Yani.

768
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,770
Listen to me.

769
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,180
It's not too late

770
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,900
to break up with him.

771
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,660
Not...

772
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,500
Not too late?

773
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,660
Don't end up like your mom.

774
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:18,850
One mistake

775
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,660
leads to another.

776
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,050
Now I am forever plagued

777
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,700
by this matter.

778
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,850
What are you going on about again?

779
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,420
So you wish to make up for the mistake?

780
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,810
It's still not too late.

781
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,180
Listen, I won't argue with you.

782
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,220
Mom, give it a rest, will you?

783
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,330
Your dad is playing the good guy.

784
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,180
Can't you see?

785
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,660
How can I keep quiet?

786
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,500
Am I supposed to not say anything

787
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,740
when you're jumping into a fire pit?

788
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,020
The money we've spent on him,

789
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,050
we'll just think of it as buying stock.

790
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,090
The market crashed

791
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,020
and we lost it all.

792
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,260
Just break up with him.

793
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,610
It's not too late.

794
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,260
Mom!

795
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,700
I won't break up with Qingzhi.

796
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,660
Just you wait.

797
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,850
Now it's his brother and sister-in-law.

798
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,370
Next time, it will be his sister and parents.

799
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,220
There will be no end!

800
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,500
Mom, stop pushing me.

801
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,660
I'm going to leave the house
if you keep doing this.

802
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,610
Don't you threaten me.

803
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,660
Where is your conscience?

804
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,570
After everything I've done for you,

805
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,050
how could you forsake me like this?

806
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,050
I... Let me talk to her.

807
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,850
Look at your dad.

808
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,530
Always sitting on the fence.

809
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,570
You're not doing her any good.

810
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,900
-Can't you see it?
-I'm harming her?

811
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,740
Yes, you are!

812
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,850
Alright, I'll persuade her.

813
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,570
Because I said what was necessary,

814
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,570
I've become the bad guy.

815
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,770
No, you're the good guy.

816
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,530
Goodness.

817
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,810
You're good.

818
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,500
She's gone?

819
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,420
About this matter,

820
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,900
this is what I have to say.

821
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,130
People that come from the countryside

822
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,610
are like snails.

823
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:25,810
Every day,

824
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,610
they struggle to move forward.

825
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,180
However,

826
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,130
behind them

827
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,290
lies a heavy shell.

828
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,740
This is how I lived

829
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,980
over the years.

830
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,370
I will forever be burdened by the shell.

831
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,420
There have been several opportunities

832
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,810
for me to leave the organization.

833
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,370
I could've held an actual post.

834
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,500
You really should've done that.

835
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,980
They spoke to me.

836
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,420
They offered to let me be the county head,

837
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,610
or the county secretary.

838
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,370
I didn't have the guts.

839
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,130
What do you need guts for?

840
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,090
Don't forget your grandma

841
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,330
and the whole slew of relatives.

842
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,050
Every one of them

843
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,260
would have come to me for help.

844
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,940
If they knew

845
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,260
I had actual power,

846
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,290
things like

847
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,020
wanting me to find them jobs,

848
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,810
or

849
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,090
asking me to approve land titles,

850
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,570
helping them with their businesses...

851
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,260
Ignore them.

852
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,130
I wouldn't dare

853
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,180
to cross them.

854
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:08,940
Right?

855
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,050
If I really did that,

856
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:10,700
I'd...

857
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,850

He's a good kid.

865
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,020
He has a bright future.

866
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,660
What I most admire

867
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,260
is my daughter's taste.

868
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,900
She's just like her father.

869
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,260
It's hereditary.

875
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,770
So you need to think this through.

876
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,090
Once you choose him,

877
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,090
then...

878
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,050
Then,

879
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,370
you have to

880
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,290
always remind him in the future

881
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,260
and keep him in check.

882
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,700
If his family members

883
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,460
come to him asking for help,

884
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,660
it's okay

885
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,770
to do what he can within limits.

886
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,770
That's not a problem.

887
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,330
But if it's anything more...

888
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,740
What do you mean

889
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,610
by "more"?

890
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,850

1020

1030
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,340
By the way, Xingfu.

1031
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,340
Do you have enough money?

1032
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,710
Expenses in the city

1033
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,620
are quite high.

1034
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,660
I have enough.

1035
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,340
You need the money to pay the loan.

1036
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,990
No need to be polite with me.

1037
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,420
I'm not.

1038
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,820
I will ask you if I need it.

1039
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,860
Put it away.

1040
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,380
Feel free to ask.

1041
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,550
I will.

1042
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,140
Let's change

1043
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:09,950
to a clean one.

1044
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,430
This one

1045
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,030
is dirty.

1046
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,350
Parents.

1047
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,140
The class is over.

1048
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,910
Let's head to the music classroom.

1049
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,222
-Okay.
-Okay.

1050
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,470
Mommy needs to go to the toilet.

1051
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,660
Let's go.

1052
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,580
Baby.

1053
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,950
I'm going to the restroom.

1054
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:49,470
Baby.

1055
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,580
Where's your mother?

1056
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:56,990
It's okay.

1057
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,740
Don't cry.

1058
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,580
Don't cry.

1059
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,660
Let me hold you.

1060
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,510
Don't cry.

1061
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,350
Where's your mother?

1062
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,830
Where did your mommy go?

1063
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,700
What are you doing?

1064
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,740
Why are you holding my baby?

1065
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,070
He's your baby?

1066
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,100
I saw him crying by himself.

1067
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,830
So I held him to coax him.

1068
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,350
Who might you be?

1069
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,870
I'm the cleaner here.

1070
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,870
Why is a cleaner holding my baby?

1071
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,910
Where's your staff ID?

1072
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,510
I'm currently

1073
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,870
still undergoing

1074
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,070
a trial period.

1075
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,620
I haven't gotten my staff ID.

1076
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,660
Without a staff ID,

1077
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,220
who knows if you're really what you say you are?

1078
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,300
No, no.

1079
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,430
I saw the boy

1080
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,180
crying all alone.

1081
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,430
I... I felt bad.

1082
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,700
So I held him to console him.

1083
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,100
As mothers,

1084
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,030
we should never leave

1085
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,030
our children unattended.

1086
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:46,950
It's not safe.

1087
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,100
Are cleaners supposed

1088
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,220
to teach others

1089
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,260
how to be a mother too?

1090
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,700
Manager!

1091
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,660
Ms. Wu!

1092
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,510
Is she a staff here?

1093
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,180
Yes.

1094
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:58,990
What happened?

1095
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,620
Here's the thing, Ms. Wu.

1096
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,780
I saw the kid

1097
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,100
all alone outside the toilet.

1098
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,870
He was crying by himself.

1099
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,550
He looked so pitiful.

1100
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,870
So I held him, wanting to console him.

1101
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,260
But the mother

1102
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,470
probably misunderstood.

1103
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,870
The mother can coax her crying child.

1104
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,390
You just need to do your own job.

1105
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,300
She's new here.

1106
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,070
She doesn't know the rules.

1107
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,220
She won't do it again.

1108
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,350
You're running an early learning child care.

1109
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,100
-Yes.
-You need to prioritize safety.

1110
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,910
I just came across

1111
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,780
such news recently.

1112
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,300
Talking about people disguising

1113
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,300
as a cleaner

1114
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,700
to sneak into child cares

1115
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,580
to kidnap children.

1116
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,140
What are you saying?

1117
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,430
Are you accusing me?

1118
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,100
Do I look like a child kidnapper?

1119
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,100
Just keep quiet.

1120
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,870
I have my own kid.

1121
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,350
Why would I steal someone else's?

1122
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,430
How can you compare

1123
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,740
your kid to my baby?

1124
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,620
Besides,

1125
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,510
you're a cleaner.

1126
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,830
Did you wash your hands before carrying my boy?

1127
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,550
You're full of germs.

1128
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,830
If my boy falls sick,

1129
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,740
will you be responsible?

1130
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,950
What's wrong with being a cleaner?

1131
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,550
So a child

1132
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,300
has different ranks?

1133
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,180
Is that what you're saying?

1134
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,220
We're both mothers.

1135
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,470
You should watch what you say.

1136
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,580
I've washed my hands

1137
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,550
before I held your child.

1138
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,260
Don't you worry.

1139
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,070
Also,

1140
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,390
that's not the way to raise kids.

1141
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,030
What can you teach them like this?

1142
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,350
So what if you dress well?

1143
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,260
When the mind is dirty,

1144
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,990
everything you see is dirty.

1145
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,830
Did you hear that?

1146
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,390
He.

1147
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,990
She criticized me right in front of you.

1148
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,140
Come here.

1149
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,180
I...

1150
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,300
Apologize to the customer.

1151
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,390
Why should I apologize?

1152
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,510
What did I do wrong?

1153
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,620
She accused me

1154
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,350
of stealing the kid,

1155
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,220
and this and that.

1156
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,990
Let's be reasonable here.

1157
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,390
I didn't ask her to apologize.

1158
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:29,830
Ms. Wu.

1159
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,260
My kid won't be studying here.

1160
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:31,830
Refund me.

1161
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,580
Please don't.

1162
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,030
Listen.

1163
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,220
Feng's mother.

1164
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,100
Don't be angry.

1165
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,910
Calm down.

1166
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,220
He.

1167
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,430
You're fired.

1168
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,350
You may go.

1169
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,180
Based on what?

1170
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,070
Go and get your pay.

1171
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,180
You don't have to come tomorrow.

1172
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,260
Can't you tell right from wrong?

1173
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:47,910
Xingfu?

1174
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,220
What are you doing here?

1175
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,660
Wait, where are you going?

1176
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,100
Xingfu!

1177
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,870
Wait!

1178
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,220
(I didn't know)

1179
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,100
(so much has happened.)

1180
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,950
(Those people are unreasonable.)

1181
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,700
Xingfu.

1182
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,470
You did nothing wrong.

1183
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,660
One thing led to another.

1184
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,830
No matter how we tried to explain
to the villagers,

1185
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,740
no one believed us.

1186
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,620
Qinglai and I

1187
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,660
didn't want to implicate the family.

1188
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,510
So,

1189
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,100
we decided to seek shelter in the city.

1190
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,390
We don't know

1191
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,100
when the issue will be settled.

1192
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,140
But we can't sit idly by.

1193
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,390
We're going to find work here.

1194
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,220
Mr. Guan.

1195
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,100
In this situation,

1196
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,780
what do you think we should do?

1197
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,300
Your question

1198
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,430
has got me stumped.

1199
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,140
To be honest,

1200
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,430
in life,

1201
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,870
it's one thing to know reason.

1202
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,950
But the reality is a different matter.

1203
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,700
Take for instance what happened to you.

1204
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,300
Someone else made a mistake,

1205
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,350
but you have to bear the consequence.

1206
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,780
Moreover,

1207
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,910
you can't do anything about it.

1208
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,180
How unfair it is.

1209
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,030
Anyway,

1210
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,260
is there anything

1211
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,870
I can help you with?

1212
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,470
I saw the recruitment ad

1213
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,740
posted at the door.

1214
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,700
Are you hiring?

1215
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,580
Perfect timing.

1216
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,470
I

1217
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,780
just lost my job.

1218
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,990
I'm available.

1219
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,070
You're hiring. I'm seeking.

1220
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,950
We can help each other out.

1221
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,100
Does that work for you?

1222
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,350
Wait.

1223
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,870
It's true that we're hiring.

1224
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,300
But what we need is a receptionist.

1225
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,030
What does a receptionist do?

1226
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,580
The receptionist represents the law firm

1227
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,950
as the face

1228
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,180
to greet customers.

1229
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:47,780
Well...

1230
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,030
That's doable.

1231
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,430
I'm good at greeting clients.

1232
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,180
It's not a problem.

1233
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,700
That's not the problem.

1234
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,580
The receptionist

1235
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,620
has to be cultured.

1236
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,390
You also need to have

1237
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,740
some basic knowledge about the law.

1238
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,220
I don't suppose you know...

1239
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,550
I can learn.

1240
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,260
It's...

1241
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,510
It's not that simple.

1242
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,660
What about

1243
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,260
this?

1244
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,620
The office needs

1245
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,300
a handyman.

1246
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,390
If you don't mind,

1247
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,700
you could give it a try.

1248
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,070
Handyman?

1249
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,740
What does that mean?

1250
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,580
A handyman is straightforward.

1251
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,180
It's

1252
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,260
helping us

1253
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,660
take care of miscellaneous work.

1254
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,550
Such as

1255
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,180
ordering food,

1256
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,620
receiving parcels,

1257
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,910
and looking after the cleanliness

1258
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:38,430
and whatnot.

1259
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,430
Sure.

1260
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,220
You mean a cleaner.

1261
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,260
That's not a problem.

1262
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,390
As long as I can work here,

1263
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,390
I'm okay with anything.

1264
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,470
Mr. Guan.

1265
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,180
Thank you so much.

1266
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,070
Please don't.

1267
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,580
I'm truly,

1268
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,390
truly grateful.

1269
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,180
Here you go.

1270
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,140
No need

1271
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,390
to thank me.

1272
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,510
To be honest,

1273
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,830
I should be thanking you.

1274
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,550
Learning about your situation

1275
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,660
and mindset

1276
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,220
has been a wake-up call

1277
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,100
and an encouragement for me.

1278
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,550
The reason I opened this law firm was

1279
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,830
that I wanted to do things

1280
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,830
I believed to be right.

1281
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,550
To put it simply, I wanted to be myself.

1282
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,620
Just like you.

1283
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,580
You've seen this place.

1284
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,180
The law firm

1285
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,350
is small and dilapidated.

1286
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,910
We're only just starting out.

1287
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,510
So we have to go out there

1288
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,700
to distribute fliers

1289
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:25,910
and find clients.

1290
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,350
We want people to know

1291
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,470
that this law firm

1292
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:30,910
stands for justice.

1293
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:32,950
At the same time,

1294
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,100
we have to consider

1295
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,430
how to break even.

1296
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,620
Enough beating around the bush.

1297
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,100
What I meant to say is...

1298
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,300
Is...

1299
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,260
We...

1300
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,220
The salary

1301
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,470
we can offer you

1302
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,070
won't be very high.

1303
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,660
Is 1,500 yuan okay?

1304
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:57,660
Sure.

1305
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,220
That's...

1306
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,350
I'm okay

1307
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,430
with whatever salary.

1308
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,550
It's not a problem.

1309
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,550
Anyway,

1310
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,620
when your company...

1311
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,430
When this law firm

1312
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,100
becomes bigger

1313
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,220
and expands,

1314
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,580
I'm sure you'll raise my pay too.

1315
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:14,990
Sure.

1316
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,390
So...

1317
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,220
Where...

1318
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,430
Where are the mop

1319
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,260
and rag?

1320
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,740
Are you going to start right away?

1321
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,260
Whatever needs cleaning,

1322
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,030
I'll get it done.

1323
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:24,830
Hold on.

1324
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,910
Let me introduce you to everyone first.

1325
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,580
Guys.

1326
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,580
Gather around.

1327
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,140
I'd like to officially introduce you

1328
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,180
to our new colleague.

1329
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,030
This is

1330
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,870
He Xingfu from Wan Village

1331
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,430
whom I've mentioned before.

1332
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,350
-Xingfu.
-Hello.

1333
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,660
This is Mr. Zhang.

1334
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,990
And that's Mr. Wang.

1335
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,070
They are also

1336
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,260
my co-partners.

1337
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,550
It's almost time.

1338
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,910
Right, we have to meet with some clients.

1339
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:54,780
Well then,

1340
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,780
I'll leave this house

1341
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,510
to you.

1342
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:57,300
Don't worry.

1343
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,870
I'll take care of it.
