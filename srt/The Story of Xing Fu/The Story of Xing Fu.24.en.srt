3
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,000
Open the door!

4
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,239
It's a downpour out there.

5
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,959
What's wrong?

6
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,840
It won't start.

7
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,640
What?

8
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
Just how out of luck are we?

9
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,159
What now?

10
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,199
What else can we do?

11
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,759
We'll have the car towed.

12
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,159
Xingfu.

13
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,319
I got it.

14
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,159
Tell them to stay.

15
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,520
We'll be right there.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,680
What is it?

17
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,360
Xingfu said

18
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,520
the victims of Shiqiao Village

19
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,439
went to the office.

20
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
It seemed urgent.

21
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,159
What is going on now?

22
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,240
We lost the big case,

23
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,639
we can't lose the small case too!

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,000
What do we do now?

25
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,280
We should go back now!

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,759
Get a taxi.

27
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,520
But I just bought the suit.

28
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,240
We are going to be flat broke,

29
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,199
so forget about the suit.

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,680
Let's go.

31
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,759
Seriously?

32
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,680
There is no taxi here!

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,560
What now?

34
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,080
We'll run back.

35
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,560
What?

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,280
Over here!

37
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
Be careful.

38
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,599
Over here!

39
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,479
We can manage here.

40
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,560
Over here!

41
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,199
Cover the computers!

42
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,000
The floor is flooded.

43
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:35,680
Third Uncle!

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,919
I need a plastic bag.

45
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,400
Use this

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,639
to cover the computer.

47
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,039
Cover the computer.

48
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,159
Cover it.

49
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,319
It's leaking over here!

50
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,759
Third Uncle, over here too!

51
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,479
Right here.

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,560
Over here.

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,120
Quick.

54
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,400
It'll be full soon.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,159
Cover it.

56
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,840
Covered.

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
-It's leaking over here.
-Wait.

58
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,240
-Over here too.
-Hold it.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,520
Watch out.

60
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,000
My goodness!

61
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:12,879
Cover it here.

62
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,520
Come on.

63
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,360
Use this.

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,360
Put it over there.

65
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,360
Over here.

66
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,439
And this too.

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,959
Xingfu!

68
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,120
Yes!

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,879
Coming!

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,720
I told you so.

71
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,519
See?

72
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,199
The lawyers rushed back here

73
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,000
and got drenched

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,160
just to handle your case.

75
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,360
Mr. Guan.

76
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,199
They've been waiting for you.

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,360
The building is leaking.

78
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,680
But these villagers are kind enough

79
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,879
to help us out.

80
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,519
Mr. Guan.

81
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,839
Check the ceiling.

82
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:51,680
It's leaking here.

83
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,240
Everything is drenched.

84
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,160
We have to collect the water here as well.

85
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,639
Quick.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,519
I got this.

87
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,680
Thank you so much.

88
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,079
-We did what was right.
-We did what was right.

89
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,319
We'll be leaving now if it's alright.

90
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,279
-Goodbye.
-Let's go.

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:32,839
Let's go home.

92
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,800
Let's go.

93
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,160
Take care.

[Fangyuan Law Firm]
Okay, thanks.

95
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,680
Have a safe trip home.

96
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,279
Sure.

97
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,480
You're welcome. We can see ourselves out.

98
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,000
Bye.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,240
Do you need transportation?

100
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,240
It's alright.

101
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,680
Okay.

102
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,759
Thanks.

103
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,560
Xingfu.

104
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,959
Thanks.

105
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
Don't thank me,

106
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,680
you should thank them.

107
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,519
Yeah, the villagers

108
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
don't always understand the rules,

109
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,439
but they are kind and honest.

110
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,920
If we

111
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,639
don't help them out,

112
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,079
they are all out of luck in this world.

113
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,079
How much money do we have left?

114
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,879
We've made no money this month.

115
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,079
The money we earned before
are running out as well.

116
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,160
We have around 10,000 yuan left.

117
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,480
My goodness.

118
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,319
Why can't we have

119
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,079
a more decent life?

120
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,639
Listen.

121
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,240
Without Xingfu getting
these smaller cases for us,

122
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:33,720
we'd probably

123
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,319
have gone bankrupt by now.

124
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,160
Dinner time.

125
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,560
Dinner is here.

126
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,639
Dinner is here.

127
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,519
Time for dinner!

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,000
-Okay!
-Coming.

129
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,959
Alright, coming.

130
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,279
Come on, dinner is ready!

131
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,600
Set the work aside, let's eat up.

132
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,160
Xingfu.

133
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,360
How much is one set meal?

134
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,279
It's 40 yuan for each set.

135
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,199
The total is 160 yuan.

136
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,240
I asked for a ten yuan discount.

137
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,560
So, it's 150 yuan.

138
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:00,839
Not bad, right?

139
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,639
The food costs 150 yuan?

140
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,920
He Xingfu!

141
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,839
How can you be so wasteful?

142
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,399
Don't you know what's going on?

143
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,040
We're in a financial crisis here!

144
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,720
We can't afford this kind of expensive meal!

145
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,000
What's gotten into you?

146
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,839
I'm not eating all the food myself.

147
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,399
How could you say that?

148
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,040
I remember someone boasting,

149
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,399
saying he'd leave with an empty hand

150
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,720
but come home a wealthy man.

151
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:22,680
I...

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,399
I...

153
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,639
What's wrong? Did you not make any money?

154
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,079
It's alright.

155
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,639
Spending money is motivational.

156
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,120
When you're full and recharged,

157
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
you can carry on with your work.

158
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,360
Right?

159
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,639
-Yeah.
-Look.

160
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,600
Eat up and drink up.

161
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,439
We're finishing these.

162
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,399
You were keeping a stash?

163
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,680
Trust me, he made a fool

164
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,879
out of himself.

165
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,319
On our way there,

166
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,879
he was so confident,

167
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,040
as if he had closed the deal.

168
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,920
But did you?

169
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,360
Yeah.

170
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,759
You're not any better.

171
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,240
You said you'd come back

172
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,480
loaded with money.

173
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,839
And?

174
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,439
You got nothing but drenched

175
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,360
when you came back.

176
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
You were drenched too.

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,720
Xingfu.

178
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,199
I just noticed it.

179
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,360
No matter how bad of a mess we are,

180
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:08,879
no matter

181
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,319
how much of a failure we've been,

182
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,879
you're always here

183
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
to have our backs.

184
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,480
You bring us food

185
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,839
and drinks.

186
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,879
So,

187
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,199
you're the greatest treasure

188
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,639
of our law firm.

189
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,360
Yes.

190
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,439
It's true.

191
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,399
Really?

192
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,319
Of course.

193
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,560
Then can you consider

194
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,519
ending my probation period?

195
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,759
My friends, what do you say?

196
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,799
It's all in the can.

197
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,639
What's in the can?

198
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,360
Is it a yes or no?

199
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,320
Yes!

200
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,080
And you?

201
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,159
Yes, of course.

202
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Okay! From now on,

203
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,799
He Xingfu

204
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,200
is officially Fangyuan Law Firm's

205
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,120
receptionist.

206
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,559
-Here.
-Cheers.

207
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,080
Cheers.

208
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,600
Cheers.

209
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,320
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

210
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,159
Bye.

211
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,039
Stay safe on the road.

212
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,919
Don't worry. We'll be back before nightfall.

213
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,159
Okay.

214
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,320
The court hearing now begins.

215
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,320
According to

216
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,440
the Civil Procedure Law
of the People's Republic of China,

217
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,679
[Circuit Court of Xiuchuan County People's Court]
Article 134,

218
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,879
Xiuchuan County People's Court,

219
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,559
Fushui Town People's Tribunal,

220
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
have conducted a court session as per the law.

221
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,960
The plaintiff, Yang Baosheng,
and the other 30 citizens,

222
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,039
are pressing charges
against the defendant Meijia Trading Pvt. Ltd.

223
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,799
due to the dispute over their contract.

224
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,960
[Presiding Judge]
The court investigation will now commence.

225
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,120
It should be here.

226
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,679
Seems that nobody's here.

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,559
Yeah.

228
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,600
Nobody's here.

229
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,879
Hello.

230
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,240
Excuse me,

231
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,279
who are you?

232
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,519
Is this

233
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,399
Fangyuan Law Firm?

234
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,000
So,

235
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,559
there's no one here today?

236
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,679
But I'm here.

237
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,879
But you're the janitor.

238
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,720
A janitor is a person too.

239
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,559
Are you looking for someone?

240
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,080
I am also the receptionist.

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,960
You can let me know

242
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,080
if you need anything.

243
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,919
She says she's the receptionist here.

244
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,639
This is Mr. Frank of Ampher Group.

245
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,120
He's here for Mr. Guan, the lawyer.

246
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,159
What was the company again?

247
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,320
Ampher Group.

248
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,000
Ampher Group?

249
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,200
Oh.

250
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,720
I think they mentioned the name.

251
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,639
Mr. Guan went to a village for a lawsuit.

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,919
Mr. Guan is elsewhere.

253
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,320
Well, then. Since Mr. Guan is not here,

254
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,759
maybe we should come back another time.

255
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,799
Mr. Frank says

256
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,440
if Mr. Guan is not here,

257
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,639
he'll come back

258
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,480
another day.

259
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,679
Please!

260
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,039
You're already here anyway.

261
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,440
Please come in.

262
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,320
This is our meeting room.

263
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,879
Okay.

264
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,159
This is great.

265
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,759
We haven't had any foreign clients yet.

266
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,159
You're the first.

267
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
This is quite

268
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,759
an eye-opener for me.

269
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,600
Thanks.

270
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,759
I'll get both of you

271
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,000
some tea.

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,720
Please wait here.

273
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,519
Okay, thanks.

274
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,720
Where did she go?

275
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,080
Hello, Xingfu?

276
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:54,759
So,

277
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,159
how is it going over there?

278
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,080
We are currently negotiating the terms

279
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,559
with the company.

280
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,519
What is it?

281
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,960
The hearing will resume soon.

282
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,480
It's alright.

283
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,480
Get back to your work.

284
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:09,919
I'll talk to you later.

285
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,440
Bye.

286
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,320
He Xingfu,

287
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,399
you'd be doing the firm a disservice

288
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,320
if you lost this client.

289
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,320
My apology

290
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,559
for the long wait.

291
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Enjoy the tea.

292
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,399
When Mr. Guan and his team

293
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,320
won their first lawsuit,

294
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,279
they bought these tea leaves.

295
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,360
They haven't had this tea ever since.

296
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,799
I've never tried it either.

297
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,759
Try it out.

298
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,200
It should taste good.

299
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,639
She says it's a great tea.

300
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,320
She's kept them for a long time.

301
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,639
-Okay.
-Enjoy yourself.

302
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:39,919
Okay.

303
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,480
How many lawyers are working in this firm?

304
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,679
How many lawyers do you have?

305
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,600
Three.

306
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,519
Three.

307
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,279
No,

308
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,120
there are four.

309
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,559
Four.

310
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,360
Are you also

311
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,120
a lawyer?

312
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,480
Are you a lawyer too?

313
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,840
I'm not.

314
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,120
I'm just a receptionist.

315
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,440
I am also the janitor.

316
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,559
But the lawyers and I

317
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,399
work as a team.

318
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,799
I alone

319
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,720
can handle several jobs.

320
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,879
She says she's tough enough

321
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,080
to do a lot of work at the same time.

322
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,960
Do you think

323
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,360
we can entrust

324
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,159
our legal affairs to such a firm?

325
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,320
What did he say?

326
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,000
Nothing.

327
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,679
It's just that...

328
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:27,399
He...

329
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,600
Is it because

330
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,639
our law firm is too small for him?

331
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,960
It's not that.

332
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,519
Please, tell him

333
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,799
that our small firm

334
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,320
is capable of great things.

335
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,600
The God of Wealth is a minor god,

336
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,039
but every family worships the deity.

337
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
What is she saying?

338
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,759
She's from the countryside.

339
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,039
She just kept on telling the local stories.

340
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't understand why this company

341
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,200
asks a peasant woman to welcome us.

342
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,840
Did they hire you to be the receptionist?

343
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,000
No.

344
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,919
I asked for the job myself.

345
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,399
She insisted herself
on being the receptionist here.

346
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,679
Wait, what?

347
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,320
I live in a rural village.

348
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,159
I had some disputes with the villagers,

349
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
so I moved into the city.

350
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,039
So, I started working here.

351
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,919
They pay me

352
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,440
1,500 yuan a month.

353
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
What? Only 1,500 yuan?

354
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,679
That's a very low salary.

355
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,080
Even you agree it's too low.

356
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,879
I think so too.

357
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,080
I've asked for a raise.

358
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,159
She keeps asking them to increase her salary.

359
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,440
So, why are you still working here?

360
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,480
Why do you still work here?

361
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,320
Because they are good people.

362
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,200
They are...

363
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,000
They are...

364
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,639
They treat everyone equally.

365
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,799
They never look down on me

366
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,080
simply because

367
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,399
I came from a rural village.

368
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,639
She says

369
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,879
they are good men with integrity,

370
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,720
that they never look down on her

371
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,679
though she's from the countryside.

372
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,320
And then, I became their receptionist.

373
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,080
They also gave me a raise.

374
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,440
Finally, they end up
increasing her salary for her.

375
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,679
Okay, not bad.

376
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,639
Not bad?

377
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,240
Not bad.

378
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,720
Not bad indeed.

379
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,720
We won the lawsuit.

380
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Ladies and gentlemen!

381
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,759
What you must do now

382
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,279
is to leave your signatures here.

383
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:31,919
Then,

384
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,279
leave your thumbprints

385
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,600
above your names.

386
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,360
-Sure!
-Okay!

387
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,240
One at a time.

388
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,720
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

389
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,399
You're welcome to have dinner at our home.

390
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,519
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

391
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,360
Let's have dinner at my place!

392
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,720
Don't mention it.

393
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,320
You deserve this.

394
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,559
You're welcome at our home.

395
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,159
We really need to thank you.

396
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,879
Hey, Xingfu!

397
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,360
Why are you calling me?

398
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,399
How did it go over there?

399
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,759
The hearing is over.

400
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,600
And?

401
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
And everything ends well.

402
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,279
I told you

403
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,679
I wouldn't leave them behind!

404
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,960
Don't worry,

405
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,399
everyone is satisfied with the result.

406
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,720
They are inviting me to their homes for dinner.

407
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,320
Come to my house.

408
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,080
Forget about the dinner,

409
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,039
come back now!

410
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,480
What is it?

411
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,320
Is it something urgent?

412
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,039
Fra...

413
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,120
It's Frank.

414
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,320
Mr. Frank is here.

415
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,159
Okay.

416
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,150
Mr. Guan. Please stay.

417
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,060
How long has he been there?

418
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,900
What does he need?

419
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,060
He's been here for a while.

420
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,230
We had a chat.

421
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,540
I think they want to work with you.

422
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,350
Just come back now.

423
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,820
I ran out of things to talk about.

424
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,030
Why didn't you say so earlier?

425
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,940
You should have told me sooner.

426
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,820
I was worried...

427
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,350
I didn't want

428
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,300
to distract you from the lawsuit.

429
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,580
Don't be silly.

430
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,180
Look,

431
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,230
use whatever means you have

432
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,940
to keep Frank at our office.

433
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,940
I'll be right back.

434
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,180
Grab our stuff,

435
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,110
we're heading back.

436
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,750
[Circuit Court of Xiuchuan County People's Court]
Mr. Guan, stay!

437
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,700
Another day, perhaps.

438
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,660
-We need to go now.
-Mr. Guan.

439
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,780
Chinese culture

440
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,580
values fateful encounters.

441
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,620
It's a big world.

442
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,430
We meet

443
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,990
and work with each other

444
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,670
because of fate.

445
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,860
I often think

446
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,140
Mr. Guan and his friends
and I are brought together by fate.

447
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,430
Look,

448
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,750
they are all well-educated people

449
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,470
with great degrees.

450
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,430
I didn't even finish middle school.

451
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,430
But how did I meet them?

452
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,950
Why would they let me be on their team?

453
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,750
That must be fate.

454
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,710
Mr. Frank,

455
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,060
you've only met each other once,

456
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,780
but you are willing to come here for them.

457
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,060
And now, we meet.

458
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,990
This must be fate!

459
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,910
She's talking something about fate.

460
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,190
The fate between Mr. Guan and her.

461
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,060
And she asks you

462
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,580
if you think

463
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,140
it's also fate that you've come all the way here

464
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,510
to meet Mr. Guan.

465
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,540
Even though you've just met him once.

466
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,990
What do you mean about fate?

467
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,340
What is fate to you?

468
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,580
Fate is...

469
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,540
It's...

470
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,300
Imagine there was a crowd of people.

471
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,300
When I looked over,

472
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,270
you'd be right there.

473
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,620
It's something like you pick out someone

474
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,670
among a bunch of people
at the first sight of him.

475
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,140
What happened to the other lawyers?
Why are they not back yet?

476
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,620
Why are they not back yet?

477
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,060
They went to a village

478
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,780
to help the villagers with a lawsuit.

479
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,140
It's tough helping out the villagers.

480
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,710
There are all kinds of requests from them.

481
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,060
Most of them don't understand the law.

482
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,030
But Mr. Guan and his friends
still take their requests very seriously.

483
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,910
They can't abandon

484
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,190
the villagers who are in need.

485
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,580
That's why they often go to the villages.

486
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,430
Oh, really?

487
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,510
Is it really possible to make money
by defending peasants in a lawsuit?

488
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,340
Do they make much money

489
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,100
by helping villagers

490
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,030
in lawsuits?

491
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,580
Of course,

492
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,430
it's not a very lucrative job.

493
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,860
That's why we can only afford
this rundown office.

494
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,780
But

495
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,950
just as Mr. Guan once said,

496
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,270
a lawyer

497
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,430
must serve the people with the law.

498
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,380
A lawyer mustn't simply use the law
as a means to make money.

499
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,190
Mr. Guan said

500
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,580
that they'd use the law to serve the people

501
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,380
and they don't just take it as a business.

502
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,380
Okay.

503
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,990
Well, I think he's quite good.

504
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,990
-Okay?
-Yes.

505
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,750
Congratulations.

506
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,140
Guan, what is going on now?

507
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,060
Frank came to visit our firm.

508
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,580
Xingfu has been keeping him there.

509
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,030
Frank came?

510
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,430
Why didn't she tell us sooner?

511
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,030
Use your brilliant brain and think.

512
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,540
I get it now.

513
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,710
Wait,

514
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,300
Xingfu must be so full of herself.

515
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,860
She received Frank on her own
just so we could finish

516
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,030
the lawsuit in the village?

517
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,300
Guan Tao, listen.

518
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,710
If Frank leaves,

519
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,620
fire her immediately.

520
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,580
Enough talking. Just drive.

521
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,270
I can't imagine the mess she's made.

522
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:18,875
[Fangyuan Law Firm]

523
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,510
It seems fine.

524
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,860
Xingfu managed to keep him here.

525
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,950
Are you guys ready?

526
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,140
Sigh.

527
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,380
I told you so.

528
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,190
There is no way he would want

529
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,580
to hire a small firm like ours.

530
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,140
Xingfu,

531
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,580
where's Frank?

532
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,910
He left.

533
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,620
He left?

534
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,860
Didn't you ask him to stay?

535
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,100
I tried,

536
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,060
but he still left.

537
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,670
He insisted on leaving.

538
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,750
I made him a wonderful pot of tea,

539
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,950
and he only took a small sip.

540
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,950
Oh, no.

541
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,710
What's wrong?

542
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,340
Didn't you win the lawsuit?

543
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,230
Forget it.

544
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,860
I stayed up all night,

545
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,950
I'm beat. I need a nap.

546
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,470
Wait.

547
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,620
Who should I hand this to?

548
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,140
Frank left his business card.

549
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,820
He wants you to contact him.

550
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,540
Guan Tao.

551
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,670
Shameless jerks!

552
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,380
Shameless jerks!

553
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,230
Shameless jerks!

554
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:04,910
Those foreigners

555
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,820
should be ashamed of themselves!

556
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,780
He's never been so furious.

557
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,910
Why should we work for them
if they are not paying?

558
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,820
Mr. Han.

559
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,580
They want to terminate the contract.

560
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,150
Fine, so be it.

561
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,430
That is a breach of contract.

562
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,740
They must pay us a year's worth of counsel fees.

563
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,630
Let them terminate the contract.

564
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,500
But Mr. Han,

565
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,740
they have the proof that we instigated them

566
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,340
to bribe the officials.

567
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,580
Fine.

568
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,390
They can show the proof if they want.

569
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,300
Let's see who'll have the last laugh!

570
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,630
Well?

571
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,150
What?

572
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,950
Did you close the deal?

573
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,630
What deal?

574
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,060
Did you come here just for a chat?

575
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,740
Yeah.

576
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,340
Without a proper chat, I wouldn't have gotten this.

577
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,820
What do we have here?

578
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,300
What is this?

579
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,470
It's been signed!

580
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,580
You closed the deal, Guan Tao!

581
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,780
That's 3,000,000 yuan!

582
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,020
Am I dreaming or something?

583
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,500
Pinch me hard.

584
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,390
Alright. Does it hurt?

585
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,300
Yeah.

586
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,630
Should I get a better car?

587
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,100
We'll do just that tomorrow.

588
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,150
Hurry and get in the car.

589
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:15,950
Let's go.

590
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,950
This is surreal.

591
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,950
Pal, that's a three-million-yuan deal!

592
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,150
Fortune

593
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,740
has really favored us.

594
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,710
What's the date today?

595
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,990
Today?

596
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,990
It's the 13th.

597
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,990
That's my lucky number.

598
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,780
Nonsense.

599
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,540
That wasn't what you said on our way here.

600
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
Frank said

601
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,150
he quickly realized that choosing Yidao

602
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,340
was an unforgivable mistake.

603
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,300
So, he went through

604
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,740
the files we left him.

605
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,990
Then, he thought he should visit our office.

606
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,500
Back in the office,

607
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
he enjoyed his chat with Xingfu.

608
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,060
He then had a better understanding

609
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,470
of our law firm.

610
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,630
And today,

611
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,190
after hearing
my proper introduction of the firm,

612
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,150
he decided

613
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,670
to sign this letter of intent.

614
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,020
The official signing of the contract

615
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,990
will happen after we go through the details.

616
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,390
Wait.

617
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,710
I'm curious.

618
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,060
Just what did Frank
and Xingfu talk about the other day?

619
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,390
You want to know?

620
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,870
I'm not telling you.

621
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,990
Frank said

622
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,230
Xingfu told him a lot about Chinese philosophy.

623
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,390
These philosophies

624
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,500
can be extrapolated into business and life.

625
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,820
At the same time,

626
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,950
he was touched

627
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,100
by our stories with Xingfu.

628
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,740
He believes

629
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,260
that a law firm that serves
the farmers loyally and honestly

630
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,060
without prioritizing profit

631
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,020
must be a great law firm

632
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,190
that will defend all its clients properly.

633
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,710
Well said.

634
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,710
But he suggested

635
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,190
that we should move the office elsewhere.

636
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,670
It's best to be a place that matches

637
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,820
the status of their company.

638
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,780
At the same time,

639
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,150
he wants us to give Xingfu a desk

640
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,060
in our new office.

641
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,190
I thought it was something serious.

642
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,230
We will give her a desk.

643
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,340
After all, she is the mascot of our firm.

644
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,060
Right?

645
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,990
There's something I should discuss with you.

646
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
Technically,

647
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,910
we managed to close this massive deal

648
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,580
because of Xingfu's contribution. Right?

649
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,100
Right.

650
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,390
What I mean is,

651
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,430
to make it fair,

652
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,500
shouldn't we give her

653
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,430
a proper reward?

654
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,580
Of course.

655
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,100
Look, you could give her

656
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,100
20,000 yuan.

657
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,190
Wait.

658
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,910
According to our normal ratio,

659
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,630
we should be giving her

660
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,820
two to three percent of the deal.

661
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,430
That's about 60,000 to 90,000 yuan.

662
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,540
Given her contribution,

663
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,260
she deserves the 90,000 yuan.

664
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,300
But...

665
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,230
90,000 yuan?

666
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,340
We should give her a reward.

667
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,910
But for a receptionist,

668
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,630
that's quite a big cut.

669
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,060
I agree.

670
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,670
Look,

671
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,990
we need to move the office and renovate.

672
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,150
We need to hire workers.

673
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,670
We must be mindful of our expenditures.

674
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,580
Well...

675
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,300
How about 60,000 yuan?

676
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,780
I think 50,000 yuan is a lot.

677
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,530
I think...

678
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,100
You're right.

679
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,010
I think...

680
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,860
Maybe we could give her nothing.

681
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,290
She doesn't know about the commission anyway.

682
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,340
But here's a piece of advice.

683
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,010
As human beings,

684
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,290
our conscience matters.

685
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,940
If you can live with the guilt,

686
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,100
so be it.

687
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,580
Guan Tao,

688
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,180
you made fun of us

689
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,660
with your little advice.

690
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:24,860
You win.

691
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,050
Just give her the reward.

692
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,860
We're back.

693
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,340
Mr. Guan.

694
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,860
Mr. Guan.

695
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,820
I saw the civil activity mentioning

696
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,450
the principle of integrity.

697
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,490
What does it mean?

698
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,050
And there is also...

699
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,860
Public policy doctrine.

700
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,420
Why do you ask?

701
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,380
I came across these terms.

702
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,050
Could you explain them to me?

703
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,690
What are the odds?

704
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,180
In a civil activity,

705
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,340
the principle of integrity

706
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,010
means that when people do business with others,

707
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,580
when they borrow from others,
or when they repay the debts and etc.,

708
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,730
the transactions

709
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,250
must be done with honesty

710
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,250
and integrity.

711
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,380
Well said.

712
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:16,970
What's wrong?

713
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,690
Nothing, we're talking about something else.

714
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,620
What's the other term?

715
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,970
Public policy doctrine.

716
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,940
Public policy doctrine

717
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,820
means

718
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,690
the principles and customs

719
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,250
everyone in society works together to uphold.

720
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,140
In other words,

721
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,660
morality is important,

722
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,580
so is our conscience.

723
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:36,970
Right?

724
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,490
Stop staring at us.

725
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,100
Well...

726
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,380
We both get it.

727
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,970
You're the boss here after all.

728
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,290
Thank you for your understanding.

729
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,900
And we have good news.

730
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,530
Frank has signed

731
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,420
a letter of intent

732
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,620
with us.

733
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,730
Yes!

734
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,580
He signed it?

735
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,940
I knew he'd choose us.

736
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,820
Does it mean we're going to be rich?

737
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:01,770
Yes!

738
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,340
Now that we're rich,

739
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,340
we won't have to

740
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,340
be worried about our survival.

741
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,490
Does it mean we can serve

742
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,050
the commoners even better now?

743
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,050
Yeah.

744
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,420
Having money is great.

745
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,490
Xingfu.

746
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,530
We managed to close the deal

747
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,210
because of your contribution.

748
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,770
Yeah.

749
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,050
I welcomed him into our office.

750
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,140
Guan Tao, you should give me a bonus.

751
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,820
Sure, of course.

752
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:32,970
How much do you want?

753
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,940
Don't call me greedy,

754
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,210
but I only want to make more money

755
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,210
to send my kid to a school in the city.

756
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,380
I want 2,000 yuan.

757
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,660
Is it too much?

758
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,420
Don't stare at me like that.

759
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,690
How about one thousand?

760
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,180
Xingfu,

761
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,530
I don't think

762
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,620
you'll get too big of a bonus

763
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,210
for this case.

764
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,420
But

765
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,620
we are going

766
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,860
to give you a commission.

767
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,970
Commission?

768
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
But Xingyun told me

769
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,900
only a lawyer would get a commission.

770
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,340
Does a receptionist get that too?

771
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,660
It's a different matter.

772
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,290
According to Frank,

773
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,580
you contributed a lot

774
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,450
to this case.

775
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,340
Based on our rules here,

776
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,180
whoever

777
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,860
gets us a case

778
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,140
will get two to three percent

779
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,660
of the total amount as commission.

780
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,490
That is...

781
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,100
60,000 yuan

782
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,690
to 90,000 yuan.

783
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,290
We are going to give you

784
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,940
three percent.

785
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,340
That is 90,000 yuan.

786
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,290
And based on your request,

787
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,420
we're giving you a 500-yuan raise

788
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,380
for your monthly salary.

789
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,210
Is that okay?

790
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,450
Okay!

791
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,530
That is so nice of you!

792
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,250
Yes!

793
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,620
Of course!

794
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,290
I'll take two percent for now.

795
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,690
We just started making money.

796
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,180
Let's not overspend.

797
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,820
For me, 60,000 yuan

798
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,530
is an amount

799
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,340
I can't even dream of having.

800
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,860
I won't ask for too much.

801
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,250
Comrade He Xingfu,

802
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,100
Guan Tao was right about you?

803
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,450
Take the full amount.

804
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,450
You have to.

805
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,290
Right?

806
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,180
What?

807
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,100
What did he mean?

808
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,290
What do you mean?

809
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,860
I don't get what you said.

810
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,180
Get back to work.

811
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,050
60,000 yuan.

812
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,010
Thank you! Thank you so much!

813
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,770
Not 60,000 yuan,

814
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,530
it's 90,000 yuan!

815
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,250
Thanks!

816
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:55,730
Oh, my.

817
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,580
Dear,

818
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,450
I'm back.

819
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,340
What is this all about?

820
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,490
Did you find a stash of money?

821
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,970
Not even a hidden stash has this much money.

822
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,450
What is this all about, then?

823
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,050
Wash your hands, I'll explain later.

824
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,820
Great news!

825
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,580
I just made 90,000 yuan today.

826
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,660
And not only that,

827
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,210
I just got a 500-yuan raise

828
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,290
to my monthly salary.

829
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,050
Cheers.

830
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,100
Are you joking?

831
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,290
That's not possible.

832
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,820
I wasn't sure about it either.

833
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,210
It's what I told you a few days ago,

834
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,420
the foreigner came to our office

835
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,250
and we talked for the whole afternoon.

836
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,580
And today, he signed a contract with Guan Tao.

837
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,010
Guan Tao and the others

838
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,180
thought I had contributed to this deal.

839
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,050
According to the rules,

840
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,580
I'd get three percent as commission.

841
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:16,970
That's 90,000 yuan.

842
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,180
That actually happened?

843
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,940
So you talked to the foreigner

844
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,380
for one afternoon

845
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,340
and made more money

846
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,900
than two years' worth of our salaries?

847
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,140
Yeah.

848
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,450
That's the rule there.

849
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,380
If you could close a deal every month,

850
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,900
we wouldn't have to work anymore.

851
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,140
You're the receptionist.

852
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,290
People would all be received

853
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,050
by you first.

854
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,650
Don't be silly.

855
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,990
No one gets so lucky every time.

856
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,630
For me,

857
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,540
this is probably the luckiest day of my life.

858
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,910
Besides,

859
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,990
he works with Guan Tao,

860
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,020
not me.

861
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,430
Honestly,

862
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,780
in hindsight,

863
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,500
I find it quite terrifying.

864
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,100
What if I said something wrong that day

865
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,820
and ruined the deal?

866
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,260
I'd be in deep trouble.

867
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,670
Guan Tao and the others are being generous.

868
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,150
They think I deserve the credit.

869
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,190
So they gave me a reward.

870
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,230
Yeah.

871
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,470
They didn't have to give you the money.

872
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,020
So why did they?

873
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,820
It's about integrity

874
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,710
and upholding rules.

875
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
Give me a break.

876
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,100
After all your time in the city,

877
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,780
have you seen anyone honest
and playing by the rules?

878
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,780
Guan Tao and the others do.

879
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,910
What if they want something else?

880
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,740
I don't think they'd be so kind.

881
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,390
They gave away money for no good reason.

882
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,150
They must be crazy.

883
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,260
You're the crazy one.

884
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,340
What now?

885
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,230
Are you not happy that I made money?

886
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,910
It's not that.

887
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,020
How about this?

888
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,740
Tomorrow, I'll tell them

889
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,470
I'm not taking the money.

890
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,060
I haven't gotten the money yet anyway.

891
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,580
That won't be necessary.

892
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,060
I was just saying.

893
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,820
I just find it

894
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,870
too weird.

895
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,180
Watch your back.

896
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,830
Don't be so petty.

897
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,310
Don't worry.

898
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,990
Your wife here is a smart one.

899
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,580
I just don't want you to get scammed.

900
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:23,990
Xingfu.

901
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,470
Now that you've made so much money

902
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,660
and we got 50,000 yuan compensation
from the land acquisition,

903
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,750
and our dispute with Mr. Wan is over,

904
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,220
maybe

905
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,390
we should go home

906
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,350
and work in our greenhouse.

907
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,830
Look at this place.

908
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,870
It's not as cozy as our home.

909
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,660
Right?

910
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
When we go back,

911
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,660
we can take better care

912
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,020
of Mom and Dad, and Little Dou.

913
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,420
What do you think?

914
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,270
I was talking to you.

915
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,020
Why didn't you say anything?

916
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,470
What you said made perfect sense.

917
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,390
When I first came here,

918
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,790
I wanted to go home so badly.

919
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,430
I missed our kid.

920
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,350
But now,

921
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,990
I have some new ideas,

922
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,660
and I

923
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,750
want to discuss them with you.

924
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,100
What do you have in mind?

925
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,430
We spent a long time

926
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,540
living in the village.

927
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,350
We only came to the city to run some errands.

928
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,140
We never had the chance

929
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,390
to experience city life.

930
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,020
But I feel like

931
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,830
the city is giving me

932
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,270
a different vibe.

933
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,750
Life may be tough now,

934
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,830
and it's tiring,

935
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,660
but I have this feeling

936
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,500
that things will get better.

937
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,870
It gives me the drive to work harder

938
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,500
and make changes.

939
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,140
The city has endless possibilities

940
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,060
waiting for us.

941
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,660
Today,

942
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,350
I made 90,000 yuan in a blink of an eye.

943
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,870
That means the future

944
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,350
holds even more opportunities.

945
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,540
With the two of us working together,

946
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,750
our family will have much better prospects.

947
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,540
In the future,

948
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,790
even we can afford

949
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
a house in the city

950
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,470
like Qingzhi.

951
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,660
We can send our kid to a school in the city.

952
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,270
We can take our parents here

953
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,220
for retirement.

954
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,830
You're...

955
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,180
This is a little

956
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,830
too hopeful.

957
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,350
Why shouldn't we have hope?

958
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,140
When I worked

959
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,310
at the early learning center,

960
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,910
all the kids

961
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,620
were already learning

962
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,660
at such a young age.

963
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,430
They were already being educated.

964
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,910
I want

965
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,540
Little Dou to be just like them.

966
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,830
But that is already too late

967
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,020
for Little Dou.

968
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,870
But with enough hard work,

969
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,870
we can make more money.

970
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,060
In a few years,

971
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,700
we might be able

972
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,470
to send him to daycare here.

973
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,990
Wouldn't that be nice?

974
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,390
It is nice.

975
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,100
But it's not as easy as you think.

976
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,470
Nothing is ever easy.

977
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,500
It takes hard work and determination.

978
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,140
Look at Guan Tao and his friends.

979
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,020
They sure are

980
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,020
the lucky ones.

981
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,620
It's because they work hard and never give up.

982
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,390
And they are kind too.

983
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,470
Otherwise,

984
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,060
they wouldn't have gotten the deal

985
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,310
and made so much money.

986
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,180
So,

987
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,100
we should also work hard

988
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,790
and never give up.

989
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,140
But I feel like...

990
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,750
I can't do anything right in this city.

991
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,830
When I was in the village,

992
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,990
I could do anything.

993
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,660
I went down to the field

994
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,870
and I was filled with strength.

995
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,830
It felt much better than living here.

996
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,910
I can understand how it feels.

997
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,470
But don't you think

998
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,470
there are things

999
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,990
we just can't have in the village?

1000
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:13,990
Don't you

1001
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,870
want to be like the city folks?

1002
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,310
Our home is always there.

1003
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,020
It's not going anywhere.

1004
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,310
And we both have jobs.

1005
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,140
We're already here,

1006
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,950
there's nothing to fear.

1007
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,790
Do it for Little Dou

1008
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,790
and fight one last time.

1009
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,270
We might actually find success.

1010
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,270
We've seen

1011
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,140
on the TV

1012
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:37,790
that people

1013
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,620
from the villages find success in cities.

1014
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,990
They could do it.

1015
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,060
Why can't we?

1016
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,990
You're...

1017
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,950
You're daydreaming.

1018
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,020
What's wrong with that?

1019
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,990
There is this saying.

1020
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,950
"Never stop dreaming,

1021
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,950
it might come true someday."

1022
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,270
Lady,

1023
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,220
you've gotten

1024
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,100
too ambitious

1025
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,220
after coming here.

1026
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,350
Mom was right.

1027
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,700
What did she say?

1028
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,220
Nothing.

1029
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,390
You just said it.

1030
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,470
What did she say about me?

1031
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,390
Nothing.

1032
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,470
Go to bed.

1033
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,750
Let's call it a day.

1034
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,430
Xiaoshan.

1035
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,790
How much is the price

1036
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,750
for each square meter
of the apartment opposite us?

1037
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,140
That?

1038
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,180
For normal households,

1039
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,350
that's around 38,000 yuan.

1040
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,700
Over 40,000 yuan for better units.

1041
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,950
That's insane!

1042
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,990
It's the location of the apartments.

1043
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,990
It's in the center of the city.

1044
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,540
However,

1045
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,580
I've done my homework.

1046
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,100
I am never

1047
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,990
buying an apartment here.

1048
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,180
Fengjing Residence

1049
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:44,910
is only

1050
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,790
eight stops away from here.

1051
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,990
It's only 12,000 per square meter there.

1052
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,870
Why not buy an apartment there then?

1053
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,990
I can't afford it.

1054
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,430
But you speak

1055
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,950
as if you know everything.

1056
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,750
I'm not bluffing, Qinglai.

1057
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,790
The whole real estate market

1058
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,910
of the city,

1059
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,870
the price and the locations,

1060
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,500
and the new projects

1061
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,580
are all in my memory.

1062
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,430
You're not buying.

1063
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,220
Why bother researching?

1064
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,910
What if I get rich someday?

1065
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,180
See?

1066
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,390
One bet, five numbers.

1067
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,830
The jackpot is 20 million.

1068
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,750
You're just like my wife.

1069
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,990
You both love daydreaming.

1070
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,750
Your wife let you waste your money

1071
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,950
on gambling?

1072
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,430
Why would she care?

1073
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,180
I work long hours every day for my family.

1074
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,220
Why would she care

1075
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,310
if I bought lotteries?

1076
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,580
Your wife doesn't have a job?

1077
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,020
I wouldn't let her get one.

1078
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,270
Our duties are clear.

1079
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,790
I make money and provide a livelihood.

1080
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,180
Her job is to stay pretty

1081
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,310
and do the chores.

1082
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,500
I can't work all day

1083
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,100
just to go home

1084
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,310
for more chores.

1085
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,060
Here are my two cents.

1086
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,390
The city is a complicated place.

1087
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,540
When a woman gets a job,

1088
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,060
she makes money and gets delusional.

1089
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,310
There are too many risk factors.

1090
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,060
All the rich city folks

1091
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,270
are divorced because of this.

1092
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,910
You're exaggerating.

1093
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,950
The flaws of humans

1094
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,660
are complex and plentiful.

1095
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,580
Everyone has flaws.

1096
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,700
Alright.

1097
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,750
Let me stop you right there.

1098
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,870
But Qinglai,

1099
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,060
you're different.

1100
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,540
You came

1101
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,790
from a much better background

1102
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,750
than our captain.

1103
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,660
His brother-in-law

1104
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,870
is a logistic head.

1105
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,470
Your in-law is a director
of the Organization Department!

1106
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,580
It'd be great if you were our captain.

1107
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,430
Your salary would be doubled.

1108
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,390
Is the captain's salary

1109
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,390
that much higher than ours?

1110
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,660
Of course.

1111
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,470
The salary matches the title.

1112
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,660
Captain.

1113
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,180
Song Xiaoshan.

1114
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,390
Wang Qinglai.

1115
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,830
You behaved like thugs

1116
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,950
during the working hour.

1117
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,580
What were you talking about?

1118
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,470
There was nothing going on here.

1119
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,180
It's just small talk.

1120
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,830
What's wrong?

1121
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:56,950
What's wrong?

1122
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,950
You must never slack off!

1123
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,390
You are paid

1124
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,540
to do your job,

1125
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,580
not for small talk.

1126
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,700
Find some work to do,

1127
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,620
or get lost!

1128
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,790
How dare you

1129
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,950
talk back at me!

1130
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,990
What's the big deal?

1131
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,270
You're just a low-rank captain!

1132
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,180
That's who he is.

1133
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,540
He's the same kind of lapdog

1134
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,470
in his in-law's house.

1135
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,470
He's a barking

1136
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,580
lapdog.

1137
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,060
Qinglai.

1138
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,580
Your uncle

1139
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,700
should take better care of you.

1140
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:37,310
He never responded to your greeting.

1141
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,750
If your uncle talks to you in front of

1142
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,220
our department head,

1143
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,700
not just the captain,

1144
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,750
even our department head
will treat you with respect.

1145
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,350
My uncle is not that kind of person.

1146
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,140
He's a righteous man

1147
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,100
to the public.

1148
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,910
But in private, he treats us well.

1149
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,990
As if that's going to do any good.
