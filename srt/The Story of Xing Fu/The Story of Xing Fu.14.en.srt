00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,950
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,920
Haven't you finished your work?

4
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,120
Yeah.

5
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,599
Mr. Han just tossed me

6
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,159
a bunch of cases.

7
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,040
Did you hear from Officer Li?

8
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,799
No.

9
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,200
What about

10
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,239
your case?

11
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,480
It's done.

12
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,879
Congratulations.

13
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,480
Thanks.

14
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,000
It's way past dinner time.

15
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,439
Carry on after the meal.

16
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,479
I'll treat you to dinner.

17
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
I want to know

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,280
what happened to your sister.

19
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:14,840
Sure.

20
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,919
Senior, wait here.

21
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,759
Hello?

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,240
Hello, Officer Li.

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,199
This is Guan Tao.

24
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,439
Mr. Guan.

25
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,199
Hello.

26
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,159
We interrogated Wan Chuanjia
and took his statement.

27
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,520
Wan Chuanjia insisted

28
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,800
that he was drunk on the day of the incident.

29
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:47,879
He remembers nothing.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,479
We also found out

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,319
who were with him

32
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,000
that day.

33
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,000
Those youngsters

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
all claimed they were drunk.

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
They remember nothing.

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,120
What about other witnesses?

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,120
There were so many people at the wedding.

38
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,960
I asked around.

39
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,000
They all said they saw nothing

40
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,879
and don't know anything.

41
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,400
There were so many of them.

42
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,039
How could no one see anything?

43
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,400
The young people

44
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,000
were all inside the house

45
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,199
on that day.

46
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,560
Chuanjia was hit on the head

47
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,520
and ran outside.

48
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,919
Only then did the people at the wedding realize

49
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,080
something had happened.

50
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,560
As for what actually happened,

51
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,280
there are only rumors and gossip.

52
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,000
There are all kinds of stories.

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,319
I don't think

54
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,120
rumors can be used

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,360
as valid evidence.

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,000
There were people.

57
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,000
We will find

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,759
the evidence.

59
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:35,879
Mr. Guan.

60
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,479
The case

61
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
is a special one.

62
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,319
But don't worry.

63
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,800
We will do our best to investigate.

64
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,120
We will find the evidence.

65
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,039
Yes, I'll leave that to you.

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,039
Thanks.

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
I need to answer this.

68
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,480
Hello?

69
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,160
Mr. Guan?

70
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,519
Xingfu,

71
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,720
the thing is,

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,879
Xingyun's case ran into some issues

73
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,920
with evidence gathering.

74
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,439
You and your family

75
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,319
are her relatives.

76
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,079
Your statements can't be used
as the sole evidence

77
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:32,920
by the court.

78
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,800
So, we need you

79
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,480
to search for other evidence.

80
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,160
Mr. Guan, what counts

81
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,319
as valid evidence?

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,879
For example,

83
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,199
the statement of an eyewitness

84
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,639
who attended the wedding.

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,759
Or perhaps someone took some photos.

86
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,759
These are what we need.

87
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:50,759
Okay.

88
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,519
Alright.

89
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,720
Let me know when you find something.

90
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,240
Goodbye.

91
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,120
Who was it?

92
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,160
It was Mr. Guan.

93
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,040
He told me my sister's case

94
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,560
needed evidence.

95
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Did you say yes?

96
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
It's useless.

97
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,199
Who would be your witness?

98
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
The villagers

99
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,439
don't want any trouble.

100
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,439
Besides, Mr. Wan and Chuanjia are involved.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,240
No one would be your witness.

102
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,759
Xingfu, talk to your sister.

103
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,639
It's enough.

104
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,079
This isn't something to be proud of.

105
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,079
If everyone knows about this,

106
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,639
she's the one getting embarrassed.

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,639
-Thanks.
-Enjoy your food.

108
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,120
Thanks.

109
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,839
Xingyun.

110
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,120
You need to be mentally prepared

111
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,439
for a case such as this.

112
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,120
The result

113
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,000
might not always be satisfying.

114
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,759
I know.

115
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,800
I think

116
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,680
suing them is more like
demanding an explanation.

117
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,079
I want an explanation for myself.

118
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,600
It's nearly impossible

119
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,360
to have them punished.

120
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,959
Everyone lives in Wan Village.

121
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,480
No one would be my witness.

122
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,439
Do you regret filing a police report?

123
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,759
Not at all.

124
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,680
That's right.

125
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,319
If we don't stand out and speak up,

126
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,360
what is the point

127
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,240
of being a lawyer?

128
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,720
The bad guys and their evil

129
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,800
will only get bold

130
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,720
and ruthless.

131
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,759
They will have no fear.

132
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,319
But is this really going to make a difference?

133
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,600
I'll be honest with you.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,639
I don't even

135
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,040
hate Wan Chuanjia anymore.

136
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,959
After I began working,

137
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,360
I've met too many people

138
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,519
like him.

139
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Take Mr. Han for an example.

140
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,839
He didn't show me the slightest respect

141
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,759
and often mocked me.

142
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
But he's not as aggressive as Chuanjia.

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,319
So...

144
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,199
There is nothing I can do about it.

145
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,160
An educated thug

146
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,160
is indeed

147
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
more hard to deal with.

148
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,680
That makes

149
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,000
our revolt even more meaningful.

150
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,120
We can't let these terrible people

151
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,639
take over the wonderful world.

152
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,160
I'm afraid only

153
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,399
someone as carefree as you

154
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,720
would think that way.

155
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,399
From what I heard,

156
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,480
your father is very wealthy.

157
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,399
You could have enjoyed a high life

158
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,199
without even getting a job.

159
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,680
I know what they say about me.

160
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,759
I don't even bother explaining.

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,680
Perhaps it's because

162
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,720
my methods

163
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,600
are too unusual in their eyes.

164
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,279
How so?

165
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,399
I don't make money.

166
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,519
I lose out on many things.

167
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,839
I got quite a number of cases,

168
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,160
but I took the blame just as many times.

169
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,160
I'm clearly not very smart.

170
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,160
Compared to Han,

171
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,279
you're indeed a fool.

172
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,199
Hello?

173
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:05,920
Qingzhi?

174
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,600
I thought you were

175
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
on a business trip with your boss.

176
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,720
Are you back already?

177
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,560
I just came back.

178
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:12,920
Qinglai,

179
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,839
is everything alright?

180
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,920
How are Mom and Dad?

181
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,399
Everything is alright.

182
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,079
Qinglai.

183
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,839
Tell them

184
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:20,879
I'm bringing

185
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,639
my girlfriend home this weekend.

186
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,240
What?

187
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,600
Really?

188
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,319
Qingzhi says

189
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,000
he's bringing her girlfriend home this weekend.

190
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,920
Really?

191
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,039
Great.

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,679
Okay.

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,879
Mom and Dad got it.

194
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,639
Don't worry about it.

195
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,080
Leave early.

196
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,799
Safe trip.

197
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,960
Alright, talk to you later.

198
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,320
It seems

199
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,720
Qingzhi is really marrying

200
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,519
the city girl.

201
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,679
We should get prepared.

202
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,440
Yes.

203
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,320
We should clean the house.

204
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,799
We'll clear out a room for her.

205
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,320
We must give her a proper welcome.

206
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,960
Otherwise, the city girl

207
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,720
might think we are rude.

208
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,679
You're so great at knitting.

209
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,679
Why do I keep messing up the stitches?

210
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
You've knitted for years.

211
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,200
She's right.

212
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,200
Madam.

213
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,000
The sweater

214
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,480
looks great.

215
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,600
Xingfu.

216
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,720
Are you...

217
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Is the child coming?

218
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,879
Yes.

219
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,840
It's next month.

220
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,960
I want to knit a sweater for my child.

221
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,000
I should learn from you.

222
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,360
Sure.

223
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,799
I can't knit.

224
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,799
I will be sure

225
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,840
to teach you all I know.

226
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,360
Thanks.

227
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,840
Is this the sleeve?

228
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,399
Yes, it is.

229
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,519
It's done.

230
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,159
Madam, I'm curious.

231
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,679
Some people were doing wedding hazing

232
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,399
when Qinglai and I got married,

233
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,399
did you hear anything?

234
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,600
We didn't notice.

235
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,320
Well...

236
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,559
Back then,

237
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,039
I sat too far away.

238
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,759
I didn't hear a sound.

239
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Chuanjia pushed my sister into the house.

240
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,120
Did you see anything?

241
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,240
Madam,

242
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,480
it's getting late.

243
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,559
I must prepare dinner.

244
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,120
See you.

245
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,559
Okay.

246
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,000
I must go home too.

247
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:06,879
Xingfu.

248
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,120
I must get going.

249
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,600
Sure.

250
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,480
(Fellow villagers...)

Madam.

Is Gang home?

263
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,960
What do you need?

264
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,399
I need to ask him about something.

265
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,159
I know you've been asking around

266

to find a witness for your sister.

267
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,360
Gang was there the whole time.

268
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,919
He knows how the wedding went.

269
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,799
I just want to ask him about it.

270
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,159
You want Gang to be your witness

271

How am I vile?

274
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,759
I just want to know what happened.

275
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,879
People were only having fun the other day.

276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
Why take it so seriously?

277
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,200
And you want Gang to be your witness?

278
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,320
What if you got Gang

279
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,360
into trouble?

280
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,200
I can't believe you.

281
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
It was just bad luck

282
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,759
to have gone to your wedding.

283
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,039
We've been

284
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,200
paying attention to the matter.

285
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,759
And?

286
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,480
The woman

287
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,519
asks anyone she sees.

288
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,039
However,

289
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,039
everyone brushes her off.

290
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:58,960
I don't think

291
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,080
she is

292
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,039
making any progress.

293
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,639
No one in Wan Village

294
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,159
is willing to help her.

295
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,120
But still,

296
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,799
do not take it lightly.

297
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,440
If she digs up any dirt on us,

298
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,080
you'll be lucky to be jailed

299
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,879
for a few years.

300
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,559
Tell your buddies

301
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,279
to keep their mouths shut.

302
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,679
Don't worry about it.

303
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,799
Those fools

304
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,759
won't say anything.

305
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,559
There is no way

306
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,000
that woman

307
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,000
can stand against the whole village.

308
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,320
We used to play here when we were little kids.

309
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,840
The water here feels great.

310

313
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,919
Slow down, Xingfu.

314
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,519
She must be your girlfriend.

315
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,879
This is Yani.

316
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,559
Yani, she is my sister-in-law.

317
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,480
Nice to meet you.

318
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,080
I am Yani.

319
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
It's a pleasure to meet you.

320
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,600
I've heard a lot about you.

321
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,279
Qingzhi.

322
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,360
You brought a girlfriend home.

323
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,480
She's beautiful.

324
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,159
I can't wait to attend your wedding.

325
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,279
Thanks.

326
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,559
A lot about me?

327
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,919
Don't listen to Qingzhi.

328
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,159
Come on, everyone is waiting for you.

329
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,919
Okay.

330
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,039
Xingfu, I was on a business trip.

331
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,960
And then,

332
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,440
there was the lawsuit.

333
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,559
I didn't help out.

334
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,519
After I came back,

335
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,559
I thought I should help out here.

336
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,399
Yani insisted on tagging along.

337
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,639
I'm glad you're home.

338
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,639
This is great.

339
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,960
Everyone is happy for you.

340
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,120
Dad! Mom!

341
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,200
Qingzhi is back!

342
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,320
You're back.

343
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,960
Mom, Dad, Qinglai.

344
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,039
Let me introduce her to you.

345
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,240
She is Xu Yani.

346
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,879
We went

347
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,000
to the same college.

348
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,879
She is now my girlfriend.

349
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,360
Yani,

350
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,559
this is my mom.

351
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,960
That's my dad.

352
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,600
Hello.

353
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,720
This is my older brother.

354
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,799
Next to him is my younger sister.

355
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,240
It's nice to meet you.

356
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
You know Xingfu.

357
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,399
Nice to meet you.

358
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,919
I hope we get along well.

359
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,960
I bought everyone some clothes

360
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,879
and tonics.

361
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,320
I hope you like them.

362
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,360
How nice of you.

363
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,559
There is no need for gifts.

364
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,399
Mom, Yani took a long time picking the presents.

365
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,679
She'd been looking online for the right gifts.

366
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,840
She was worried you might not like them.

367
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
If the sizes don't fit,

368
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,440
there is a free refund policy.

369
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,120
-It's very convenient.
-Yes.

370
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,679
You can have a refund if the clothes don't fit.

371
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,679
We love your gifts.

372
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,120
We love everything you brought us.

373
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,000
Hey, look.

374
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,159
She is gorgeous.

375
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,960
She looks even better in person.

376
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:09,399
Alright, Mom.

377
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,559
Let's talk inside.

378
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,120
Right.

379
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,480
Come inside.

380
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:12,960
I can carry them.

381
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,039
Thanks, Qinglai.

382
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,440
Xiuyu, bring us some water.

383
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,399
What do you think?

384
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,480
Great.

385
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,679
This is wonderful.

386
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,200
Come on, take a seat.

387
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,000
Take a seat.

388
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,279
You look silly in this photo.

389
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,519
It's an old photo.

390
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,399
Your bag.

391
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:33,440
Alright.

392
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,440
Take a break.

393
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,159
I'll get dinner ready.

394
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,200
Let me help out.

395
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,039
Are you...

396
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,399
I want to have some fun.

397
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,320
Xingfu, let her help out.

398
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,639
Alright, let's go.

399
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,039
This is our kitchen.

400
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,799
Is there anything I can do?

401
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,799
Yani.

402
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,399
How did you meet Qingzhi?

403
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,519
We were both in the hiking club.

404
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,679
I see.

405
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,600
Hiking club.

406
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,360
Great.

407
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,440
Come here more often.

408
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,840
We don't have much here,

409
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,799
but we have mountains.

410
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,519
Feel free to visit them.

411
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,399
I see them.

412
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,840
The mountains are beautiful.

413
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,240
Qingzhi.

414
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,519
Tell me.

415
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,320
What does her father do

416
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,519
for a living?

417
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,240
Yani's father

418
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,080
is the director of the city's

419
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,159
organization department.

420
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,159
A director?

421
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,639
What rank is that?

422
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,120
In terms of rank,

423
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,039
he's at the division-head level.

424
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,200
He's more or less

425
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,559
the head of the county.

426
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,399
The county governor.

427
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,480
Qingzhi.

428
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,840
You're marrying the governor's daughter!

429
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,919
I knew it.

430
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,039
Qingzhi,

431
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,159
well done.

432
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,799
You've finally made us proud.

433
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,200
In that case,

434
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,799
I must say

435
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:52,879
that she's a good match for you.

436
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,639
Dad, Mom,

437
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,399
in the city,

438
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,360
there are plenty

439
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,559
of directors.

440
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,799
He's still the head of the county.

441
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,399
Qingzhi.

442
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,200
Tell me.

443
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,120
You got a job in the government

444
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,240
after you got your master's degree.

445
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,360
Was it because

446
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,200
her father pulled some strings?

447
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,399
Not at all.

448
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,320
I got in on my own.

449
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,440
Besides,

450
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,519
Yani and I are not married.

451
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:17,639
Asking her father

452
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,759
to get me a job

453
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,960
doesn't seem right.

454
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,620
Yes, well said.

455
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,260
Find success with your own strength.

456
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,570
Xingfu.

457
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,530
Could you tell me

458
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,740
about the wedding hazing?

459
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,890
From what I heard,

460
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,500
you sued the secretary's son.

461
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,460
What is there to talk about?

462
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,860
It's not anything joyous.

463
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,220
I wanted to write an article

464
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,410
and interview Xingyun.

465
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,460
But Qingzhi

466
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,220
wouldn't let me do the interview.

467
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,460
He was right.

468
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,890
The villagers couldn't wait

469
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,620
to bury the matter whole.

470
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,410
Why would they bury it?

471
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,020
If words got out,

472
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,930
my sister would never get a husband.

473
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,620
If anyone finds her a suitor,

474
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,020
the man must find it embarrassing.

475
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,020
But it's the modern day!

476
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,570
That mentality should be obsolete.

477
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,690
It's like women were tainted

478
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,740
once men touched them.

479
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:04,090
People have this thought

480
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,130
because their conscience is tainted.

481
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,130
Who cares about them?

482
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,980
You are right.

483
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,500
Xingfu,

484
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,090
I want to invite you and your sister

485
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:12,900
to my show

486
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,050
and tell us what you experienced.

487
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,460
We should criticize

488
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,530
the vulgar tradition

489
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,610
and the feudalistic mindset.

490
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,530
I can't do that.

491
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,130
I mustn't do that.

492
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,770
Why not?

493
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,180
Qingzhi told me

494
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,770
you were

495
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,130
brave enough to hit the son

496
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,330
on the head with a bench.

497
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,460
And then

498
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,370
you defended your sister's honor.

499
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,460
The secretary even set a rule

500
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,850
that bans wedding hazing.

501
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,660
You are amazing.

502
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,610
If you ask me,

503
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,260
you're the pioneer who will eliminate

504
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,610
the vulgar traditions and promote

505
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,500
intellectual development!

506
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,130
I'm no pioneer.

507
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,090
Stop poking fun at me.

508
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,020
I didn't care much.

509
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,810
I only wanted to protect my sister.

510
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,850
That's right.

511
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,500
Your honest intention

512
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,770
is what reminds people

513
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,260
that developing the villages

514
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,050
is not just about improving

515
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,220
the life quality,

516
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,260
but we must improve

517
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,290
intellectual development.

518
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,050
Therefore,

519
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,980
I came

520
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,740
to visit Qingzhi's family

521
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,700
and to

522
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,090
interview you two.

523
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,050
I'm hoping you can

524
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,610
contact your sister

525
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,810
and some villagers.

526
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,740
It's best

527
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,090
to have the secretary and his son present as well.

528
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,810
I want to make a documentary.

529
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,260
The title will be

530
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,570
"She Whacked Feudalism on the Head".

531
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,130
The title has a nice ring to it.

532
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,020
The show will definitely go viral!

533
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,980
Alright, young lady.

534
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,810
It's not that I don't want to help out,

535
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,370
but I can't.

536
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,370
Don't let

537
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,050
Qingzhi's parents hear what you just said.

538
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,700
You could give them a heart attack.

539
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,460
Qingzhi told me the same thing.

540
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,180
I knew it.

541
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,260
Qingzhi.

542
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,500
What does Yani do for a living?

543
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,460
She works as a reporter

544
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,130
at the TV station.

545
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,980
That's nice.

546
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,220
I bet she meets superstars

547
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,180
all the time.

548
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,020
I want to meet some superstars too.

549
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,050
Qingzhi.

550
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,850
What exactly does she do?

551
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,260
She writes news.

552
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,220
She's often on business trips.

553
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,740
She travels very often.

554
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,220
If anything

555
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,740
good or bad happens

556
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,660
somewhere,

557
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,290
she will write news about it.

558
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,500
The job

559
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,570
suits her well.

560
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,530
She likes fun stuff.

561
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,610
See?

562
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,810
You're too young and naive.

563
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,770
You can't have fun while working.

564
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,090
You can't work while having fun.

565
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,220
What's wrong with having fun?

566
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,850
They are young.

567
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,090
They only live once.

568
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,460
They are not married or raising kids.

569
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,940
Of course she wants to have fun.

570
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,020
When you get married,

571
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,260
you can stop her from going out so much.

572
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,980
Qingzhi.

573
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,420
When are you two

574
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,980
getting married?

575
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,530
How much do they want

576
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,370
for the dowry?

577
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:42,810
Dad,

578
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,980
they don't want anything.

579
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,810
They don't want a cent from us.

580
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,370
Not even a cent?

581
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,980
Sit down!

582
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,570
But it's not right.

583
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,090
She's married into our family.

584
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,700
If we don't pay the dowry,

585
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,290
people will look down on us.

586
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:01,940
That's right.

587
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,290
But, Dad...

588
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,980
It's too early to talk about getting married.

589
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,660
Besides,

590
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,130
I'm not in a hurry.

591
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,460
How are you not worried?

592
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,980
It's best not to delay it.

593
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,330
If the feelings are right, just get married.

594
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,180
Your dad can't wait to have a grandson.

595
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:14,740
That's right.

596
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,850
Mom, Xingfu is still pregnant.

597
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,500
Why are you coming after me?

598
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,530
Besides,

599
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,420
to get married

600
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,130
in the city, I must first

601
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,290
buy a house there.

602
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,530
House prices have gone through the roof.

603
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,130
I just got a job.

604
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,570
I can't afford a house right now.

605
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,770
Qingzhi,

606
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,180
Yani's father is a government official.

607
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,260
He must have a lot of money.

608
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,420
The house will be Yani's as well.

609
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,260
Is he not paying for the house?

610
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,290
Qinglai.

611
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,260
In that regard,

612
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,770
things are the same both in the city

613
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,940
and the countryside.

614
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,850
Most people think the groom

615
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,850
should pay

616
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,050
for the house.

617
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,420
That's right.

618
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,370
Why let them pay for the house?

619
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,770
He'd be living in the wife's house.

620
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,570
We can't have that.

621
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,530
You're right.

622
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,260
That's not right.

623
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,900
We can't let her

624
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,740
look down on us.

625
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:01,980
Trust me.

626
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,850
If she looks down on us,

627
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,660
your married life with her

628
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,610
will be miserable.

629
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,180
You'll be

630
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,290
just like me.

631
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,420
I mean, you won't be like me.

632
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:10,850
I mean...

633
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:14,940
Qingzhi.

634
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,330
How much will it cost to buy a house

635
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
in the city?

636
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,370
It depends on the size of the house

637
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,660
and where it's located.

638
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,330
Even if we take a loan,

639
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,260
the down payment is at least 300,000 yuan.

640
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,090
What?

641
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,570
Did you say 300,000 yuan?

642
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,420
That's a lot.

643
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,180
The cold dishes are ready.

644
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,180
I'll place it on the table.

645
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,740
I can handle it.

646
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,810
Thank you for helping out.

647
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,660
Place them here.

648
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,500
Yani, let's go out

649
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,220
after dinner

650
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,370
to have a look around.

651
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,330
Sure.

652
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,770
This is beautiful.

653
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,700
I couldn't get the show going.

654
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,500
But the scenery is nice.

655
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,290
I told you so.

656
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,090
You were building a castle in the sky.

657
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,570
Qingzhi,

658
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,460
look at the lakeside house.

659
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,050
It looks so adorable!

660
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,460
Let's build a house here.

661
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,700
We can plant some crops too.

662
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,660
What do you think?

663
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,460
Hey, what's so funny?

664
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,770
We can have a life

665
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,130
where we grow our own food

666
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,050
and enjoy the mountain scenery.

667
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,700
I'm serious. Stop laughing.

668
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,570
No, I think

669
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,610
you mustn't

670
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,460
let your mother hear what you just said.

671
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,740
If she heard it,

672
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,180
she'd eat me alive.

673
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,700
Look.

674
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,180
Your mother

675
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,290
doesn't want you to marry a guy
from the countryside

676
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:53,940
and move

677
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,260
to a rural village,

678
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,290
buy a few plots of land,

679
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,460
build a house,

680
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,850
and become a farmer like me.

681
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,850
If your mother heard it,

682
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,500
she'd be...

683
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,770
She'd be steaming!

684
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,660
Whatever the case is,

685
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,370
I'm not my mother.

686
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,130
She doesn't have control over me.

687
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,500
She can't stop me from living here.

688
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,290
Yani,

689
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,740
when I went to college,

690
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,500
my family

691
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,130
used up everything they had

692
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,370
to pay for the fees.

693
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,460
My parents

694
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,770
want me to live in the city

695
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,810
and have a life there.

696
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,020
What's so great about city life?

697
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,330
The houses there are small and unpleasant.

698
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,530
The air here is fresh.

699
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,330
So,

700
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,700
how much would it cost

701
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
to build a house here?

702
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
It's probably around 200,000 yuan.

703
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:34,660
That's enough

704
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,850
to build a decent house here.

705
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,610
That's very affordable.

706
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,370
The same amount isn't even enough
for the down payment

707
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,740
of a house in the city.

708
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,570
That settles it.

709
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,570
We're saving up for a house.

710
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,180
Let's work hard together.

711
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:46,940
Alright?

712
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,420
Alright.

713
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,460
You sounded reluctant.

714
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:51,610
Here,

715
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,460
have some nuts.

716
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,050
What is it?

717
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,660
What is this all about?

718
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,500
Qinglai.

719
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,220
Your dad and I

720
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,330
want to discuss

721
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,130
how much we're paying

722
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,660
for Qingzhi's house.

723
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,290
He's old enough

724
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,260
to get married.

725
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,900
You can decide on the matter.

726
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,050
I could bring

727
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,570
Xingfu and Qingzhi here

728
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,260
for the discussion.

729
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,130
You fool.

730
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,610
Can't you decide anything on your own?

731
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,090
Never mind them.

732
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,610
We do as your mother says.

733
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,260
Qinglai.

734
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,020
Our family

735
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,090
has around 400,000 yuan

736
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,610
after the bank loans

737
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,180
and the money we paid Cai.

738
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,740
We plan

739
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,610
to use up

740
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,850
350,000 yuan for Qingzhi's house.

741
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,850
You can use the remaining
50,000 yuan to rent a plot of land.

742
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,460
That is only enough

743
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,500
for the rent and the seeds.

744
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,370
To build a greenhouse,

745
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,220
I'll need to take a loan.

746
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,090
Forget about the greenhouse.

747
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,700
Do as you did before.

748
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,050
You plant as much as you can on the land.

749
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,460
Your wife's plan

750
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
to invest

751
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,090
in the greenhouse

752
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,330
had us all worried.

753
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,700
We're not lucky enough

754
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,370
to make a fortune.

755
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,370
We should place our hopes

756
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,740
on Qingzhi's career in the city.

757
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,700
And I thought

758
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,810
he could help us financially

759
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,530
after he graduates.

760
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,700
Be patient.

761
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,090
They are still in a relationship.

762
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,220
He is marrying an official's daughter.

763
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,660
The whole family

764
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,700
must have his back right now.

765
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,290
When he gets married

766
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,220
and has kids,

767
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,180
what's hers will be ours as well.

768
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,850
And later on,

769
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,460
we'll have an actual official to have our backs.

770
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,020
Am I right?

771
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,810
Fine.

772
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,330
But I must first tell Xingfu

773
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,260
about your plan.

774
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,020
The baby is moving!

775
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:16,660
So,

776
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,980
what should we name the baby?

777
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,980
We must come up with a good name.

778
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,050
As for the nickname...

779
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,500
How about "Dou?"
(*means "beans")

780
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,290
It has a nice ring to it.

781
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,460
Little Dou.

782
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,330
It sounds like something round and strong.

783
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,020
Little Dou just kicked me.

784
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,500
He likes the name.

785
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,130
He's moving again.

786
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,980
Maybe the baby wants to come out now.

787
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,530
When the baby grows up,

788
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,810
I'm sending the kid to a school in the city.

789
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,180
I want the kid to be as successful as his uncle.

790
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,500
What is it?

791
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,130
Xingfu.

792
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,700
There is something

793
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,090
I must tell you.

794
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,260
What is it?

795
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,940
Mom and Dad think

796
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,740
Qingzhi needs a house

797
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,810
to get married.

798
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,900
The damages we received

799
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,900
will be used for his down payment.

800
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,260
How much do they need?

801
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,090
It's 350,000 yuan.

802
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,740
But...

803
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,130
but we don't have much left.

804
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,260
Do we still build the greenhouse?

805
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,420
Dad

806
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,370
says no.

807
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,900
It's too risky.

808
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,370
Do you think the same?

809
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,530
It's mainly because...

810
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,770
Dad is getting old.

811
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,020
Getting worried

812
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,810
over the greenhouse

813
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,660
is bad for his health.

814
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,370
Mom wants to

815
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,740
make Qingzhi and Yani

816
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,940
get married

817
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,180
as soon as possible.

818
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,660
Getting help from her family
is far more promising

819
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,130
than growing vegetables.

820
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,330
But that is their life.

821
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,660
We have our own life.

822
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,050
We can't expect them to help us.

823
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,290
But still,

824
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,940
Qingzhi is living in the city.

825
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,570
The living cost is high.

826
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,610
Now that he is dating Yani,

827
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,180
it's inconvenient not to have their own house.

828
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,420
Fine, they can have the money.

829
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,420
We'll figure something out.

830
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:44,700
It's alright.

831
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,460
If it was back then,

832
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,810
the damages aside,

833
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,460
I'd take a loan

834
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,740
to come up with the money

835
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,370
for Qingzhi's house.

836
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,090
But somehow...

837
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,770
I don't know why,

838
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,570
but now we'll have

839
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:13,850
a baby soon,

840
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,530
I'm starting

841
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,530
to feel reluctant

842
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,260
to help Qingzhi.

843
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,570
That's because you're going to be a father.

844
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,020
You care about the baby.

845
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,940
I feel the same way.

846
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,810
Back then,

847
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,090
I never kept anything to myself.

848
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,330
But as I got pregnant

849
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,900
and is now expecting a baby,

850
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,850
I started to think

851
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,570
what the baby would be like

852
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,980
when he's born.

853
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,900
Who would the baby take after?

854
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,740
You, of course.

855
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,220
It'd be bad if he took after me.

856
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,290
Let's welcome our groom and bride

857
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,660
of the day!

858
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,220
The dress is beautiful.

859
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,980
That must be Qinglai's first time wearing a suit.

860
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,700
Yes, it was.

861
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,500
I must look very silly.

862
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,090
No, you look handsome.

863
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,980
I'm not like Qingzhi.

864
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,290
Qingzhi looks like city folk.

865
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,940
Well, he already is one.

866
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,460
He looks normal

867
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,220
wearing a suit.

868
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,740
It looks like I stole someone else's suit.

869
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,850
Nonsense, the suit looks great on you.

870
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:28,940
Look at Mom.

871
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,260
What is she doing?

872
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,500
She is going to Mr. Wan.

873
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,420
Where are you? I don't see you in the video.

874
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,260
I was...

875
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,740
She sneaked out.

876
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,850
I sneaked out for some snacks.

877
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,850
Mr. Wang is leaving too.

878
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,770
My parents...

879
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,940
Today is a day of celebration!

880
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,900
What's wrong?

881
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,020
It's nothing.

882
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,500
Something came to my mind just now.

883
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,330
It's nothing.

884
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,220
You're only staying for a day?

885
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,420
Why don't you stay longer?

886
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,940
I have to work tomorrow.

887
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,530
-Mom.
-Here.

888
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,090
Take it.

889
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,610
Take this with you.

890
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,020
That is a lot.

891
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,900
We have these in the city too.

892
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,420
Those are bought,

893
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,180
but these are our gifts for you.

894
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,020
Just take them.

895
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,180
-Mom.
-Thanks, Xingfu.

896
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,460
I think that's too much.

897
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,050
We can't take all of them.

898
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,850
I made them myself.

899
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,500
Take your time.

900
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,180
Okay.

901
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,740
Meigan Cai.
(*a type of dry pickled Chinese mustard)

902
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,260
Yes.

903
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,370
We dried it ourselves.

904
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,810
There's more.

905
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,700
There's more.

906
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,660
Here, there's more.

907
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,610
Take these with you.

908
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,610
Thanks, Xiuyu.

909
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:26,980
Xiuyu, are those mushrooms?

910
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,130
Yes.

911
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,020
And those,

912
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,130
those are the dates.

913
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,980
It's good for your health.

914
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,700
The compensation for the damages we received

915
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,610
is saved in this account.

916
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,220
It's enough for the down payment.

917
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,980
The password is the date

918
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,020
you got into college.

919
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:43,420
Mom, but...

920
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,810
Not a word.

921
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,220
Work hard.

922
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,370
As long as you are well,

923
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,260
we are well.

924
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,260
Qingzhi.

925
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,090
Keep it safe.

926
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:54,740
Keep it.

927
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:55,980
Thanks, Mom.

928
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,700
Silly boy.

929
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,500
Is this it?

930
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,370
Yeah?

931
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,330
This should be it.

932
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,330
This outfit looks nice.

933
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,530
How much is it?

934
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,290
It's around 1,000 yuan.

935
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,090
Hello. Come in.

936
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,090
Mr. Gao,

937
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,850
do you remember me?

938
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,700
You are...

939
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,220
You are Wang Qinglai from Wan Village.

940
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:32,850
Yes.

941
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,770
You must be his wife, He Xingfu.

942
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,290
Yes.

943
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,740
You are famous around here.

944
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,610
Your wedding

945
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,140
was a merry one.

946
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,580
Weddings rarely get so lively.

947
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,860
Of course I remember you.

948
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,620
Great, then.

949
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,790
Is there

950
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,180
a problem

951
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,140
with my video?

952
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,230
Not at all.

953
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,310
I knew it.

954
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,470
If it was the video,

955
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,420
you'd have said so.

956
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,950
The wedding didn't end

957
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,270
on a good note,

958
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,180
but

959
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,580
the DVD I made

960
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,900
only contains the merry

961
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,030
and wonderful moments.

962
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,660
There is nothing unpleasant.

963
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:03,510
Yes.

964
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,420
Well,

965
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,380
the wedding recording

966
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,710
is well done.

967
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,030
The editing is decent too.

968
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,950
But we are here

969
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,180
for the content you didn't include in the video.

970
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,420
What do you need it for?

971
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,950
I might have

972
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,990
deleted it.

973
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,180
You deleted it?

974
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,180
But...

975
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,310
Could you do a search?

976
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,900
It's an important piece of evidence for us.

977
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,620
Yes.

978
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,380
What evidence?

979
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,510
Well,

980
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,550
they were doing the wedding hazing that day.

981
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,100
They bullied my sister.

982
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,470
That was too much!

983
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,660
So, I hit Mr. Wan's son

984
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,470
right on the head.

985
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,860
Did you catch that on camera?

986
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,990
I want to know

987
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,070
what you filmed.

988
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,750
Maybe it could be used as evidence.

989
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,310
But it happened so long ago.

990
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,100
It could have been lost.

991
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,660
Please have a look.

992
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,340
What if you still have it?

993
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,230
If you find it,

994
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,790
we won't let your effort go unrewarded.

995
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,620
Yes.

996
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,420
This is important.

997
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,270
How about this?

998
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,510
Give me your contact number.

999
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:03,860
Okay.

1000
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,950
If I find it,

1001
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,100
I'll call you.

1002
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,900
Sure.

1003
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,300
This is my phone number.

1004
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,990
Call me if you find it.

1005
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,550
Alright. Sure.

1006
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:20,990
Great.

1007
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,780
We're counting on you.

1008
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,660
Don't mention it.

1009
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,830
Have a nice day.

1010
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,350
Go to the back and look for

1011
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,220
Mr. Chen's files.

1012
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:42,830
Yes.

1013
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:57,925
[A Touching Proposal]

1014
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:15,870
Who is it?

1015
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,030
Hello?

1016
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,390
Hello?

1017
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,740
You came to my shop just now.

1018
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,430
I'm the wedding photographer.

1019
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,990
Mr. Gao.

1020
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,660
Well? Did you find the video?

1021
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,700
Not yet.

1022
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:33,100
I just want to ask.

1023
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,700
Is this video

1024
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,260
very important to you?

1025
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,180
How is it going to help you?

1026
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,220
If it's not that important,

1027
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,910
I wouldn't want to waste my time.

1028
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,990
Don't say that.

1029
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,470
Of course it's important.

1030
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,390
We went to your shop in person.

1031
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,350
Without the video,

00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,870
Where is the thing you took?

1202
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,180
You took something?

1203
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,660
What did you take?

1204
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,260
Mom.

1205
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,350
It's alright.

1206
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,470
We didn't take anything.

1207
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,300
It was ours, to begin with.

1208
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,740
Wang Qinglai.

1209
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,950
You should hand it over

1210
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,390
while I'm still in the mood to talk.

1211
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,620
I don't have it.

1212
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,700
Xingfu took it

1213
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,140
and went to her sister.

1214
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,390
Are you asking for trouble?

1215
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,580
Fine, you don't believe it.

1216
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,510
Feel free

1217
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,300
