What was that about?

00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
Another wasted trip.

6
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,960
Their attitude was so bad.

7
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,000
Ridiculous.

8
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,599
The truth

9
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,080
is that they think our law firm is too small.

10
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,639
Our law firm might be small,

11
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,159
but it's fully equipped.

12

Did you work for free?

Why didn't I realize

38
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,360
that you were so petty?

39
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,759
How can you be so calculative?

40
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,240
Are you not calculative?

41

I don't think

they're not calculative either.

Why are they paying you so little?

49

they know you're desperate,

50
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,959

Yes.

Why?

81

It was such a coincidence today.

82

Do you know who I met today?

His new law firm isn't far

86

from the Early Learning Center.

87
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,959
What? You met Guan Tao?

88
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,639
Yes.

89
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:56,920
I even decided

90
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,120
to work at his law firm.

91
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,240
What a coincidence.

92
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,040
I'm making pastries.

93
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,720
Come over for a meal.

94
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,000

Well.

99

Maybe next time.

100

[Fangyuan Law Firm]

00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,720
Senior, your place is hard to find.

106
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,160
I only found it after searching for a few rounds.

107
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,240
There's neither coffee nor tea.

108
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,279
It's near the court.

109
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,519
It's easier to find customers.

110
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,279
Operating a small law firm is tough.

111
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,800
This is nothing compared to Yidao Law Firm.

112
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,319
Take a seat.

113
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,079
It seems

114
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,639
you're doing well in your career.

115
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,879
Not too bad, I guess.

116
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,399
I'm now

117
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,439
a practicing lawyer.

118
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,199
I got some cases.

119
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,319
So it's way better than before.

120
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,839
It's what you deserve

121
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,519
with your capability.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,079
But there's something

123
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,399
that you shouldn't be hasty with.

124
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,040
This circle

125
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,480
is neither big nor small.

126
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,639
There are many things

127
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,639
that you can't hide.

128
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,360
What do you mean?

129
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,639
I heard

130
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,639
some rumors

131
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,759
out there.

132
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,959
It's said

133
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,120
that Yidao Law Firm

134
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,519
has a hardworking new lawyer.

135

Furthermore,

136
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,199
she's quite bold.

137
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,240
You're talking about

138
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,879
Ruishou Wine Company, right?

139
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,800
The informer

140
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,480
changed his testimony in court.

141
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,959
Isn't this odd?

142
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,240
It's as if he's slapping his own face.

143
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,120
I've only seen

144
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,279
such things in movies.

145
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
I didn't break the law.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Regarding this matter,

147
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,360
the whole process

148
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,560
was based on evidence.

149
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,000
That's for sure.

150
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,680
I believe that Han

151
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,759
would settle this

152
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,000
without any flaws.

153
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,000
However,

154
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,360
aside from legal principles, ethical reasoning

155
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,759
should also be considered.

156
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,840
Isn't your approach toward the case

157
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,159
too unconventional

158
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,240
and inappropriate?

159
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,039
Or else,

160
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,080
there wouldn't be

161
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,159
so many rumors in this circle.

162
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,799
Why are you taking

163
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,480
the moral high ground

164
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,440
to judge me?

165
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,120
What's the point?

166
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:55,720
Yes.

167
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,879
You helped me a lot.

168
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,519
I'm grateful and I mean it.

169
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,600
But I can finally be independent now.

170
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,559
Why are you using another method

171
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,799
to show your superiority

172
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,799
in front of me?

173
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,279
This is perhaps

174
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,720
the misunderstanding between us.

175
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,200
I've never thought like that.

176
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:31,840
Perhaps we

177
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,080
are not on the same path.

178
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,200
You're right. I admit

179
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,840
that as before,

180
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,759
I'm still concerned

181
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,879
about you.

182
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,159
As a friend,

183
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,159
I would like to give you

184
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,000
my last piece of advice.

185
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,559
I hope you wouldn't mind.

186
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,120
I don't agree with the working style

187
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:50,919
of Han.

188
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,440
I believe you know it as well.

189
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,080
A person like him

190
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,399
can indeed

191
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,399
get along well with others in life.

192
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,759
He's unscrupulous

193
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,799
and greedy.

194
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,720
But not everyone

195
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
can agree with him.

196
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,120
Because a despicable method

197
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,279
means a despicable goal.

198
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,799
If you still have a conscience

199
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,840
and moral principles,

200
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,919
there'll be a big price to pay

201
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,399
for such a deal.

202
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:26,879
Xingyun.

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
Right now,

204
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,159
your life

205
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,159
isn't as hard

206
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,320
as your life as a fresh graduate.

207
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,519
Now that you are better off,

208
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,600
you should make a sensible choice.

209
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,919
You left Yidao Law Firm

210
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,840
to open such a small law firm.

211
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,279
Don't you regret it?

212
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,480
To be honest,

213
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,240
I don't.

214
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,240
Perhaps

215
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,559
it's because I can still make a living.

216
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,639
In addition,

217
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,120
you helped my sister make a living.

218
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,399
That's not true.

219
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,519
She has her value.

220
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,440
In fact, I think

221
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,279
I pay her too little.

222
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,799
Really?

223
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,639
Believe it or not.

224
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:34,679
If I just happen

225
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,559
to know you today,

226
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,559
I won't believe you.

227
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,240
Sadly,

228
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,879
we've known each other for a long time.

229
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:57,759
Here.

230
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:58,879
Taste it.

231
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,080
I'm not sure

232
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,000
if the filling is salty enough.

233
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:02,799
The pastries made by you

234
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,679
are my favorite.

235
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,320
Qingzhi.

236
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,480
Have you

237
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
gotten me a job?

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,080
I haven't had any news.

239
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,279
Qinglai.

240
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,720
Don't be anxious.

241
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,279
It's hard to find a job in the city at the moment.

242
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,799
Can't your father-in-law

243
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,559
help out?

244
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,840
I...

245
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,639
I mentioned it to him.

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,519
He didn't answer me.

247
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,360
Yani and I

248
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,399
aren't married yet.

249
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,360
It's inappropriate for me

250
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,279
to keep asking

251
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,759
since he didn't answer.

252
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,960
Let's eat.

253
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,159
Qinglai.

254
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,559
Why don't you go out tomorrow?

255
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,600
There's a labor office nearby.

256
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,559
Go and have a look.

257
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,399
Hurry.

258
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,879
Xingfu.

259
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,159
What are you doing?

260
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,080
There are some stubborn stains on the floor.

261
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,000
So I'm soaking them.

262
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,279
Be careful.

263
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,039
If a customer falls here,

264
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,720
we will be legally responsible.

265
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,480
Why?

266
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,519
If they fell on their own,

267
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,440
why should we be legally responsible?

268
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,799
This is our place.

269
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,559
If a customer is here for business,

270
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,559
we have

271
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,440
the legal obligation to ensure their safety.

272
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,120
Okay.

273
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I'll get it done soon.

274
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,879
We don't have many customers now anyway.

275
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,360
Xingfu.

276
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Why are you cleaning again?

277
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,519
Didn't you just clean the office?

278
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,120
Do something else.

279
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,240
What else can I do?

280
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,600
You can change the bottle

281
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,879
of the water dispenser.

282
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,480
Well...

283
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:02,840
Choose more restaurants

284
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,720
for lunch so we can have

285
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,519
more options.

286
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,080
When you know this place better,

287
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,320
you can help deliver some documents.

288
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,320
The court is right there.

289
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,120
It's nearby.

290
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,200
You can do all that.

291
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,879
Tell...

292
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,879
Tell me more.

293
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll jot it down.

294
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,919
What else

295
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,559
can I do?

296
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,960
So...

297
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,720
Change the water bottle.

298
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,679
Change the water bottle.

299
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,039
Order lunch.

300
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,000
Order lunch.

301
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,720
Submit documents.

302
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,200
What else?

303
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,639
The court is right there.

304
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,399
Okay.

305
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,519
When I'm done with these duties,

306
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,000
can I be the receptionist?

307
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:44,879
Xingfu.

308
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,440
That place is a little dirty.

309
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,240
Clean it.

310
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,639
No.

311
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,440
I'm done cleaning.

312
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,279
Only these two spots

313
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,120
are dirty.

314
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,440
Other places are clean.

315
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,080
Qinglai.

316
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,279
Qinglai.

317
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,480
Qingzhi.

318
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:08,679
You're off work.

319
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,759
Qinglai, you're back so early.

320
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,799
Get some rest.

321
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,480
I'll cook for you.

322
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,320
No need.

323
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,679
I've done the cooking.

324
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,879
Qinglai.

325
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,159
How's your job search?

326
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,080
I found nothing.

327
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,039
I wanted to find

328
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,440
a manual job,

329
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,399
such as moving houses,

330
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,440
building walls or digging trenches.

331
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,919
Anything is fine.

332
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,279
They had nothing.

333
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,279
I found out

334
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
that those in these fields

335
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
are from Jiangsu and Hebei.

336
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,039
They know each other.

337
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,399
They're helping out each other.

338
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,679
I have no chance.

339
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,960
Qinglai, don't be anxious.

340
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,240
Let's keep searching.

341
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,360
Qingzhi.

342
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,360
Didn't you say

343
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,279
that you mentioned

344
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,279
to your father-in-law

345
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,159
about the job?

346
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,879
Yes.

347
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,639
Is it because we didn't send any gifts?

348
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,000
Everything is about gifts nowadays.

349
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:02,960
Qinglai.

350
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,200
Yani's father doesn't want gifts.

351
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,240
Even if he does,

352
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,759
he won't take gifts from us.

353
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,879
I'm back.

354
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,039
Xingfu.

355
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,500
When Guan Tao helped us with the lawsuit,

356
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,050
Mom and Dad said

357
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,530
they earned money just by talking.

358
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,930
As if they're robbing.

359
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,810
I didn't say anything then.

360
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,890
But I thought

361
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,770
they make money very easily.

362
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,530
But now that I'm working with them,

363
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,220
I realize

364
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,020
that their work is tough.

365
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,100
They need professional knowledge.

366
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,860
Today, someone came to our law firm.

367
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,290
Can't you keep quiet while you eat?

368
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,930
What's wrong?

369
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,650
What's so hard about it?

370
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,380
Their work is much easier

371
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,810
than manual labor.

372
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,050
How can you say that?

373
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,020
Qingzhi also has an office job.

374
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,740
Is it easy for him to make money?

375
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,650
No.

376
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,980
Qinglai.

377
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,180
Qinglai.

378
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,330
I'm going to work now.

379
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,220
Have another look at the apartment

380
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,290
we saw last time.

381
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:12,980
Try to negotiate with them.

382
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,940
If it's cheaper,

383
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,850
we'll just rent it.

384
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,050
I haven't found a job yet.

385
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,370
What's the hurry?

386
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,570
Wouldn't we be out of money

387
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,850
if we counted only on your earnings?

388
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,850
Why don't you

389
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,370
have a look at other labor offices?

390
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,810
It's useless.

391
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,260
You can't find a job

392
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,660
without connections.

393
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,050
Think about it.

394
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,700
Even you got your job

395
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,980
because of your connection

396
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,980
with Guan Tao.

397
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,260
Xingfu.

398
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,740
Why don't we

399
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,460
treat Yani's parents to a meal?

400
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:48,770
Why?

401
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,180
To build connections.

402
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,180
You...

403
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,050
You'll be putting Qingzhi
in a difficult position.

404
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,740
Stop mentioning it.

405
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,770
Find a job yourself.

406
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,850
I'm leaving now.

407
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:18,775

20 yuan.

413
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:29,700
What do you want?

414
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,500
A pack of Zhongnanhai.
[* Cigarette brand]

415
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:31,610
Okay, thank you.

416
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,660
Sir.

417
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,740
What about

418
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,500
the one on the left?

419
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,020
This is 50 yuan.

420
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,260
50 yuan?

421

How much

422
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,700
is a whole package?

423
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,220
A whole package?

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,770
500 yuan.

425

500 yuan?

426

The whole package is 500 yuan?

427

Yes. That's the market price.

433
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,260
How much is that?

434
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,220
This one?

435
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,330
On the right.

436
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,850
The white one.

437
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,050
This is 700 yuan.

438
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:09,980
700 yuan?

439
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,220
So expensive.

440
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,500
What do you need it for?

441
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,940
Why do you care?

I'll offer you

446
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,180
two for 800 yuan.

447
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,330
How about that?

448
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,420
Two for 800 yuan?

449
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,220
Yes.

450
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,940
Are these

451
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,700
the same as that one?

452
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,330
They're the same.

453
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,370
Don't worry.

454
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,900
Everything I sell

455
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,500
is real.

456
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,810
If they're fake,

457
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,130
you can come back anytime.

458
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:48,900
Okay?

459
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,570
They think I'm not qualified enough.

460
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,290
They're in the start-up stage.

461
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,290
I may need to work overtime.

462
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,330
And the law firm is so small.

463
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,660
I'm not going to consider it.

464
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,130
Let's go.

465
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,530
Mr. Guan.

466
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,370
This is yours.

467
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,090
Okay, thank you.

468
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,220
Here's yours, Mr. Zhang.

469
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,090
Thank you.

470
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:31,420
Yours.

471
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,020
Thank you.

472
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,090
Those two definitely won't do.

473
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,980
Should we post

474
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,130
the recruitment notice

475
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,130
at more places?

476
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,370
Nowadays, fresh grads are ambitious.

477
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,610
With the pay that we offer them,

478
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,850
it won't be easy.

479
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,370
Money, money.

480
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,370
He who takes charge knows the responsibility.

481
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,500
I think I'm getting sick.

482
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,050
Whenever money is mentioned,

483
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,260
I feel dizzy.

484
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,940
But luckily, Xingfu is here.

485
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,700
At least, she can help us

486
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,570
with the reception.

487
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,130
But we can't go on like this.

488
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,500
Does that mean I did some reception work?

489
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,770
Are you asking for a raise?

490
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,810
No way.

491
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,180
I'm dizzy whenever money is mentioned.

492
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,770
No.

493
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:15,810
Didn't I...

494
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,660
I did

495
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,700
whatever I could do.

496
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,090
You don't need a receptionist.

497
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,260
You can even save

498
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,180
some money.

499
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,660
Xingfu.

500
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,740
You need special knowledge in this field.

501
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,050
Can we stop thinking

502
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,220
about being the receptionist?

503
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,770
Okay.

504
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:36,660
Bye.

505
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,290
Okay.

506
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:04,980
Hello.

507
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,900
Who are you looking for?

508
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,940
I'm here

509
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,660
to see Mr. Xu.

510
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,700
Please register here.

511
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,260
Hello.

512
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,500
How may I help you?

513
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,180
I'm here to see Mr. Xu.

514
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,050
Which Mr. Xu are you looking for?

515
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,500
Just Mr. Xu.

516
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,770
Do I have to specify which Mr. Xu it is?

517
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,740
We have many colleagues named Xu.

518
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,570
Which department is the Mr. Xu
you are looking for from?

519
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,260
Hold on a second.

520
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:50,940
Qinglai.

521
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,330
I have a question.

522
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,370
Yes?

523
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,090
Which department

524
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,180
is your father-in-law in?

525
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:57,810
Organization Department.

526
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,770
What do they do?

527
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,130
They're in charge

528
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,020
of cadres selection.

529
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,740
Qinglai.

530
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,460
Why do you ask?

531
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,290
It's nothing.

532
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,700
I just wanted to know.

533
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,460
I'm looking for a job now.

534
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,290
I've got to go.

535
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,050
I'm hanging up.

536
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,260
Where was I again? This is...

537
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,290
Mr. Xu of the Organization Department.

538
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,940
Who are you to him?

539
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,980
Nephew.

540
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:50,850
Hello.

541
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,770
Hello.

542
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,740
Is this Mr. Xu?

543
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,610
I'm from the guard house.

544
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,290
Your nephew is here to see you.

545
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,460
My nephew?

546
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,460
Which nephew?

547
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,740
Mr. Xu asked

548
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,180
which nephew you were.

549
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,260
Here, give it to me.

550
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,940
I'll talk to him.

551
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,420
Hello.

552
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,810
Uncle.

553
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,900
I'm Wang Qinglai.

554
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,610
Qingzhi's brother.

555
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,500
I just came into the city.

556
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,850
My parents told me

557
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,900
to stop by

558
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,090
to visit you.

559
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,180
I see.

560
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,660
Well,

561
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,740
I'm working now.

562
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,610
It's inconvenient.

563
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,420
Why don't we

564
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,090
meet another day?

565
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,810
No, Uncle.

566
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,940
I've been here for many days,

567
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,020
yet I haven't visited you.

568
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,220
And my parents have urged me many times.

569
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,020
Okay.

570
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:43,700
Just...

571
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,980
Just wait for me there.

572
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,810
I'm coming.

573
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,610
He told me to wait.

574
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,090
Then register here

575
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,660
and wait in the security room.

576
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,290
I need to register here?

577
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:04,850
Yes.

578
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,180
Wang.

579
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,050
Let him in.

580
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:09,940
Okay.

581
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,370
Who's looking for me?

582
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,940
Mr. Xu, here he is.

583
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,660
Are you Mr. Xu?

584
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,370
Uncle.

585
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,740
Are you Wang Qingzhi's brother?

586
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,420
Yes.

587
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,530
Yani mentioned you to me.

588
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,940
Well,

589
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,220
I've been very busy.

590
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,980
I know, Uncle.

591
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:46,850
Here's the thing.

592
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,290
Since I was in town,

593
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,770
my parents kept telling me

594
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,500
to visit you

595
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,370
and to thank you

596
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,810
for taking care of Qingzhi.

597
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,570
I know you're busy,

598
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,090
so I didn't want to disturb you.

599
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,740
Yesterday, they called to scold me again.

600
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,770
Uncle.

601
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,660
Please pardon me.

602
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,180
No.

603
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,290
Don't be too polite.

604
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,740
This is for you.

605
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,610
No.

606
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,330
No way.

607
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,050
No, Uncle.

608
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,260
We have regulations here.

609
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,700
We can't receive any gifts.

610
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,500
No, Uncle.

611
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,660
I bought these for you.

612
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,660
I bought these for you.

613
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,260
No way.

614
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,130
Take them, please.

615
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,900
I neither smoke nor drink.

616
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,980
I have no use for these.

617
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,020
Keep them at home then.

618
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,260
Besides, you just came to the city.

619
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,900
You need favors.

620
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,500
I don't.

621
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,180
Keep it for them.

622
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,570
If you don't take them,

623
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,570
you look down on us.

624
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:22,700
You...

625
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,260
If you don't take them,

626
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,290
you look down on us.

627
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:24,900
Uncle.

628
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,570
Take these.

629
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,500
You...

630
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,130
Come out with me.

631
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,700
Come out.

632
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,570
He called him "Uncle".

633
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,020
Yes.

634
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,700
So that's his nephew.

635
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,130
Are they related?

636
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,370
My parents say

637
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,740
that we are all very happy

638
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,370
that Qingzhi has a girlfriend like Yani.

639
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:45,980
No.

640
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,330
Let's not talk about that.

641
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,570
Are you here

642
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,370
to see me

643
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,330
for a reason?

644
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,420
No.

645
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,180
I just came to...

646
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:54,740
Really?

647
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,770
I just came to see you.

648
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,090
I just thought I might trouble you

649
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,130
now that I'm in the city.

650
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,020
It's good that you didn't come with an agenda.

651
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,050
Then

652
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,770
I shall head back to work.

653
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,180
No, Uncle.

654
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,570
There's a small matter.

655
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,330
See?

656
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,900
What small matter?

657
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,570
Well,

658
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,610
Qingzhi mentioned to you

659
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,740
about getting me a job, right?

660
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,570
What job?

661
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,130
Didn't he mention it to you?

662
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,740
Here's the thing.

663
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,570
I...

664
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,050
I can't stay

665
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,740
in the village anymore.

666
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,900
I would like to work in town.

667
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,900
But it's hard to find a job nowadays.

668
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,330
I only

669
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,460
know you in this town.

670
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,530
Therefore...

671
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,530
Your name

672
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,220
is Qingshi?

673
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,130
Qinglai.

674
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,660
Wang Qinglai.

675
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,330
Qinglai.

676
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,130
Qingzhi

677
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:51,980
must have introduced

678
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,660
me to you as well.

679
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,460
He did.

680
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,420
Of course, he did.

681
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,770
He said you're the director of a department.

682
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,700
Your position

683
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,460
is as high

684
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,500
as the head of a county.

685
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,700
Did he say that?

686
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,700
Did he also

687
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,180
mention

688
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,370
that I also came

689
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,570
from a village?

690
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,050
He did mention it.

691
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,180
He said

692
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,290
you're great.

693
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,570
You came from a village

694
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,370
and now you

695
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,330
are a high-ranking official.

696
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,090
He said you're his role model.

697
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,570
Let's not talk about ranks.

698
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,530
You can imagine

699
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,050
that I too have

700
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,740
uncles, aunties,

701
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,740
and many relatives.

702
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,610
Our family

703
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,180
isn't smaller than yours.

704
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,420
Let's put it this way.

705
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,850
Yesterday,

706
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,900
my nephew,

707
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,370
my biological nephew

708
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,050
came to see me.

709
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,130
He graduated from a technical school.

710
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,770
Despite his certificate,

711
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,940
he couldn't find

712
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,220
a suitable job for two years.

713
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,980
He wanted me to arrange something.

714
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,610
I rejected him right away.

715
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,570
Your biological nephew?

716
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,290
Yes.

717
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,500
I got into university

718
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,370
with the help

719
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,570
of my entire family.

720
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,770
What about my brother?

721
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
He was managing

722
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:00,810
the entire family.

723
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,570
He sustained the whole family.

724
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,980
Shouldn't I care

725
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,260
more about his son?

726
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,370
But I...

727
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,660
I would love to,

728
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,850
but I can't.

729
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,330
Especially now.

730
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,090
You know what the current situation is like.

731
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,570
Right?

732
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,900
There are anti-corruption campaigns.

733
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,370
You must have heard.

734
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,850
If I use my power for personal gain,

735
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,460
that would be

736
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,260
a classic corruption.

737
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,700
Let alone

738
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,330
that I don't have

739
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,980
much power in the organization.

740
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,260
Even if I have,

741
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,050
I can't use

742
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,420
my power to help my family.

743
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,810
If I did that,

744
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,740
how could I still be

745
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,850
the director of a department?

746
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,130
Do you

747
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,090
want me

748
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,850
to retire early?

749
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:42,740
Right?

750
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,290
Uncle.

751
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,660
Despite what you said,

752
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,500
could you still

753
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
help me?

754
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,420
I...

755
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,260
It's not that

756
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,660
I don't want to help.

757
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,530
I honestly can't help.

758
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,610
Qingzhi

759
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,610
mentioned to me

760
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,500
that you provided

761
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,610
his tuition fee.

762
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,220
You've contributed a lot to the family.

763
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,130
Qingzhi is my future son-in-law.

764
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,660
I thank you on his behalf.

765
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,980
But this favor you asked for...

766
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,530
I...

767
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,290
Can't...

768
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,770
Right?

769
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,940
In fact,

770
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,130
if you're willing to work,

771
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,220
it's not so hard

772
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,700
to find a job.

773
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:29,610
Right?

774
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,810
There.

775
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,370
Right

776
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,180
at that corner.

777
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,290
Around that corner.

778
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,460
There's an employment agency.

779
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,660
You can go there

780
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,570
and have a try.

781
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,090
That's at least a way.

782
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,260
Uncle.

783
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:53,980
I understand now.

784
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:55,850
I understand.

785
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,020
Thank you, Uncle.

786
00:30:59,420 --> 00:30:59,940
No.

787
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,770
I didn't do anything.

788
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,940
I've troubled you.

789
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,130
Don't say that.

790
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,770
Take these.

791
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,420
No.

792
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,090
This...

793
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,020
As I mentioned,

794
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,810
please take it back.

795
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,770
Okay.

796
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,420
Then I shall not

797
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,770
keep you any longer.

798
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,900
I'll let you get back to work.

799
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:18,980
So,

800
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,850
I shall just leave now.

801
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:31,940
Qinglai.

802
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,290
Here.

803
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,290
Here.

804
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,810
Here's some money.

805
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,370
Take this.

806
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:38,980
No way.

807
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,770
Uncle, no way.

808
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,090
You just got in town.

809
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:41,610
-I can't take this.
-You need this.

810
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,610
How can I take your money, Uncle?

811
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,090
Uncle.

812
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:43,770
Do take it.

813
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,220
Take it.

814
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:44,900
I...

815
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,020
I'm going back to work.

816
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:46,810
Okay?

817
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:33,900
Qinglai.

818
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,180
Qinglai.

819
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,620
Why didn't you discuss it with me

820
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,580
before you see Yani's father

821
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,510
at his office?

822
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,620
How dare you say that,

823
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,140
huh?

824
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,860
Qingzhi.

825
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,510
You've grown up.

826
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,820
You're an adult now.

827
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,100
You don't need me now.

828
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,470
You learned to lie to me.

829
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,620
Didn't you say

830
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,420
you told him about me?

831
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,790
Did you?

832
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,420
Qingzhi, let me ask you.

833
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,420
How did you get into university?

834
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,710
How did you get your apartment?

835
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,710
Ask your conscience.

836
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,180
Without me,

837
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,140
would you have all these?

838
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,180
You've grown up now.

839
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,100
You have a big apartment

840
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,580
and an office job, right?

841
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,310
You have a county head as a father-in-law.

842
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,380
I was chased out of the village

843
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,510
and came to ask for your help.

844
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,420
Yet you learned

845
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,750
to lie to me.

846
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,510
Why didn't you just

847
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,620
throw me out?

848
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:43,660
Qinglai.

849
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,100
I'm sorry.

850
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,820
I have no way.

851
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,270
You should have been honest with me.

852
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,310
Just turn me down.

853
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,310
And that would be the end of it.

854
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,270
Why did you

855
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,070
lie to me?

856
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,990
You made me beg him.

857
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,510
So I could be insulted

858
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,950
by him face-to-face.

859
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,580
We're relatives.

860
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,510
How dare he

861
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,820
give me a lesson?

862
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,100
Has he not made

863
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,140
arrangements for his family?

864
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:10,870
He's pretending

865
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,030
to be upright when it's me.

866
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,870
Does he

867
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,350
respect you

868
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,390
as his son-in-law?

869
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,430
If he looks down on you,

870
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,260
don't beg him shamelessly!

871
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,580
Although

872
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,030
our family is small,

873
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,950
we have pride!

874
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,180
He thinks we're villagers

875
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,100
who know nothing.

876
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,070
Isn't the Organization Department

877
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,350
in charge of recruiting people?

878
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,260
Don't they arrange manpower?

879
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,260
Qinglai.

880
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,260
Scold me if you want to.

881
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,870
Please don't talk about Yani's father like that.

882
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,070
I'm useless.

883
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,740
Qinglai.

884
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,780
How should I tell you this?

885
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,780
Yes.

886
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,620
I didn't ask

887
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,030
for his favor.

888
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,220
Not only that,

889
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,660
when her father

890
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,180
knew that you and Xingfu are here,

891
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,990
he even asked me

892
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,470
if you needed help.

893
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,830
I rejected him right away.

894
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:16,350
Aren't you

895
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,140
acting tough?

896
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,950
Why?

897
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,030
Qinglai.

898
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,180
Yes.

899
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,390
I'm acting tough.

900
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,660
Qinglai, there's something

901
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,140
that I don't know how to tell you.

902
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,070
In fact,

903
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,510
when I got together with Yani,

904
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,580
her mother didn't like me.

905
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,700
In the beginning,

906
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,740
her mother threatened her with death.

907
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,910
But the more she threatened Yani,

908
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,390
the more determined Yani was.

909
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,620
That's how

910
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,740
we managed to stay together.

911
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,300
To be honest,

912
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,470
I...

913
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,910
When I'm with Yani,

914
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,950
I always feel self-abased.

915
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,070
Our family background

916
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,390
isn't the same.

917
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,870
Their social status

918
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,390
is obviously higher.

919
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,140
I always feel inferior

920
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,990
in front of her family.

921
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,220
Qinglai, please understand me.

922
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,870
How can I beg them

923
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,580
to help our family?

924
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,300
Can't you just

925
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,140
break up with her?

926
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,740
You're with her,

927
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,780
she can't help out,

928
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,180
yet you're being mistreated.

929
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,350
And you have to stand

930
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,830
the humiliation of your mother-in-law.

931
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,620
What for?

932
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,620
But Qinglai,

933
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,830
I love Yani.

934
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,300
Yani is nice to me.

935
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,550
She tolerates me.

936
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,430
She loves me.

937
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,580
I never dreamed

938
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,220
that I can be

939
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,430
with a girl like Yani.

940
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,700
Sometimes, I think

941
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,140
I would rather

942
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,390
give up whatever I have now

943
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,830
to be with Yani.

944
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,390
Even your family?

945
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,180
Qinglai.

946
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,910
There are different matters.

947
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:22,990
Qinglai.

948
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,870
I've told all my friends

949
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,870
about the job search.

950
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,550
They promised to help.

951
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,180
Coming.

952
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,950
Who is that?

953
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,740
Who's there?

954
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:54,990
Hello, Mrs. Xu.

955
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,260
Why are you here?

956
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,100
Yani is on a business trip.

957
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,990
Don't you know?

958
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,300
I know.

959
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,350
By the way, Mrs. Xu.

960
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,870
I bought you some nuts.

961
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,620
We are not celebrating some festivals,

962
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,910
why are you giving me gifts?

963
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,070
I heard

964
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,030
this is delicious

965
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,180
and nutritious.

966
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,350
So I bought a box for you

967
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:14,910
and Mr. Xu.

968
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,740
Is Qingzhi here?

969
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,740
Mr. Xu.

970
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,390
Come in.

971
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,030
I told him to come.

972
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,580
Why did you ask him to come?

973
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,620
Is something up?

974
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,740
Yesterday,

975
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,300
I met his supervisor.

976
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,620
He wants to transfer Qingzhi

977
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,580
to another department.

978
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,140
We shall discuss it.

979
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,100
Aren't you

980
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,300
going out for groceries?

981
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,260
Hurry up.

982
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,300
That's right.

983
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,350
I'm going now.

984
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,950
Mr. Xu, sorry.

985
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,910
Goodbye, Mrs. Xu.

986
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:58,950
Goodbye.

987
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:05,700
Mr. Xu.

988
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,700
I'm sorry.

989
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,140
My brother was immature.

990
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,830
He has troubled you.

991
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,740
I want to clarify something.

992
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,510
Did you tell your family

993
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,390
that I'm a county head?

994
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,100
Mr. Xu.

995
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,830
I think

996
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,070
I should explain this to you.

997
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,140
Yani was also there that day.

998
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,350
My parents asked me

999
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,700
about your official rank.

1000
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,620
In order to let them

1001
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,510
understand better,

1002
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,350
I told them you're at the county level.

1003
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,620
Your rank

1004
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,140
is the same as the county secretary.

1005
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,950
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

1006
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,510
My parents

1007
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,620
didn't understand well.

1008
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,620
I knew it.

1009
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,780
You don't look like

1010
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,870
someone like that.

1011
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,700
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

1012
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,390
I didn't expect my brother

1013
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,620
to see you at your office.

1014
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,260
To him,

1015
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,140
he thinks the county head

1016
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,550
is a high-ranking official

1017
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:57,910
who can do anything he wants.

1018
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,350
There are things

1019
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,990
that I can't explain to them.

1020
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,830
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

1021
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,550
You never

1022
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,430
asked me

1023
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:07,950
to find

1024
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,550
your brother a job.

1025
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,830
This explained it all.

1026
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,220
Thank you for saying that.

1027
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,870
They came to seek your help.

1028
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,350
What are you planning to do?

1029
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,390
I don't know either.

1030
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,300
Don't worry.

1031
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,470
I want to hear your real thoughts.

1032
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,430
My brother

1033
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,350
came to seek my help.

1034
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,260
He can no longer stay in the village.

1035
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,260
They

1036
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,030
can't find

1037
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,180
jobs here either.

1038
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,300
I already told my friends about this.

1039
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,950
They're just like me

1040
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,830
who just joined the workforce not long ago.

1041
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,180
I guess this problem

1042
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,660
can't be solved

1043
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,830
at the time being.

1044
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,390
But I thought

1045
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,510
since they're here,

1046
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,550
I can't chase them out.

1047
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,550
Qingzhi.

1048
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,350
Your office supervisor complimented you.

1049
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,550
He compliments you every time he sees me.

1050
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,830
He even said,

1051
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,390
Deputy Mayor Xiang

1052
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,910
also praised your capability.

1053
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,430
Therefore,

1054
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,300
now

1055
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,300
is your crucial moment.

1056
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,220
Don't think your future

1057
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,030
will forever be bright.

1058
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,550
You should focus

1059
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,620
on the present.

1060
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,740
If you're not careful,

1061
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,300
everything will be back to zero.

1062
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,780
Don't worry

1063
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,780
about your brother.

1064
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,870
Forget it.

1065
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,910
I shall arrange a job

1066
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,910
for your brother.

1067
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,300
Mr. Xu,

1068
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,620
wouldn't it be hard for you?

1069
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,180
It's never easy

1070
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,660
to ask for a favor.

1071
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,230
But if I don't do it,

1072
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,860
you'll have to do it.

1073
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,190
Fortunately, I've been working longer than you

1074
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,820
and I have more connections.

1075
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,590
However,

1076
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,550
you must be clear with your brother.

1077
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,030
With his current skills,

1078
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,150
he has no advantage

1079
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,300
in getting a job in town.

1080
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,510
It's good enough to have a job.

1081
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,670
He can't be picky.

1082
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,460
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

1083
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,860
I will tell him that.

1084
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,110
Thank you.
