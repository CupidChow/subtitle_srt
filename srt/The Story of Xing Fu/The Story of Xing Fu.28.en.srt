What kind of places do you guys like?

10
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,039
I like places with hills and rivers.

Somewhere we can fish.

12
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,039

Two million yuan isn't a lot.

will be known as junior partners.

64

That means we're focusing on
the act of participation.

65

Besides giving them discounts,

72
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,120
we have to pay them dividends

73
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,120
from our profit according to
the percentage of their investment.

110

Of course, they'll be hard to achieve.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,680
If so, we should try to solve it.

112

tell her to wait for me. I'm in a meeting.

I'll look for her when I'm free.

121

If so, I...

131
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,120
Where are you going when you haven't finished

Were you guys having a meeting?

138
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,680
It's just a discussion.

139
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,560
You see,

140
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,920
we were discussing the issue
with the sales performance

142

Tell us about it.

146
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,000

I don't have any ideas in particular.

148

I don't know anything.

149
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
Xingfu, it's like this.

150
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,360
I had this idea

151
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,800
for several days.

152
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:18,879
You came

at a great time.

154
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,040
I was just planning to tell them about it.

155
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,240
You arrived before I did.

156
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,000
Since we want to improve our sales performance,

157
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,480
I plan to set up

158
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
a retail store in the city.

159
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,160
You have experience

160
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,959
working outside.

161
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,080
You did great too.

162
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,279
When I think about it,

163
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,639
you're the best candidate for us.

164
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,679
You can be the manager of our retail store.

165
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,600
What do you think?

166
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,879
Mr. Wan,

167
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,159
thank you for your trust.

168
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,519
However, I don't wish to be a manager.

169
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,559
I'm here to discuss other things with you.

170
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,799
Xingfu,

171
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,720
do you know how much

172
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,279
a retail store manager earns per month?

173
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,919
Calm down. We can talk about that later.

174
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,279
Xingfu,

175
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,799
it's tough working out there,

176
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,559
am I right?

177
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,759
I know you're trying to make a living.

178
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
Being a manager is actually pretty good.

179
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,480
Why are you rejecting me?

180
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,399
It's just that I wish
to build a building on the land 

181
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,480
that the village had given us in Niaofei Creek

182
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,879
and turn it into an inn.

183
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,919
Turn it into an inn?

184
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,440
Xingfu,

185
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,720
you need a huge capital for that.

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,240
How do you plan to solve that issue?

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,320
Currently, I'm thinking of something.

188
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,519
However, besides money,

189
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,320
I need to obtain the village's support

190
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:32,279
so that I can have the water,
electricity, and network up and running.

191
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,360
She's talking about

192
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,519
the water, electricity, and network

193
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,159
even before she has obtained enough capital.

194
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,000
What gives you the right?

195
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,080
Mr. Wan,

196
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,200
we can negotiate a deal.

197
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,240
For example,

198
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,879
I can pay the village management fee

199
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,440
or share my profit with the village.

200
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,440
And, regarding your health products,

201
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,000
I can be your agent

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,399
and sell them in our inn by then.

203
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,840
We can negotiate a deal.

204
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,960
There's no need to negotiate anything.

205
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,039
You want to be our agent?

206
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,360
If you do a terrible job,

207
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
not only will you affect our brand,

208
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,759
but you will also implicate the village.

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,120
Chuanjia, calm down for now.

210
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,320
Xingfu,

211
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,480
why must you manage an inn?

212
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,799
Do you have any detailed plans I can see?

213
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,799
This is my proposal.

214
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,039
You can take a look.

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,960
It's because I think

216
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,720
people in the city

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,519
are stressed out from work.

218
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,519
They're under huge pressure.

219
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,039
During weekends,

220
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,840
they'll head out

221
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,919
on a trip

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
or take a walk in parks.

223
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,639
Look at Wan Village.

224
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,399
It has great scenery

225
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,480
and fresh air.

226
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,240
It's a natural park.

227
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,399
However, the living,

228
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,879
food, and sanitary conditions here

229
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,399
are not up to standards.

230
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,360
People who came to Wan Village

231
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,559
said that the place was great.

232
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,600
However, they were pretty exhausted

233
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,919
when they had to travel up and down

234
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,039
and climb a hill.

235
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,320
Say, if we have

236
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
a safe and comfortable place

237
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,279
for them to stay,

238
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,960
it'll be great.

239
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,320
I think

240
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,879
the land in Niaofei Creek

241
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,120
is a great place to build our inn.

242
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,200
It's not that you're not willing to work
under other people.

243
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,679
You're just ambitious.

244
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,600
Let me put it in another way.

245
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,600
You have lofty aspirations.

246
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,240
That's not it.

247
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,759
Mainly,

248
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,679
I just want

249
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,120
to test the water.

250
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,200
What if...

251
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,480
What if we did great?

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,159
Maybe we can attract
more tourists to the village.

253
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,440
If so, we can build up the tourism business

254
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,679
of the village.

255
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,240
Tourism business?

256
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,960
This is good.

257
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,360
If you do a good job,

258
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,919
maybe it might be a new path

259
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,759
for Wan Village to prosper.

260
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,480
What about this, Xingfu?

261
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,159
First, this is a great idea.

262
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,159
If you have any other ideas,

263
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,840
you can talk to Chuanjia

264
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,039
and Cailiang anytime.

265
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,720
We will hold a village committee meeting

266
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,440
in a few days.

267
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,440
We will put this

268
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,360
on our agenda

269
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,240
and discuss it with them.

270
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,679
I have a firm stand

271
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,919
on this.

272
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,360
I will support you

273
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,159
on this project.

274
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,120
If so,

275
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,519
shall I talk to Chuanjia?

276
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,799
That's right.

277
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,039
Chuanjia, tell us your stand.

278
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,960
Sure.

279
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,919
Don't worry, Xingfu.

280
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,559
Since Mr. Wan has already expressed

281
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,879
that he'll be supporting you,

282
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,879
I will definitely not make things difficult

283
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,480
for you.

284
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,519
Xingfu, I expect great things from you.

285
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,480
Work hard

286
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,519
and achieve something great.

287
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,799
Thank you, Mr. Wan.

288
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay. Then...

289
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,039
You can take your time to review it.

290
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,200
Okay.

291
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,600
Let's keep in touch.

292
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay?

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,759
Okay, I'll make a move first.

294
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,320
This lass

295
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,480
is pretty good.

296
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,360
You want to open an inn?

297
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:41,960
Xingfu,

298
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,679
you used to be single.

299
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,519
You can do anything on your own

300
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,720
and make your own decisions.

301
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,799
But now, you're our daughter-in-law.

302
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,879
Not only that, but you're also Qinglai's wife

303
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,279
and the mother of our grandson.

304
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,840
In the future, you should only make a decision

305
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,679
after discussing your ideas with us.

306
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,000
I just wanted to test their reactions.

307
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,159
I didn't expect Mr. Wan to agree to it so quickly.

308
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,960
Besides,

309
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,360
now that I've returned here,

310
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,679
I don't want to spend my days here
without any goals.

311
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,720
I have to get myself a new goal somehow.

312
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,879
Xingfu,

313
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,799
didn't we have a promise?

314
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,159
I said I wouldn't stop you
no matter what you wanted to do.

315
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,000
However, what if you incur losses

316
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,480
after you open the inn?

317
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,159
What should we do then?

318
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:25,840
Precisely.

319
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,440
What should we do if you incur losses?

320
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,480
It's two million yuan, you know?

321
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,279
Our family cannot afford to repay the debt.

322
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,399
We were happy that you guys came back.

323
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,639
We thought we could finally take a breather.

324
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,519
But now, you brought a huge debt home

325
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,360
even before I could take a breather.

326
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,200
Mom, this isn't a debt.

327
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,600
This is what we call risk sharing.

328
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,519
Even if we incur losses,
we don't need to pay them back.

329
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,080
If we make profits,

330
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,840
we'll share them with everyone else.

331
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,639
Do you understand?

332
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
The online thing you said just now...

333
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,639
Crowdfunding?

334
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,600
Yeah, the online crowdfunding.

335
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,519
It will never work.

336
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,120
Who...

337
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,720
Who will invest in your business

338
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
when they don't even know who you are?

339
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,960
I'm sure

340
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,399
they're out of their minds.

341
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,399
This is a new way of procuring wealth

342
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,120
that everyone

343
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,519

00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,540
she didn't come back last night.

854
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,090
Now, she's gone again.

855
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,610
Little Dou has lost his mother again.

856
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,540
Mom, where's Little Dou?

857
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,060
He's sleeping.

858
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:22,860
He's sleeping?

859
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,460
Where are you going?

860
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,650
I'm heading to Xingfu's place.

861
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,980
I have to go.

862
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,060
Wait up.

863
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,250
She's bringing some food to you.

864
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,090
Qingzhi

865
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,570
sent these to you from the city.

866
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,020
These are nuts. They're good for your brain.

867
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,900
Study hard and pass your accounting exam.

868
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,060
Don't just go out and party all day long.

869
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,610
Did you hear me?

870
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,170
Alright, I can handle it myself.

871
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,250
Mom, leave this one in my room.
I'll have it when I come back.

872
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,290
Xiuyu.

873
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,540
Let me send you to Xingfu's place.

874
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,170
Wear your helmet.

875
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,290
Okay.

876
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,380
Mom, see you.

877
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,500
Watch out for the trucks.

878
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,340
Yeah, I know.

879
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,980
See you.

880
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,660
[Xingfu Inn]

881
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,020
Xingfu.

882
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,570
Liuhua, how's business today?

883
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,340
It's pretty quiet today.

884
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,210
So we are not that busy.

885
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,860
Were there any reservations?

886
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,570
No.

887
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,420
Don't worry.

888
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,090
Maybe there will be more customers
during the weekends.

889
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,610
Alright, I got it.

890
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,060
Okay.

891
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,250
Xiuyu,

892
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,210
don't be too absorbed in your study.

893
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,420
Have some fruits.

894
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,540
Thank you, Xingfu.

895
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,730
I have no choice.

896
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,090
The accounting qualification exam
will be open for registration soon.

897
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,650
I have plenty of things
that I haven't memorized yet.

898
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,500
Even so, you need to take a break occasionally.

899
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,610
You need to strike a balance
between work and rest.

900
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,460
I'm sure it's exhausting for you
to sit here for so long.

901
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,690
Get up and do some stretches.

902
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,690
Don't just sit here.

903
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,460
Okay.

904
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,940
It's bad for your eyes if you study
for an extended period.

905
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,610
When you're exhausted,
you should take a look at the scenery around you.

906
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,980
Green is good for the eyes.

907
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,730
Xingfu, your inn is so relaxing.

908
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,500
I totally lost track of the time.

909
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,610
Yeah.

910
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,210
You can study here every day

911
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,250
if you like the place.

912
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,290
At least, it's quiet here.

913
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,170
Xingfu.

914
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,570
Don't you think it's too quiet here?

915
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,900
You don't have any customers.

916
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,250
Yeah, I'm fretting about the same thing.

917
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,340
Before this,

918
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,610
my customers were only some friends

919
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,340
and investors.

920
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,020
Now that it's been some time,

921
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,020
they're getting busy again.

922
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,340
I guess they have no time to frequent my inn now.

923
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,980
Besides, when I do business with people I know,

924
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,340
I have to give them discounts.

925
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,290
In reality, I'm just earning back my capital.

926
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:25,610
Xingfu,

927
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,420
why don't I call my friends and classmates

928
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,460
to come for a stay?

929
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,290
I'll ask them to bring their friends here as well.

930
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,540
What do you think?

931
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,020
That won't work in the long run.

932
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,900
We can't just depend on people
we know to support our inn.

933
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,290
I appreciate your kind intention.

934
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,860
I'll resolve this issue somehow.

935
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,900
You shouldn't worry too much.

936
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,130
Mr. Wu,

937
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,340
this 

938
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,940
is our new dish,

939
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,540
bamboo shoot soup.

940
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,770
Please give it a try.

941
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,690
Okay.

942
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,730
And give me your opinion.

943
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,340
Okay.

944
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,860
Let me have a taste.

945
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:53,860
What do you think?

946
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,020
It's palatable.

947
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,610
So palatable.

948
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,570
It's a delightful dish.

949
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,900
This soup

950
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,020
can solve the troubles of the world.

951
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,130
Is...

952
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,340
Is the soup that good?

953
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,860
I'll get you another bowl.

954
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,610
Okay.

955
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,650
Mr. Wu,

956
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,250
you're our regular.

957
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,940
I'm very thankful to you
for supporting our inn all along.

958
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,860
This soup is on the house.

959
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,820
Why are you being so courteous?

960
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,060
I'm spending money

961
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,500
in order to enjoy the service you provide,

962
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,460
am I right?

963
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,250
We're just taking what we need from each other.

964
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,730
To be honest,

965
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,170
the only reward we can provide to the investors

966
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,380
are the discounted rooms.

967
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,380
You've already used all the discounts.

968
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,020
You've been staying in the standard room
since long ago.

969
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,980
And our business isn't booming.

970
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,650
We don't have any bonuses

971
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,940
to pay you with.

972
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,940
Even so, you didn't pressure us.

973
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,610
I feel that thanking you isn't enough.

974
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,290
You're too courteous.

975
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,340
Xingfu,

976
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,940
do you know

977
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,860
why I stay here for so long?

978
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,610
It's because this inn is quiet

979
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,650
and it helps you with your creative work.

980
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,980
That's not comprehensive enough.

981
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,610
Well,

982
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,460
it's because the dishes are nice.

983
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,500
That's still not comprehensive enough.

984
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,690
You had me.

985
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,770
So, why exactly did you stay here?

986
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,090
Because of the water.

987
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,290
Huh?

988
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,460
The water you provide here,

989
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,570
the spring water,

990
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,540
it's delicious.

991
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,460
Your soup

992
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,860
is made from spring water.

993
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,900
I can tell at first taste.

994
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,020
Remember,

995
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,090
you shouldn't put 

996
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,570
any seasonings in your soup.

997
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,060
It's best if you can retain its original taste.

998
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,020
You're amazing.

999
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,730
You could actually tell?

1000
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,090
The water

1001
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,420
is what we drink usually.

1002
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,020
What's the difference?

1003
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,540
That's a deep topic.

1004
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,610
You see, I enjoy three things in life.

1005
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,570
I enjoy writing,

1006
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,980
eating,

1007
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,460
and drinking tea.

1008
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,570
When you make tea
with the spring water you have here,

1009
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,170
the taste

1010
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,730
is divine.

1011
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,210
My praises cannot do it justice.

1012
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,940
You could tell that the tea tasted different too?

1013
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,650
But of course.

1014
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,130
Xingfu,

1015
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,420
I have a suggestion for you.

1016
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,130
Please tell me.

1017
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,860
The road here

1018
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,500
is just like the Road to Shu,

1019
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,460
especially the uphill road.

1020
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:30,900
It's so difficult to traverse.

1021
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,020
It's riddled with holes.

1022
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:34,820
I just

1023
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,500
hope that you guys can fix the road
as soon as possible.

1024
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,170
I like to take a walk
in order to draw inspiration.

1025
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,940
I think while I walk.

1026
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,210
However, the holes in the road
keep distracting me.

1027
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,380
You're right.

1028
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,170
I reported this issue to the village
before I opened the inn.

1029
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,090
The village agreed to fix the road.

1030
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,420
But in the end, they didn't.

1031
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,060
I'll ask them about it
when I return to the village later.
