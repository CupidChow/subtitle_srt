of the bridal hazing at their wedding

53

then according to Officer Li,

57

what he did

58
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,280
can cause him a few years of jail time.

59
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,520
Is it really so serious?

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,759
Wasn't it just bridal hazing?

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,039
We might think it was bridal hazing.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,319
But they were using

63
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,240
bridal hazing

64
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,400
as an excuse to harass the girl

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,240

always causing trouble?

68
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,400
He has always been rebellious

69
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,439
and was punished a lot.

70

We can't blame anyone

82

but ourselves.

83
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,639
We didn't know the law.

84
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,519
Right?

85
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,160
What they did was outrageous.

86
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,240
This is a classic case

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,879
of indecent assault on a woman with a crowd.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,680
They have to be punished.

and the assistant of Mr. Han.

96
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,439
The last time she helped me

to deal with your case

98
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,839
made Mr. Han very unhappy.

99
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,680
But since Xingyun was helping
with her own sister's case,

100
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,199
he couldn't disagree.

101
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,480
But if Xingyun entrusts me

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,319
again with this case,

103
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,839
I'm afraid

104
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,720
you'll seriously offend him.

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,720
Xingyun, you want

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,839
to become a practicing lawyer.

107
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,639
I'm afraid

108
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,279
he may make things difficult for you.

No matter if I offend him or not,

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,360
he'll play tricks if he wants to.

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,519
If Guan Tao isn't happy,

176
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,279
ask him to see me.

177
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,480
Okay?

178
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,480
Senior,

179
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,519
what do you think we should do?

180
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,159
Han

181
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,919
insists on

182
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,480
taking a part in this case.

183
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,559
We can't do anything.

184
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,440
Let him represent you then.

185
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,000
After all, this case

186
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,120
has clear facts

187
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,080
and evidence.

188
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,919
It can't go wrong anyway.

189
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,080
No way.

190
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,120
Out of the question.

191
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,519
I don't trust him.

192
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,879
I think

193
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,919
I feel more assured

194
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,559
having you help me.

195
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,399
I would love to help you.

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,360
But be it the working experience

197
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,279
or the position in the law firm,

198
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,720
I have no way to stop him.

199
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,039
All major events

200
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,759
are decided by him.

201
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,320
I mean it.

202
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,480
Only with you around

203
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,960
do I feel assured.

204
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,120
So please

205
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,360
don't back out.

206
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,240
Eat first.

207
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,799
I don't want to eat. I'm full.

208
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,399
Eat a little more.

209
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,120
You didn't...

210
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,639
I don't want to.

211
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,720
I'm full.

212
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,399
You...

213
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Keep playing then.

214
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,200
Okay.

215
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,320
I'm going to eat.

216
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,159
Forget it.

217
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,000
It's so late now,

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,080
but Chuanjia isn't back yet.

219
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,440
Dad.

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
Did something happen in Wanjia Group today?

221
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,639
Whatever happens,

222
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,120
is out of my control.

223
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,159
What do you mean?

224
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,679
Did something actually happen?

225
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,039
Ask him when he's back.

226
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,200
He's not answering my call.

227
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,639
Keep calling then.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,600
Dad.

229
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,879
What happened?

230
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,679
Just tell me.

231
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,919
Don't make me worry, okay?

232
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,279
Xingfu!

233
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,799
He Xingfu.

234
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,039
Xingfu, get out!

235
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,519
Where is she?

236
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,000
Where's He Xingfu?

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,320
What's going on?

238
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,120
What happened?

239
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,639
What happened?

240
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,600
Go and ask your daughter-in-law

241
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,840
what she did.

242
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,360
What happened?

243
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,000
Let's speak calmly.

244
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,679
He Xingfu!

245
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,720
Come outside.

246
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,519
Where is she?

247
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,519
He Xingfu!

248
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,240
Do you hear me?

249
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,919
What's going on?

250
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,799
Why are you screaming?

251
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,120
How dare you ask me?

252
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,799
We can't find Chuanjia.

253
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,679
He's missing.

254
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,919
Tell me what you plan to do with this.

255
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,440
What's his missing got to do with us?

256
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,080
Of course, it has something to do with you.

257
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,960
If your sister didn't sue

258
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,120
Chuanjia,

259
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,320
would this happen?

260
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,919
He deserved to be sued for harassing my sister.

261
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,799
Your sister was being seductive.

262
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,720
It has nothing to do with Chuanjia.

263
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,480
Mind your words.

264
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,279
If you keep talking nonsense,

265
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,159
I'll tear off your mouth.

266
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,399
Bring it on.

267
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,639
You want to fight?

268
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,840
Good one, all of you.

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
Since Chuanjia is missing, I would rather die.

270
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,759
Even if he's found,

271
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,360
he will be jailed because of your sister.

272
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,480
I don't want this kind of life.

273
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,720
Come on, hit me.

274
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,320
Hit me.

275
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What are you doing?

276
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,679
Hit me!

277
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,480
What's this about?

278
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,519
What are you trying to do?

279
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,279
This family is bullying us.

280
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,320
They are bullying us!

281
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,480
This family

282
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,919
is horrible.

283
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,519
Let go.

284
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,720
You're not reasonable.

285
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,240
Let's go back.

286
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,480
You guys be the judge of this.

287
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,720
-Ignore her. It's okay.
-What have we done...

288
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,000
-Ignore her.
-to deserve this?

289
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:54,799
That's enough.

290
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,840
Stop being nosy. Go home.

291
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,320
It's over.

292
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,399
Go back to your room.

293
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,519
Go inside, Mom.

294
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,240
Let's go back.

295
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,519
Don't be angry.

296
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,320
It may affect the baby.

297
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,080
Let's go.

298
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:07,799
Let's go.

299
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,360
Qinglai.

300
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,879
What is it, Xingfu?

301
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,960
My stomach aches.

302
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,039
Xingfu.

303
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,799
What's going on?

304
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:50,840
What's wrong?

305
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,039
My stomach aches.

306
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,480
My stomach aches.

307
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:56,919
Stomach?

308
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,039
Xingfu.

309
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,879
You're bleeding.

310
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,879
Don't move.

311
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:05,600
I'm getting Mom.

312
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Don't move.

313
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,799
Mom.

314
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,519
Mom.

315
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,919
Mom.

316
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,000
Xiuyu, get up.

317
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,279
Xingfu is giving birth.

318
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,600
Get up.

319
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,799
Hurry to have a look.

320
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,879
Hurry up. Now.

321
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,159
Hurry up!

322
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:21,919
Xingfu.

323
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,240
Hold on, Xingfu.

324
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,080
Mom!

325
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,840
Mom.

326
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,440
Hurry up, Mom.

327
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,559
I'm coming.

328
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,240
Coming.

329
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,440
I told Xiuyu to borrow Fusheng's car.

330
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,639
Hang in there.

331
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,480
Hang in there.

332
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,120
Mom.

333
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,519
I'm in so much pain.

334
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,240
I can't take it anymore.

335
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,480
Let's go to the Health Center.

336
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,559
There's a doctor there.

337
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,440
All the children

338
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,519
in our village were born there.

339
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,480
Mom, let me do this.

340
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,960
Hurry.

341
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,000
Hang in there, Xingfu.

342
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,720
Hurry up.

343
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,039
-Doctor.
-Doctor.

344
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,919
-Doctor.
-Doctor.

345
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,279
[Medical Area]
Doctor.

346
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:50,960
What's going on?

347
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,519
She's giving birth.

348
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,279
Here, this way.

349
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:52,840
To the delivery room.

350
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,759
Here, come with me.

351
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:54,639
Hurry.

352
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,960
The room at the end.

353
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,519
Where?

354
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,200
This way.

355
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,960
The room at the very end.

356
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,000
Mind the step.

357
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,360
Be careful.

358
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,759
This way.

359
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,039
Here, be careful.

360
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,480
Hurry.

361
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,240
Where?

362
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,720
Here.

363
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,240
This way.

364
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,919
Family members should stay outside.

365
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,120
I'll get Dr. Li and Ms. Zhang.

366
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,240
They know how to deliver a baby.

367
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:10,960
Okay.

368
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,080
Please wait outside.

369
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,240
Measure her blood pressure.

370
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:15,879
Okay.

371
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,840
When in pain,

372
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,879
take a deep breath,

373
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,440
okay?

374
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,159
Push your legs down

375
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,360
and hold your fist tight.

376
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,440
Remember that.

377
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,799
How is it?

378
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Her blood pressure is 80/50.

379
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,799
It's low.

380
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,039
Disinfect, fast.

381
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,600
Okay.

382
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,679
Deep breath.

383
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,840
Deep breath.

384
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,039
Push your legs downward.

385
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:42,639
Use more strength.

386
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,120
Push.

387
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,600
Use more strength.

388
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,279
Come on.

389
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,279
We can see the head now.

390
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,519
Catch your breath.

391
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,320
And get ready for another push.

392
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,799
Now, again.

393
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,320
That's right.

394
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,320
Another deep breath.

395
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,840
Deep breath.

396
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,600
Push your legs downward.

397
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:57,960
Hold on tight.

398
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,000
Push.

399
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,440
Don't be afraid.

400
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,879
We're here.

401
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,519
Don't worry.

402
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,440
You'll be just fine.

403
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,240
One more time, okay?

404
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,440
Push your legs downward.

405
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,559
The head is out.

406
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,000
I can see it, it's out.

407
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't be afraid of the pain.

408
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,399
All women need to endure the pain.

409
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,840
You'll be done soon.

410
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:18,919
Come on.

411
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,840
Just once more.

412
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,080
-Come on.
-You got this.

413
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,039
Doctor.

414
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,519
Alright.

415
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,080
Once again.

416
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,159
Come on.

417
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,000
Deep breath.

418
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:28,639
Use some strength.

419
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,440
Push your legs downward.

420
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,279
Use more strength.

421
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:34,960
Almost there.

422
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,600
Use more strength.

423
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:38,519
Okay.

424
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,320
Good.

425
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,440
Relax.

426
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,000
Come on.

427
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:42,440
Again.

428
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,559
You got this.

429
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,600
Breathe.

430
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:46,519
Okay.

431
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,559
The baby is almost out.

432
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:49,600
Use more strength.

433
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,919
Use more strength.

434
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,080
Come on.

435
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,759
Use more strength.

436
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,639
Very good.

437
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,320
You are doing well.

438
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,320
Why isn't the baby out yet?

439
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
The baby is almost out.

440
00:15:59,519 --> 00:15:59,919
Come on.

441
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,519
Come on.

442
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,360
Open your legs.

443
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,759
Okay.

444
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,440
Push. Use more strength.

445
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,919
Use more strength.

446
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,759
Use more strength.

447
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,039
Deep breath.

448
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,240
Almost there.

449
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,360
You can do it.

450
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,320
Almost there.

451
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,279
The child is born.

452
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:19,559
The child is born.

453
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,570
The baby's born.

454
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,220
Really?

455
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,100
Yes. Listen.

456
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,290
Yes. I heard it.

457
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:25,810
Is the child born?

458
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,220
Yes.

459
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,260
-I heard it.
-I heard it.

460
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,140
The baby's crying.

461
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,260
The baby's delivered.

462
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,460
The bleeding can't be stopped.

463
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,530
Nurse.

464
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,380
Nurse.

465
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,530
Coming.

466
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,890
The mother is bleeding a lot.

467
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,100
Prepare to send her to the county hospital.

468
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,500
Hurry.

469
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,650
It's risky to transfer her now.

470
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,620
She's still bleeding.

471
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,050
We should do a blood transfusion first.

472
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,620
But we don't have plasma storage.

473
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,220
Call 120 for an ambulance.

474
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,770
And ask her family to help out.

475
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,140
Hurry.

476
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,860
Okay.

477
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,460
Doctor.

478
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,690
The baby is a boy

479
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,570
and he's safe.

480
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,050
But the mother is bleeding a lot.

481
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,740
She needs a blood transfusion.

482
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,620
Bleeding a lot?

483
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,410
Yes.

484
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,620
Take my blood then.

485
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,340
What's your blood type?

486
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,770
Well...

487
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,020
I don't know either.

488
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,330
Besides, your blood alone

489
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,220
isn't enough.

490
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,420
You have to think of something else.

491
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,460
We have to think of a way?

492
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:10,810
What...

493
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,090
How are we supposed to think of a way?

494
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,180
-Indeed.
-Indeed.

495
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,330
What should we do?

496
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,740
Get the hemostatic agent

497
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,180
from the pharmacy and inject it into the mother.

498
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,530
Mr. Wan.

499
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,700
Mr. Wan.

500
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,090
Mr. Wan.

501
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,220
Mr. Wan.

502
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,900
It's ready, Doctor Li.

503
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:03,000
[Village Branch Committee of Wan Village]

504
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,770
Fellow villagers of Wan Village,

505
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,980
fellow folks,

506
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,770
pay attention, please.

507
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,700
There's a patient

508
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,420
in the Health Center who's bleeding a lot.

509
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,220
She needs a blood transfusion urgently.

510
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,570
Everyone

511
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,020
who's older than 20

512
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,180
and younger than 40,

513
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,530
please gather at the Health Center immediately.

514
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,460
Please gather at the Health Center immediately.

515
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,810
Where's the blood?

516
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,900
Why isn't the blood here yet?

517
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,530
The mother is unconscious.

518
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,850
Is this the line for blood type testing?

519
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,570
Yes.

520
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,420
The blood type matched.

521
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,740
The blood is here.

522
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,740
Inject directly with the needle.

523
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,570
Don't wait for the blood bag.

524
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,460
Okay.

525
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,020
Hurry.

526
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,500
When the patient's condition is stable,

527
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,660
transfer her to the county hospital.

528
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,330
Okay.

529
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,530
Transfer the next syringe immediately.

530
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:22,660
Mr. Wan.

531
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,090
You saved us.

532
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,850
It's okay, Youde.

533
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,090
It's a matter of life and death.

534
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,660
Thank you so much.

535
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,610
Thank you.

536
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,020
Don't thank me.

537
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,220
We live in the same village.

538
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,460
Guan.

539
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,460
Since Xingyun insists on

540
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,570
having both of us

541
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,660
handle this case together,

542
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,570
please share your opinion.

543
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,810
It doesn't matter

544
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,980
who handles this case.

545
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,500
Just follow the normal procedure.

546
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,290
We just need to do our part.

547
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,530
Pass the evidence to the police...

548
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,460
According to what you said,

549
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,900
a lawyer's job is too easy.

550
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,020
You should first

551
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,090
think about the feeling

552
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,940
of the litigant.

553
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,050
And also

554
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,370
the influence of the verdict

555
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,090
on our law firm.

556
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,290
This case

557
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,980
involves Xingyun's privacy,

558
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,530
hence

559
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,530
the court won't hear it openly.

560
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,810
No. You still don't understand

561
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,610
what I mean.

562
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,810
Whether

563
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,770
the case is heard openly or not

564
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,700
doesn't matter.

565
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,290
No one cares in society.

566
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,130
You know what matters here?

567
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:36,940
If Xingyun

568
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,810
insists on suing,

569
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,020
she'll become very famous

570
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,770
in this profession.

571
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,330
Xingyun,

572
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,020
is this what you hope for?

573
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,290
Xingyun

574
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,610
is the victim.

575
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,020
She should be sympathized with and supported.

576
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,220
Yes.

577
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,940
She should be sympathized with and supported.

578
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,570
Guan.

579
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,610
You

580
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,330
are an upright person

581
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,980
with principles.

582
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,130
Although I don't quite like you,

583
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,610
I've never been hard

584
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,700
on you.

585
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,020
Because I trust you.

586
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,660
However,

587
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,610
how many people

588
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,740
in this society are like you?

589
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,130
The majority of the people

590
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,500
pretend to sympathize

591
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,220
while waiting to make fun of you.

592
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,700
Am I right?

593
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:30,610
Xingyun.

594
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,420
You still want to be in this profession

595
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,850
for the coming decades.

596
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,330
Are you willing

597
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,130
to endure

598
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,180
the judgmental look

599
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,370
of your peers in the future?

600
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,940
Can you stand that?

601
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,090
We can't just

602
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,330
give up on this case.

603
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,530
I don't mean that.

604
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,420
I just think

605
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,740
we shouldn't rush things.

606
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,500
After all,

607
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,900
we have the evidence.

608
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:53,700
Right?

609
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,500
Your case

610
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,290
can be filed anytime.

611
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,660
I think

612
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,610
we should contact

613
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,660
them first.

614
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,810
This helps us to plan

615
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,050
a better strategy.

616
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,460
What do you think, Xingyun?

617
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,180
Dad.

618
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,530
Food is ready.

619
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,940
Eat something.

620
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
You didn't sleep well last night.

621
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,290
Is there news about Chuanjia?

622
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,810
He came back at dawn.

623
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,940
What did he do?

624
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,810
He went drinking.

625
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,420
He's still sleeping.

626
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,610
He still had the mood to drink?

627
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,090
I think

628
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,290
you shouldn't have been involved

629
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,290
in Xingfu's matter.

630
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,050
Look at her attitude,

631
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,090
she's so arrogant.

632
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,220
She would have deserved it if she died.

633
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,370
That's karma taking its course.

634
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,090
How can you say that?

635
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,050
How can you even suggest

636
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,130
such things?

637
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,330
I don't expect you to earn a lot

638
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,460
nor do I care that you work sloppily.

639
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,610
If you have time,

640
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,530
you should read more

641
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,770
and become more educated.

642
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,810
Chuanjia behaves like this

643
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,370
because of you.

644
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,610
Why is it relevant to me?

645
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,220
As the saying goes,

646
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,220
A husband will have fewer problems
if he has a good wife.

647
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:25,940
Blow it.

648
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,260
If you were able to keep him in check,

649
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,940
he wouldn't keep causing trouble out there.

650
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,530
It's easy for you to say.

651
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,260
If you couldn't control him,

652
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,180
how could I?

653
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,850
How can you blame it on me?

654
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,130
You can't handle Chuanjia.

655
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,660
Can't you even handle your child?

656
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,290
Here.

657
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,610
Look at him.

658
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,130
He hasn't eaten a meal

659
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,050
at this table properly

660
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,700
since he was born.

661
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,900
You spoiled him.

662
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,180
All he does is play.

663
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,660
You should teach him something useful.

664
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,940
Or else you'll suffer

665
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,900
when he grows up.

666
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,850
Alright.

667
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,220
Dad.

668
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,500
Your mood is bad,

669
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,700
everyone is not good enough for you.

670
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,740
Enjoy your meal.

671
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,700
You're even mad with your grandson.

672
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,500
Take some rest after eating.

673
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,850
Don't blame us

674
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,370
if your blood pressure gets high again.

675
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,940

Senior,

what should we do now?

681
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,260
This case

682
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,940
can be handled in any way.

683
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,570
What he said wasn't wrong.

684
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,740
This problem

685
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,460
does indeed exist.

Most importantly,

what goal

I...

I don't think

I know what to do now.

693
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,330
Hello.

694
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,090
Qinglai,

695
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:13,660
what is it?

696
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,370
Xingyun.

697
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,460
Your sister gave birth prematurely last night.

698
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,020
What?

699
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,500
How is my sister?

700
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,570
How is the child?

701
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,900
The child is fine.

702
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,420
But your sister

703
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:26,810
bled a lot.

704
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,500
Wait.

705
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,020
Hold on.

706
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,500
Where is my sister now?

707
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,500
She's sent to the county hospital.

708
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,260
They stopped the bleeding.

709
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,900
I came home to collect something,

710
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,900
then I'll be with her in the hospital.

711
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
I just want

712
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,980
to inform you.

713
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,530
Qinglai.

714
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,050
Why

715
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:45,980
didn't you

716
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,180
inform me earlier?

717
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,260
I didn't dare to.

718
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,660
I don't want you to be worried.

719
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,050
Does my mother know about it?

720
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,850
I haven't told her yet.

721
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,530
I'm planning to tell her

722
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,660
when your sister gets better

723
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,570
in a couple of days.

724
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,420
That's not a bad idea.

725
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,130
Please send me

726
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,090
the address.

727
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,290
I'll go visit her now.

728
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:05,980
Okay.

729
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,660
Sir.

730
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,290
How much is this fruit basket?

731
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,700
168 yuan.

732
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,330
So expensive.

733
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:07,366
[Han Shengjie. Chief]

734
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,850
Yidao Law Firm.

735
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,460
What's up?

736
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,260
My client

737
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,370
is one of our employees.

738
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,260
You should know her too.

739
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,660
Her name

740
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,090
is He Xingyun.

741
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,610
What do you want?

742
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,530
It's not about what I want,

743
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,740
but what she wants.

744
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,980
What does she want then?

745
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,130
She wants you to be jailed.

746
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,420
She said you harmed her.

747
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,180
Who does she think she is?

748
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,610
Would I be jailed

749
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,460
on her will?

750
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,740
Does she own the court

751
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,370
or something?

752
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,460
Can she control everything?

753
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,460
She doesn't own the court.

754
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,900
The court requires evidence.

755
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,810
She has a video.

756
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,290
I watched it.

757
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,130
It shouldn't be a problem

758
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,020
to get you a five-year jail time

759
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,660
for rallying a crowd to sexually assault
a lady in public space.

760
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,370
If this evidence

761
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,940
is sent to the police,

762
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,740
the Procuratorate will directly

763
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
prosecute you.

764
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,900
You've been doing big business

765
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,530
in Wanjia Group for so many years.

766
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,260
You should have some common sense in law.

767
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,050
Our group has a legal adviser.

768
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,180
I asked him about it.

769
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,130
You just explained

770
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,700
the matter so well to me.

771
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,770
You aren't here

772
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,090
just to tell me this, right?

773
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,090
Does the girl

774
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,260
have other thoughts?

775
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,460
She no longer wants to sue me?

776
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,850
It's not her.

777
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,740
It's me who doesn't want to sue you.

778
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,420
So what?

779
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,660
You don't make the call here.

780
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,980
Whether I can make the call or not

781
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,460
depends on you.

782
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,050
He Xingyun

783
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,130
is our employee.

784
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,090
She's also a trainee who works under me.

785
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,900
I can make a big difference

786
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,980
on her future

787
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,980
of becoming

788
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,700
a practicing lawyer.

789
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,700
I finally understand now.

790
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,370
You

791
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,020
are using her case

792
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,180
to take advantage of me.

793
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,850
Can you be sure

794
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,260
that she won't submit

795
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,700
the evidence?

796
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,810
I can try.

797
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,610
I think

798
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,460
I can make a difference.

799
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,220
Good.

800
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,810
If you can sort this out,

801
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,610
I'll give you

802
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,530
however much money you want.

803
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,770
I don't want money.

804
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,610
I'm a lawyer.

805
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,260
I can't do illegal things.

806
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,770
I can't receive money

807
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,700
from an unknown source.

808
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,370
Then what do you want?

809
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,530
Here's the thing.

810
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,180
This is the promotional material of our firm.

811
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,660
Take a look if you're interested.

812
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,900
If you

813
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,810
trust us,

814
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,460
I hope

815
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,700
that all the future legal affairs

816
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,220
of Wanjia Group

817
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,130
can be entrusted to Yidao Law Firm.

818
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,420
You sure have a long-term plan, huh?

819
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,770
But I can't decide

820
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,740
on this matter. I don't have a say on this.

821
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,330
I know.

822
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,740
This must be decided by the chairman.

823
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,530
But isn't Mr. Wan your father?

824
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,370
Members of the same family
should be able to reach an agreement.

825
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,900
My father will never

826
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,660
make a deal with you

827
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,660
because of such a matter.

828
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,980
He's closer to the Organization than to me.

829
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,570
He would rather I go to jail

830
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,260
than betraying

831
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,700
any of his principles.

832
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,180
If you want to negotiate sincerely,

833
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,810
please change your condition.

834
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,500
I can give you more money.

835
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,260
As I said,

836
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,130
I can't receive money from an unknown source.

837
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,260
We won't be able to strike a deal then.

838
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,090
Indeed.

839
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,810
I get it now.

840
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,770
It's hard for you to persuade your father.

841
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:23,940
It's also hard

842
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,290
for me to dissuade Xingyun

843
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,260
from suing you.

844
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,500
However,

845
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,180
where there is a will,

846
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,530
there is a way.

847
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,740
Why don't we both try it out first?

848
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,050
[People's Hospital]
Mr. Han, I'm in the hospital.

849
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,610
My sister gave birth prematurely.

850
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,770
I came to visit her.

851
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,530
How is she?

852
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,330
She's fine now.

853
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,020
She has to be hospitalized for a few days.

854
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,740
Xingyun,

855
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,260
I went to Wan Village just now

856
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,900
to find out more about your case.

857
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,660
Let's meet when you get back,

858
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,420
okay?

859
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:12,940
Okay.

860
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:14,660
What about this?

861
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,900
Let's meet

862
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,290
at the restaurant downstairs.

863
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,570
Mr. Han,

864
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,660
should we ask Mr. Guan to come along?

865
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,740
I think

866
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,900
we should talk privately.

867
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
Alright then.

868
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,620
Sir.

869
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,470
Your dishes are all here.

870
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,620
Okay, thank you.

871
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,790
Please leave.

872
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,470
We want to talk privately.

873
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:47,900
Okay.

874
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,900
Xingyun.

875
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,710
I went to Wan Village

876
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,990
to find out more about the situation.

877
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,820
I also met

878
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,100
the general manager of Wanjia Group,

879
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,340
the one who harmed you.

880
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,820
That horrible lad is really something.

881
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,270
He offered me money as I arrived.

882
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,950
I rejected it firmly.

883
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,180
Really?

884
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,270
Of course.

885
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,340
I represent you.

886
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,070
How would I take his money?

887
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,550
You probably thought the money was too little.

888
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,710
Xingyun, I know

889
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,790
you're prejudiced

890
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,860
against me because of

891
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,230
what happened in Shanghai.

892
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,750
But after all, I've been

893
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,070
a lawyer for many years.

894
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,140
I work with the law,

895
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,900
right?

896
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,180
One can be in the gray zone,

897
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,860
but he can never do illegal things.

898
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,030
If I took his money,

899
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,230
I would be receiving a bribe.

900
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,340
I surely won't do that.

901
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,900
That's reassuring.

902
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,820
Thank you, Mr. Han.

903
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,030
However,

904
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,900
we have to be clear

905
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,580
about one thing.

906
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,820
What kind of result

907
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,510
do you expect

908
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,860
to get from this case?

909
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,550
To be more exact,

910
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,510
what do you want?

911
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,350
Look.

912
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,780
According to the current situation,

913
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,950
the accused

914
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,470
can be sentenced

915
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,950
to at least five years

916
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,030
in prison.

917
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,950
But you've read up a lot.

918
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,910
The actual punishment

919
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,910
can also be only three years.

920
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,390
Especially in this case.

921
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,700
Everyone drank alcohol,

922
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,740
including you.

923
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,660
The accused

924
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,950
only needs

925
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,910
to behave well

926
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,780
during the hearing,

927
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,070
show remorse,

928
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,470
find a relatively good lawyer,

929
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,350
and have some people write him

930
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,510
a good evaluation letter,

931
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,870
he might eventually get

932
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,740
three years in prison
and three years of probation.

933
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,260
Am I right?

934
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,580
Here comes

935
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,660
the problem.

936
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,470
The court

937
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,350
reached a decision.

938
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:04,950
The accused

939
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,910
is released home.

940
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,350
This matter is settled.

941
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,300
This matter

942
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,470
has nearly no impact on him.

943
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,180
He can live his usual life.

944
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,660
But what do you get?

945
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,220
Will you

946
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,030
get your revenge?

947
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,510
Will you get a promotion with a raise?

948
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,910
Or will you get notoriety

949
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,950
and become the joke of this field?

950
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,780
You lose more than you gain.

951
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,070
So what are you actually trying to say here?

952
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,470
What I mean

953
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,780
is that you should negotiate

954
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,300
with him using your evidence.

955
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,350
Maximize

956
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,350
your gain legally,

957
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,780
while giving him

958
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,950
a certain punishment.

959
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,030
Do you mean

960
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,700
that I should use my suffering and sorrow

961
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,470
to make a deal?

962
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,510
I don't think this is a deal.

963
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,180
This is just another type of punishment.

964
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,740
But this also

965
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,180
involves the benefits you want to get

966
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,660
for the law firm, right?

967
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,550
Well.

968
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,100
Why else would I put in this effort?

969
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,100
Just because I sympathize with you?

970
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,870
There are many people
in this world worth sympathizing with.

971
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,140
Can I sympathize with all of them?

972
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,780
You're very honest indeed.

973
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,030
People like us

974
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,220
are real.

975
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:27,510
So,

976
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,620
with the premise

977
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,620
that you agree

978
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,510
with my proposal,

979
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,260
we shall calm down

980
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,430
and talk to them

981
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,180
about the compensation

982
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,390
in detail.

983
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,180
At least in the short term,

984
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,780
you can pay off

985
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,390
your credit card bills,

986
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,910
you won't have to worry about your rent.

987
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,580
You can even buy

988
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,030
a new house,

989
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,260
a home that belongs to yourself.

990
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,030
This is more realistic.

991
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,580
Right?

992
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,350
Think twice

993
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,910
about this matter.

994
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,070
Miss,

995
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,300
harder, please.

996
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:06,990
Okay.

997
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,870
Hu.

998
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,780
How have you been

999
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
in Wanjia Group?

1000
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,700
Ever since I became

1001
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,990
the legal adviser of Wanjia Group,

1002
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,950
other than

1003
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,660
some regular legal contracts,

1004
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,700
there's nothing much

1005
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,070
to do.

1006
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,620
To be honest,

1007
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,950
the money of Wanjia Group

1008
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,780
is rather easy to earn.

1009
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,300
That's because we're on the same channel.

1010
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,550
We share similar views

1011
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,660
and interests.

1012
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,070
That's right.

1013
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,990
I have never

1014
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,100
mistreated you, right?

1015
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,100
I never leave you out

1016
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,510
when I have fun, right?

1017
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,300
Mr. Wan.

1018
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,220
What you did

1019
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,550
was very good.

1020
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,870
I have a favor to ask.

1021
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,140
Don't be so polite.

1022
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Just tell me,

1023
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,700
I'll do anything

1024
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,180
to help you.

1025
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,390
Then resign from the Group.

1026
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:05,990
What?

1027
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,550
Are you kidding?

1028
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,260
Are you serious?

1029
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,660
Girls.

1030
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,990
Please give us some space.

1031
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,260
What do you mean?

1032
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,510
Nothing special.

1033
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,390
Just

1034
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,100
resign.

1035
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,990
Is Mr. Wan still angry with me

1036
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,950
because of the land acquisition?

1037
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,220
I can explain it to him.

1038
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,780
This has nothing to do with my father.

1039
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,550
Something happened

1040
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,550
on my side.

1041
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,350
It's about the girl who wants to sue me.

1042
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,030
You can count on me then.

1043
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,550
I can be your lawyer.

1044
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,140
This is the time for me to help you out.

1045
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:53,830
Hu.

1046
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,030
Once this case is filed,

1047
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,580
you know the future situation

1048
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,870
better than me.

1049
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,260
Can you be sure that I won't be sentenced?

1050
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,140
But who can be sure

1051
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,550
to get you

1052
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,510
the result you want?

1053
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,470
Someone can.

1054
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,220
Tell me

1055
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:11,990
about it.

1056
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,830
How can he do it?

1057
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,830
Don't ask

1058
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,870
about the specifics.

1059
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,070
Anyway, someone can do it.

1060
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,390
I just need a small favor from you.

1061
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,220
Does Mr. Wan know about this?

1062
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,510
What did your father say?

1063
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,140
I don't want my father to know,

1064
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,220
that's why I'm asking for your favor.

1065
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,550
Think about it, Hu.

1066
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,300
If you

1067
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,580
don't resign and let him join the Group,

1068
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,100
I have to be jailed.

1069
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,830
If I were to be jailed,

1070
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,180
do you think you

1071
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,660
can still work as the legal adviser?

1072
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,070
Dad.

1073
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:57,990
Please leave.

1074
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,470
Okay.

1075
00:39:59,220 --> 00:39:59,780
Hello, Mr. Wan.

1076
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,700
What's going on with this?

1077
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,910
Well, Hu didn't do

1078
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,030
his job well

1079
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,260
and had a short temper.

1080
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,830
A few days ago, I argued with him

1081
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,910
because of work,

1082
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,990
then he just resigned.

1083
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,300
It's true that Hu isn't that capable.

1084
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,780
I always wanted to fire him.

1085
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
But you were the one who always

1086
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,030
put in good words for him.

1087
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,430
Take a seat and listen to me.

1088
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,390
Our group

1089
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,740
is developing and expanding.

1090
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,550
There are more and more

1091
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,470
legal affairs.

1092
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,740
We didn't take this field

1093
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,660
very seriously.

1094
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,260
I hope that in the future,

1095
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,220
we'll have

1096
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,870
a more capable legal team.

1097
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,950
You're right.

1098
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,700
You've been spurring me on,

1099
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,070
I must improve myself.

1100
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:44,660
Whatever.

1101
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,180
This time, I found

1102
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,180
a bigger law firm.

1103
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,390
They can help us

1104
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,550
reorganize

1105
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,620
the legal affairs

1106
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,910
of our company.

1107
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,100
The only thing

1108
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,390
is that their consultant fees

1109
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,740
are higher than Hu's.

1110
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,470
Do you know this law firm well?

1111
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,830
Which law firm is that?

1112
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,990
Is it capable enough?

1113
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,700
Here's the company profile.

1114
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,070
Yidao Law Firm.

1115
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,470
It's a famous law firm

1116
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,300
in our province.

1117
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,070
This name sounds familiar.

1118
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,220
Isn't this

1119
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,870
the law firm that represented the Wangs

1120
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,550
in our previous lawsuit?

1121
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,510
Yes.

1122
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,220
That's the one.

1123
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,830
Because of that matter,

1124
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,660
I thought they were quite capable.

1125
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,870
That's why I chose them.

1126
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,300
As long as they're capable,

1127
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,660
the fee isn't a problem.

1128
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:28,620
Okay.

1129
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,780
You shall handle this.

1130
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,550
