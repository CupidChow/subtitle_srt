[The Story of Xing Fu]

00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,950
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,519
Security guard?

4
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,799
Does it mean that I have to guard the doors?

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,920
Qinglai.

6
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,840
It's not like any other security guard job.

7
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,560
Yani's father

8
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,120
spoke to the department of safety and security
of their company

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,519
and begged them

10
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,640
to make you the security guard
at the Municipal Council.

11
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,159
That's where your father-in-law works.

12
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,200
Precisely.

13
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,040
Qinglai.

14
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,640
You

15
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,000
will be serving the country.

16
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,079
From now on,

17
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,480
you'll be a public servant.

18
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,120
Oh!

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,599
I should've guessed it.

20
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,080
He's the director
of the Organization Department.

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,360
There's nothing he can't do

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,439
as long as he wants to.

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,120
Sure.

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,960
That's nice.

25
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:16,599
Then...

26
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,879
About that...

27
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,599
I mean...

28
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,360
How much

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,280
will I be earning

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,159
every month?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,639
I guess

32
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,599
slightly over 2,000 yuan.

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
Slightly over 2,000 yuan?

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,159
Wait.

35
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,800
I'm going

36
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,520
to work

37
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,039
for the government.

38
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,280
Is that all I'm going to get?

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,680
That's quite a lot.

40
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,280
I only earn 1,500 yuan a month.

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,879
How can you compare yourself to me?

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,080
I'm a man.

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
I have to earn more than you.

44
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,639
Qinglai.

45
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,879
I hold a master's degree

46
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,919
and I only earn slightly over 3,000 yuan a month.

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,039
If you were to find another job yourself,

48
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:47,599
you probably wouldn't

49
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,159
be able to land yourself such a good offer.

50
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,159
Right?

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,560
Moreover,

52
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,759
if you join the public service,

53
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,240
they will provide you with
five social insurance and one housing fund.

54
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,319
Your future will be guaranteed.

55
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,759
Qinglai.

56
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,159
We need to be grateful.

57
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:58,680
Right.

58
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,439
Grateful.

59
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,479
Grateful.

60
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,120
I'm always grateful.

61
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,360
Sure.

62
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,560
Then...

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,280
Extend

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,639
my gratitude to your father-in-law.

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,560
Yeah.

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,719
Extend our gratitude to Yani's dad.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,120
Don't worry.

68
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,639
I will make sure to send your word to him.

69
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,159
Sure.

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,080
I will be

71
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,199
a public servant.

72
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,800
Xingfu.

73
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,599
Where is the photocopy paper?

74
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
Where did you keep them?

75
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,680
It's right here.

76
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,479
-Thanks.
-We're only left with these.

77
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,520
It's time we restock.

78
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,639
It'll be cheaper if we buy more.

79
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,039
Don't throw away the used papers.

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,039
I've organized them

81
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,879
and placed them here.

82
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,600
I've put all the papers here,

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,560
so I can place it

84
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,480
under my lunchbox.

85
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,319
Wait.

86
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
You want to place this under your lunchbox?

87
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,680
Didn't you say that we should be thrifty?

88
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,160
You said that the business

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,920
has been slow

90
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,199
and told us to work hard and be more frugal.

91
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,399
You also mentioned...

92
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,480
Tight...

93
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,279
Tight...

94
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:36,680
Money...

95
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,319
Politics?

96
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,879
Tight monetary policy.

97
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,160
Tight monetary policy.

98
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,879
Ms. Xingfu.

99
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,360
You're neither practicing
tight monetary policy,

100
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,399
nor being frugal.

101
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,959
You're just wasting resources.

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,079
Wasting resources?

103
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,199
Look.

104
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:49,839
Tell you what.

105
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,399
Take this photocopy paper for an example.

106
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,120
You can use both sides.

107
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,040
You can flip it

108
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,199
and use the other side.

109
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:56,839
Look.

110
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,240
Place it in there,

111
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,120
and you can use it again.

112
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,199
I see.

113
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:02,879
Be careful.

114
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,360
Doing this

115
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,000
is good for both the environment and our wallets.

116
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,800
It'll be very wasteful

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,079
to place the paper under your lunchbox.

118
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,399
Moreover, if you really want to place something
under your lunchbox,

119
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,720
can't you just use

120
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,439
the free newspaper?

121
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,000
You're just...

122
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:15,959
Fine.

123
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,639
You're just...

124
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,199
How do I put this?

125
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,120
You won't know how expensive the essentials are

126
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,680
when you're not the one who pays for them.

127
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,319
I got it.

128
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,839
I won't place them under my lunchbox again.

129
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,560
I got it.

130
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,720
Don't...

131
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,360
Don't pass out here.

132
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm feeling really dizzy right now.

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,759
Hang in there.

134
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,920
I'll get you water.

135
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,920
Have some water.

136
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,800
Thank you.

137
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,319
I have something to tell you.

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,600
I would like to take a half-day off tomorrow.

139
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll be doing

140
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,120
some property viewings tomorrow.

141
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,040
I don't want to keep living
under someone else's roof.

142
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,240
Go ahead.

143
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:50,600
Okay.

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,240
Xingfu.

145
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,439
You're too extravagant.

146
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,360
These disposable cups

147
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,959
are meant for clients.

148
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,240
We should all just use

149
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,519
our own mugs.

150
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,560
Do you know how much one of these costs?

151
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,040
How much?

152
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,519
Too much.

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,199
Fine. I got it.

154
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,360
What are you doing?

155
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,839
I...

156
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,480
Let me clean it.

157
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,240
Are you going to let the clients reuse this?

158
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,759
That's very unhygienic.

159
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,879
Don't do it again.

160
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,160
Sure.

161
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,319
Wait.

162
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,639
Since I've used this,

163
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,279
I should drink more.

164
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,399
Isn't this cap

165
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,839
a little too big?

166
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,839
Not at all.

167
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,000
It fits you perfectly.

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,160
It's as if it was custom-made for you.

169
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,279
Qinglai.

170
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
You are born to wear this uniform.

171
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,759
Everyone will fear you

172
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,240
when you're standing at the gate
with this fierce look.

173
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,360
That's not true.

174
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,879
You addressed Mr. Xu as your uncle

175
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,680
when he came in the other day.

176
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,079
That's when I learned about the truth.

177
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,279
What truth?

178
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,319
Like uncle,

179
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,639
like nephew.

180
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,360
What are you trying to say?

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,399
Qinglai, listen to me.

182
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,600
Tang Sanzang went through 81 challenges

183
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,680
before he could bring back
the Buddhist Scriptures.

184
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,279
Look at me.

185
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,199
I'm only a security guard,

186
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,639
but I have to go through many challenges as well.

187
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,319
First of all, there's the training,

188
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:27,920
then the examination,

189
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,839
and then the assessment.

190
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,759
It took me a lot of effort.

191
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,199
I'm not like you.

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,800
It must be nice having connections.

193
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,199
I don't have

194
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,160
any connections.

195
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,120
I don't.

196
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,839
You know Mr. Xu.

197
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,879
Isn't that a connection?

198
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,519
Qinglai.

199
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,959
From now on, I, Song Xiaoshan,

200
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,879
will obey you.

201
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,360
I'll run errands for you.

202
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,800
I'll do everything you say,

203
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,279
so please take care of me.

204
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,160
Mr. Xu,

205
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,759
you have a meeting at 2 PM later.

206
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,920
All the departments are ready

207
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,879
to report their work to you.

208
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,399
Bring Wang and Li with you.

209
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:01,839
Also...

210
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:02,360
Also...

211
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,360
Mr. Sun.

212
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,120
He'll lead all the members

213
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,240
to go through the whole thing again.

214
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,759
The smaller the matter is,
the more careful we should be.

215
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,519
You're right.

216
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,079
Qinglai.

217
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,920
Wasn't that Mr. Xu?

218
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:13,759
Yes.

219
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,079
Why didn't you

220
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,040
say hi to him?

221
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,079
He was working.

222
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,759
We have nothing important to tell him, right?

223
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,199
Skipping a hi won't hurt.

224
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,000
We should say hi

225
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,639
when it's necessary.

226
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,500
[Security]

227
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,679
Sir,

228
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,879
do you think

229
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
you can offer me a cheaper rate?

230
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,399
How cheap are you expecting?

231
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,759
What about 600 yuan?

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,679
600 yuan?

233
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,039
That's very bold of you.

234
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:46,919
Tell you what.

235
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,799
This is the cheapest I can offer

236
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,320
for this house.

237
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,559
1,000 yuan.

238
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,279
But this place is so far from the city center.

239
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,799
Far?

240
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,679
You get fresh air here.

241
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,279
You can go for a jog in the morning.

242
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,200
Exercise

243
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,960
can make you healthier.

244
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,080
Jogging

245
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
is quite time-consuming.

246
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,399
What about this?

247
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,879
Why don't you rent it to me?

248
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,120
And I...

249
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
I'll clean the place for you.

250
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,960
Clean the place?

251
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,559
I'm renting a house,

252
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,039
not hiring a housekeeper.

253
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,000
What about this?

254
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,000
Why don't you

255
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,919
try somewhere else?

256
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,120
Hey.

257
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,919
Li.

258
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,200
Yes. I can hear you.

259
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,960
Go ahead.

260
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,960
My goodness.

261
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,120
Sir.

262
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,039
Are you all right?

263
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,559
Sir.

264
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,320
Sir.

265
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Sir, are you all right?

266
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,000
Sir.

267
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
Are you okay, sir?

268
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,519
I think my legs are stuck.

269
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,360
I can't get them out.

270
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,639
Can you call an ambulance for me?

271
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,360
Sure.

272
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:27,879
Hey.

273
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,960
Is this 120?

274
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,679
There is a car crash here

275
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,240
at Dongrun Road, the old town.

276
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,440
The driver is stuck

277
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,799
and he can't get out of his car.

278
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,240
Yes, he's conscious.

279
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,960
He can articulate.

280
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:40,799
Okay.

281
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,679
Please come here as soon as possible.

282
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,559
Hey.

283
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,519
110?

284
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,159
There's a car crash here

285
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
at Dongrun Road, the old town.

286
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,759
The door is stuck

287
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,879
right now.

288
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,360
Someone is injured.

289
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,360
Car plate number?

290
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,080
Wan X6C073.

291
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,799
Sure.

292
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,159
Then,

293
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,480
I'll be waiting for you right here.

294
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:16,799
Sure.

295
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,720
Sir,

296
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,159
don't worry.

297
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,600
I've called both the police and the ambulance.

298
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,679
They'll be here soon.

299
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:25,960
Stop moving around.

300
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,080
I can't move

301
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
even if I want to.

302
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,240
Can you help me make another call?

303
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,759
Sure.

304
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,679
168

305
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,279
0121

306
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
6498.

307
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,159
Tell him

308
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,720
that their boss has gotten into a car accident.

309
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,759
Sure.

310
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,159
(Sorry.)

311
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,159
(The number you've dialed
is currently unavailable.)

312
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,279
(Please try again later.)

313
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:55,799
Sir.

314
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,919
The call couldn't get through.

315
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,600
These people

316
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,799
always curry favor with me,

317
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,279
but when I'm really caught up in trouble,

318
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,320
none of them is here to help me.

319
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:08,600
Did you

320
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,240
see the car

321
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,879
that hit me just now?

322
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,120
I think it's a silver sedan.

323
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,039
Did you manage to see the car plate number?

324
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,080
I didn't.

325
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,440
It was going really fast.

326
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,200
Miss.

327
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,320
Thank you so much.

328
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,720
I've brought so much trouble to you.

329
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,200
I think

330
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,639
you'll need to stay here for quite a while.

331
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,600
When the police are here,

332
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,679
remember to tell them

333
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
what you saw.

334
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,759
You're now the witness.

335
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,679
Witness?

336
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,399
Yes.

337
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,519
Eyewitness.

338
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,519
I wonder

339
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,600
if there are any surveillance cameras here.

340
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,600
If we bring this to court,

341
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,399
I might need you

342
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,480
to testify in court.

343
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,399
Bring it to court?

344
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,399
That's great.

345
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,559
What?

346
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,320
No.

347
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,759
That's not

348
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,679
what I meant.

349
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,879
I meant...

350
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,799
What a coincidence.

351
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,840
I work in a law firm.

352
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,159
If you are going to file a lawsuit against him,

353
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,440
can you hire

354
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,200
our law firm?

355
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,200
Are you a lawyer?

356
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:12,960
I'm not.

357
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,519
I work as a handyman.

358
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,639
The law firm just started operating not long ago.

359
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,039
We don't have many clients yet

360
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,200
and we're having a tough time.

361
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,360
I was wondering

362
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,039
if I could get them a client.

363
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:24,679
Can you...

364
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:24,960
You...

365
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,279
You're quite passionate about your work.

366
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,639
Our lawyers are very good.

367
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,279
I'm sure

368
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,240
you can rest assured

369
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,799
if you hire them.

370
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,240
I have my personal lawyer.

371
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:36,960
I won't need any other lawyers

372
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,000
if I'm filing a lawsuit against him.

373
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:40,720
However,

374
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,759
seeing how passionate you are about your job

375
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,519
and owing to the fact that you've helped me,

376
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:48,960
I...

377
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,559
I can think about it.

378
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:51,960
Really?

379
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:54,759
Then...

380
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:55,799
Then...

381
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:56,840
You...

382
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,279
You...

383
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,960
You're injured,

384
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,039
so I was too shy to say this,

385
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,799
but that's great.

386
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,480
It's not a good idea

387
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,519
to keep waiting here.

388
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,279
I can't open the door either.

389
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,639
Hang in there.

390
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,799
I'll go get help.

391
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:19,960
Hi.

392
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,440
Hi.

393
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,159
Can you do me a favor?

394
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:21,440
What's wrong?

395
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,480
Someone got into a car accident over there.

396
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,960
Sure.

397
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,480
Thank you.

398
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,120
Sir.

399
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,840
Guys, let's help him.

400
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,399
What's the matter?

401
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,080
Hi.

402
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,639
Sir, someone got into a car accident.

403
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,559
Can you help him?

404
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:46,321
[Ambulance]

405
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:03,000
[Public Security]

406
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,679
Thank you.

407
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,200
Who made the police report just now?

408
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,480
Sir,

409
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,320
I was the one who made the police report.

410
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,200
Can you tell us what happened?

411
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,240
When I was crossing the road,

412
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,320
I saw that car.

413
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,440
It hit

414
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,399
the utility pole.

415
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,480
It depends

416
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,279
on how severe the victim's injury is.

417
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,759
Is there anyone by his side now?

418
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,799
No.

419
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,279
I'll allow you another half-day off.

420
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,240
You can stay there

421
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,159
and take good care of him.

422
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,279
I'll be there

423
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,480
once I'm done with my work.

424
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:34,720
Keep an eye on him.

425
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,600
Sure.

426
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,799
Find out

427
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,240
how severe the victim's injury is.

428
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:40,840
Then...

429
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,559
Wait.

430
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,639
Is he all right?

431
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,279
He just woke up from the anesthesia

432
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,200
but is not very sober yet.

433
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,399
We need to keep observing him.

434
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,759
Are you his family?

435
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:54,759
I'm not.

436
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,879
Ring the bell

437
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,080
if you need anything.

438
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,279
Sure. Thanks.

439
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,580
Who are you?

440
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,510
I'm the eyewitness.

441
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,060
I passed by the scene...

442
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,030
Then, why are you taking photos of him?

443
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,990
Who are you working for?

444
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,820
I'm not working for anyone.

445
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,180
I only want to show the lawyer of our firm

446
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,660
how severe his injury is.

447
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,750
Lawyer?

448
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,580
I'm his lawyer.

449
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,390
Allow me to introduce myself.

450
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,270
I am

451
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,630
Mr. Zhang's attorney.

452
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,660
I'm in charge

453
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,700
of all his legal affairs.

454
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,700
Which law firm are you working for?

455
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,700
Why haven't I seen you before?

456
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,030
I'm not...

457
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,270
Mr. Zhang.

458
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,700
You're awake.

459
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,390
Don't worry.

460
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,540
It's just a minor fracture in your leg.

461
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,630
It'll heal very soon.

462
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,470
I got here

463
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,340
as soon as I heard

464
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,580
about the car accident.

465
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,270
The company

466
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:06,860
has sent people

467
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,100
to talk to the traffic police.

468
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,230
How are you feeling now?

469
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
We will make the culprit

470
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,510
pay for what he has done.

471
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,670
Hey.

472
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,910
Young lady.

473
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,710
You're still here.

474
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,230
Thank you.

475
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,190
This is the first time we have met.

476
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,670
Han.

477
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,030
It was this young lady who helped me just now.

478
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,230
She?

479
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,470
She helped you?

480
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,620
But I saw her

481
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,540
taking photos

482
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,230
of you...

483
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,100
She also...

484
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,300
She mentioned lawyers and whatnot.

485
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,950
Photos?

486
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,270
She was taking photos of you

487
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,270
when I arrived.

488
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:40,950
Wait.

489
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,270
Who are you going to

490
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,230
send the photos to?

491
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,540
Do you know that Mr. Zhang

492
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,670
is the chairman of a listed group?

493
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,230
His image is everything.

494
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,060
How can you take photos

495
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,340
at times like this?

496
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,140
You...

497
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,100
What are you trying to do?

498
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,750
Moreover,

499
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,300
you need his consent
before you can take his photos.

500
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,620
Don't you know that?

501
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,670
How dare you call yourself a lawyer?

502
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,030
I...

503
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,580
I...

504
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,190
I'm not...

505
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,750
What?

506
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,340
Miss.

507
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,510
Did you really take photos of me?

508
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,190
I...

509
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,910
I wanted to send pictures of your injury

510
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,140
to our lawyer.

511
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,820
I didn't mean it.

512
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,910
Now...

513
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,380
Law firms these days

514
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,300
will do everything they can to win businesses

515
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,230
even if they have to act
against their conscience.

516
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,710
They'll do whatever it takes.

517
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,750
You

518
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,990
should delete the photos.

519
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:38,625
[Delete]

520
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,230

Thank you.

522
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,620
You've helped me a lot.

523
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,340
Let me know

524
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,910
how much you want.

525
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,510
It's fine.

526
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,990
It's just a case.

527
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,580
We can always get another one.

528
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,340
I was so stupid.

529
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,140
Even if Mr. Zhang

530
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,100
is not a big shot,

531
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,820
when a man is ill

532
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,470
and wearing a cast on his leg,

533
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,340
you shouldn't take photos of him

534
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,670
without his consent.

535
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,820
That's the rule.

536
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,230
It's about being respectful to the person.

537
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,780
Why did I not know about that?

538
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,750
Why didn't that come across my mind?

539
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,300
The only thing I was thinking

540
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,750
is to win us a client.

541
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,140
I am really worried seeing how hard

542
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,270
you are trying to cope with the financial stress.

543
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,100
I can understand

544
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,030
where you're coming from,

545
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,820
but...

546
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,190
You see.

547
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,030
You grew up

548
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,190
in an environment like that.

549
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:54,910
It's fine.

550
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,580
Take it easy.

551
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,860
There are some rules

552
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,620
that you still don't quite get.

553
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,190
Well...

554
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:00,990
I do things with good intentions,

555
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,510
but the results always turn out bad.

556
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,780
The more I live,

557
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,950
the more I am confused about life.

558
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,380
It was like this when I was in the countryside,

559
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,950
and it's still the same after I came here.

560
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,430
I'm so stupid.

561
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,230
I'm a fool.

562
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,430
You shouldn't say that about yourself.

563
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,670
You carry a lot of good traits
that others don't have.

564
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,910
You're brave,

565
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,510
kind,

566
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,060
and you don't give up easily.

567
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,230
If you are...

568
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,230
That...

569
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:26,710
I mean...

570
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,780
I mean...

571
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,060
What?

572
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,620
I mean

573
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,300
these traits

574
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,100
are not enough.

575
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,820
You have to be knowledgeable and cultured too.

576
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,780
Knowledgeable?

577
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,910
Cultured?

578
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,140
Aren't they the same?

579
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:46,820
This...

580
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,030
They are not

581
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,470
exactly the same.

582
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,430
You can get knowledge,

583
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,670
but not culture,

584
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,060
from reading books.

585
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,100
You have to...

586
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,750
Anyway, this is not something

587
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,750
I can explain in such a short time.

588
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,230
Let's save this for some other day.

589
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,140
Let's get down.

590
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,510
I didn't know

591
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,860
being a security guard

592
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,100
would be so difficult.

593
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,990
Look at this posture.

594
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,950
You know what.

595
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,190
I was drenched in sweat
just from practicing how to stand.

596
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,100
It's not an easy job.

597
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,860
There is a lot to learn.

598
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,380
Really.

599
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,510
I have to memorize the car plate numbers too.

600
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,140
When I see the cars coming from afar,

601
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,030
I need to greet them.

602
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,060
Those are all the leaders

603
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,270
and chiefs.

604
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,380
Like this.

605
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,470
Salute.

606
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,950
You look so ugly.

607
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,100
You won't understand.

608
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,300
Other than that,

609
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,430
we have to learn

610
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,300
how to march too.

611
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:40,910
See.

612
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,910
We're neither soldiers,

613
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,820
nor police officers.

614
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,670
We don't take part in any military parade.

615
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,670
Why do we have to waste time on that?

616
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,300
Do we look good

617
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,060
walking like this?

618
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,510
Look.

619
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,190
Do I look good?

620
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,100
It looks pretty decent.

621
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,060
Qinglai.

622
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,670
It's pretty good, right?

623
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,750
Tell you what.

624
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,470
It's not about looking good.

625
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,990
It's about

626
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,470
achieving a collective will.

627
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,190
You have to always listen to commands.

628
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,190
Imagine

629
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,100
if we can all take a walk

630
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,270
at the Municipal Council building.

631
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,430
Then, it'll turn into a market, right?

632
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,510
You're new,

633
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,860
so you have to learn what you don't know.

634
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,860
I got it.

635
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,100
They are really nice to me too.

636
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,100
They knew

637
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,670
that Mr. Xu helped me get that job.

638
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,140
Qinglai.

639
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,620
You

640
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,380
shouldn't tell others

641
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,710
about your relationship with Mr. Xu.

642
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,910
It will affect others' impressions of you.

643
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:28,820
Yes.

644
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,380
Try not to leave a bad impression.

645
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,620
Xingfu.

646
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,380
Why didn't I know

647
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,540
that you're nearsighted?

648
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,670
No.

649
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,340
Don't you think

650
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,510
I look more cultured like this?

651
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,750
What are you reading?

652
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,620
I'm trying to find out

653
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,060
what a receptionist does.

654
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,340
Xingfu.

655
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,780
You should be focusing

656
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,860
on your own tasks.

657
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,030
I finished all my tasks.

658
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,060
The front desk is part of my job description too.

659
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,340
I need to be both knowledgeable and cultured.

660
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,190
Well done.

661
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,060
My teaching didn't go wasting.

662
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,230
Your teaching didn't go wasted,

663
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,140
not wasting.

664
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,710
Wasted.

665
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,860
Wasting.

666
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,670
Wasting.

667
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:24,950
That's right.

668
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,230
Alright.

669
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,780
Dad. Mom.

670
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,540
I saw Mr. Shantang

671
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,100
on my way here.

672
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,100
What...

673
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,060
Where

674
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,230
did you see him?

675
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,910
Near my office.

676
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,780
I saw him on the street.

677
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,780
How was he doing?

678
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,190
He looked quite good,

679
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,030
except for the fact that he was hobbling.

680
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,750
That's great.

681
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,950
Thankfully.

682
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,270
Heaven will always bless the kind-hearted.

683
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,030
That's right.

684
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,580
Youde.

685
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,230
Hurry up

686
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,710
and give Qinglai and the others a call.

687
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,300
Tell them

688
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,860
that Mr. Wan has been discharged.

689
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,430
Mr. Wan is coming home.

690
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,060
Dou.

691
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,670
Little Dou.

692
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,270
I'll go and keep my bag.

693
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,270
Qinglai.

694
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:08,750
Let me

695
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,670
tell you something.

696
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,580
Xiuyu just came home from work

697
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,190
and she told us that she saw Mr. Wan.

698
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,270
Yes.

699
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,340
He has been discharged.

700
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,510
The only thing is

701
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,190
that he has a little trouble walking.

702
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,190
That means

703
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,060
he's fine.

704
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,750
Don't worry.

705
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,470
Just focus on your work.

706
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,910
Earn more money.

707
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,230
Don't worry about what happened back home.

708
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,580
We're all doing fine.

709
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,510
All right.

710
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:30,990
Sure.

711
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,300
Take care.

712
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,300
Yes. Take care.

713
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,300
All right.

714
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,860
That's great.

715
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,780
Hey.

716
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,430
As of now,

717
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,540
this is the work progress

718
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,100
in the village.

719
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,340
Mr. Wan,

720
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,950
do you have anything else to say?

721
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:48,860
Here.

722
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,580
Have some fruits.

723
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:50,950
Thank you.

724
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:53,990
Mr. Wan.

725
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,510
You should now

726
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,340
focus on recuperating.

727
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,750
Chuanjia and I

728
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,990
will take care of the work in the village.

729
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,190
We will carry out

730
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,430
the other plans one by one too.

731
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,100
You shouldn't

732
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,540
worry about them.

733
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,030
How is

734
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,510
the Wang family

735
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,030
doing?

736
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,030
Nothing much.

737
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,620
Wang Qinglai

738
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:17,860
and He Xingfu

739
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,950
can't stay in the village anymore.

740
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,300
They found a job in the city.

741
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,470
Chuanjia,

742
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:24,860
did you scare

743
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,300
Qinglai and his wife

744
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,510
away?

745
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,860
How could you say that?

746
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,510
We live in a society governed by the rule of law.

747
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,620
What could I have done to them?

748
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,100
My body is aching all over.

749
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,580
It's really sore.

750
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:47,910
Hey.

751
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,430
Xingfu.

752
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,340
Here.

753
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,620
Give me a massage.

754
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,140
What are you doing?

755
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:51,580
Give me a massage.

756
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,030
Just a massage.

757
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:52,710
Over here.

758
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,710
My body is aching all over.

759
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,340
Hurry up

760
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,300
and give me a massage.

761
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,510
Which part is hurting?

762
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,510
Everywhere.

763
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,950
Give me a shoulder massage first.

764
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,380
Sigh.

765
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,780
It feels so good.

766
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,430
The houses I went to inspect today

767
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,990
are quite far

768
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,820
from our workplaces.

769
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,540
I'm planning to visit a few more tomorrow.

770
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,540
I think

771
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,710
it's better if we live in the city.

772
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,190
There's no need to hurry.

773
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,950
We have a place to stay right now.

774
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,030
Why should we move out of this big house

775
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,510
and spend money renting another?

776
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,100
Isn't that a waste of money?

777
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,030
We're both working now.

778
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,470
We can afford that.

779
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,100
It's not appropriate to keep staying

780
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,820
at Qingzhi's place.

781
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,190
How is it not appropriate?

782
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,750
This is Qingzhi's place.

783
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,300
Ask him yourself.

784
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,230
If he dares say this house belongs to him,

785
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,950
I'll leave right away.

786
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,510
Ask him yourself.

787
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,270
You're being unreasonable.

788
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,340
Qingzhi doesn't live here alone.

789
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,430
Yani is here too.

790
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,540
Although

791
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,540
they didn't say it out loud,

792
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,540
you don't know what's on their mind.

793
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,750
We should be more conscious.

794
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,100
Let's not turn ourselves

795
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,780
into annoying people.

796
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,620
It's convenient

797
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,950
to get to our workplaces from here.

798
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,300
Moreover,

799
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,230
the entire family

800
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:11,860
helped him with this,

801
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,470
it doesn't make sense
that he's enjoying all these alone.

802
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,060
You're his elder brother.

803
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,380
How could you say that?

804
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:19,710
Go away.

805
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,300
Where are you going?

806
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,380
Just go to sleep.

807
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:48,269
[Law Encyclopedia for Laymen]

808
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,270
Mr. Wan.

809
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,380
Are you feeling better?

810
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,270
Mr. Wan.

811
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,990
Doudou is so cute.

812
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,820
So cute.

813
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,100
You're too cute.

814
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,230
The baby is really cute,

815
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,860
right?

816
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,750
Is he cute?

817
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,820
Downy.

818
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,140
Downy.

819
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,750
One. Two. Three.

820
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,510
You...

821
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,190
Youde.

822
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,750
Why is he running away?

823
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,510
Why won't he show me the baby?

824
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,780
That's so rude.

825
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,910
Time to go home.

826
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,140
You're back, Qinglai.

827
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:35,750
Qinglai.

828
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,230
Are you tired?

829
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,540
Sigh.

830
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,580
It's really weird.

831
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,910
I was just standing there,

832
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,620
but it's more tiring than working on the field.

833
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,670
-You know what.
-Qinglai.

834
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:45,750
This one's for you.

835
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,270
Hey.

836
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,950
Qinglai.

837
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,470
This is not the worst.

838
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,780
-Back then...
-Thank you.

839
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,950
My first day of work

840
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,340
happened to be

841
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,270
one of the warmest days of the year.

842
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:54,750
Tell you what.

843
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,670
I was wet from head to toe.

844
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,990
I was soaked in my own sweat.

845
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,100
Luckily, I didn't get a heat stroke.

846
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,380
You're exaggerating it.

847
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,430
That means you'll turn into
a popsicle in the winter.

848
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:00,750
No, but...

849
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,340
My wife made this.

850
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,100
Try it.

851
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,100
Let's try it.

852
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,140
It's really good.

853
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,620
It's nice, right?

854
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,270
It's really good.

855
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,820
-Have some more.
-Her cooking tastes really good.

856
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:09,860
Here.

857
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,580
Send our gratitude.

858
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,300
Have some more.

859
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,670
Qinglai.

860
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,750
My wife cooks really well, right?

861
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,910
What are we doing tonight?

862
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,580
We can't eat this for free.

863
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:16,910
I'll treat everyone to dinner.

864
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,230
Hey!

865
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:19,780
I...

866
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,190
It's been a few days since I last drank.

867
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,380
So what are we having tonight?

868
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,140
Up to you.

869
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:23,620
Let

870
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,140
Qinglai decide.

871
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,030
Qinglai, what do you want for dinner?

872
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,470
Anything.

873
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,510
Ask Si and Gang along too.

874
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:30,910
Yes.

875
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,860
Ask them along.

876
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,340
Sure.

877
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,030
Let's have dinner together.

878
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:34,580
All of them will be there?

879
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,470
Of course.

880
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:36,860
Sure.

881
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,580
Then, I'll come along.

882
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,190
Let's have drinks together, Qinglai.

883
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,060
Life is great.

884
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,580
Here.

885
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,620
Have some more.

886
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,230
You can take some home too.

887
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,190
Take some home.

888
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:46,820
Hey.

889
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,510
Big Guy.

890
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,140
You're the host.

891
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,710
-Shouldn't you propose a toast to Qinglai?
-He's right.

892
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,910
Big Guy, what are you doing?

893
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,990
Hurry up and propose a toast to Qinglai.

894
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:53,430
I...

895
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,060
Here's one for you.

896
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,470
Stay seated.

897
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,820
Let's drink with Qinglai together.

898
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,990
-To Qinglai.
-To Qinglai.

899
00:31:59,380 --> 00:31:59,910
Stay seated.

900
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,270
Have a seat.

901
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,710
Have a seat.

902
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,670
Tell you what.

903
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:10,910
I

904
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,620
have a younger brother

905
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,270
who holds a master's degree.

906
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,860
He works in the public service too.

907
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,190
Hopefully, one day,

908
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,750
he will achieve something and prove himself

909
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,780
to one of his superiors.

910
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,670
What?

911
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:23,990
Qinglai.

912
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,340
Why haven't you mentioned this before?

913
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,510
Haven't I?

914
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,430
No. You keep a really low profile.

915
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,190
I was occupied with the work

916
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,270
and I forgot about it.

917
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:31,750
Hey.

918
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,340
Qinglai.

919
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,300
So you're from

920
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,580
a wealthy

921
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,780
and noble family.

922
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,300
I'm sure

923
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,750
you will have a very bright future.

924
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,670
Qinglai, you know what.

925
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,180
I can tell from your face profile

926
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,310
that you're...

927
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,340
I'm not good with words.

928
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,340
Xiaoshan, you should do it.

929
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,790
The first time I saw Qinglai,

930
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,470
I could tell

931
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,580
that he has a rounded forehead.

932
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,420
-Rounded forehead.
-That's right.

933
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
A face of good luck.

934
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,310
Yes, a face of good luck.

935
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,230
You have the profile of a hero.

936
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,380
There's a hero here. Can you see it?

937
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,100
You're right.

938
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,620
The face of a noble man.

939
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,100
Yes, a noble man.

940
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,230
From a noble family.

941
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,820
Your compliments are making me shy.

942
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,950
Let me propose a toast to you.

943
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,660
Let's do it together.

944
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,070
Hurry up!

945
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,070
Here.

946
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,860
-To Qinglai.
-To Qinglai.

947
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,710
Qinglai, please take good care of us
in the future.

948
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,470
Please take good care of us.

949
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,510
Excuse me. I'll just answer this call.

950
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,180
You guys go ahead.

951
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,620
Go ahead without me.

952
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,230
Mom.

953
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,620
I'm at work.

954
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,820
What's the matter?

955
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,900
Last time,

956
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,750
during

957
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,580
Little Dou's

958
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,660
hundred-day banquet,

959
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,990
we bought two bottles of Wuliangye.
(*a Chinese baijiu liquor)

960
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,900
Have you seen them?

961
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,950
I kept them

962
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,100
in the closet.

963
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:34,750
What's wrong?

964
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,950
I spent a long time looking for them.

965
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,790
I thought

966
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,180
they could be useful

967
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,310
when I moved to the city.

968
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,710
I can use them as a gift

969
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,790
when I need help from others.

970
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,380
I was in a hurry
and I accidentally left them behind.

971
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,230
Why do you need them?

972
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:47,950
As a gift.

973
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,140
Hold this.

974
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,990
Hold this. I'll go bring the baby.

975
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,380
He's sleeping.

976
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,340
Don't disturb him.

977
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,420
If he wakes up and starts crying,

978
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,900
he'll ruin everything.

979
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:01,990
You don't get it.

980
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,030
When Mr. Wan sees

981
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,750
the poor baby without his mom,

982
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,750
it'll melt the iron.

983
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,580
He only needs to say a few words

984
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,790
to allow them to come home.

985
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,620
Go and get him now.

986
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,700
Hurry up.

987
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,260
Youde.

988
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,580
Mr. Wan.

989
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,390
Guizhi!

990
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,550
Guizhi!

991
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:25,740
-Guizhi!
-Stop yelling.

992
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,390
Why are you yelling nonstop?

993
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,580
-See who's here.
-What's wrong with you?

994
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:29,350
Hey.

995
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,910
Mr. Wan.

996
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,140
Mr. Wan.

997
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,990
Never in my life would I've expected this.

998
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,430
Why are you here?

999
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,180
It's really unexpected.

1000
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,950
Please don't hold grudges against us.

1001
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,470
Mr. Wan.

1002
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,950
We shouldn't leave you standing here.

1003
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,430
Come on in.

1004
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:41,740
This way.

1005
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,260
Come in.

1006
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,180
Let's just stay here.

1007
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:43,780
We can't.

1008
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,390
Please don't.

1009
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,070
You...

1010
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,470
Look at this.

1011
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,140
Thank you.

1012
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,430
-The weather is cold.
-It's cold.

1013
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,220
-Let's not sit here.
-The weather is cold.

1014
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:49,990
It's fine.

1015
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:50,780
Be careful.

1016
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,510
I'm not that frail.

1017
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,780
Mr. Wan.

1018
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,620
It has been really tough

1019
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,260
for us.

1020
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,180
We've been regretting

1021
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,390
the things we did to you.

1022
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,390
When you were admitted to the hospital,

1023
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,430
we intended to pay you a visit.

1024
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,140
However, we were worried about your health

1025
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,830
and were afraid that our presence
would upset you.

1026
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,780
Youde and I

1027
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,030
just heard

1028
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,910
that you had been discharged,

1029
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,870
so we were planning

1030
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,990
to pay you a visit.

1031
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,470
But...

1032
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,070
You...

1033
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,140
You were a step ahead.

1034
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,070
My goodness.

1035
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,300
You haven't fully recovered yet,

1036
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,700
so please don't overwork yourself.

1037
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,660
Take a seat.

1038
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,660
Sure.

1039
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,430
About this,

1040
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,550
the doctor told me

1041
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:23,870
to walk

1042
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,550
at least

1043
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,220
half an hour

1044
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,470
every day.

1045
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,140
That's why I am out for a walk.

1046
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,220
And I somehow ended up here.

1047
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,510
Youde.

1048
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,430
Guizhi.

1049
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,300
Qinglai and his wife went to the city

1050
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,260
to work, right?

1051
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,550
Yes.

1052
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,580
It was all our fault.

1053
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,870
The kids only caused such a huge mess

1054
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,510
because they are too young and immature.

1055
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,390
Thankfully,

1056
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,300
you're

1057
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,830
strong enough

1058
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,030
to pull through this.

1059
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,300
If anything happens to you,

1060
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:49,780
what...

1061
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,260
what are we supposed to do?

1062
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,100
The moment

1063
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,030
I was admitted to the hospital,

1064
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,740
they stopped telling me everything.

1065
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,830
I only found out

1066
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,390
about this

1067
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,830
after I asked them.

1068
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,350
I came here

1069
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,100
because

1070
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,030
I wanted to tell you this.

1071
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,620
If Qinglai and his wife

1072
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,580
wish

1073
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,030
to work in the city,

1074
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,510
then let them do it.

1075
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,180
Let

1076
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,620
the young people

1077
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,870
gain some experiences out there.

1078
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,950
It's not entirely a bad thing.

1079
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,550
If they run into any difficulties

1080
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,910
working there,

1081
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,950
they can always

1082
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,550
come back

1083
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,470
to the village.

1084
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,910
I will always

1085
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,950
keep

1086
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,140
my promises.

1087
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,470
Really?

1088
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,100
Look.

1089
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,740
Mr. Wan.

1090
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,780
You're too kind.

1091
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,070
If it weren't for you,

1092
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:36,950
the Wang family

1093
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,550
wouldn't have survived until today.

1094
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,220
-He's right.
-Let's not keep talking about this.

1095
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:40,740
I...

1096
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,830
I'll continue my stroll.

1097
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,220
Sure.

1098
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,300
Mr. Wan.

1099
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,740
This.

1100
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,470
This one's for you.

1101
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,700
We prepared this for you.

1102
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,390
Youde.

1103
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,910
-This...
-We're old friends.

1104
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,700
There's no need for this.

1105
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,660
This...

1106
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,740
You don't have to send me off.

1107
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,620
Don't have to send me off.

1108
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,180
I'll get going.

1109
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,220
-I'll get going.
-Be careful.

1110
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:00,950
Be careful.

1111
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,660
How did I

1112
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,740
get so old?

1113
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,430
This...

1114
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,910
Mr. Wan.

1115
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,350
Drop by again when you're free.

1116
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,180
Take care.

1117
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,910
That's great.

1118
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,870
Mr. Wan's visit

1119
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,660
is like a public notice.

1120
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,180
Yes.

1121
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:20,910
From now on,

1122
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,430
none of the villagers

1123
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,780
dare to pick on us again.

1124
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,430
Exactly.

1125
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,300
That's great.

1126
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:24,580
Let's go.

1127
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,070
This is nice.

1128
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,300
Xingfu, I'm here.

1129
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,180
Where are you?

1130
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,300
Keep going

1131
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,100
when you see the wet market.

1132
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,870
Right here.

1133
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,430
I'm coming.

1134
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,030
Xingfu,

1135
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,950
I think this is quite a good location.

1136
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,870
The wet market is right in front of the building.

1137
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,180
I've spoken to the landlord.

1138
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,260
She's waiting for us upstairs.

1139
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,140
This way.

1140
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,510
The kitchen is right there.

1141
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:06,870
It's pretty good.

1142
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,260
Here.

1143
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,350
Have a look around.

1144
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,580
Madam.

1145
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,030
What about 400 yuan?

1146
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,350
I saw another place

1147
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,300
that was bigger than this.

1148
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,740
He was only asking for 500 yuan.

1149
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,100
Then,

1150
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,390
why didn't you

1151
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,620
rent the bigger room?

1152
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,100
Fine.

1153
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,700
Enough of bargaining.

1154
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,660
500 yuan.

1155
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,470
That's the best I can offer.

1156
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,470
400 yuan, please.

1157
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,350
Look.

1158
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,470
We'll be neighbors from now on.

1159
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,260
There's a saying that goes,

1160
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,550
"Better a neighbor nearby
than a brother far away."

1161
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,910
We're both young.

1162
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:39,660
Whatever

1163
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,430
happens in the future,

1164
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,470
we are there to help each other.

1165
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,300
The problem is that rental prices

1166
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,140
are skyrocketing these days.

1167
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,830
The best I can offer is 500 yuan.

1168
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,180
That's the lowest I can go.

1169
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,620
Look.

1170
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,030
Here.

1171
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,580
The furniture.

1172
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,030
You can use all the furniture.

1173
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,830
There is also

1174
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,910
a color television here.

1175
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,260
You can use it too.

1176
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,470
When can we move in?

1177
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,260
Let's not talk about moving in first.

1178
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,700
We need to agree on the rent first.

1179
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,580
500 yuan.

1180
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,580
That's the lowest I can go.

1181
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,390
You need to pay me
six months' worth of rent at one go.

1182
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,740
Madam.

1183
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,180
400 yuan, please.

1184
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,220
If you rent this to us,

1185
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,030
we will clean the room up for you.

1186
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,390
It'll be easier for you to rent it out
in the future as well.

1187
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,350
That's right, madam.

1188
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,660
My sister is a really nice person.

1189
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,140
She always keeps things clean too.

1190
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,180
She can help you

1191
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,260
when you need any help in the future.

1192
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,780
You will never regret renting the room to her.

1193
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,620
Please.

1194
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:34,620
Mom.

1195
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,510
Qingzhi.

1196
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,140
We're on the bus.

1197
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,990
I have good news to share with you.

1198
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,430
Everyone is here.

1199
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,180
It's your birthday today,

1200
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,990
so we're going to celebrate it for you.

1201
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:44,550
Wait.

1202
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,140
This...

1203
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,220
This is too sudden.

1204
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,030
You didn't give me a heads-up.

1205
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,740
I'm giving you a heads-up now.

1206
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,300
Then,

1207
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,430
when will you be here?

1208
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,990
We'll be there at noon.

1209
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,700
Sure.

1210
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,030
Then, I'll pick you up at noon.

1211
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,830
You can leave first.

1212
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,620
I have something else to do.

1213
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,070
Sure.

1214
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,390
How are you leaving?

1215
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,700
Don't worry about me. I'll hail a taxi.

1216
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,220
Sure.

1217
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,140
Bye.

1218
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,470
Hey.

1219
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,070
Yani.

1220
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,510
Wait a minute.

1221
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,100
Yani.

1222
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,620
You can talk now.

1223
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,580
It's your birthday today,

1224
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,780
but I can't be there with you.

1225
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,580
Sorry.

1226
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,350
It's fine.

1227
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,660
Work is the top priority.

1228
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,430
As long as our hearts are bound together,

1229
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,070
I'm happy.

1230
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,550
Thanks, Yani.

1231
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,220
I'll get back to work.

1232
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,070
I'll call you again later.

1233
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:46,950
By the way,

1234
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,700
when you're out there,

1235
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,990
make sure to take good care of yourself.

1236
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,180
Eat your meals on time.

1237
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,180
Take good care of yourself.

1238
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,030
All right.

1239
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,620
Bye.

1240
00:40:59,217 --> 00:41:00,800
[Exit]

1241
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:01,740
Hey.

1242
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:02,830
Hey.

1243
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,260
Qingzhi.

1244
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:03,740
Dad.

1245
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,220
Dad.

1246
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,030
-Qingzhi.
-Mom.

1247
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,140
Qingzhi.

1248
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,030
Dad, why did you decide to come here
all of a sudden?

1249
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,220
You didn't even give me a heads-up.

1250
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,510
I wanted to give you heads-up,

1251
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:13,910
but we wanted

1252
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,220
to celebrate your birthday with you.

1253
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,620
Your mom wanted to get here as soon as possible.

1254
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,030
You can just visit me

1255
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,390
without

1256
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,550
bringing this live chicken.

1257
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,070
There's a story about this chicken.

1258
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,260
Mom.

1259
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,660
Did something happen again?

1260
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:24,660
Yes,

1261
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,580
but it's good news.

1262
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,990
Your dad and I didn't sleep for the entire night.

1263
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,390
We're here to bring you good news.

1264
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,780
Mr. Wan dropped by our place.

1265
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,620
This chicken

1266
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,910
was from Mr. Wan.

1267
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,430
That...

1268
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,550
Does that mean

1269
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,780
that Qinglai and Xingfu

1270
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,870
can return to the Wan Village?

1271
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,700
You're right.

1272
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,220
We're here

1273
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,180
to discuss that with you.

1274
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,910
That's good news.

1275
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,220
Let's go home now.

1276
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,030
Let's go.

1277
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,030
Little Dou.

1278
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,990
This way.

1279
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,070
Mom. Dad.

1280
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:01,830
Mom. Dad.

1281
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,180
This house...

1282
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:09,950
Mom, are you all right?

1283
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,350
There were too many people on the bus.

1284
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:12,990
It was so packed

1285
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,430
and so warm.

1286
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,390
I'm all soaked,

1287
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,950
so I got off the bus to take a breather.

1288
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:16,550
It's fine.

1289
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,300
Have a seat.

1290
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,910
Here.

1291
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,180
Look at you.

1292
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:20,700
How could you

1293
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:21,620
go out

1294
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,620
in such a cold weather

1295
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,180
without wearing a few more layers?

1296
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,580
Qingzhi.

1297
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,580
I'll prepare

1298
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,620
some good food

1299
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,580
with the ingredients I brought here.

1300
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,990
Invite Yani over.

1301
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,350
We'll have a meal together.

1302
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,430
Mom.

1303
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,070
Yes.

1304
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,070
Yani is on a business trip.

1305
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,100
She is not back yet.

1306
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,470
What a pity.

1307
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,390
Look.

1308
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,030
Look.

1309
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,950
This place is really nice.

1310
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,620
It looks really fancy.

1311
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:42,620
It's so pretty.

1312
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:43,990
Why didn't you ask

1313
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,430
how much he spent

1314
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,660
and how much loan has he taken?

1315
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:47,830
Do you know

1316
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,780
how many years will Qingzhi take
to pay off the debt?

1317
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,030
20 years.

1318
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,180
Mom. Dad.

1319
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,620
I have to go to work in the afternoon.

1320
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,350
There's a playground

1321
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,300
downstairs.

1322
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,700
You can bring Dou there.

1323
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:57,550
Sure.

1324
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,550
