00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,959
What are you saying?

173
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,120
How could we, the police, arrest whoever we like?

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,920
Qinglai is recovering.

175
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
He's getting alright.

176
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,199
Then that's settled.

177
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,439
We haven't solved the issue yet.

178
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,600
You still owe him a ton of compensation.

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,959
Gosh.

180
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,639
You're

181
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,759
really a piece of work, Li.

182
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,000
What are you trying to say?

183
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,120
Are you too free?

184
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,360
Is our district too peaceful

185
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,920
that you have nothing else to do?

186
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,040
Why are you interested in economic disputes?

187
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,680
You're just a petty police officer.

188
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,199
Look at you.

189
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,079
Wan, you're really a donkey

190
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,680
that has to be rubbed the right way.

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,519
If things don't go as you wish,

192
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,839
you take it out on others.

193
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,879
You even treated me like this.

194
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,439
It isn't hard to imagine

195
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,439
how you treated Qinglai.

196
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,720
You've certainly treated them discourteously.

197
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,959
Hey.

198
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,480
Li.

199
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,160
You're acting like

200
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,680
an unprincipled peacemaker.

201
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,519
You have no principles.

202
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,560
How am I unprincipled?

203
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,279
Fine.

204
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,040
This is

205
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,199
your biggest weakness.

206
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,319
You're too easygoing.

207
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,720
Yes. I'm gruff and stubborn.

208
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,000
But why am I gruff?

209
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,399
As I did nothing wrong.

210
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,399
I've never been unreasonable to others.

211
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,199
Nor have I ever bullied others.

212
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,600
I didn't turn into this state in one day too.

213
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,319
Back then,

214
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,120
I brought people to the mountain for quarry

215
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,079
to get rich.

216
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,399
The secretary back then didn't agree.

217
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,240
In the end, I was proven right.

218
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,160
Then, I insisted

219
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,079
that a small private workshop

220
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,600
could be developed

221
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,240
into a stone-working plant.

222
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,920
The county worried that I might
be unable to pay back the loan.

223
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,240
They didn't agree either.

224
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,319
But in the end,

225
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,800
I was proven right again.

226
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,279
Under my lead, Wan Village

227
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,519
has become what it is today

228
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,399
from nothing.

229
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,879
How did I manage to get here?

230
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,199
I have my principles.

231
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,519
I never take more than I'm entitled to.

232
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,600
I don't bully the weak.

233
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,439
I walk in integrity.

234
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,120
If I were like you,

235
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,679
excessively pitying

236
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,840
people,

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,440
well.

238
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,799
Whoever sees you

239
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,919
would just need to shed some tears

240
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,799
and you'd feel sorry for them.

241
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,360
You'd think that they're pitiful

242
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,639
and you'd sympathize with them.

243
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,480
Then, you'd give them

244
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,639
your own money.

245
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,559
How could I manage my group then?

246
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,519
Think about it.

247
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,720
Why couldn't you get a promotion?

248
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,080
How would your higher-up

249
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,639
trust you with important positions
when you act like this?

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,679
They're afraid that once you have power,

251
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,720
you'll get rid of your principles

252
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,240
and use your power recklessly.

253
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,519
Let's take Qinglai's incident as an example.

254
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,559
If you were in my place,

255
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,360
let alone sixty thousand yuan,

256
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,080
you'd easily give him 160,000 yuan.

257
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,399
He's really pitiful.

258
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,679
He's pitiful.

259
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,320
So, do I have to pity him

260
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,279
and risk the collective interest
just to help him?

261
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,320
If I was unprincipled,

262
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,639
Wan Village,

263
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,480
a village that consists of more than
a thousand families and five thousand people

264
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,120
would never grow into what it is today.

265
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,919
It'll be listed under the poverty line.

266
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,399
How could it be

267
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,799
a star business in the county or even in the city?

268
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,360
In your dreams.

269
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,120
You're right.

270
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm not as capable as you.

271
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,639
Hence, I can't improve.

272
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,840
Back then, you went to the mountain for the quarry.

273
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,159
There wasn't even a proper road.

274
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,000
I rode on an old motorcycle,

275
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:19,279
going back and forth,

276
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,279
just to ask about it.

277
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,720
Actually,

278
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,879
I shouldn't be bothered about it too.

279
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,360
You wanted to start a processing plant.

280
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,440
You needed a loan.

281
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,120
I went to the city

282
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,200
and the county

283
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,279
to bring you to meet my friends
who I met in the army.

284
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,320
I begged them for help

285
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,919
to solve your problem.

286
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,120
What did that have to do with me?

287
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,399
I do have no principles.

288
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,320
About the compensation
for Qinglai and the village,

289
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,919
should I be bothered by it?

290
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,159
Why should I take charge of the matter?

291
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,000
Who am I

292
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
to interfere with it?

293
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,039
I'm just a petty police officer.

294
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,240
And you're Wanjia Group's chairman.

295
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,440
Why would I be a busybody to care about this?

296
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,080
I...

297
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,559
I'm being discourteous.

298
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,559
I'm unprincipled.

299
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,519
That's enough.

300
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,480
I'm leaving.

301
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,399
Hey, don't.

302
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,440
Li. Buddy.

303
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,120
Hey.

304
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,840
Don't leave.

305
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,159
I'm sorry.

306
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,799
I don't mean it.

307
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,080
There's been a lot on my mind recently.

308
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,879
My mind is a mess.

309
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,759
Besides,

310
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,080
we're

311
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,120
just arguing with each other.

312
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,480
I didn't mean what I said.

313
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,360
Don't take this to heart.

314
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,840
We're still buddies.

315
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,039
Not for the others.

316
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,600
Just for your sake.

317
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,360
Okay?

318
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,559
I'll consider this again.

319
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,080
Is that alright?

320
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,000
Have lunch with me before you leave.

321
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:29,240
Hello?

322
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,039
Xingyun.

323
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,080
Is everything alright, Xingfu?

324
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,559
Is my brother-in-law getting better?

325
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,879
Your brother-in-law is fine.

326
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,960
He can get up and move about now.

327
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,679
What's your progress with Mr. Guan?

328
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,720
We have some ideas now.

329
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,039
We're going to discuss it with you.

330
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,240
Hold on.

331
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,720
Mom and Dad are around too.

332
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,799
I'll put you on speaker.

333
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,200
Let's discuss this together.

334
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,399
Dad.

335
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:51,879
Mom.

336
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,840
Mr. Guan is on the phone.

337
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
Let's listen to what they have to say.

338
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,039
Okay, go ahead.

339
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
Hello, this is Guan Tao.

340
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,519
Well.

341
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,080
We've looked into the case.

342
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,440
We think

343
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,519
that it's not worth it

344
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,320
to pursue the matter in court.

345
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,039
If you file the case,

346
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,519
the legal procedures

347
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,519
are complicated

348
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,759
and time-consuming.

349
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,480
Besides,

350
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,320
the amount of money
involved in the case isn't big.

351
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,000
Additionally, both sides

352
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,679
have their justifications.

353
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,759
We can't assure

354
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,919
that the court would support us

355
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,679
to claim

356
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,960
the full amount of sixty thousand yuan.

357
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What should we do then?

358
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,399
In our opinion,

359
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,639
it's better to send them a demand letter

360
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,679
to negotiate about it.

361
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,360
In this way,

362
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,759
we won't be bringing this to court.

363
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,879
We won't be on bad terms

364
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,159
and be at war with them.

365
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,320
Moreover, this method costs the least.

366
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,200
What is a demand letter?

367
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,320
A demand letter

368
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,200
is a formal letter issued by

369
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,960
an attorney on behalf of a client,

370
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,440
which requests the opposing side

371
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,720
to fulfill their responsibility

372
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,639
to pay the compensation.

373
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,600
But...

374
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,360
will it work?

375
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,279
We'll

376
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,840
let the recipient know

377
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,399
about the consequences
if our demands are not met.

378
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,320
In this way,

379
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,000
it will act as a deterrent.

380
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,000
It's up to them.

381
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,679
Whether can they consider this

382
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,879
rationally.

383
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,240
This is beneficial to us too.

384
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,480
We can settle this

385
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
peacefully.

386
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,840
Let's wait for their response

387
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,440
to decide on

388
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
our next step.

389
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,840
Dad, Mom.

390
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,759
I think that'll work.

391
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,799
What do you think?

392
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,679
Does that mean

393
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,480
that we don't have to inform the village

394
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,159
and get help from Mr. Wan?

395
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,360
Yes.

396
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,759
We'll just leave this to Mr. Guan.

397
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
I think this will do.

398
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,399
It's really awkward
if we need to ask them for a favor.

399
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,200
That's right.

400
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,240
I feel so ashamed.

401
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,080
We'll leave this to Mr. Guan then.

402
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,559
Okay.

403
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,000
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

404
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,840
You're welcome.

405
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,080
That's all. Goodbye.

406
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,879
Goodbye.

407
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:53,480
Xingfu.

408
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
You talked about hiring a lawyer previously.

409
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,039
I was really worried.

410
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,759
If we file a lawsuit,

411
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,399
how should we

412
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,080
face Mr. Wan in the future?

413
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,720
However, if we don't take this case to court,

414
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,399
we can't get compensation.

415
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,879
I was really worried about this.

416
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,480
You're worried?

417
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,279
You're worried till you keep

418
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,200
tossing and turning at night.

419
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,600
I couldn't sleep well.

420
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,360
This is good.

421
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,679
Xingfu is thoughtful.

422
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,159
You're educated indeed.

423
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,559
You are indeed better than us.

424
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,799
Let's eat.

425
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,320
I've examined the matter.

426
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,879
It's true.

427
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,480
I've checked the agreement
that Qinglai signed with them too.

428
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,159
There is such a condition.

429
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,320
But the condition

430
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
was written ambiguously.

431
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,200
The Wang family

432
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,240
might have missed that detail.

433
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,759
If we try to find fault with this,

434
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,240
they might need to bear

435
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,919
the compensation of sixty thousand yuan.

436
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,600
I didn't read the agreement
between the vegetable vendor

437
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,320
and the supermarket in the city.

438
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,200
The amount of compensation

439
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,840
is stated by the vegetable vendor.

440
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,120
No one knows

441
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,320
if he is asking more than he should.

442
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,399
The amount of money doesn't matter.

443
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,600
But the issue is indeed complicated.

444
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,519
Cailiang.

445
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,559
Well.

446
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,559
Can you get the village to bear the compensation?

447
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,039
It doesn't make sense at all,

448
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,039
does it?

449
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,919
Well, they signed the agreement

450
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,519
and the compensation was given.

451
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,240
Theoretically,

452
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,840
this issue

453
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,399
is over and done.

454
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,220
Am I right?

455
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,020
Now, they suddenly

456
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,260
ask for compensation from the village.

457
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,420
Besides, our accounts

458
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,060
are transparent.

459
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,740
We can't explain it if we pay them again.

460
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,540
I think you should think of a way

461
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,660
to pay them through the company.

462
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,060
It's the same as well.

463
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,780
We collaborate with outsiders for this project.

464
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,300
We haven't even started the project,

465
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,780
yet we have to pay an amount of money.

466
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,180
That doesn't sound good.

467
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,340
It'll make our partners upset.

468
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,140
How about this?

469
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,980
I'm rather occupied these two days.

470
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,380
We'll arrange a day

471
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,260
and you shall invite Youde

472
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,180
to my place to have a drink together.

473
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,860
Invite the parents as well.

474
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,420
Let's persuade them

475
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,300
to bear the compensation first.

476
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,220
I'll find a chance in the future

477
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,380
to pay them back.

478
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
They have to understand

479
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,820
that everyone

480
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,380
is keeping an eye on this

481
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,820
and it's complicated.

482
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,660
Alright.

483
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,140
That's our only choice.

484
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,300
The red lines represent our sewage pipes.

485
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,980
It's a lot indeed.

486
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,100
From the picture,

487
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,620
the geological conditions

488
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,940
are complicated too.

489
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,740
We might need more money.

490
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,020
Liu.

491
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,860
You look charitable.

492
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,860
Why are you acting so stingy?

493
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,780
Just be straightforward.

494
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,660
Tell me,

495
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,660
how much more money do you need

496
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,140
to solve this issue?

497
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:53,940
Chuanjia.

498
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,820
I've asked them

499
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,420
to estimate a rough figure.

500
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,700
Moreover,

501
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,300
the brand and the models of the sewage system

502
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,220
that we ordered don't match.

503
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,300
I'll bring up the topic

504
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,940
during the upcoming negotiation.

505
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,980
So, everyone can discuss it.

506
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:07,900
Alright.

507
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,660
I have a suggestion

508
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,300
regarding your question about which direction

509
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,780

Why?

682
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,460
Isn't this your home?

683
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
You don't understand.

684
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,540
Rural kids,

685
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,620
especially those who are schooled in the city,

686
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,500
all want to stay in the city.

687
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,220
I can understand.

688
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,620
But you don't have to swear

689
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,020
that you will never return.

690
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,620
It's probably due to

691
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,940
some traditional customs

692
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,820
and outdated values

693
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,100
that I couldn't stand.

694
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,420
Did you know?

695
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,500
I realized one fact in university.

696
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,300
The mentality of rural kids and urban kids

697
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,820
are really different.

698
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,940
For urban kids,

699
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,860
no matter

700
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,940
they fail their examinations

701
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,220
or spend all their money,

702
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,580
they're still at ease.

703
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,460
But I'm different.

704
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,580
I'm always anxious.

705
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,500
I feel pressured.

706
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,180
I feel as if

707
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,620
I can't afford to waste any second

708
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,220
or any chances.

709
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,220
You're hardworking.

710
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,980
Things will get better.

711
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,580
Actually, you can be at ease too.

712
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,860
Hopefully.

713
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,100
Are you back for this matter?

714
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,140
Yes.

715
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,740
Okay, thank you.

716
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,460
The village secretary is

717
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,900
such a bully.

718
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,140
Hence, I asked Mr. Guan

719
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,500
to mediate the dispute.

720
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,580
I'll cook you something.

721
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,300
Mr. Guan.

722
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,820
Have some water. Have a seat.

723
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,660
It's okay, ma'am.

724
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,860
We won't be here for long.

725
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,060
No way.

726
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,020
You've come to our house.
You must eat before you go.

727
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,500
That's right. Do stay and have a meal with us.

728
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,740
My mom is a really decent cook.

729
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,900
Xingyun.

730
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,420
Come here.

731
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,820
What should I cook?

732
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,420
Hurry up.

733
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,020
I have no idea what my senior likes too.

734
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,380
Have a seat, Senior.

735
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,100
I'm sorry to trouble you.

736
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,700
What can I help you with, Mom?

737
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,300
You naughty girl.

738
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,540
What's wrong?

739
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,380
Mr. Guan is from the city.

740
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,940
He didn't know about our village's matter.

741
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
Don't you know about it?

742
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,620
Your sister's family is filing a lawsuit
against the village.

743
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,660
Why are you involving an outsider in this?

744
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,060
It's okay, Mom. Don't be anxious.

745
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,860
If she had a solution,

746
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,220
she wouldn't ask us for help.

747
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,460
She has no other choice.

748
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,620
She's so stubborn.

749
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,180
I can't help but worry about her.

750
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,700
She's still being stubborn at this point.

751
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,860
She's making things worse.

752
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,460
It won't, Mom.

753
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,420
Don't worry.

754
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:40,980
No.

755
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,260
I must give her a call.

756
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,020
Never mind, Mom.

757
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
She'll come in a minute.

758
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,540
We agreed to meet here.

759
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,940
I'm back, Mom.

760
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,060
Look, she's here.

761
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,020
Xingfu.

762
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,460
You're back.

763
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,540
Look at you.

764
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,980
You're pregnant. Why are you here?

765
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,980
Are you alright?

766
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,900
I'm alright.

767
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,420
Have you cooked dinner?

768
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,220
Drink some water, Xingfu.

769
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,940
I'll cook you dinner right away.

770
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,660
Alright, I'll help you out.

771
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,540
Be careful.

772
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,140
I'll do it.

773
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,260
Go and rest, Xingfu.

774
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,740
We had an agreement.

775
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,300
We'll wait till we harvest the vegetables.

776
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,340
Then, we'll dismantle the sheds.

777
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,420
But they didn't inform us

778
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,100
and went to the field.

779
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,620
When we arrived,

780
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,780
they were bulldozing the sheds with tractors.

781
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,100
We tried hard to stop them.

782
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,740
In the end, my father-in-law
vomited blood due to extreme anger.

783
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,060
Then, they finally stopped.

784
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:24,980
This means

785
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,060
that things have changed again.

786
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,580
In your agreement,

787
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,940
it is stated that before they carry on
with construction,

788
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,940
they must allow you
some time to dismantle the sheds.

789
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,540
They didn't

790
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,980
inform you in advance, did they?

791
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,340
Our meetings

792
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,780
were always chaotic.

793
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,700
I couldn't remember anything.

794
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,220
Does this count as evidence?

795
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,500
We'll see about that

796
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,260
in the court.

797
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,340
Now,

798
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,460
do tell me more

799
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,740
about the details.

800
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,380
This way,

801
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,420
we can

802
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,100
gain more advantage

803
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,740
in the court.

804
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,460
Xingfu.

805
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,500
You were living a good life.

806
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,420
Why must you

807
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,580
file a lawsuit against the village?

808
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,020
I'm not filing a lawsuit, Mom.

809
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,180
We're asking Mr. Guan to mediate the dispute.

810
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,340
Yes.

811
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,100
Ma'am.

812
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,100
Don't worry.

813
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,060
We're

814
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,260
in a society with the rule of law.

815
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,940
We act in accordance with the law.

816
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,940
There shouldn't be a problem.

817
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,500
Our priority now

818
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,900
is to solve the problem.

819
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,220
Mr. Guan.

820
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,020
I can see that you're a reasonable man.

821
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,780
I believe in you, then.

822
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,180
I'll leave her in-laws' matter

823
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,500
in your hands.

824
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,380
Don't worry, Mom.

825
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,620
He is extremely reliable.

826
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,700
[Wanjia Group]
We still have to put this out to tender.

827
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,540
Don't think about your relatives.

828
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,900
Mr. Wan is here.

829
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,580
Everyone has been really busy recently.

830
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,420
I've checked.

831
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,100
Your performance is great.

832
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,740
I'm asking you over

833
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,940
as I want to have a short meeting.

834
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,140
General Manager Wan, please stand up.

835
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,300
What's the matter?

836
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,020
Stand up and talk.

837
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,220
But...

838
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,700
We're in a meeting.

839
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,660
I'm the group's managing director.

840
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,860
Why did you

841
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,140
tear down Wang Youde's field?

842
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,300
All fields belong to the country.

843
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,500
It's not his land.

844
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,340
We're about to build

845
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,380
a wastewater treatment plant.

846
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,420
We acquired that land.

847
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,180
We even signed the land acquisition agreement.

848
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,220
What about their property on the land?

849
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,860
The vegetables and sheds

850
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,660
are their property.

851
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,820
Have you informed them in advance?

852
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,740
You didn't inform them in advance.

853
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,940
You ordered the workers
to dismantle it as you like.

854
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,780
Besides,

855
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,620
according to our schedule,

856
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,060
we should be building
the health products factory first.

857
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,420
Then, we build the wastewater treatment plant.

858
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,420
Why did you have to rush it?

859
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,740
I just wanted to avenge you.

860
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
Alright, Dad.

861
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,260
Address me as Chairman Wan,

862
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:51,900
Mr. Wan.

863
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,780
Fine, Chairman Wan.

864
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,940
Chairman Wan.

865
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,860
During the site inspection,

866
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,900
they made you furious
and you got high blood pressure.

867
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,860
You rested at home for two days.

868
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,060
No one dared to look for you.

869
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,420
It's dragging the schedule behind.

870
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,580
It's about

871
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,940
Wang Youde's land after all.

872
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,420
If it were not for Cailiang,

873
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,740
I'd have flattened their field.

874
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,500
Everything will be settled.

875
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,700
We can proceed with our project.

876
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,700
These peasants keep pestering us.

877
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,900
Stop calling them peasants.

878
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,540
They're all villagers of the Wan Village.

879
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
Are you a bandit?

880
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,300
It isn't easy

881
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,580
for farmers to earn a living.

882
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,300
When such an incident happens,

883
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,740
it's understandable that they're asking

884
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,620
for more money.

885
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,020
Am I right?

886
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,860
You can educate them slowly
if they don't understand.

887
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,260
However, you took apart

888
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,700
their field without advance notice.

889
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,100
You destroyed their properties.

890
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,700
Shouldn't you compensate them?

891
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,980
Never.

892
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,940
How dare they ask for compensation?

893
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,100
It's their punishment for disobeying us.

894
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,140
If they refuse to accept it,

895
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,900
they can come to me.

896
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,780
I'm the general manager of the group.

897
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,220
I should be

898
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,780
in charge of this.

899
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,140
It's you who meddled with this.

900
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,980
Otherwise, I'd have solved this ages ago.

901
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,820
We wouldn't have to go through the trouble...

902
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,780
Shut up!

903
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,380
I'm gathering everyone

904
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,140
to talk about this.

905
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,180
General Manager Wan has handled

906
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,700
the land acquisition matter poorly.

907
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,380
On behalf of Wanjia Group,
I shall reprimand his action.

908
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,940
This is his personal action.

909
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,500
Hence,

910
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,860
the loss

911
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,420
of Wang Youde's family

912
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,260
will be assumed by General Manager Wan solely.

913
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,060
Cailiang.

914
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,340
Meet Youde.

915
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,500
Ask him to calculate his loss

916
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,420
and let us know.

917
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,020
Please be reasonable.

918
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,500
I'm doing this for the Group.

919
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,940
Why should I take responsibility for this alone?

920
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,460
As you're working for the Group,

921
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,020
you shouldn't do

922
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,060
whatever you like.

923
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,980
You shouldn't decide everything on your own then.

924
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,700
Everyone is present.

925
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,060
Come on.

926
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,180
Let's put it to a vote.

927
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,980
There is no need.

928
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,340
This is final.

929
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,540
If you disagree,

930
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,420
you may consider quitting your job.

931
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,020
Dismiss.

932
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,860
What should I say?

933
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,540
I have no idea.

934
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,180
What do you mean?

935
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,940
You rested at home for two days.

936
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,740
Are you recharged now?

937
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,140
You vented on me once you're back,

938
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,260
using me to reinforce your prestige.

939
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,980
Is that necessary?

940
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,620
Don't be ungrateful.

941
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,020
Have you seen how the others look at you?

942
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,780
I'm helping you.

943
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,780
You think I can manage Wanjia Group
for the rest of my life?

944
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,780
But in your hands,

945
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,700
Wanjia Group won't last long.

946
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,660
I only know

947
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,700
that you tore down their field today.

948
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,340
Wang Youde even
vomited blood due to extreme anger.

949
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,380
Who will be committed to working for you?

950
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,620
Even if they pretend that they're committed,

951
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,740
they're not committed deep down.

952
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
Whatever.

953
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,660
As long as they obey my orders.

954
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,020
Will they really obey your orders?

955
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,260
They can pretend to agree with you

956
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,540
but create trouble for you secretly.

957
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,460
The higher your position is,

958
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,660
the more open-minded you should be.

959
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,900
If you make a mistake, you must admit it.

960
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,380
A mistake isn't horrifying.

961
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,420
You just have to correct it.

962
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,340
I'm in the right, okay?

963
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,060
I did that for the interest of the Group.

964
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,980
I did that for my job.

965
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,380
Even if you're in the right,
you need to use the right method.

966
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,740
You shouldn't handle this roughly

967
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,740
and punish those who disobey you.

968
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,060
That's not right.

969
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,300
You're acting like a local tyrant.

970
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,660
Alright. That's enough.

971
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,420
Stop nagging me.

972
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,220
I got it.

973
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,740
However,

974
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,340
I'll be honest.

975
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,540
If you criticize me in public again,

976
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,980
affecting my image,

977
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,300
I will not hold it in anymore.

978
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,940
I'll refute and talk back to you.

979
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,060
Don't blame me for being unfilial then.

980
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,220
How dare you!

981
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,740
You're so rebellious.

982
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,740
Well...

983
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,300
Mr. Wan.

984
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,020
He Xingfu is here.

985
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,140
Nice to meet you, Mr. Wan.

986
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,020
Xingfu.

987
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,420
Who is this?

988
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,660
This is Mr. Guan, a lawyer.

989
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,220
Hello, I'm Guan Tao.

990
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,940
I'm a lawyer from Yidao Law Firm.

991
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,580
We're here upon Wang Qinglai's request

992
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,220
to represent his family to mediate in

993
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,140
the land acquisition agreement dispute

994
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,780
and

995
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,060
your personal dispute.

996
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,700
We're here today

997
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,940
to discuss our views

998
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,260
and negotiate the solutions.

999
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,500
This is our business.

1000
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,820
It's none of

1001
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,860
your business.

1002
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,540
Please leave.

1003
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,780
I'm afraid that you're not
in the position to say so.

1004
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,100
We've reached a consensus with the Wang family.

1005
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,380
I'm representing the Wang family

1006
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,500
to negotiate this with you.

1007
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,380
Well, well. He Xingfu.

1008
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,260
How lucky for the Wang family to have you!

1009
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,460
It's your idea again, isn't it?

1010
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,260
My in-laws agreed on this.

1011
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,060
Do you hear them?

1012
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,860
What did I say earlier?

1013
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,860
You wanted me to talk to them nicely.

1014
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,340
They're filing a lawsuit against us now.

1015
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,700
Thank you, He Xingfu.

1016
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,980
You showed him

1017
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,260
the vicissitudes of life

1018
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,340
and the evils of the world.

1019
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,580
Well done.

1020
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,020
What are you planning to do?

1021
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,140
This is a reasonable demand.

1022
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,020
If you don't accept it,

1023
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,780
you shouldn't tear the agreement apart

1024
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,740
and confiscate our field.

1025
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,300
Our greenhouses and vegetables

1026
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,660
are almost destroyed.

1027
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,180
We need to settle this.

1028
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,500
That's right.

1029
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,860
We have to settle this.

1030
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,380
Why did I dismantle your field?

1031
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,580
I was just trying to solve the problem.

1032
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,980
What do you mean by tearing the agreement apart?

1033
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,220
Who's the one who went back on his word

1034
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,900
after signing the agreement?

1035
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,420
Who is it?

1036
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,780
Who went back on his own word?

1037
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,060
Even if you compensate us,

1038
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,380
we're still running at a loss.

1039
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,620
The village wants to build a factory

1040
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,300
and they are acquiring lands.

1041
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,660
We tried to give our cooperation.

1042
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,740
But our greenhouses and vegetable fields

1043
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,900
are almost destroyed.

1044
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,420
We're at a bigger loss.

1045
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,820
Mr. Wan.

1046
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,700
How could we survive?

1047
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,220
You're really funny.

1048
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,540
Why would we be bothered by that?

1049
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,220
It's your business.

1050
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,420
Well.

1051
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,100
Stop accusing us of everything.

1052
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,340
We don't owe you anything.

1053
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,420
You're the one who dismantled our field.

1054
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,860
How dare you get angry?

1055
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:27,860
Listen.

1056
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,900
The sight of you makes my blood boil.

1057
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,820
You're pregnant, aren't you?

1058
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,100
Then you shouldn't get angry.

1059
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,420
Otherwise, you'll blame our group again

1060
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,500
if your pregnancy goes awry.

1061
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,860
We can't take that responsibility.

1062
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,580
That's enough.

1063
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,500
Stop it.

1064
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,780
If that's the case,

1065
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,540
we shall settle this through legal procedures.

1066
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,540
We can't settle this

1067
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,820
if we continue to argue.

1068
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,100
Wanjia Group has its own attorneys, right?

1069
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,340
If it's possible,

1070
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,420
can you please ask them over?

1071
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,180
I'll talk to them about it.

1072
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,660
I know about this from top to bottom.

1073
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,100
If I ask the attorneys over,
I'll have to explain to them again.

1074
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,420
Besides, they're under my charge.

1075
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,420
I'm the boss here.

1076
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,460
Alright then.

1077
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,620
According to

1078
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,180
the demand letter that I've sent,

1079
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,020
in addition to

1080
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,540
Wanjia Group's

1081
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,540
actions that caused

1082
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,740
a loss to the Wang family's vegetables
and greenhouses

1083
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,660
due to a construction project.

1084
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,780
If you're willing to compensate for their loss,

1085
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,300
we can solve this dispute personally.

1086
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,020
In this way,

1087
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,420
we won't have to intensify the feud.

1088
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,660
I always thought

1089
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,220
that we can solve everything harmoniously

1090
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,660
through negotiation.

1091
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,300
But they insist on taking this case to court

1092
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,980
and involve you in this.

1093
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,460
Fine.

1094
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,180
We'll take this case to court then.

1095
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,260
I, Wan Shantang,

1096
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,380
can be open

1097
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,260
to persuasion.

1098
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,180
But I'll never submit

1099
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,060
to coercion.

1100
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,940
Send them off, Chuanjia.

1101
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,180
Okay.

1102
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,780
I think you should

1103
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,300
consider this rationally, Mr. Wan.

1104
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,180
What's there to consider?

1105
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,540
You're a lawyer.

1106
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,660
You didn't even do your homework.

1107
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,060
You have no idea about Wan's temper.

1108
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,980
You want to have a negotiation with him.

1109
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,540
What's there to negotiate about?

1110
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,780
Please leave.

1111
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,420
You...

1112
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,020
File a lawsuit. Do whatever you want.

1113
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,260
Get the court to issue a summon.

1114
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,300
How is it?

1115
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,460
It didn't go well.

1116
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,540
Let's talk about it at home.

1117
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,220
I can't believe this.

1118
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,180
As the chairman of Wanjia Group,

1119
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,180
he doesn't even understand the law.

1120
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,300
I told him

1121
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,940
that I wanted to talk to their attorneys.

1122
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,820
He didn't want to cooperate.

1123
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,900
I don't understand.

1124
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,660
How did they manage to grow their business?

1125
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,220
Well...

1126
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,820
Does this mean

1127
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,740
it didn't go well even if we had hired an attorney

1128
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,180
to be the mediator?

1129
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,340
He refused to negotiate.

1130
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,660
He said

1131
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,900
that we can file a lawsuit against them.

1132
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,820
Then, he kicked us out.

1133
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,820
What should we do?

1134
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,180
What else can we do?

1135
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,220
They're being unreasonable.

1136
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,980
We shall take the case to court then.

1137
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,900
Mr. Guan said so.

1138
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,220
We're in the right

1139
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,220
from the perspective of the law.

1140
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,660
Seems like

1141
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,900
we have to take this to court

1142
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,100
if we don't want to be bullied.

1143
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,340
Don't we have other choices?

1144
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,900
It's our only choice.

1145
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,500
We've tried everything.

1146
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,300
None of them worked.

1147
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,500
They tore down our field.

1148
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,660
Yet they refuse to compensate us.

1149
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,180
Officer Li talked to them,

1150
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,020
but to no avail.

1151
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,340
Even you and Qinglai
got admitted to the hospital.

1152
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,780
We're all humans.

1153
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,060
How could they do that to us?

1154
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,140
Enough.

1155
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,260
Why can't I complain about it?

1156
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,660
If we don't speak up,

1157
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,740
we'll only get bullied.

1158
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,300
Mr. Guan.

1159
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,460
What do you think?

1160
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,980
We're lawyers.

1161
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,700
We can't engage in barratry.

1162
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,980
In my opinion,

1163
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,420
taking this to court

1164
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,740
isn't as serious as you think.

1165
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,300
Our country is promoting

1166
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,900
a law-based government.

1167
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,140
In the future,

1168
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,100
citizens' legal consciousness

1169
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,100
will elevate.

1170
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,940
Using the law

1171
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,340
to solve disputes

1172
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,020
will be a common phenomenon in the future.

1173
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,740
If we're taking this to court,

1174
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,220
we have to be mindful of the methods we use

1175
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,900
during the legal proceeding.

1176
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,860
We must state reasonable claims.

1177
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,420
If we don't file a lawsuit,

1178
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
we can negotiate with them.

1179
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,740
However,

1180
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,700
judging by today's event,

1181
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,820
that'll be hard.

1182
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,140
No matter what your decision is,

1183
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,140
you need to discuss it

1184
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,220
with everyone in the family.

1185
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,380
Well.

1186
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,300
You can discuss it.

1187
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,820
We'll come over tomorrow.

1188
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,300
I can't believe it.

1189
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,540
We're already in the twentieth century.

1190
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,020
Yet in this village,

1191
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,060
the authorities

1192
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,940
and villagers

1193
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,420
are still uneducated about the law.

1194
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,860
Xingyun.

1195
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,620
Didn't you say that we don't have cases?

1196
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,700
Look.

1197
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,060
You grew up in the countryside.

1198
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,420
You understand things
in the countryside better.

1199
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,500
Let's develop our legal business

1200
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,900
in the village, shall we?

1201
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,220
No.

1202
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,540
Why not?

1203
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
Didn't you say it?

1204
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,020
Their knowledge of the law is outdated.

1205
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,420
If we try to educate them about the law,

1206
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,580
it's impossible to communicate with them.

1207
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,580
It's like casting pearls before swine.

1208
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,780
It'll be a waste of time and effort.

1209
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,940
This is the value of our existence as lawyers.

1210
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,300
In my opinion,

1211
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,860
if a country

1212
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,700
tries to promote the law,

1213
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,980
not only the city,

1214
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,380
the countryside should be included as well.

1215
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,340
Only when you replace

1216
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,300
the feelings with the law,

1217
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,820
you can build a law-based government.

1218
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,260
Are you trying to reform the countryside?

1219
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,060
Why not?

1220
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,220
Our responsibility as lawyers

1221
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,460
includes

1222
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,500
promoting the rule of law.

1223
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,100
But this is too tough.

1224
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,420
Yes.

1225
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,580
It won't be easy.

1226
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,100
If it's easy, we wouldn't be here.

1227
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,100
Let's take

1228
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,300
Mr. Han and the other lawyers
in the law firm as an example.

1229
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,500
To be honest,

1230
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,060
when they first started their career,

1231
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,860
I believe they were passionate
about their work too.

1232
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,380
What about now?

1233
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,900
They treat the law as a business.

1234
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
When I get to their age,

1235
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,940
I won't be like them.

1236
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,500
Why are you staring at me?

1237
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,460
Am I wrong?

1238
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,100
You're absolutely right.

1239
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,620
Xingyun.

1240
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,460
Why didn't you go meet them with us

1241
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,780
when we were at Wanjia Group?

1242
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,580
You said you were feeling unwell.

1243
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,940
That was just your excuse, right?

1244
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,540
Well.

1245
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,500
I'm Xingfu's sister.

1246
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,660
I'm afraid

1247
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,180
that they might make an issue out of this

1248
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,820
and cause a misunderstanding.

1249
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,980
You know each other. Isn't that better?

1250
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,340
It's more convenient to communicate
with people you know, isn't it?

1251
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,580
Sometimes,

1252
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,140
ambiguous

1253
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,500
relationships

1254
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,140
are even more complicated.

1255
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,740
