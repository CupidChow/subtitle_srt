00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,800
The bride is here!

5
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
The bride is here!

6
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,880
She's here!

7
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,679
She's here?

8
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,000
Over here.

9
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:49,160
Be careful.

10
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,960
Thank you for coming.

11
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,440
The Wang family is honored by your presence.

12
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,679
You flatter me.

13
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,360
Congratulations.

14
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,279
Thank you.

15
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,240
Time does fly, huh?

16
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,119
Your son is getting married now.

17
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:01,919
Yeah.

18
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,279
Next time, it'll be my grandson's wedding.

19
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,240
Go and have some candies.

20
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,440
Go and have fun.

21
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,119
Have a seat. We can talk later.

22
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,880
Xiuyu!

23
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:16,960
Good girl.

24
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,279
Mom, what's the matter?

25
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,039
Get us some snacks.

26
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,520
Don't let your sister-in-law starve.

27
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,440
Okay, Mom.

28
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,559
Congratulations.

29
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,160
You're here?

30
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,320
The kids have grown up already?

31
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Congratulations.

32
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,800
Thank you!

33
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,919
Qingzhi, come.

34
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,839
Today's your brother's wedding day.

35
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,199
You have to make sure
everything proceeds smoothly.

36
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,639
Go and monitor the entrance.

37
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,559
Don't worry, Mom.

38
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,199
Over here!

39
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,440
Please follow me!

40
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,360
Over here!

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,679
Go and have some candies.

42
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,479
Mom told you to pass this to our sister-in-law.

43
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,119
Okay.

44
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,759
Go now.

45
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,919
Come in.

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,080
So,

47
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,360
Mom was afraid

48
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,880
that you two might be starving.

49
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:20,759
She told me

50
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,320
to bring some snacks for you two.

51
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,440
Okay.

52
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,839
I'll...

53
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,359
I'll resume my work now.

54
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,640
Xingfu,

55
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,040
it's such a waste for you

56
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,880
to marry into the Wang family.

57
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,640
Why is it a waste?

58
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,760
I'm not a rich man's daughter.

59
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,279
Even if Prince Charming does exist,

60
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,760
I'm not good enough for him.

61
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,119
I'll be content

62
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,799
as long as you find yourself a good husband.

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,760
To me, my sister is the best.

64
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,160
But I don't understand something.

65
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,920
What do you

66
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,959
like about your husband?

67
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,559
I like him because he's honest and hardworking.

68
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,440
He doesn't smoke or gamble either.

69
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:09,959
That's all?

70
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,160
Aren't your expectations too low?

71
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,239
I know honesty is a great attribute.

72
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,600
However,

73
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,119
if one is as honest as my brother-in-law,

74
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,079
people will call him a coward.

75
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:22,279
Think about it.

76
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,640
Isn't it embarrassing for you

77
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,799
if you bring him out with you

78
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,119
in the future?

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,920
He's so lame.

80
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,720
What's wrong with you?

81
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,079
So, you're looking down on the villagers

82
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,839
just because you attended university?

83
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,920
Don't forget.

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,519
Even if

85
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,720
you move into the city in the future,

86
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,640
you were born in this village.

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,679
I know that.

88
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,559
Stop glaring at me.

89
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,679
What about you?

90
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,600
How's your relationship with Daxun?

91
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,760
Is it going well?

92
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,359
It's going pretty well.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,440
He gave me this before I came here.

94
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,000
He told me to miss him every day.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,519
This looks gorgeous.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,160
Did he buy this for you?

97
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:07,920
It's so gorgeous.

98
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,079
I think this is quite expensive.

99
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,160
You shouldn't spend his money all the time.

100
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,359
Just tell me if you need money.

101
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,000
He'll look down on our family

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,440
if you keep spending his money like this.

103
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,600
I got it.

104
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,720
Chuanjia.

105
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,480
Over here.

106
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,440
Dad, Mom!

107
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,760
Chuanjia is here!

108
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:29,959
Chuanjia, you're here.

109
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,160
Congratulations.

110
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,760
Thank you.

111
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,799
Today's Qinglai's wedding day.

112
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,040
Of course I have to be here.

113
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,720
Take the red envelope.

114
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
No need for that.

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
We're honored with your presence alone.

116
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,320
Yeah.

117
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,839
Is that so?

118
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,640
-Yes.
-Alright then.

119
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,679
Just take it.

120
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,920
Thank you.

121
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,200
This is too much.

122
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,359
Chuanjia,

123
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:50,040
can your father make it?

124
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,200
He went to the county for work.

125
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't know if he can make it.

126
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Can you please

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,480
ask him over the phone?

128
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,119
He'll come here himself

129
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:58,119
if he can make it.

130
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,040
No one can do anything about it

131
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
if he cannot make it.

132
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,959
Besides,

133
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,480
I'm here, aren't I? It's the same.

134
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,119
Yeah!

135
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,679
You're right!

136
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:05,640
Which table should I take?

137
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,600
The main table.

138
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,760
Qingzhi!

139
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,519
Bring him to his table.

140
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,760
Please.

141
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,720
It's almost time, you know?

142
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,440
Don't tell me Mr. Wan

143
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,720
can't make it?

144
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,440
He will make it.

145
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:19,040
He promised me personally.

146
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,720
Didn't you hear what Chuanjia said just now?

147
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,239
The auspicious hour has arrived!

148
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,920
Let us begin the ceremony.

149
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,480
-Wait!
-Let us...

150
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Wait a minute.

151
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,600
We won't begin the ceremony.

152
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,359
What's wrong?

153
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,559
We have to wait for Mr. Wan.

154
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,160
Okay.

155
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,920
Let me see.

156
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,959
Let's wait a little longer.

157
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,399
They said Mr. Wan isn't here yet.

158
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,040
Let's wait a little longer.

159
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,320
Why should we wait for a mere secretary?

160
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,480
I don't know.

161
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,559
Let's just wait then.

162
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,119
This is ridiculous.

163
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,600
What a bunch of bootlickers.

164
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,119
What are you saying?

165
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,079
Am I wrong?

166
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,519
The secretary isn't the one getting married today.

167
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,399
Why should we wait for him?

168
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,040
Let's just hold on for a little longer.

169
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,200
Just a little longer.

170
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,279
Let's wait.

171
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,559
Have some candies.

172
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,559
The ceremony will start soon.

173
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,320
Let's wait a little longer.

174
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,279
Mr. Wan is here!

175
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,600
Guizhi!

176
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,480
Mr. Wan is here!

177
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,760
Hurry!

178
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,359
Mr. Wan!

179
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,839
You're finally here!

180
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,559
Mr. Cailiang, you're here as well?

181
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,720
Madam, are you blaming me right now?

182
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,480
You're blaming me for being late, aren't you?

183
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,239
I told Chuanjia to pass

184
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:23,799
the red envelope to you.

185
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,440
Didn't he pass it to you?

186
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,399
He did.

187
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,239
Look.

188
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,640
I'm not an eloquent speaker.

189
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,600
Hello, Mr. Wan.

190
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,279
Hello. Don't get yourself drunk, okay?

191
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,839
What I meant was,

192
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,119
we're so lucky that you can make it today.

193
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:34,600
That's right.

194
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,279
You're shifting the topic again.

195
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,079
Qinglai's wedding is a huge deal.

196
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:38,959
I have to come

197
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,479
even if there's a hailstorm or a flood here.

198
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,200
Please take your seat.

199
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,039
Over here.

200
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,440
Please take your seat.

201
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,039
Have a seat.

202
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,119
Here, take the red envelope.

203
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,679
Thank you!

204
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,479
So, Mr. Wan,

205
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,919
can we start now?

206
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,840
Go ahead. Hurry up.

207
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,119
Let's begin.

208
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,359
Begin the ceremony!

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,760
The auspicious hour has arrived!
Let us begin the ceremony!

210
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,359
First, let us welcome

211
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:10,200
the parents of the newlyweds
to make their entrances!

212
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,880
Great!

213
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,280
Hurry.

214
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,119
We'll make a move first.

215
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,000
Nice!

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,719
Where should we sit?

217
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,119
Over here.

218
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,599
Let us give a big hand

219
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,400
to our groom, Wang Qinglai,

220
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,359
and our bride, He Xingfu,

221
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,400
as they make their entrances!

222
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,239
Nice!

223
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,880
First, a bow to Heaven and Earth!

224
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,159
Who's the bridesmaid?

225
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,679
I think it's her younger sister.

226
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,039
Second, a bow to the parents!

227
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,320
Nice!

228
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,679
Wait!

229
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,559
Don't bow first.

230
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,919
Mr. Wan,

231
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,200
please come up to the stage

232
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,400
and let them

233
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,239
bow to you.

234
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,799
-Yeah!
-This is inappropriate.

235
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,840
It's your son's wedding day.

236
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,119
They should bow to Heaven and Earth
and their parents.

237
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,039
Why should they bow to me?

238
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,719
Not at all!

239
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,479
Mr. Wan!

240
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,119
You must let them bow to you!

241
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,039
Without you,

242
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,919
the Wan Village wouldn't even exist!

243
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,520
These are two different matters.
I think it's inappropriate.

244
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:25,880
Please.

245
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,840
-Fine.
-Follow us.

246
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,919
How could they bow to me?

247
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,599
Watch your steps.

248
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,719
I don't think this is appropriate.

249
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:34,719
Congratulations.

250
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,520
Look at him.

251
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,119
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

252
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,119
Xingfu,

253
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,239
since you're new to the village,

254
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,440
let me introduce him to you.

255
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,640
This is

256
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,919
the village secretary.

257
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,919
Without him,

258
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,880
the village would be in shambles.

259
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
You guys wouldn't be able to enjoy
such a lively wedding.

260
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,919
Enough, Madam.

261
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,119
In the future, we still need to depend on Mr. Wan

262
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:55,679
to take care of our village.

263
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,679
That's enough.

264
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,760
Come on. You two,

265
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,000
bow to Mr. Wan right now.

266
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,919
I don't think this is appropriate.

267
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,719
A bow to the leader of the Wan Village,

268
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,119
Mr. Wan!

269
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:05,799
You guys are...

270
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,880
-Please sit down.
-Bow!

271
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,039
Okay! Thank you!

272
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,559
Bow again!

273
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,000
That's enough.

274
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,640
Bow again!

275
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,559
No need for that!

276
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,479
Please stop it.

277
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:14,919
That's enough.

278
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,200
Congratulations.

279
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Alright, everyone, quiet down.

280
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:22,039
Today's Qinglai's wedding day.

281
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,320
It seems like Qinglai

282
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,200
is pretty popular.

283
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,280
Look at all the guests we have today.

284
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,119
Using this opportunity,

285
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,239
let us invite Mr. Wan

286
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,919
to give us a speech,

287
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,640
okay?

288
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,280
-Cailiang!
-Okay!

289
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:36,520
I...

290
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,400
Give us a speech.

291
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,159
Give us a speech!

292
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,640
Okay.

293
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,080
So, I would like to thank everyone.

294
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,880
Today, Youde's eldest son, Qinglai,

295
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,960
is holding his wedding.

296
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,359
Youde has the surname Wang.

297
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,640
He's one of the minorities

298
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,119
in the Wan Village.

299
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,280
But when the village was still undeveloped,

300
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,239
Youde was one of the first people

301
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,400
who joined me to collect ores from the mountains.

302
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,200
I alone could not

303
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,479
develop the Wan Village myself.

304
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,440
It's the result of the effort
of everyone in the village.

305
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,960
So,

306
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,080
even if Wang Youde is one of the minorities
in the village,

307
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,440
I'll treat them like family

308
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,320
as long as they've contributed
to the development

309
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
of the Wan Village.

310
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:16,280
Today, Wang's son is going to get married.

311
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,520
Let us hold a grand wedding for them

312
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,119
in the Wan Village, okay?

313
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,239
Okay!

314
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,960
Everyone,

315
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
isn't Qinglai's bride

316
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,599
beautiful?

317
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,880
She's beautiful!

318
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Qinglai is very fortunate

319
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,440
to get a beautiful wife like her.

320
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,479
It's also the honor of the Wang family

321
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,719
and the Wan Village
to get a beautiful villager like her!

322
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:38,919
That's right!

323
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:41,159
Now, the days of being poor

324
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,960
and not being able to afford a wedding are over.

325
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,159
Now,

326
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:46,239
we've become wealthy.

327
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,119
Everyone here is able to lead good lives now.

328
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,719
I just wish

329
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,799
that the young boys of our village

330
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,679
can get themselves beautiful wives

331
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,719
from all over the nation.

332
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,919
That will make me happy!

333
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,840
Nice!

334
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,640
So,

335
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,119
Chuanjia, come up.

336
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,679
What's the matter?

337
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,440
Did you bring any money with you?

338
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:10,359
Come here.

339
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,799
Mr. Wan,

340
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,559
Chuanjia has given us the red envelope.

341
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,200
He already gave us the red envelope.

342
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,080
The red envelope was for the banquet.

343
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,960
These children bowed to me, you know?

344
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,599
I have to do something in return.

345
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,159
Here, take this.

346
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,559
Mr. Wan,

347
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,840
listen to me.

348
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,239
I just want the future generations

349
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,679
to remember your kindness and be grateful to you.

350
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,479
If you do this,

351
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,880
it'll make me an unsightly person.

352
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,679
You mustn't do this.

353
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,400
Madam, I'll get angry if you don't take it.

354
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,679
Just take it!

355
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,400
Just take it!

356
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,520
Just take it.

357
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,479
Hurry and thank him.

358
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,200
Thank you, Mr. Wan.

359
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,679
You two must be filial to him in the future.

360
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,559
I have one last thing to say.

361
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,520
Remember his kindness.

362
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,880
Everyone, I have one last thing to say.

363
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,479
I wish them

364
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,280
a blissful marriage

365
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,400
and a harmonious family.

366
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,640
Great!

367
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,280
Please continue.

368
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,200
Go ahead.

369
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,239
Watch your steps!

370
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,679
Watch your steps.

371
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,440
I'm fine.

372
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,320
Mr. Cailiang, please take care of him.

373
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,479
Let us continue the ceremony!

374
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,119
I wasn't ready for that.

375
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:09,159
Second, a bow to their parents!

376
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,479
Great!

377
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,880
A bow to each other!

378
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,559
Great!

379
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
The ceremony is done!

380
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,679
Great!

381
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,119
Kiss her!

382
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:31,320
The banquet begins!

383
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,359
Hurry! Serve the liquor.

384
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,599
Qingzhi, fill Mr. Wang's cup.

385
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,400
Come in.

386
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:42,919
Brother-in-law.

387
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,000
You must be exhausted.

388
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:54,440
Have some water.

389
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,559
It's almost time for us
to return their toasts, right?

390
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,520
There's no need to rush.

391
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,919
Qingzhi

392
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,799
and I

393
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,320
will deal with them first.

394
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,440
You guys can have some water

395
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,880
and food for now.

396
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,840
If not, you'll get sick

397
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,440
if you drink liquor

398
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,760
on an empty stomach.

399
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,320
You two

400
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,599
can take a break.

401
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,679
I'll entertain them first.

402
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,919
You shouldn't drink too much.

403
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:19,919
Don't worry.

404
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,159
I'll be fine.

405
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,599
I'll make a move first.

406
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,200
Xingfu,

407
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,479
Qinglai might be silly sometimes,

408
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,679
but he's very thoughtful.

409
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,960
I'll give him an extra five points

410
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,840
as encouragement.

411
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:39,719
Come on.

412
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,599
Let me look at

413
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:42,840
my beautiful bride again.

414
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,119
Thank you.

415
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:47,919
Qinglai,

416
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,599
let's offer Chuanjia a toast.

417
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:55,919
Chuanjia.

418
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,159
My brother

419
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,919
is here to offer you guys a toast.

420
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,000
He would like to thank you all

421
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,119
for attending his wedding.

422
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,799
You can offer us a toast,

423
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,159
but you shouldn't use this cup.

424
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,960
Here, fill it up.

425
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,359
Fill it to the top.

426
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,159
I never expected

427
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,679
Qinglai,

428
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,880
the famous introvert

429
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,039
of our village,

430
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,239
to get himself such a beautiful wife. Am I right?

431
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:17,880
Yeah.

432
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,200
Isn't he the pride of the Wan Village?

433
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,880
Yeah, he is!

434
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,280
Doesn't that mean he needs to drink for us?

435
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,880
Yes!

436
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,840
Say no more. Come on.

437
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,440
Drink up.

438
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,239
Come on.

439
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,640
Chuanjia, that's too much for him.

440
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,440
It's his wedding day.

441
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,159
It's never too much.

442
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,140
Come on, my brothers.

443
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,230
Let's offer Qinglai a toast.

444
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,260
Here, bottoms up.

445
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,790
Bottoms up.

446
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,310
Qinglai.

447
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,870
Come on.

448
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,380
Nice!

449
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,940
What a generous man!

450
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,870
Drink up!

451
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
That's enough.

452
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,670
Alright, Chuanjia.

453
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,670
My brother and I have to offer
the other tables a toast too.

454
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,990
Go ahead.

455
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,030
Go ahead.

456
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:53,940
Be careful.

457
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,670
Qinglai, be careful.

458
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,180
The ladies

459
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,790
who were married into the Wan Village

460
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,380
are getting prettier by the day.

461
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,940
I think it'll be difficult

462
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,870
for girls from other villages

463
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,700
to marry into the Wan Village.

464
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,380
Yeah.

465
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,430
We moved from the city

466
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,060
back to the Wan Village in 2005.

467
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,180
It's been almost four years.

468
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,500
We had witnessed the development

469
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,590
of the Wan Village with our own eyes.

470
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,710
It's all thanks to Shantang.

471
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,620
You flatter me too much.

472
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,460
Maybe, I did contribute a little bit to it.

473
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,500
Who knew this would happen, right?

474
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,030
Back then, we had to transport the ores

475
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,980
trolley by trolley
from the mountains to the village.

476
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,030
But now,

477
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,140
we've built

478
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,140
a developed village like Wan Village

479
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,030
that makes the other villages

480
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,550
envious of us.

481
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,710
Chuanjia!

482
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,070
Chuanjia!

483
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,620
Chuanjia! Come here!

484
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,430
Chuanjia, your father is calling for you.

485
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,140
You guys can continue.

486
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,070
I'll be back in a second.

487
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,430
I'll be back soon.

488
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,310
Continue drinking.

489
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,100
Come on.

490
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,070
Come here.

491
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,860
Chuanjia is here.

492
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,670
How could you guys drink by yourself?

493
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,070
You should offer old folks like us a toast.

494
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,910
So, was my father

495
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,740
bragging about the glorious history

496
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,830
of the Wan Village again?

497
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,590
So, you hate hearing it?

498
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,310
Young brats like you wouldn't

499
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,190
even be able to get married today

500
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:02,830
if the older generation

501
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,070
didn't bend their back and collect ores
in the mountains back then.

502
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,140
Yeah.

503
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,030
Chuanjia,

504
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,100
we wouldn't be able to enjoy

505
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,030
a grand feast like this today

506
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,860
without the glorious history
your father had bragged about.

507
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,340
I know it was a glorious history.

508
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,380
However, we should look towards the future too.

509
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,830
I belong to the younger generation.

510
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,860
Let me offer the elders a toast. Here.

511
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,740
That's more like it.

512
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,460
Come on.

513
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,550
You guys don't need to stand up.

514
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,670
He's much younger than you.

515
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,790
I'll say this today.

516
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,670
Everyone will surely lead a good life

517
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,380
as long as the Wanjia Group is still around.

518
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,070
Okay?

519
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,590
Okay!

520
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,860
Sit down.

521
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,590
Can't you just sit here

522
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,260
and keep the elders company?

523
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,430
It's as if you're itching to go.

524
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,260
You guys have your old traditions to brag about.

525
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,710
We have our own things to brag about.

526
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,980
Please take care of my father here.

527
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,340
I'll go and entertain my buddies.

528
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,460
Just leave him to us.

529
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,310
That's right.

530
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,670
Go easy on the liquor. Don't drink too much.

531
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,310
Just go.

532
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,980
Mind your blood pressure.

533
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,460
Have fun.

534
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,220
Please go ahead.

535
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,550
-Have fun.
-He's so rude.

536
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,950
He's a young man.

537
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,140
Of course he doesn't want to stay here with us.

538
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,670
You're right.

539
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,500
After all, we're old now.

540
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,710
We have to depend on the younger generation

541
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,710
if we truly wish to develop the village.

542
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,500
That's right.

543
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,620
Back then, we had to collect ores manually

544
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,340
and started the mineral business from scratch.

545
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,550
We built a factory for it.

546
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,980
Now, we're one of

547
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,710
the major taxpayers of the county.

548
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,740
We're a star village now.

549
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,430
A few days ago,

550
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,260
our superiors told us

551
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,590
that we shouldn't be satisfied

552
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,500
with our current state.

553
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,460
The nation is still transforming.

554
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,620
We have to broaden our minds

555
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,950
and continue developing the village.

556
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,710
Yeah. We should continue developing the village.

557
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,070
Just like the usual,

558
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,220
we'll follow the steps of the party.

559
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,670
That's right.

560
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,590
Come on, let's drink.

561
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,710
Have you seen his parents before?

562
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,430
But his parents do know about me.

563
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,070
If so, why didn't you

564
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,670
bring him with you when you came back?

565
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,500
Just forget it.

566
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,340
He was born in the city.

567
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,220
I'm afraid he would be terrified of the village

568
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,710
if he couldn't

569
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,710
get used to the life here.

570
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,460
Besides,

571
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,620
Xingfu, I didn't plan on returning

572
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,190
if it weren't for your wedding.

573
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,670
I think I'm already used to living in the city.

574
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,100
You heartless girl.

575
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,500
You're despising the village

576
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,620
only after living in the city for a few years.

577
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,500
That's not it.

578
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,030
Once you leave the village,

579
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,100
you won't be able to come back.

580
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,830
It isn't that serious.

581
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,910
What do you mean by that?

582
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,260
Let me give you an example.

583
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,980
Initially,

584
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,740
I was great friends with Cui and Hua.

585
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:08,790
However,

586
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,910
after I returned from the city, I felt like

587
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,910
we are people from different worlds.

588
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,620
But I saw you guys

589
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,590
chatting happily on your way here.

590
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,500
Doesn't that mean something?

591
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,620
Of course we would.

592
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,710
Of course we'd look like
we get along on the surface.

593
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,190
However, in reality,

594
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,260
there's a huge difference between us.

595
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,950
What kind of difference?

596
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,950
So, do you despise them
for not attending university?

597
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,140
I don't despise them.

598
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,710
There's just a gap between us.

599
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,670
However, it's neither good nor bad.

600
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,860
We have different mindsets and standards

601
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,790
due to the different environments

602
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,830
we live in.

603
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,860
Of course we'd be excited
when we see each other again.

604
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,590
However, I realize that we have nothing in common

605
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,550
if we sit down and chat.

606
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,590
I was wondering why you were keeping me company.

607
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,550
So, you just want to have some peace of mind.

608
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,670
Mainly, I still want to keep you company.

609
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,550
So, will you despise your own sister as well

610
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,190
if you live in the city for a few more years?

611
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,860
Xingfu, what are you saying?

612
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,980
I will never despise you

613
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,550
even if it means I have to despise myself.

614
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,590
Dad left us when we were still young.

615
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,030
I wouldn't have become the person I am today

616
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,220
without you and Mom.

617
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,220
Alright now. I was just kidding.

618
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,380
Xingfu, I only realized

619
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,590
that the outside world is totally different

620
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,070
after attending university.

621
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,910
I think I would have pursued my studies

622
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,380
for a few more years
if I didn't need to support myself.

623
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,590
I'll take a Master's Degree

624
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,790
and shift my starting point higher.

625
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,670
Now, there are too many things I wish to achieve.

626
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
I cannot imagine

627
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
what it would be like
if I had to get married early

628
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,140
and have a family,

629
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,340
just like Cui and Hua.

630
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,950
Cui and Hua are here

631
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,030
to keep us company.

632
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,030
You should entertain them for us.

633
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,910
They don't know anyone from the village.

634
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,070
You shouldn't neglect them.

635
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,740
Go now.

636
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,100
Okay.

637
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,430
I'm going.

638
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,340
See you.

639
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,790
Let me take a bite!

640
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,430
Hey!

641
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,950
Qinglai,

642
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,500
offer your aunt a toast.

643
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,670
He would never get himself

644
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,670
such a beautiful wife

645
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,260
if you weren't his matchmaker.

646
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,670
I have to drink this time.

647
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,790
You have to.

648
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,860
I've lost weight

649
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,070
just by running around

650
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,380
so that you could get married.

651
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,620
Fill the cup for Chuanjia.

652
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,310
Let's drink.

653
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,910
Yeah.

654
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,140
I drank with the elders just now.

655
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,860
They drank beer

656
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,790
while I drank Chinese Baijiu.

657
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,830
Just drink a little bit.

658
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,070
I'll punish myself with a toast.

659
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,790
I'll go ahead.

660
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,860
Cheers.

661
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,670
That girl over there,

662
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,340
she's Qinglai's sister-in-law, right?

663
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,190
Give me a second. My boyfriend is calling me.

664
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,220
I need to answer his call.

665
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,260
Yeah, that's her.

666
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,380
I heard

667
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,910
that she is an undergraduate.

668
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,430
So what?

669
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,860
However, she does look different
from the girls in the village.

670
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,070
She's quite pretty.

671
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,550
So what if she attended university?

672
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,790
She was still born in this village.

673
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,740
She's very arrogant.

674
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,620
Zhu cracked a joke with her just now.

675
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,070
She just raised her head

676
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,830
and ignored us.

677
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,430
Yeah.

678
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,070
Were you truly cracking a joke?

679
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,340
I'm sure you behaved like a thug.

680
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,140
No, Chuanjia.

681
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,430
I just went there and offered her a toast.

682
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,430
But she ignored me.

683
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,670
She didn't even return the toast?

684
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,620
Yeah.

685
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,670
Every girl in the Wan Village

686
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,460
should return the toast
when someone offers them one.

687
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,310
Pass me the drink.

688
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,830
I'll offer her a toast.

689
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,620
Let's go.

690
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,260
Let's go.

691
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,950
Here.

692
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
That's not it.

693
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,260
My sister is holding her wedding today.

694
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,100
I didn't hear your call because it was too noisy.

695
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,030
Tell me then.

696
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,460
It's fine.

697
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,740
I just found a quiet spot.

698
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,030
Have you eaten?

699
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,950
What are you doing?

700
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,710
So, you're the younger sister

701
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,380
of He Xingfu, the bride,

702
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,070
am I right?

703
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,590
Today

704
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,220
is your sister's wedding day.

705
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,100
How could you not return the toast

706
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,910
offered to you by my brother?

707
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:50,790
As an elder,

708
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,070
I'm offering you a toast right now.

709
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,790
Come on, drink up.

710
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,260
Stop that. Return my phone to me!

711
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,380
Give it back!

712
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:57,980
You don't want to drink?

713
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,310
Let me feed you then. Here.

714
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,670
You thugs!

715
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,100
Give it back!

716
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,500
What are you guys doing?

717
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,590
Little girl, don't be scared.

718
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,620
We're just celebrating
the joyous occasion with you.

719
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,100
Let's have some fun!

720
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,860
What are you guys doing?

721
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,710
Give it back!

722
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,260
Move out of the way!

723
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,790
Don't hurt her.

724
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,140
Stupid thugs!

725
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,550
You guys can continue.

726
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,500
-Alright.
-Please continue.

727
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,380
Hands off!

728
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,430
Hands off!

729
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,460
What are you doing, Qingzhi?

730
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,590
Chuanjia,

731
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,710
stop it. This is inappropriate.

732
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,340
Are you telling me what to do now?

733
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:38,860
What?

734
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
You think you're better
just because you're a postgraduate now?

735
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,260
You're telling me what to do now?

736
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,670
Chuanjia, that's not what I meant.

737
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,220
-What do you mean, then?
-What are you guys doing?

738
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,340
Listen, Wang Qingzhi.

739
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,790
You guys are lucky that I, Wan Chuanjia,

740
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,830
am here to attend the wedding.

741
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,260
You better know what's good for you. Scram!

742
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,550
Chuanjia!

743
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,910
Chuanjia, open the door!

744
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,670
Don't touch me!

745
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,910
Don't touch me!

746
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,260
Come on!

747
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,260
Let's drink.

748
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,590
Qinglai.

749
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,220
-Come.
-What's the matter?

750
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,310
You should go and take a look.

751
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:10,950
Chuanjia

752
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,910
is harassing your sister-in-law.

753
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,100
They're just celebrating the joyous occasion.

754
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,140
It's a joyous occasion after all!

755
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:18,590
Yeah.

756
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,100
Just let them have some fun.

757
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,340
It's no fun when they don't do anything.

758
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,310
Yeah.

759
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,070
Mom,

760
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,310
Xingfu and her sister are not from this village.

761
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,860
It won't be good if something happens to her.

762
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,460
There are four men here.

763
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,310
Don't tell me

764
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,220
we can't deal with a little girl like her?

765
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,190
Get out of the way!

766
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:31,980
I'll do it!

767
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,030
Let go of me!

768
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,620
What are you trying to do?

769
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,260
-Shout all you like.
-Let go of me!

770
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,140
Mom,

771
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,500
I think I should go and take a look.

772
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,620
Let's go!

773
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,190
Qinglai,

774
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,310
it'll be fine.

775
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,310
You should let them

776
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,190
have some fun.

777
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,550
We came from a small family.

778
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,500
It's embarrassing

779
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,380
when no one is celebrating it for us.

780
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,260
Let go of me!

781
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,100
Help!

782
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,620
No one can save you now!

783
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,670
Help!

784
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,710
Help!

785
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,500
Let go of me!

786
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,380
-Let go of me!
-It's fine.

787
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,260
Alright.

788
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,030
Shout all you like.

789
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,980
Let go of me!

790
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,430
Shout louder!

791
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,030
Help!

792
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,740
Help!

793
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,260
Chuanjia, open the door!

794
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,910
Everything is fine.

795
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,590
Open the door immediately!

796
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,980
We're "celebrating" the joyous occasion!

797
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,620
Chuanjia!

798
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,550
Chuanjia!

799
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,950
What are you guys doing?

800
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,430
Let go of me!

801
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,380
What are you guys doing?

802
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,620
Stop it right now!

803
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,790
-It's no fun when she's not shouting.
-Let go of me!

804
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,620
Let go of me!

805
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,430
Let go of me!

806
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,070
Chuanjia!

807
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,340
Scram!

808
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,590
Chuanjia!

809
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,190
Who did it?

810
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,140
Let's go!

811
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,980
We were just celebrating the occasion!

812
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,260
What are you guys doing?

813
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,310
I'm here for you.

814
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,310
Everything is fine now.

815
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,590
I'm here.

816
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,790
Everything is fine now.

817
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,310
Mr. Wan, something terrible has happened!

818
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,430
Something terrible has happened!

819
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,340
-Something terrible has happened?
-Hurry!

820
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,310
What's wrong, Gang?

821
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,220
Someone hit him on the head!

822
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,830
Can you please stop filming?

823
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,790
Make way!

824
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,710
Get out of the way!

825
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,380
-Chuanjia.
-What happened?

826
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,620
Chuanjia was celebrating the occasion
with the bride's sister.

827
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,830
But the bride hit him on the head!

828
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,140
What's going on?

829
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,140
The bride just hit Chuanjia on the head!

830
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,670
What?

831
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,030
Send him to the hospital right now!

832
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,430
Yeah!

833
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,030
Hurry up!

834
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,740
Send him to the hospital!

835
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,740
Hurry!

836
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,030
Mr. Wan,

837
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,550
they were celebrating the occasion
with the bride's sister.

838
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,910
She did so because she felt sorry for her sister.

839
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,950
Celebrating the occasion?

840
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,070
I thought your family

841
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,310
wanted the entire village to celebrate it?

842
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I rushed all the way here

843
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
from a meeting in the county

844
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,670
just so I could celebrate this occasion!

845
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,860
But now, my son's head is bleeding.

846
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,670
Your banquet

847
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,430
is inauspicious.

848
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,260
Mr. Wan!

849
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,590
We're sorry!

850
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,500
Please don't leave!

851
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,030
Don't leave!

852
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,590
Madam!

853
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,790
Don't leave!

854
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,070
Don't leave!

855
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,710
Those animals.

856
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,950
Don't be scared. I'm here.

857
00:27:59,340 --> 00:27:59,980
Don't leave!

858
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,340
I'm begging you guys!

859
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,500
Please don't leave!

860
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,710
-It's not over yet!
-Don't leave!

861
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,620
Please don't leave!

862
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,550
I'm begging you guys!

863
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,620
Xiuyu, let's stop them from leaving!

864
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,340
Please don't leave!

865
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,620
My phone!

866
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,430
Hello?

867
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,140
Daxun?

868
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,590
Daxun?

869
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:20,980
Hello?

870
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,590
Mister, please don't leave.

871
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,140
Please persuade them to stay.

872
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,550
My brothers,

873
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,310
can you guys please stay here?

874
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,310
How do you guys explain yourselves?

875
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,140
Please stay here, okay?

876
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,310
Please don't leave.

877
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,740
Let's drink.

878
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,310
I'm sorry.

879
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,380
We're so sorry.

880
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,460
How did a joyous occasion

881
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,670
end up like this?

882
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,500
Dad.

883
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,430
Mom.

884
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,380
Where's the bride?

885
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,260
Where's your wife?

886
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,830
Where's your wife?

887
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,550
Where's your wife?

888
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,340
Let's go and take a look.

889
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:15,140
Qinglai!

890
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,220
Get out of the way!

891
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,430
Xingyun.

892
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,190
Look.

893
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:30,710
Xingyun.

894
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,430
Xingyun.

895
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,830
Are you okay?

896
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,790
Are you okay?

897
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,310
Xingyun,

898
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,830
listen to me.

899
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,340
Chuanjia was here to celebrate
the occasion with us.

900
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,550
It's what we do here.

901
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,550
They would go even further

902
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,590
for some weddings.

903
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,380
We finally managed to invite him
after all this while.

904
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,620
He's here

905
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,950
to show us some respect.

906
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,030
How could they celebrate the occasion like this?

907
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,980
They tore her clothes apart!

908
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,910
They're thugs!

909
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,740
Xingfu.

910
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,030
Xingfu.

911
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,670
Let's leave her alone for now.

912
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,430
Let's talk outside.

913
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,670
Xingfu,

914
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,140
you should stay here for now.

915
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,910
I'll confront them about this.

916
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,550
I won't forgive them for this.

917
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,550
They harassed my sister.

918
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,740
I can't just let it go.

919
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,070
They have to give me an explanation.

920
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,460
Can you please stop?

921
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,100
What? I don't even have the right to speak now?

922
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,860
Listen,

923
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,740
my sister is a law student.

924
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,430
She's familiar with the law.

925
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,140
She can sue him.

926
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,590
Stop creating trouble for us!

927
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,460
Do you know whom you hit on the head just now?

928
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,950
It was Chuanjia!

929
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,380
He's the son of Mr. Wan!

930
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,100
You've caused huge trouble

931
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,500
for our Wang family!

932
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,140
So what if he's the son of the village secretary?

933
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,030
Does that mean

934
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,220
he can commit such lowly acts?

935
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,140
Xingfu,

936
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,710
Chuanjia was here to celebrate
the occasion with us.

937
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,950
As the saying goes, rules are meant to be broken
for the first three days of a wedding.

938
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,310
He's showing us respect
by celebrating the occasion with us.

939
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,980
Can you even call that celebrating?

940
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,100
He was pressing my sister against the floor!

941
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,220
He even tore her clothes!

942
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,430
He was acting like a thug!

943
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,910
You smashed his head, didn't you?

944
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,430
Both of you are even now.

945
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,340
Mom,

946
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,140
this isn't about being even.

947
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,670
Why did I smash his head?

948
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,950
It's because he harassed my sister.

949
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,620
I only smashed his head

950
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,670
because he harassed my sister!

951
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,860
You guys should be able

952
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
to tell right from wrong!

953
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,980
Yeah.

954
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,380
He did harass your sister.

955
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,550
But you smashed his head in return.

956
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,790
Doesn't that make you two even?

957
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,220
Mom, you can't just say that.

958
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,670
I think Xingfu did the right thing.

959
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,740
Chuanjia

960
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,030
went too far.

961
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,190
He wasn't celebrating the occasion.

962
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,140
He was sexually assaulting her.

963
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,190
Enough.

964
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,710
It isn't that serious.

965
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,550
Xingfu,

966
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,830
you said you want the Wan family
to give you an explanation.

967
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,030
What kind of explanation

968
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,220
do you want from them?

969
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,980
I want him to acknowledge his mistake

970
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,950
and apologize to my sister in person.

971
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,430
You smashed his head.

972
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,430
How will you explain that?

973
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,030
If he admits his mistake,

974
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,070
I'll apologize to him.

975
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,380
I'll accept my punishment.

976
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,950
But what if his brain was damaged

977
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,830
because of it?

978
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,710
What if he became an idiot

979
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,100
and couldn't even apologize to you?

980
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,910
What will you do then?

981
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,740
Tell me.

982
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
His head was covered

983
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,590
by blood.

984
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,310
Yeah.

985
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,310
Xiuyu.

986
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,140
Xiuyu,

987
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,460
head to

988
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,380
the village health center immediately.

989
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,590
Don't waste any time.

990
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,950
Call us if there's any news.

991
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,140
Hurry.

992
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,740
Hurry up.

993
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,740
What a terrible wedding.

994
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,950
His head was covered by blood?

995
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,260
Was it that serious?

996
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,860
Yeah. Didn't you see it yourself?

997
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,220
He couldn't even speak.

998
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,830
Look at you.

999
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,070
You've caused such huge trouble for us.

1000
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,740
I cannot afford to compensate him

1001
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,740
even if I were to sell away everything I have!

1002
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,740
Mom,

1003
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,310
I was the one who hurt him.

1004
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,710
I'll bear the consequences

1005
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,310
if anything happens.

1006
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,310
You'll bear the consequences?

1007
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,100
Can you even afford to bear it?

1008
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,550
Seriously? You want to bear the consequences?

1009
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,910
Such wishful thinking.

1010
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,030
Now, you're a part of the Wang family.

1011
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,340
You've gotten yourself in huge trouble here.

1012
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,100
No one in the family

1013
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,740

00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,580
You sounded like a fly.

1180
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,060
No one can hear you with that voice.

1181
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,660
Put your back into it.

1182
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,010
Don't tell me they haven't returned
from the hospital yet?

1183
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,820
It's all because of our daughter-in-law.

1184
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,140
I hear a sound.

1185
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,250
Mr. Wan...

1186
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,660
Mr. Cailiang?

1187
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,490
Mr. Cailiang.

1188
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:52,970
You guys must be here

1189
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,290
because of Chuanjia's incident.

1190
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,210
That's right.

1191
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:55,900
Mr. Cailiang,

1192
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,580
we'll make a move first.

1193
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,690
Alright. Please go ahead.

1194
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:01,730
Youde,

1195
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,580
your new daughter-in-law is amazing.

1196
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,490
Yeah, she's amazing.

1197
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,490
Mr. Cailiang,

1198
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,140
it's our daughter-in-law's fault.

1199
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,180
She was too insensible.

1200
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:09,690
Madam...

1201
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,860
It's our fault.

1202
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,250
We can talk inside.

1203
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,690
Let's go.

1204
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:21,900
Mr. Wan.

1205
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:22,770
Mr. Wan?

1206
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:23,930
Mr. Wan.

1207
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:24,580
Youde.

1208
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,420
Mr. Wan.

1209
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,140
You guys...

1210
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,900
We're here to apologize for our mistake!

1211
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,860
What are you guys doing?

1212
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,730
Get up now.

1213
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,380
Cailiang.

1214
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:31,770
Get up.

1215
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,900
Do you know what era we're in right now?

1216
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,420
We don't do this anymore.

1217
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,290
Come on, Madam.

1218
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,490
Just let me do it...

1219
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,210
What do you guys mean by this?

1220
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,820
Are you guys insulting me in another form?

1221
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,060
If people hear about this,

1222
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,690
they'll say that people need to kneel

1223
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,210
when they speak to me.

1224
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:44,860
That's not it.

1225
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,730
Who do you think I am?

1226
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,820
Do you think I'm the village bully?

1227
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,060
Or do you think I'm the ruler here?

1228
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,860
Just get up already.

1229
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,100
Hurry and get up.

1230
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,380
Mr. Wan, that's not what we mean.

1231
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,290
Mr. Wan,

1232
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,290
we...

1233
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,970
We know our fault now.

1234
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,450
I swear to Heaven

1235
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,900
that we didn't mean to insult you.

1236
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,930
That's right.

1237
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,730
Even so,

1238
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,730
you don't need to kneel!

1239
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,060
What do you mean by that?

1240
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,450
Just converse in a normal way.

1241
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,530
Talk about the issue at hand.

1242
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,420
-Yes, Mr. Wan.
-Yes, Mr. Wan.

1243
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,690
Speak. What's the matter?

1244
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
Just tell him!

1245
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,290
Mr. Wan,

1246
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,660
I...

1247
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,490
You see...

1248
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,210
You see,

1249
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,340
my daughter-in-law isn't from the village.

1250
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,060
She...

1251
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,900
She doesn't know the rules here.

1252
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,820
If so,

1253
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,620
the elders should teach her.

1254
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,210
Yes, Mr. Wan.

1255
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,380
Youde,

1256
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,250
weren't you the one
who came here time and time again,

1257
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,860
telling me that I must attend

1258
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,930
the wedding ceremony?

1259
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,970
Yes, Mr. Wan.

1260
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,140
You were afraid that no villagers
would attend it if I weren't attending it.

1261
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,530
If that happens, it'll be
an embarrassment to your family.

1262
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,530
Yes, Mr. Wan.

1263
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,730
You said I should attend it.

1264
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,180
Yes, Mr. Wan.

1265
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,180
Did I attend the wedding?

1266
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:48,730
You did.

1267
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,530
I attended it even though I was busy.

1268
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,970
Don't you guys think
I have shown you two enough respect?

1269
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:52,660
Yes, Mr. Wan.

1270
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,970
So, what do you mean by that?

1271
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,180
Your new daughter-in-law

1272
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,900
actually smashed my son's head
during her wedding.

1273
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,580
Is this how

1274
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,250
the Wang family educates children?

1275
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:01,900
Yes, Mr. Wan.

1276
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,140
I mean, no.

1277
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,290
I'm not trying to criticize you here.

1278
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,100
You've been an honest guy all your life.

1279
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,730
But now, you've got yourself
such a feisty daughter-in-law.

1280
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,340
You will surely

1281
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,620
get into more trouble in the future.

1282
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,060
Yes, Mr. Wan.

1283
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,730
Mr. Wan,

1284
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,730
we need your help

1285
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,530
to discipline her in the future.

1286
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,140
Do you think I'm that free?

1287
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,620
Do you think I can discipline her for you

1288
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,290
when I don't even have time to finish my work?

1289
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,620
Speaking of which,

1290
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,820
no matter where she comes from,

1291
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,010
now that she's married into

1292
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,690
the Wan Village,

1293
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,380
she's a part of the Wan Village now.

1294
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,340
That means she has to obey the rules here.

1295
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,290
That's right.

1296
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,290
You were lucky this time.

1297
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,770
It was Chuanjia who got hurt.

1298
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,450
What if it was some other villagers?

1299
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,860
What if he wasn't that educated?

1300
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,660
What if he smashed the head

1301
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,730
of your daughter-in-law in return?

1302
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,210
How can we build a peaceful society
if that happens?

1303
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,530
Yes, Mr. Wan.

1304
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,660
By then, as the village secretary,

1305
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,420
I will have no choice but to get involved.

1306
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,060
Yes, Mr. Wan.

1307
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,860
Mr. Wan, don't worry.

1308
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:58,730
Our daughter-in-law

1309
00:42:58,730 --> 00:42:59,380
doesn't have the guts to do so.

1310
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,420
She doesn't have the guts?

1311
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,900
You better be prepared.

1312
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,690
I think she has the guts to do anything.
