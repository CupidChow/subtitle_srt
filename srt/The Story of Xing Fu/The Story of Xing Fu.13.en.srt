00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,239
[People's Court]

4
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,079
Both parties

5
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,359
have negotiated thoroughly

6
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,640
and have reached an agreement.

7
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,599
The court

8
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,959
is nothing but supportive
of such an undertaking.

9
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,120
Today,

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,560
we will finalize the deal.

11
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,879
Well,

12
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,319
we have no problem for the most part.

13
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,120
However,

14
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,039
regarding the plot on Niaofei Creek,

15
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,520
can we get another offer?

16
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,639
Sorry.

17
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,840
All workable lands already have owners.

18
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,879
That plot is the only one left.

19
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,319
But that plot is barren.

20
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,879
It's just a rock formation

21
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,479
and it's so deep within the mountain,

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,479
at least ten li away from the village.

23
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,319
Oh, Wang Qinglai.

24
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,319
Sometimes, I wonder

25
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,599
if you're a wolf

26
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,800
in sheep's clothing.

27
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,800
You weren't even supposed to have land

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,919
nor did you mention you wanted one.

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,159
My father took pity on all of you

30
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,439
and so he gave this plot away ad hoc.

31
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,479
Be grateful already.

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,759
But this plot you gave

33
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,800
is barely cultivable.

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,479
And it was given to us

35
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,439
from the hands of a contractor.

36
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,280
We have to pay him.

37
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,840
It's...

38
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,639
It's so useless.

39
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,280
I can't plant anything on it.

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,000
What do I use this land for?

41
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,479
Do whatever you wish with it then.

42
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,639
Plant whatever that can grow.

43
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,599
It's none of my business.

44
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,439
Do you want it

45
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,360
or not? Just say it.

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,080
Yes.

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,439
Please mind your manner.

48
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,919
Both parties

49
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,680
agreed to the settlement below.

50
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,000
The defendant, Wanjia Group,

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,439
will pay the plaintiff, Wang Youde,

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,840
130,000 yuan for land damages

53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,319
and 60,000 yuan for violating the terms stipulated
in the vegetable distributorship agreement.

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,360
Out of Wanjia Group's compassion

55
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,759
toward

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,240
the injured villager,

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,120
they have offered to pay the two hospital bills,

58
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,240
amounting to 3,720 yuan,

59
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,639
for a total of 193,720 yuan.

60
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,439
In addition,

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,240
this settlement also includes

62
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,039
a 30-year contractor agreement on the 15-mu plots
on Niaofei Creek.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,680
Proceed to the final confirmation

64
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,159
before the court pronounces its legitimacy.

65
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,960
Chuanjia is out.

66
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,319
Chuanjia,

67
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,280
is it over now?

68
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,479
Come. Let's go sing karaoke

69
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,280
and relax a bit.

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Let's go.

71
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,240
Mr. Cailiang,

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,479
this matter has finally concluded.

73
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,080
You should come

74
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,879
with us today.

75
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,960
We'll sing karaoke, have some beer,

76
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,439
and relax.

77
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,560
Let me arrange everything for you, all right?

78
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:18,919
I agree.

79
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:19,719
Arrange what?

80
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,080
You should head back earlier.

81
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,039
If your dad knows that you visit a KTV,

82
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:23,960
he will be angry.

83
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,079
Let him be.

84
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,720
He always wants

85
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,000
everyone to be a workaholic

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
like him.

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,720
Didn't we earn money to spend it?

88
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,279
Let's go.

89
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,639
Sorry, I can't.

90
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,839
I still have some matters to handle
in the village committee.

91
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,199
Head home early today.

92
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,279
Safe trip, Mr. Cailiang.

93
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's sing karaoke!

94
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:37,759
Let's go.

95
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,120
Senior, do we head back right now?

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,439
Let's go.

97
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,560
Xingyun.

98
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,800
We're going to sing karaoke

99
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,360
and drink.

100
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,759
Join us.

101
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,480
I'm not done yet.

102
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,439
Let me finish my sentence.

103
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,240
We know each other very well now.

104
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,120
We're old friends.

105
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,639
Come.

106
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,040
-Come.
-Come.

107
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,639
Come.

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm not your old friend.

109
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,399
Move aside.

110
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Did you not hear her?

111
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,720
She wants you to move aside.

112
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,600
What are you doing?

113
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,199
Don't touch me.

114
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm warning you.

115
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,560
We're outside the court.

116
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,720
People are watching.

117
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,759
Your behavior today

118
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,120
might be used against you

119
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,959
when we file a lawsuit in the future.

120
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,959
You hear that? He is a lawyer.

121
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,720
You have to behave.

122
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,600
No roughhousing.

123
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,519
I won't touch him, all right?

124
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,759
What are you doing?

125
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,120
Let me go!

126
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,959
It's just boys being boys.

127
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,040
I was too drunk the other day

128
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,160
and I offended you.

129
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,000
Today, we'll sing karaoke,

130
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,399
dance, and drink a bit.

131
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,480
I don't want to drink,

132
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,199
sing,

133
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,319
or dance with you.

134
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,839
-What do you want to do with me then?
-Wan Chuanjia, what are you doing?

135
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,319
Xingfu.

136
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,759
Are you trying to harass a girl outside the court?

137
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,959
Stay away from my sister.

138
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,480
Don't you dare touch my sister!

139
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,839
I do not take your accusation well.

140
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,480
You glare at me

141
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,439
but did you witness what happened?

142
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,279
Did I harass her?

143
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:54,920
This is defamation.

144
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,079
You're just twisting everything.

145
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,879
Stop.

146
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,519
I was just saying

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,639
that the day you two got married,

148
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,839
my behavior might have offended her.

149
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,560
Today, I want to treat her to some karaoke or beer

150
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
and maybe we can move on.

151
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,680
Are you free? Join us.

152
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,399
Go away.

153
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,399
No one wants to drink with you.

154
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,680
You have no shame.

155
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,600
Just say you're busy then.

156
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,319
We'll hang out another day.

157
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,240
Dress better. Otherwise, no invitation for you.

158
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,120
Till next time!

159
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,120
Let's go.

160
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:18,720
Scoot.

161
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,279
What a jerk.

162
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:24,759
Xingyun.

163
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,439
I'm fine, Xingfu.

164
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,600
Tell Mom

165
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,480
that I won't head back.

166
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,319
We're returning to the city straight away.

167
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,160
Let's go, Senior.

168
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,680
Mr. Guan.

169
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,439
Please take good care of my sister.

170
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,680
Okay. See you then.

171
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,079
Drive safe!

172
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:14,800
Senior,

173
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,519
can you pull over?

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,120
What's the matter?

175
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,800
I don't want to mention it.

176
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,000
Did the general manager of Wanjia Group

177
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,480
do something to you?

178
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,079
The day Xingfu got married,

179
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,199
I was her bridesmaid.

180
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,279
Wan Chuanjia

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,720
and his goons came.

182
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,600
They tore my dress

183
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,639
and started touching me.

184
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,480
And then?

185
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,879
And then...

186
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,879
I just want to kill them now

187
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,080
because

188
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,960
they have ruined my life.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,799
Xingyun.

190
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,679
They committed a crime.

191
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,159
You have no idea, Senior.

192
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
In a rural village,

193
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,399
this is called wedding hazing.

194
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,320
At most,

195
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,200
people thought

196
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,080
that they overdid it.

197
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,960
This is not a question
of whether this is acceptable in a rural village.

198
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,360
You're educated and you practice law.

199
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,360
Now, use it

200
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,799
to protect yourself

201
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,519
and give them the punishment they deserve.

202
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,039
I can file a lawsuit but that won't do a thing.

203
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,720
I can do that

204
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,840
and they won't be rightfully punished.

205
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,360
Can you imagine?

206
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,200
Even my mother

207
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,080
said it was just a joke gone awry.

208
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,799
She said if the villagers did not joke around

209
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
during a wedding ceremony,
it wouldn't be festive enough.

210
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,120
It was all for the festivity.

211
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,320
What can I do against it?

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,639
But Xingyun,

213
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,240
others might think that way

214
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,759
but you can't.

215
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,120
You studied law.

216
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,240
You know very well

217
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,720
that it wasn't a joke.

218
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,320
They sexually assaulted a woman.

219
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
They rallied a crowd

220
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,480
and committed a crime in public.

221
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,879
That's at least a five-year prison sentence,

222
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,879
with no suspended sentence available.

223
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,320
But if I tell everyone this

224
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,120
and bring them to court,

225
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,679
the one who gets hurt the most is me.

226
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,960
If everyone knows,

227
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,679
how can I face them?

228
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,879
How can I lift my head up?

229
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,360
Because of this,

230
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,559
my ex left me.

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,480
But this is not your fault at all.

232
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,039
What do you mean you can't lift your head up?

233
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,799
Xingyun,

234
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,320
you are a lawyer in the making.

235
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,080
If you can't even defend

236
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,240
your own right,

237
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,679
how can you defend your clients'?

238
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,200
Running away will not solve anything.

239
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,399
And if you do not deal with it now,

240
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,000
whenever you visit your hometown,
you'll run into him again.

241
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,600
What happened today

242
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,720
might repeat itself.

243
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,000
What are you doing to do then?

244
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,399
Don't visit your hometown forever?

245
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,799
Hide away from him forever?

246
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,200
But can you ever

247
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,679
hide from your inner demon?

248
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,399
Xingyun,

249
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,200
be like your sister.

250

Do not be afraid.

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,080
Senior,

252
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,320
you know everything now.

253
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,279
Will you look down on me?

254
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,000
Of course not.

255
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,320
Why would I do that?

256
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,799
Xingyun.

257
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,440
You have to be braver.

258
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,279
Bring him to court.

259
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,519
I'll stay by your side.

What?

261
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,639
We would like to report a case.

262
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,759
Wan Chuanjia sexually assaulted a woman.

263

Xingyun.

264
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,159
Mr. Guan, have a sit.

265
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,399
Let's talk.

266
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,279
The previous case just concluded

267
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,840
and now, a new one presents itself.

268
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,360
I can't catch a break at all.

Xingyun.

271
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,879
Mr. Guan is from the city. He can be excused.

272
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,639
But you are from the village.

273
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,399
You know it, don't you?

274
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,159
Wedding hazing is like a local custom here.

275
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,279
Your brother-in-law's family is a small one.

276
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,440
If no one went to conduct a wedding hazing,

277
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,360
her wedding would never be that festive.

278
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,320
They wanted your brother-in-law's family

279
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,159
to feel good about themselves

280
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
so they did that to drive up the atmosphere.

281
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,320
A bunch of men tore a woman's dress apart

282
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,840
and touched her.

283
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,240
That's hyping up the atmosphere

284
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,279
instead of a crime?

285
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,679
They might have overdone it.

286
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,759
Definitely.

287
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,080
But this village...

288
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,840
It is not above law, is it?

289

Right.

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,039

Look.

295

In a village, there are many outdated practices.

296

Before they become completely obsolete,

297
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,679
if we have to treat them as criminal offenses,

298
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,600
then too many people will have to be arrested.

I totally agree with you.

I don't like

302

wedding hazing at all.

303
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,600
But I can't do anything about it.

The more reasons to enforce the law!

00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,799
Your tummy will become bigger

343
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,039
so you have to be extra careful.

344
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,200
Look.

345
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,840
We got the compensation.

346
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,639
Make sure she's well-fed

347
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,399
so that she is in good health.

348
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:20,480
All right?

349
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,519
I'll brew some fish soup then,

350
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,480
okay?

351
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,879
Dad, Mom.

352
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,960
Although we got the compensation

353
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,600
and the issue has concluded,

354
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,279
I still feel like

355
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,200
justice hasn't prevailed.

356
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,200
If it were me,

357
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,720
I'd never settle out of court with them.

358
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,200
I would have brought them to court.

359
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,320
I want to see

360
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,759
justice prevail.

361
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,240
If I win the lawsuit, then I'll be happy.

362
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,720
Don't bring unnecessary troubles to yourself.

363
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,240
Getting financially compensated

364
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,799
is the best solution there is.

365
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,679
You want them to apologize to you?

366
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,080
What good will that do?

367
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,919
I would rather
have the money to buy a bag of rice.

368
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,039
Don't you think so?

369
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,279
Remember this, okay?

370
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,879
In this village,

371
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,720
don't always be this argumentative.

372
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,919
You'll suffer

373
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,159
in the long run.

374
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,879
How sad is that?

375
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,519
Shouldn't we differentiate right from wrong?

376
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
I agree the issue is settled.

377
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,320
But you weren't there to see how triumphant

378
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,240
Wan Chuanjia was

379
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,720
outside the court.

380
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,120
It's almost as if he was the right one.

381
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,039
Otherwise, why would he touch Xingyun again?

382
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,270
What?

383
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,540
What did Chuanjia do?

384
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,180
Another fight?

385
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,470
Another brawl?

386
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,470
Mom.

387
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,390
After we signed the agreement,

388
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,820
Chuanjia insisted

389
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,820
on inviting Xingyun to drink and sing karaoke.

390
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,110
Xingfu chased them away.

391
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,180
I think

392
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,900
he just wanted to apologize to her.

393
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,510
Mom,

394
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,150
is that how one is supposed to apologize?

395
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,390
He was harassing my sister.

396
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,230
Look at his villainous face.

397
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,630
This case barely tickled him.

398
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,580
Otherwise, how could he still dare

399
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,660
behave like that right outside the court?

400
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,940
Enough.

401
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,110
What they do is not our concern.

402
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,060
We just have to mind our own business.

403
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,140
Sit.

404
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,670
Qinglai.

405
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:14,950
Sit.

406
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:15,780
Sit.

407
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,950
Since we will be free,

408
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,780
let's dust off

409
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,230
the agricultural tools.

410
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:21,910
Eat.

411
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,300
You have arrived, my friend.

412
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:50,620
What is going on?

413
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,750
Something serious?

414
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,190
Sit down, please.

415
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,340
We...

416
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,910
Please give us a moment.

417
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,380
See you, Mr. Wan.

418
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,860
What happened?

419
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,580
We want to speak to Chuanjia.

420
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,540
He went to the county

421
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,710
for some errands.

422
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,190
Did he get himself into trouble again?

423
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,580
He Xingyun came to the police station
to report a case.

424
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,990
She said Chuanjia

425
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,430
sexually assaulted her.

426
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,710
And we came here

427
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,510
to investigate further.

428
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,270
The wedding hazing again?

429
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,190
It's an old story already.

430
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,030
What's the problem now?

431
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,470
It will never end, will it?

432
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,910
It was supposed to be over.

433
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,100
But Chuanjia stopped

434
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,580
Xingyun in front of the court.

435
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,190
He catcalled her

436
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,340
and his gang

437
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,510
tried to create a scene.

438
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,780
She was upset

439
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,430
so she came back to file a report.

440
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,950
So she filed a report
because they tried to create a scene?

441
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,430
It's not about that.

442
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,580
It's about the wedding hazing.

443
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,910
Seriously?

444
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,430
Regarding that,

445
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,100
I have already spoken to the village committee.

446
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,190
We even laid out rules

447
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,230
that no wedding hazing is to be had from now on.

448
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,100
What else do you want?

449
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,670
That's where you are wrong, you see.

450
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,580
While this is a common occurrence here,

451
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,430
if the victim doesn't report it to the police,

452
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,300
you can chalk it up to local customs.

453
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,270
But if the victim comes forth...

454
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,380
Several young men

455
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,620
undressed a woman

456
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,580
and touched her.

457
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,540
In legal terms,

458
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,580
it's called sexual assault.

459
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,540
Furthermore, they rallied the crowd

460
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,510
and did it in public.

461
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,100
If they were found guilty,

462
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,300
they would be sentenced to jail

463
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,990
with no suspended sentence available.

464
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,750
Come on.

465
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,060
Wedding hazing has existed

466
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,750
for several generations,

467
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,540
several decades.

468
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,470
Right?

469
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,670
Some even had it worse.

470
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,430
And that's why it's an outdated practice.

471
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,540
If we treat it seriously,

472
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,270
those who are part of the hazing

473
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
all committed a crime.

474
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,860
Criminal Law states

475
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,470
that sexual assault or aggression

476
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,430
toward women

477
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,140
via violence, extortion,

478
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,380
or other means,

479
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,860
will be given five-year imprisonment
or criminal detention maximum.

480
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,430
And this is not the end.

481
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,910
Rallying the crowd

482
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,270
or committing this crime

483
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,510
in front of the public

484
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,780
will be given a five-year sentence at least.

485
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,620
Can you see it now?

486
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,750
Chuanjia

487
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,190
ticked all the boxes.

488
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,470
Shantang,

489
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,140
you need

490
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,620
to treat this matter seriously.

491
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,860
Your enemy

492
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,030
is not the Wang family,

493
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,270
but two lawyers.

494
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,780
I took it seriously.

495
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,710
As I said, I laid out rules.

496
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,670
Also,

497
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,230
wedding hazing

498
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,710
has been observed for several centuries.

499
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,750
All right?

500
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,780
And now, when Chuanjia did it, it's a crime.

501
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,270
I don't buy it.

502
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,230
Whether you like it or not,

503
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,380
as the saying goes,
no village shares the same customs,

504
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,060
this might be accepted here

505
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,510
but in another province,

506
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,950
Chuanjia could very well

507
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,670
be in jail now.

508
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,620
Your son...

509
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,780
Go

510
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,270
and arrest him now.

511
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,620
Teach him a good lesson.

512
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,030
That would spare me the headache too.

513
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,510
I know you said that out of frustration.

514
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,620
But if my investigation

515
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,230
leads to any solid evidence

516
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,510
that suggests criminality,

517
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,710
I'll have no choice but to arrest him.

518
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,140
All right.

519
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,820
Since Chuanjia is not here,

520
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,620
we'll head back first.

521
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,620
Let's leave.

522
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,950
You look quite busy here as well.

523
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,540
Don't get upset.

524
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,780
When Chuanjia returns,

525
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,860
send him to me at the police station.

526
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,430
Come in.

527
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,950
Mr. Han, you asked for me?

528
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,950
You're back.

529
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,710
Looks like I have to thank you.

530
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:34,950
So tell me,

531
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,060
how much profit did you bring

532
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,750
to the law firm?

533
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,750
I only found this out after you left,

534
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,340
the one you fought against was Wanjia Group.

535
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,030
Do you know how much they make

536
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,620
in a year?

537
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,270
No idea.

538
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,510
Then search online!

539
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,340
You have to have some basic knowledge about them.

540
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,380
Wanjia Group's

541
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,380
output value is in the billions.

542
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,990
Their net profit is at least 100 million.

543
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,510
As a lawyer, you have to pick your side.

544
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:01,990
You

545
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,910
should pick your client.

546
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,780
And you

547
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,380
represented a villager

548
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,710
and fought against a huge company like this.

549
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,340
The battle will never be won.

550
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,030
Wanjia Group

551
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,270
spends millions on its legal department
every year.

552
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,780
Several hundred thousand at the very least.

553
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,540
You should work

554
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,190
for clients like them.

555
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,580
Mr. Han,

556
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,620
a lawyer shouldn't favor the rich.

557
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,580
We shouldn't, you say?

558
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,030
There are many lawyers here.

559
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,230
Who gives you your paycheck?

560
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,470
Poor clients like your sister?

561
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,060
Just so you know,

562
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,470
if you ever do something foolish like this,

563
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,030
this firm will not keep you.

564
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,140
This is the pile of cases from the last two days,

565
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,470
summarize them.

566
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,670
You won't make anything like that.

567
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,340
Let me crochet for my grandchild.

568
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,380
Mr. and Mrs. Wang!

569
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,100
Xingfu.

570
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,750
Mr. Wan, you're here.

571
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,990
-What brought you here?
-Mr. Wan.

572
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,300
Welcome, Mr. Wan.

573
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,950
Qinglai.

574
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,780
I just want to know something.

575
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,430
I heard that Chuanjia
bullied Xingfu's sister again.

576
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:18,910
Nothing

577
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,950
too serious, I hope.

578
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,190
Of course, not.

579
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,100
No, not really.

580
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,230
Why don't you ask your son what he did?

581
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,990
Oh, tell me about it.

582
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,380
I haven't even found my stupid son.

583
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,580
If he did something bad again,

584
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,140
I'll teach him a lesson.

585
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,990
Take a seat first, Mr. Wan.

586
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,710
-Exactly.
-Yes.

587
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:33,950
Qinglai.

588
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,100
-Serve some tea.
-Okay.

589
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,860
Have a seat, Mr. Wan.

590
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,710
Brew some nice tea, okay?

591
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,140
Okay.

592
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,750
Sit.

593
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,230
Okay.

594
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,510
Mr. Wan, you came all the way here

595
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,100
just for this?

596
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,060
No, not at all.

597
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,510
There are other matters too.

598
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,230
It took a long time to solve

599
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,540
the land acquisition issue.

600
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,100
And then,

601
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,540
I was too occupied with the construction
of the factory.

602
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,820
I did not have any free time.

603
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,620
Qinglai was hospitalized

604
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,860
and yet, I did not pay him a visit.
It's not right.

605
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,270
Village kids are tough, all right?

606
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,060
He's as healthy as a horse now.

607
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,750
That's good then.

608
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,100
-Mr. Wan, have some tea.
-Thank you.

609
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,270
Qinglai is fine now

610
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,710
but he was seriously injured.

611
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,140
The doctors in the village
dared not to intervene

612
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,430
so we had to go to the hospital

613
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,300
in the county.

614
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,270
You misjudged the force of your kick.

615
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,100
It's an old story now.

616
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,140
Why bring it up?

617
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,670
The elder was teaching the young ones a lesson.

618
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,710
The young ones weren't behaving

619
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
so the elder had to be strict.

620
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,140
Sometimes, you just got carried away.

621
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,910
Right?

622
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,190
But Qinglai did nothing wrong.

623
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,470
I came

624
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,030
to apologize.

625
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,430
It was just

626
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,230
a series of unfortunate events.

627
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,820
I just kicked Guancai out

628
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,670
and then

629
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,860
Qinglai appeared.

630
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,140
I was fuming.

631
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,140
And I thought

632
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,750
Qinglai was an opportunist

633
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,950
like Guancai,

634
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,540
who wished to take advantage of us.

635
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,510
I got carried away.

636
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,580
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

637
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:01,860
Qinglai,

638
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,470
do not hold any grudges.

639
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,620
Please accept my apology.

640
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,950
No need, Mr. Wan.

641
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,910
I'm all healed now.

642
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,820
I'm good.

643
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,950
That's good to know.

644
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,670
Mr. Wan,

645
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,620
Xingfu is very straightforward.

646
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,430
She's not one to keep her thoughts to herself.

647
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,230
However, she's a tremendous helper

648
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,540
and she treats us very well.

649
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,710
She's definitely someone to keep.

650
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,710
Of course.

651
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,620
Xingfu is a rare gem in the village.

652
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,100
You have brought in new changes

653
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,860
to our village.

654
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,380
And you have improved our societal

655
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,340
and legal awareness.

656
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,190
If we ever have to pick

657
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,100
an exemplary family,

658
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,340
yours will definitely be in it.

659
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,140
Mr. Wan,

660
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,190
no need to compliment me.

661
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,710
I am not after anything.

662
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,340
I just want us to sort it out.

663
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,750
That will eliminate the hard feelings.

664
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,380
Of course.

665
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,950
Right or wrong, it needs to be sorted out.

666
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,710
You sure have a high standard.

667
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,710
She says that

668
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,430
but not everything is black and white.

669
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:56,950
Am I right?

670
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,300
I just came

671
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,030
to pay all of you a visit.

672
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,470
And I wonder

673
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,060
what your future plans are

674
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,340
since you no longer need to work on the plot.

675
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,060
Based on the village rules,

676
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,380
Qinglai and Xingfu

677
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,300
can apply

678
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,140
to work

679
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,380
in the factory.

680
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,060
I can give them the jobs whenever.

681
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,380
And you two

682
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,380
are also old enough

683
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,710
to claim your pension

684
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,510
according to the village welfare plan.

685
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,470
Right?

686
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,100
Xingfu is expecting.

687
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:27,990
Mr. and Mrs. Wang,

688
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,060
you two should retire.

689
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,780
Rest up

690
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,190
and maybe raise your grandchild.

691
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,470
Enjoy your retirement life.

692
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,060
All right?

693
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,510
Sure!

694
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,750
If you have any problems, just come to me.

695
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,910
If they can be solved,

696
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,910
the village committee will help.

697
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,140
All is good.

698
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,190

699
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,990
how generous Mr. Wan is!

700
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,580
We have stayed in the same village

701
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,540
for many years.

702
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,230
Everyone knows each other.

703
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,190
Right?

704
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,030
If something goes wrong,

705
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,860
we can always talk things out.

706
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,580
No need to tell an outsider.

707
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
Why waste your money and time on a lawyer?

708
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,820
We can just talk things out, can't we?

709
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,030
We never wanted to take it to court.

710
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,060
But you said...

711
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,620
Just forget

712
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,140
about it already.

713
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:05,990
It's past now.

714
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,060
Water under the bridge.

715
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,750
Yes.

716
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,510
Let's forget it.

717
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,270
Yes,

718
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,820
it's all in the past now.

719
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,270
Once it's settled, we don't mention it again.

720
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,140
And I

721
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,620
have another favor to ask

722
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,670
of Xingfu.

723
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,540
How can I help?

724
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,030
Well,

725
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,430
because of the wedding hazing, your sister

726
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,190
wants to report Chuanjia.

727
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,270
Again?

728
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,140
You weren't aware?

729
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,670
I didn't know about that.

730
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,780
Oh, my. Why didn't your sister

731
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,780
tell you guys

732
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,510
before making a major decision?

733
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,750
Xingfu.

734
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,910
That incident

735
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,780
has become an old story.

736
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,380
Right?

737
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,140
I also laid out rules

738
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,540
to ban all wedding hazing.

739
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,540
Can you

740
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,510
talk to your sister

741
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,910
and see what she thinks of it?

742
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,430
We can just discuss it among ourselves.

743
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,470
I'll have Chuanjia

744
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,140
apologize to your sister

745
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,950
in person later.

746
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,950
Mr. Wan.

747
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,230
I truly have no idea about this.

748
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,270
I'll call my sister

749
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,750
and ask her what happened.

750
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,140
I'll get back to you once I have the full picture.

751
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:00,820
Is that okay?

752
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,030
Call her now then.

753
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,780
I'll wait.

754
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,470
Sure.

755
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,340
Sit inside, Mr. Wan.

756
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,990
-Go inside.
-Okay.

757
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,140
Sit down, please.

758
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,030
Yes, Xingfu?

759
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,540
Did Chuanjia give you a hard time again?

760
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,430
It's Mr. Wan.

761
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,620
He came

762
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,580
and told us that you wanted to report Chuanjia.

763
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,230
He wanted me to talk to you.

764
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,620
So they can actually be afraid.

765
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,140
Have you thought it through?

766
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,300
You really want to report it?

767
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,380
If he hadn't messed with me when I was back,

768
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,750
it wouldn't be like this.

769
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,060
What if Mr. Wan

770
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,780
promised to ask Chuanjia to apologize to you?

771
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,710
It's too late.

772
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,100
He should have done it earlier.

773
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,950
Thank you.

774
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,910
Have some water, Mr. Wan.

777

what did your sister say?

Xingyun

779

780
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,100
on bringing this to court.

781
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,190
She must have made up her mind.

782
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,620
Xingfu,

783
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,620
you should persuade your sister.

784
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,910
It's an old story.

785
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,190
Why bring it up again?

786
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:08,910
I admit

787
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,950
that wedding hazing is an outdated practice.

788
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,540
No one treated this matter seriously in the past.

789
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,510
Ask around the villages

790
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,540
nearby.

791
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,950
Our village is the first

792
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,670
to outlaw this practice.

793
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,100
Is this

794
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,750
not good enough?

795
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,780
Well,

796
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,780
my sister is very angry.

797
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,430
She insisted on bringing him to court.

798
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,710
I cannot persuade her otherwise.

799
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,030
Mr. Guan said

800
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,060
that if we ever had disagreements,

801
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,340
we could settle them legally.

802
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,780
Xingyun has her justifications

803
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,190
and so do you.

804
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,060
Why don't we settle it

805
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,190
in court?

806
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,910
I'm sure the judge will consider
both our situations

807
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,270
and give us a satisfactory answer.

808
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,300
That will be fair.

809
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,860
What do you think?

810
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,060
All right. We'll do that then.

It's getting late now. I have to go.

812

Stay a little longer, Mr. Wan.

813

No?

Take care, Mr. Wan.

00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,580
that my heart is beating abnormally.

853
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,220
Let me rest up before we go inside.

854
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,550
Okay?

855
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:18,910
Come, have a seat.

856
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,700
Sit.

857
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,030
You know,

858
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,300
our child is old enough. Doing it on the bed

859
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,580
is quite inconvenient.

860
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,470
Maybe we can...

861
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,470
Your father is here.

862
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,470
-Your father is here!
-I don't care.

863
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:35,950
Dad,

864
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,180
when did you arrive?

865
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,700
This is so awkward.

866
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,550
Who did you go out drinking with?

867
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,030
You know,

868
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,470
my bros.

869
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,580
After we worked,

870
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,470
we sang karaoke

871
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,140
and drank

872
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,140
to relax.

873
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,180
You had a great time?

874
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,350
You have no idea.

875
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,220
Dad, you know what?

876
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,300
I'll bring you there one day.

877
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,220
I'll arrange everything for you.

878
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,390
You have the lights,

879
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,470
the speakers,

880
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,740
and all sorts of alcohol.

881
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,260
You can dance,

882
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,180
jump, or sing.

883
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,030
I'm serious, Dad.

884
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,780
You can't live

885
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,830
to work.

886
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,430
You have to live for yourself.

887
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,510
Was it fun?

888
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,950
Very fun.

889
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:14,910
Fun?

890
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,550
Very fun, you said?

891
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,910
Very fun?

892
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,260
Go have fun then.

893
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,300
Stop!

894
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:20,580
Dad!

895
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
I'm 30 years old now

896
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,990
and you're still

897
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:23,830
hitting me.

898
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,660
You'll still amount to nothing

899
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,740
even if you live until the age of 80.

900
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,740
Calm down, Dad!

901
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,950
-Don't stoop to his level!
-Of course, I'll hit you.

902
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,180
Live for yourself, you say?

903
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,780
Do you even know what it means?

904
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,140
When will you grow up

905
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,180
and stop giving me trouble?

906
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,220
What did I do?

907
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
What troubles did I give you now?

908
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,430
You have no idea how screwed you are.

909
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,700
She is charging you!

910
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,510
Who?

911
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,140
I went to sing karaoke.

912
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,870
What crime did I commit?

913
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,550
You don't know who you crossed?

914
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,180
Listen,

915
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:45,990
she is reporting you

916
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,780
for sexual assault.

917
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,180
Sexual assault, you hear me?

918
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,780
Officer Li told me

919
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,580
that in your case,

920
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,620
if you were found guilty,

921
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,260
three to five years in jail

922
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,660
would be guaranteed.

923
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,300
What assault?

924
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,100
What sexual assault?

925
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,510
Who

926
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,830
did I assault?

927
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,550
You truly have no idea?

928
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,910
He Xingyun

929
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,260
is suing you.

930
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,180
This was supposed

931
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,470
to be over.

932
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,780
She decided to take it silently.

933
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,260
But you, you had to rub it on her face.

934
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,100
Are you crazy?

935
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,220
Everyone has their dignity.

936
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,260
A rabbit will bite back if it's provoked.

937
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,220
Tell me, aren't you mocking her?

938
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,300
But... But...

939
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,660
You told me

940
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,740
to apologize to her.

941
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,660
I ran into her outside the court

942
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,660
so I invited her to sing karaoke
and drink with me.

943
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,430
I thought I'd apologize

944
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,620
and we could just move on.

945
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,030
Why is she suing me for this small matter?

946
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,830
Small matter?

947
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,220
Put yourself in her shoes.

948
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,350
If this happened to your sister,

949
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,740
would you do the same?

950
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,550
I would kill the perpetrator!

951
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,220
See?

952
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,180
That's what they are doing.

953
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:42,620
When did I ever

954
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,180
grovel to someone?

955
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,700
But for you, I dragged my apologetic face

956
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,260
to coddle someone.

957
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,700
Thank you so much!

958
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,430
You said you were independent, didn't you?

959
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,180
I won't intervene then.

960
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,620
Fix

961
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,550
your own mess.

962
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,740
When he sobers up tomorrow morning,

963
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,620
tell him

964
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,990
to go to Officer Li

965
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,030
in the police station.

966
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:06,950
He will be questioned.

967
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,830
Please calm down.

968
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,140
Unbelievable.

969
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,830
Take your high blood pressure pill.

970
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,070
Why did you cross that girl again?

971
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,990
Was last time not enough for you?

972
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,470
What's wrong with you?

973
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,740
If my father hits me, I'll take it.

974
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,510
And now, you hit me too?

975
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,740
How dare you hit me back!

976
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,660
This is not over!

977
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,390
Explain now!

978
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,660
You two, out of my sight!

He Xingyun filed a report

983

that on October 1st, 2009,

984
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,580
the day her sister, He Xingfu, got married,

985
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,180
you rallied the crowd
and sexually assaulted her.

What do you have to say about that?

987
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,740
She's lying and she's trying to tarnish my name.

988
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,510
She claimed

989
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,220
that you and several young men

990
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,700
pinned her on the bed,

991
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,700
tore her dress,

Who else was there?

As I said, I don't remember.

to attend his son's wedding ceremony.

what happened that day.

1023
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:17,510
Okay.

1024
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,870
You know what?

1025
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,070
I'll recall it when I'm back home

1026
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,260
and if I have something, I'll call you.

1027
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,030
Wait.

1028
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,180
You can head back today

1029
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,870
but

1030
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,830
if you ever recall anything, you tell us.

1031
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,510
All right?

1032
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,700
We will continue investigating.

1033
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,180
And during this period,

1034
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,870
you will make yourself available at all times

1035
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,070
and you cannot leave the village.

1036
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,740
Is that necessary?

1037
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,030
Mr. Li, I have to handle many things
for my project.

1038
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,030
If I have to go on a business trip...

1039
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,470
You have to be cooperative.

1040
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:49,870
Okay?

1041
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,070
Yes, cooperative.

1042
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,700
I won't leave. Is it good enough?

1043
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,870
Can I leave now?

1044
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,030
Here. Sign in.

1045
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:03,910
Here.

1046
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,430
Let me read what you wrote.

1047
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:14,650
[Signature: Wan Chuanjia]

1048
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,430
Your fingerprint.

1049
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:20,550
Tissue paper?

1050
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,430
We don't have it.

1051
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,220
Come in.

1052
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:37,510
Mr. Han.

1053
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,220
The case summary you asked for.

1054
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,950
Already done?

1055
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,350
That was quick.

1056
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,510
You sure are efficient.

1057
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,620
Coincidentally,

1058
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,740
these

1059
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,910
just arrived.

1060
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,580
Summarize them too.

1061
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,030
Mr. Han.

1062
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,580
I'm handling a lot of work now.

1063
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,140
Can you

1064
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,220
give me a raise?

1065
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,260
Never have I heard a trainee solicitor

1066
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,910
asking for a pay rise.

1067
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,220
Well, Mr. Han,

1068
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,350
my base salary

1069
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,140
is 800 yuan.

1070
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,870
After paying my rent,

1071
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,620
the rest is barely enough.

1072
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,990
Other lawyers get commissions from their cases.

1073
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,180
I have been your assistant for a long time

1074
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,220
and have done many things.

1075
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,030
But you never give me

1076
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,580
any commission.

1077
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,580
By right,

1078
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,740
a trainee solicitor has no base salary.

1079
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:53,390
800 yuan is already an exception made for you.

1080
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,910
Also,

1081
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,300
didn't you follow

1082
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,510
Guan Tao

1083
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,220
to earn some extra cash?

1084
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,030
I...

1085
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,140
I'm your legal mentor

1086
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,180
and without my permission,

1087
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,300
you left to handle a case with another lawyer.

1088
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,990
And when you returned, you asked me for a pay rise.

1089
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,550
Is that appropriate?

1090
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,550
But Mr. Han, you have to know

1091
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,950
that this is a special case.

1092
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,350
It involved my sister.

1093
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,870
It's not right if I don't help out.

1094
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,580
No need to explain.

1095
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,550
Are you

1096
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,950
in love with Guan Tao?

1097
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,470
Although he had a divorce,

1098
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,620
you two do look good together.

1099
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,470
If he

1100
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,220
takes you seriously,

1101
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,740
then I have nothing to comment on.

1102
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,580
But if it's just a fling,

1103
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,100
why don't you have it with me?

1104
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,430
Mr. Han, please refrain

1105
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,740
from making this kind of joke.

1106
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,620
A joke?

1107
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,910
A pay rise?
