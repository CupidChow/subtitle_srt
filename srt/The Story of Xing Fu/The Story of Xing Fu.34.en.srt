[The Story of Xing Fu]

2
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 34]

3
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,630
Yes,

4
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,020
Xingfu.

5
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,710
What's up?

6
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,300
Where are you?

7
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,100
I'm making dumplings

8
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,380
with Mom back home.

9
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,820
I see.

10
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,100
Wait for me.

11
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,820
I'll be back.

12
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,070
Okay.

13
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,630
See you later.

14
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:15,790
Mom.

15
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,990
Xingfu will be here soon.

16
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,070
Mom.

17
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,820
Let's make more dumplings.

18
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,070
Then I can pack some back with me.

19
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,100
Okay.

20
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,030
Xingfu can take some too.

21
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:39,540
Yes.

22
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,540
She can take some too.

23
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,350
She loves

24
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,820
Chinese chives and egg filling.

25
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:46,950
Xingfu!

26
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,980
Speak of the devil.

27
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,790
Come.

28
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,100
Help me make dumplings.

29
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:52,980
Come here.

30
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,420
Why?

31
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,580
I have some questions.

32
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,860
Wait.

33
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,820
Did you draft Chuanmei and Xiuyu's contract?

34
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,260
Yes.

35
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,310
Wan Chuanjia asked me to.

36
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,350
He promised...

37
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,100
Xingfu.

38
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,790
Why did you slap me?

39
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,190
I'm their lawyer.

40
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,910
Why can't I draft a contract for them?

41
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,070
Did he promise to give you a lot of money?

42
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,950
Xiuyu studied just as hard as you.

43
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,470
She got accepted into a university
but someone took her spot.

44
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,510
And what did you do?

45
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,260
You drafted that contract for Wan Chuanjia.

46
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,580
Where is your good conscience?

47
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,380
What do you mean?

48
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,070
I didn't commit the deed.

49
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,980
I merely drafted a contract.

50
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,750
I...

51
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,700
If I didn't do it, anyone else would.

52
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,660
You know this contract is null and void.

53
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,100
You're a lawyer.

54
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,660
Why did you draft it?

55
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,030
900,000 yuan?

56
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,030
You are quite bold
to put that number on the contract.

57
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,310
Guan Tao told me this contract

58
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,510
was drafted by a professional.

59
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,750
I knew right away it was you.

60
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,980
He didn't reveal your name

61
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,030
because he cares about my feelings.

62
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,540
Whatever others and Guan Tao say,

63
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,750
you believe them.

64
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,950
You trust everyone else.

65
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,950
Why do you trust outsiders

66
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,230
but not me?

67
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:10,950
Who's your family

68
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,790
and who's an outsider?

69
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,310
The Wangs still think I'm an outsider

70
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,540
and hide everything from me.

71
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,700
You're my sister

72
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,190
and you want to lie to me forever.

73
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:19,980
Why would I trust you?

74
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,310
And what's wrong with Guan Tao?

75
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,460
He's a lawyer

76
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,310
but he never exploits anyone.

77
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,950
And you,

78
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,900
you used Xiuyu to earn quick money.

79
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,310
You know,

80
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,020
Xiuyu is in the same situation
like yours from back then.

81
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,510
But you helped Wan Chuanjia to hurt her.

82
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,670
What did I do to her?

83
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,110
It's precisely because I know

84
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,340
she's in the same situation

85
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,110
that I know

86
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,580
what her choices should be.

87
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,380
Xingyun,

88
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,750
what has become of you?

89
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,630
Xingfu.

90
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,900
What's wrong with you two?

91
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,260
Where are you going?

92
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,460
The dumplings are almost ready.

93
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,580
Eat before you leave.

94
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,430
No, thanks.

95
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,430
I'm busy, Mom.

96
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,140
I've got to go.

97
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,900
Mr. Wan.

98
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,430
Mr. Wan.

99
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,260
You're here.

100
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,380
Have a seat.

101
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,750
You gave me this tea last time.

102
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,340
You found out about everything?

103
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,260
Yes.

104
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,750
Truth be told,

105
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,780
nothing is scarier

106
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,900
than you finding out

107
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,820
everything.

108
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,900
When I visited your home last time,

109
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,460
I even left a reminder to your mother-in-law.

110
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,820
You stared at me from the door

111
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,780
and I felt like I was caught.

112
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,140
Then I left with you absentmindedly.

113
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,990
In the end,

114
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,780
you still caught me.

115
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,750
I do fear you.

116
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,820
Mr. Wan.

117
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,900
I'm not afraid of you.

118
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,430
I respect you.

119
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,670
Do you still do?

120
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,630
I don't know.

121
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,140
Xingfu,

122
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,900
you've never

123
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,310
met Chuanmei after you were married

124
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,820
into Wan Village, right?

125
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,260
Yes.

126
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,820
She was afraid of coming back.

127
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,510
She feels

128
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,670
ashamed.

129
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
Xiuyu asked me to bring her to a university.

130
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,780
She told me

131
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,780
her life

132
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,990
was stolen.

133
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,630
Chuanmei

134
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,070
hanged herself when she came back last time.

135
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,020
Chuanjia found out in time
so nothing dire happened.

136
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,380
Chuanmei hanged herself?

137
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,260
Why did she do that?

138
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,190
Shame, I guess.

139
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,110
Whenever I close my eyes now,

140
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,110
I can see

141
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,020
the red mark

142
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,900
on her neck.

143
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,870
I'm getting old.

144
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,020
I can't remember the present

145
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,550
but I retain the past very well.

146
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,140
Chuanmei

147
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,700
was raised

148
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,260
by Chuanjia.

149
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,820
Their mother passed away early.

150
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,750
I was busy working with other villagers

151
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,900
to make a living

152
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,700
and was hardly home.

153
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,620
This one time,

154
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,740
the weather was awful.

155
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,860
I went home early.

156
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:49,815
I told myself

157
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:51,935
to pick them up at school.

158
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,220
But when I arrived there,

159
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,910
I realized I didn't know which grades they were in.

160
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,190
I failed as a father.

161
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,190
Children are your debts.

162
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,340
Xingfu,

163
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,150
go back and tell Xiuyu

164
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,950
that Wanjia Group
will not stop paying her salary.

165
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,670
It will be paid

166
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,030
from Chuanjia's and my pocket.

167
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,950
If she has any other requests,

168
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,340
feel free to let us know.

169
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,580
Xiuyu said

170
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,070
all she wants is to go to a university.

171
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,700
Mr. Wan.

172
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,310
I have to go now.

173
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,190
Xingfu,

174
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,910
you know everything now.

175
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,500
What do you plan to do?

176
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,390
It's not about what I plan to do.

177
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,620
It's about what Xiuyu plans to do.

178
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,580
Mr. Wan.

179
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,790
I know everything now.

180
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,790
What do you plan to do?

181
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,100
Xiuyu.

182
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,310
You're still awake.

183
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,670
Xiuyu,

184
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,950
I just talked to Mr. Wan.

185
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,270
He told me

186
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,550
that when Chuanmei came back last time,

187
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,910
she tried to hang herself.

188
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,740
Chuanjia found out in time

189
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,220
so she was saved.

190
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,910
What?

191
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,340
She tried to suicide?

192
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,790
She doesn't have the right to.

193
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,580
I'm the victim.

194
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,620
I am the victim.

195
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,100
Xiuyu,

196
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,670
I understand what you're feeling.

197
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,580
I want to defend your right too

198
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,100
but I don't know

199
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,190
how I should proceed.

200
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,460
We can't just force Chuanmei on a path to suicide.

201
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,620
They made a mistake.

202
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,270
They will be hounded by their good conscience.

203
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,390
Chuanmei

204
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,150
will not be able to live happily.

205
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:39,950
Xiuyu.

206
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,700
Don't cry.

207
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,950
There, there.

208
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,740
Mr. Wan.

209
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,430
You're back.

210
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,220
Xiuyu.

211
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,270
Wake up.

212
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,550
Wake up.

213
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,070
Dad, Mom, and Qinglai

214
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,270
came to visit you.

215
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,500
Your mom even brought you

216
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,910
your favorite toasted flatbreads.

217
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,030
It's warm.

218
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,580
Have some.

219
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,100
I'll put them here.

220
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,430
Remember to eat them.

221
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,030
So?

222
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,950
Let me talk to her.

223
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,390
Don't,

224
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:31,790
Mom.

225
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,270
Give her more time.

226
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,740
Xiuyu,

227
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,150
I know you're upset.

228
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
And I'm with you.

229
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,910
I do not want this to be over just like that.

230
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,950
Sometimes, I get so angry

231
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,100
that I think

232
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,620
it's their fault.

233
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,910
So they should bear

234
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,950
the consequences, no matter how dire they are.

235
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,460
However,

236
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,980
if this went out of control,

237
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,390
we would be indirectly killing Chuanmei.

238
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,270
Would we really feel better that way?

239
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,340
Chuanmei did make a mistake

240
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,070
but it's not serious enough to call for her death.

241
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,820
In my head,

242
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,550
there are two people

243
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,430
arguing non-stop.

244
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,740
It's annoying.

245
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,470
Xiuyu,

246
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,020
do you feel the same way?

247
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,540
Why me?

248
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,660
When I had a misfortune,

249
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,260
I asked myself that question too.

250
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,310
And then,

251
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,070
a voice would ring in my head:

252
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,590
those meant to lift heavy responsibilities

253
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,260
would first endure

254
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,900
the trial of the mind,

255
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,830
and the trial of the body.

256
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,020
When you think that way,

257
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,430
you feel strong enough to overcome everything.

258
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,780
Here you go.

259
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,590
Thank you.

260
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,470
Here.

261
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,870
Thanks.

262
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:15,340
All right.

263
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:15,780
Let's go.

264
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,540
Let's go.

265
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,630
Take it.

266
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,190
What else do you want to eat?

267
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,780
Do you want to eat this?

268
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,950
Look.

269
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,740
Xingfu.

270
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,060
Is that you?

271
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,670
Do you remember me?

272
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,060
Cai.

273
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,190
It's been a while.

274
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,910
Hi.

275
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,950
Yes, it's been a while.

276
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,390
How are you?

277
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,020
All good?

278
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,780
Is Qinglai

279
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,390
still working on his plot?

280
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,300
Yes, he is.

281
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,870
I now own an inn.

282
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,020
Qinglai supplies vegetables to my inn

283
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,910
and to all other inns in the village.

284
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,260
Oh,

285
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,230
in Wan Village,

286
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,740
there's a Xingfu Inn.

287
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,390
It's quite famous.

288
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,430
Is it yours?

289
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,710
I knew it.

290
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,150
No wonder it's called Xingfu Inn.

291
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,260
What are you doing now then?

292
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,340
Are you still selling vegetables?

293
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,150
Of course.

294
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,230
How else can I feed myself?

295
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,630
Xingfu,

296
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,670
I have an idea.

297
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,500
You see,

298
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,340
Qinglai is still a farmer.

299
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,710
Let's finish

300
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,390
what didn't work

301
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,100
last time.

302
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,670
Honestly,

303
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,430
Qinglai

304
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,670
is a talented farmer.

305
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,820
And organic vegetables

306
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,500
are all the rage now.

307
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,390
Sure.

308
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,470
I'll let him know

309
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,470
and ask him to contact you.

310
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:23,990
Sure.

311
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,020
Make sure he calls me, okay?

312
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,470
Okay.

313
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,340
What a chance encounter.

314
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,060
I'll leave you be.

315
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,740
See you.

316
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:37,740
Dear,

317
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,100
I delivered the vegetables to your kitchen.

318
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,500
I'm just dropping by to see you

319
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,190
and get some water before I go.

320
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:42,580
Okay?

321
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,540
I was meant to call you

322
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,540
to tell you something.

323
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,740
What?

324
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,100
Do you remember Cai?

325
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,020
Of course.

326
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,740
I ran into him in the wet market today.

327
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,020
He told me

328
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,060
he wanted to finish

329
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,470
the failed project.

330
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,020
He wanted you to contact him soon.

331
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,580
Really?

332
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,470
He still wants to establish a special counter?

333
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:03,990
Yes.

334
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,020
He heard how good

335
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,230
your products are

336
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,540
and wanted to work with you too.

337
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,020
Isn't this great news?

338
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,060
But first thing first,

339
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,670
if you guys strike a deal,

340
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,100
my inn's vegetable supply still takes priority.

341
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,260
Of course.

342
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,670
A special counter...

343
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,390
I need

344
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,230
to expand

345
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,060
and hire more people.

346
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,340
I didn't expect organic vegetables

347
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,470
to be this popular.

348
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,230
Right?

349
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,190
I'll contact him now.

350
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,500
Go.

351
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,740
See you then.

352
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,540
I'll leave you be.

353
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,740
Ms. He.

354
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,300
Hi.

355
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,470
I'm Liu,

356
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,300
a teacher from a school in the town center.

357
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,230
I need a favor

358
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,340
from you.

359
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,260
May I know

360
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,950
if you're free now?

361
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,150
Of course.

362
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,990
Have a seat.

363
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,020
Thank you.

364
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,060
So what is it?

365
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,500
Ms. He.

366
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,870
Actually,

367
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,230
I heard about you long ago.

368
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,630
Did you

369
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,300
work in a big law firm

370
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,950
in the city before?

371
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,020
Yes, I did.

372
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,500
I need

373
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,230
your help.

374
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,580
I need

375
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,580
the expertise

376
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,260
of a lawyer.

377
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,230
Can you

378
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,190
show me the way?

379
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,710
What happened?

380
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,260
You see.

381
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,710
I have several students

382
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,950
who live

383
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:20,780
in Shuiwei Village

384
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,580
by the foot of the mountain.

385
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,430
They kept falling ill

386
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,300
recently.

387
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,950
It's always

388
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,020
a cold,

389
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,820
a fever,

390
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,500
or diarrhea.

391
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
It's been like that for a while.

392
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,740
Why do you need a lawyer for sick students?

393
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,100
Because I think something is not right.

394
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,060
What do you mean?

395
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,390
Hear me out.

396
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,260
Shuiwei Village

397
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,260
is located

398
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,100
downstream

399
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,300
of the Fushui River.

400
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,870
The wastewater treatment plant
of Wanjia Health Products Factory

401
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,670
is located upstream.

402
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,500
After it went

403
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,670
fully operational,

404
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,340
the children

405
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,230
have been falling ill.

406
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,870
I suspect

407
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,230
that they polluted the water.

408
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,470
I confronted them

409
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,470
many times

410
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,710
but they denied it categorically.

411
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,740
They told me

412
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,580
the wastewater

413
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,780
has been properly dealt with.

414
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,430
It is.

415
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,780
Their wastewater treatment plant

416
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,670
occupies part of my land.

417
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,540
So I know.

418
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,020
But the fact

419
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,020
is that those children kept falling ill.

420
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,100
Also,

421
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,540
when they say they have processed the water,

422
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,020
are they telling the truth?

423
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,950
Ms. He.

424
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:27,950
Truth be told,

425
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,340
I spend most of my time with kids.

426
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,500
The oldest ones

427
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,740
are like 12 or 13 years old

428
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,020
and the youngest ones

429
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,470
are only 7 or 8 years old.

430
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,740
Their life has just begun.

431
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,910
I heard

432
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,950
you know a lawyer called Guan Tao.

433
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,390
He's a famous figure in the villages

434
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,260
nearby.

435
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
Everyone calls him

436
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,340
the Village Lawyer.

437
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,340
I want to go to him

438
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,540
to consult him

439
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,710
and see

440
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,430
if there's a solution to this matter.

441
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,230
Sure.

442
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,740
I'll bring you to him tomorrow.

443
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,990
He's a kind person.

444
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,260
He's a lawyer who truly has
the villagers' interests at heart.

445
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,260
Thank you.

446
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:11,990
(You see,)

447
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,670
(Mr. Liu.)

448
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,990
What makes you think

449
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,190
the wastewater
from the health products factory

450
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,150
caused the children to fall ill?

451
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,190
Do you have any proof?

452
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,990
I don't have

453
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,230
any solid evidence.

454
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,710
But this phenomenon

455
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,580
appeared

456
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,670
after the health products factory

457
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,500
went fully operational.

458
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,950
Don't you think

459
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,630
the timeline matches up?

460
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,990
Has anyone from the village tested

461
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,950
the drinkable water?

462
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,060
Do you know?

463
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,870
I did

464
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,150
talk to the chief of Shuiwei Village.

465
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,470
He said

466
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,500
National Health
and Family Planning Commission

467
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,390
would evaluate

468
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,540
the potable water

469
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,500
in the village

470
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,430
every few months.

471
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,670
No problem

472
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,060
came to light.

473
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,430
Is it possible

474
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,670
that there's another source of pollution?

475
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,740
For example,

476
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,470
is there another factory nearby

477
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,020
or perhaps

478
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,500
it's in your rice,

479
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,230
your noodles,

480
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,230
your vegetables,

481
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,430
or your fruits?

482
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,430
I did notify the Town Council

483
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,260
and they have sent people to investigate.

484
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,230
But nothing

485
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,580
was found.

486
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,630
Mr. Guan.

487
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,150
I'm just

488
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,580
an elementary school teacher.

489
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,910
I might be

490
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,710
overstepping

491
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,780
the bounds here.

492
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,060
But

493
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,740
I spend

494
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,910
every day

495
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,060
with the kids.

496
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,580
I want them to be healthy.

497
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,020
When I see them sick,

498
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,950
it hurts my soul.

499
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,630
Also,

500
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,580
they are not

501
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,740
from a wealthy background.

502
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,630
To treat their kids,

503
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,580
the parents

504
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,190
are so worried

505
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,390
that they can barely eat or sleep.

506
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,670
Knowing how obedient the children are,

507
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,340
I truly feel sorry for them.

508
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,670
So

509
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,500
Mr. Guan,

510
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,100
I came to you

511
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,870
because I believe

512
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,870
you know more than I do.

513
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,820
Can you tell me

514
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,670
if there's a way

515
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,230
to get to the bottom

516
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,390
of this?

517
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,190
Mr. Liu.

518
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,100
How many children in your school manifest

519
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,020
similar syndromes?

520
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,950
Around

521
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,470
eight.

522
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,580
Another three

523
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,740
aren't as affected.

524
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,230
And all those eight students

525
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,870
are from Shuiwei Village?

526
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,780
Do they share anything else

527
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,540
in common?

528
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,100
Anything else

529
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,060
in common...

530
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,580
Right.

531
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,100
They live

532
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,740
near the village border,

533
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,820
next to the river.

534
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,150
When I do my house visits,

535
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,710
I will visit

536
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,060
the ones in the village center

537
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,470
before

538
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,260
visiting

539
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,100
their houses.

540
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,630
I see.

541
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,340
Mr. Liu.

542
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,464
I know someone
from Environment Monitoring Station

543
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:37,260
in the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

544
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,870
I'll give you her contact.

545
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,710
You...

546
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,430
You can inform the leader

547
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,150
of Shuiwei Villager.

548
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,190
Okay.

549
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,870
I'm close to the leader.

550
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,500
Just leave the contact

551
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,390
to me later.

552
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,190
I'll talk to him.

553
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,300
Mr. Liu.

554
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,910
Do not

555
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,430
worry about this too much.

556
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,740
My colleagues and I will devise

557
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,710
a plan as soon as possible.

558
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,710
Our sole objective

559
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,870
is to investigate the problem

560
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,710
and solve it.

561
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,300
Thank you

562
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,260
so much.

563
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,470
Sorry

564
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,950
for taking up

565
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,190
so much of your time.

566
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,950
I do not know how else

567
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,710
to express my gratitude.

568
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,150
So...

569
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:09,990
Thank you.

570
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,340
No worries.

571
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,910
It's my job.

572
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,060
Then,

573
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:12,820
I shall take my leave.

574
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,390
Okay.

575
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,470
Thank you.

576
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,670
Thanks, Guan.

577
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,340
No worries.

578
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,910
Let's go.

579
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,340
Okay.

580
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,540
Let's go, Mr. Liu.

581
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:21,780
[Fangyuan Law Firm]

582
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,540
No need to see me out.

583
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,060
Okay.

584
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:23,910
Bye.

585
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,780
We can walk ourselves out, Guan.

586
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,260
Bye.

587
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,910
All right.

588
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,910
Bye.

589
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,150
I'll be frank.

590
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,910
Merging Shuiwei Village

591
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,710
into Wan Village

592
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,910
is like a charity project.

593
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,260
If the higher-up

594
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,990
hasn't been pestering me with it,

595
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,710
I wouldn't want to accept this unfavorable deal.

596
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,950
What does Shuiwei Village have?

597
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,230
Lands?

598
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,630
Who wants to be a farmer nowadays?

599
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:54,950
Human capital?

600
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,020
Most of them are old and sick.

601
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,020
Those who graduated
from the university in the city

602
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
would all try their very best

603
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,260
to join the Wanjia Group.

604
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,150
And suddenly,

605
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,990
we have to look after the dead weight
that is Shuiwei Village.

606
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,020
It's inadequate to say that.

607
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,950
When Wan Village was under development,

608
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,470
the higher-up asked Shuiwei Village
to be the bigger person.

609
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,260
You had the priority

610
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:19,990
for water

611
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,430
and electricity.

612
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,780
They said your village

613
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,710
should get rich first

614
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,780
and then, you'd help us to get rich.

615
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,260
Others

616
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,820
might not know

617
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,230
but I do.

618
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,430
Without our sacrifices

619
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,150
and support,

620
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,670
Wan Village
could never progress this quickly.

621
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,580
Now, Wan Village wants to expand further

622
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,780
but it has no more land.

623
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,470
They want to acquire us

624
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,580
because we have the land.

625
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,390
If you think

626
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,020
this isn't fair,

627
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,060
then let's postpone the merger.

628
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,150
Maoqin.

629
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,230
Forget it.

630
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,300
The merger is ordained

631
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,390
by the higher-up.

632
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,100
Right?

633
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,500
Since they have spoken,

634
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,780
there's no need

635
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,990
to recite old stories.

636
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,780
It serves nothing.

637
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,230
No.

638
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,390
If we merge together,

639
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,540
we will be a family.

640
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,740
Everyone should be treated equally.

641
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,190
But clearly, we aren't treated

642
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,390
in the same way as you guys.

643
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,060
You're just making my work tougher for me.

644
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,950
How interesting.

645
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,190
Of course, you'll be treated differently.

646
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,060
Don't you agree?

647
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,910
All villagers of Wan Village

648
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,950
went through

649
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,740
the hardship of starting out.

650
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,540
They are like the founding fathers.

651
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,820
Of course, they should be treated better.

652
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,670
Shuiwei villagers have no right

653
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,150
to claim their prestige.

654
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,780
Also,

655
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,740
this company

656
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,580
will recruit

657
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,870
staff members from other cities too.

658
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,670
And they'll receive even lower salaries

659
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,060
than those of the Shuiwei villagers.

660
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,340
What's your opinion on that?

661
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,150
And still, you're complaining.

662
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,230
Fine.

663
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,500
Go work outside

664
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,500
and see if you can earn more than working for us.

665
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:57,670
You...

666
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,540
If you put it that way,

667
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,150
then let's postpone

668
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,340
the merger.

669
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,150
But if someone from the village

670
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,300
complains about the pollution by Wanjia Group

671
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:10,950
and wants

672
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,580
to sue you,

673
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,060
then

674
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,230
we won't be able to help.

675
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,190
Of course.

676
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,150
My, my.

677
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,100
We talk

678
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,740
and negotiate

679
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,910
then suddenly, you're threatening me?

680
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,190
Maoqin,

681
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,500
I address you as my elder

682
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,910
out of respect for my dad.

683
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,470
If you want to threaten me,

684
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
let's call it off here.

685
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,990
Tell your people

686
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,540
to bring me to court.

687
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,340
Fine.

688
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,300
Let's call it off here.

689
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,340
I would rather strut than wag my tail.

690
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,710
I don't fancy
this Deputy Manager position anyway.

691
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,260
Let's go.

692
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:42,950
Mr. Maoqin.

693
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,870
Sit.

694
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,740
You have to

695
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,820
put up with him.

696
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,470
Yanping.

697
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,820
I do not accept it.

698
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,230
I would rather be starved to death

699
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,500
than be a lapdog.

700
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,390
Let's leave.

701
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,430
You do have the backbone.

702
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,780
Mr. Cailiang,

703
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,430
well,

704
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,190
since our guests are leaving,

705
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,870

Can't you see what he's doing?

709

He wants us to leave now.

710
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,580
Stop staying here shamelessly.

Listen.

They have prepared the chicken...

Why did you have to do that?

717
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,540
Your father said

718
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,910
that the merging of two villages

719
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,260
would be advantageous

720
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
for our development.

00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,020

Don't worry, Mr. Cailiang.

Wonderful.

this deal will never work.

737
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,820
What happened?

738
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:57,780
You see.

739
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,100
Ever since your village

740
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,430
built this health products factory,

741
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,150
I have been telling the higher-up

742
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,910
that it could pollute our land.

743
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,580
And see?

744
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,390
Several kids are sick now.

745
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,300
The teacher in the town thinks
something is not right

746
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,710
and has consulted a lawyer.

747
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,710

748
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,630
for the eventual merging.

749
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,390
But your village

750
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,230
keeps thinking we are inferior.

751
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,100
It is shameful to admit it.

752
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,260
As a chief,

753
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,190
I don't earn as much as one committee member
of your village.

754
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,230
Let's not merge.

755
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,230
We're poor

756

you have quite a mess to clean up.

If they insist on

760
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,100
getting to the bottom

761

of the pollution issues,

762
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,100

You blame me for your sick children

because my factory is upstream.

when the children in our village fall sick?

Wow.

to Mr. Wang's and others' attention.

791

If we have any rudimentary evidence

792
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,990
that suggests the health products factory

793
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,230
polluted the land,

794
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,500
we can consider

795
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,430
taking legal actions.

796
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,500
In this kind of pollution case,

797
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,190
the court will demand the defendant

798
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,710
to prove that their emission

799
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,910
has nothing to do with the children's illness.

800

801
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,710
did pollute the land

802

to prove their innocence,

804
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,190
they would need to show convincing evidence.

805
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,500
That evidence

806
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,300
can also answer all our questions.

Sure.

However,

809
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,710
once we initiate the legal proceedings,

810
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,060
it might affect

811
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,390

get in touch with the Ministry of Ecology
and Environment to test the water.

It's up to you.

837

However, I think

838
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,060
it's too early for it.

839
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,860
We can test the water ourselves

840
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,030
and see where it leads.

00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,820
That way,

842
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,430
we don't have to explain it to everyone,

The way I see it,

854
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,580
since we can't merge together anyway,

855
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:24,990
they just

856

857
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,710
Let's fight them.

858
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,470
We'll feel better that way.

Stop yelling.

861

If yelling can solve anything,

862
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,470
I'll yell the loudest.

863

Calm yourselves.

I actually think

868
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,340
this is our bargaining chip.

869
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,340

872
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,230
The lawyer also expressed

873
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,030
his intention to visit the village for more info.

874
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,270
We should support his endeavor.

875

We just

876
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,230

00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,300
Everything can be solved.

881
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,910
Right?

882
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,100
Let's discuss it.

883
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,470
Come.

884
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,140
Are we there yet?

885
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,140
Almost.

886
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,180
Here?

887
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,030
Yes.

888
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,700
This is the place.

889
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:45,980
[Environmental Monitoring
People's Republic of China]

890
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:51,910
Sure, you'll do the reservation.

891
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,870
The restaurant we went to last time?

892
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,180
Can do.

893
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:53,700
No problem.

894
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,100
I invite the others.

895
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:55,580
Okay?

896
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,220
But bear in mind,

897
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,030
don't drink too much.

898
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,990
We have a morning shift tomorrow.

899
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,350
Just this once.

900
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,030
Come back.

901
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,510
What?

902
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,180
Look at that car.

903
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,310
Environment Monitoring.

904
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,990
Isn't that a car from the Ministry
of Ecology and Environment?

905
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,060
They sent someone here?

906
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,830
I wasn't aware of it.

907
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,030
During the meeting with Mr. Mo yesterday,
he told us to pay attention

908
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,430
to the people
from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

909
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,700
Look.

910
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,310
That woman.

911
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,620
Isn't she Xingfu?

912
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,580
Yes!

913
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,540
It's Xingfu.

914
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,100
This is not normal.

915
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,220
Indeed.

916
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,390
Let's go

917
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,060
and report it.

918
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,310
Okay.

919
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,140
Thank you so much.

920
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,740
Do you want to rest in my inn?

921
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,700
You can leave after dinner.

922
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,510
No need.

923
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,180
We still

924
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,310
have to go to Shuiwei Village.

925
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,180
Their village committee

926
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,950
asked us to test their potable water too.

927
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,540
All right. Thank you.

928
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,430
Hi, Mr. Wan.

929
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,350
Why are you two running?

930
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,220
Why so frantic?

931
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,470
Mr. Wan.

932
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,830
There's a car
from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

933
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,060
What's wrong with that?

934
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,260
They are just doing their job.

935
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,870
We didn't do anything wrong

936
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,580
so we have nothing to fear.

937
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,910
Go back to your post.

938
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,580
Mr. Wu had a meeting with us yesterday

939
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,830
and told us to be careful

940
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,140
of fire, robbery,

941
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,830
and Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

942
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,580
Nonsense.

943
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,030
The Ministry of Ecology and Environment
is there to facilitate

944
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,740
our economic development.

945
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,740
Why should we fear them?

946
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,350
Don't you have anything to do?

947
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,030
Go back to work.

948
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:35,740
Okay.

949
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,100
Wan Village

950
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,310
is located

951
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,030
in a beautiful place.

952
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,950
The hill is green.

953
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:45,910
The water is clear.

954
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,100
The scenery is breathtaking.

955
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,990
Xingfu,

956
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,700
do you have rooms in your inn?

957
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,870
I want to visit with my family.

958
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,100
Sure.

959
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,390
Let me know before you visit.

960
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,220
I'll keep a room for you.

961
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:57,830
Wonderful,

962
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,260
Xingfu.

963
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:58,910
You're so reliable.

964
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,510
Misters,

965
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,470
can I invite you to my house

966
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,990
to collect one more water sample?

967
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,830
Please?

968
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,510
Give me the bottle.

969
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,180
Done.

970
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:22,700
Let's go.

971
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:29,620
Okay.

972
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,260
No problem.

973
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,350
What a day.

974
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,990
What's the matter, long face?

975
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,740
You're sulking

976
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,830
as if there's a misfortune.

977
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,620
What happened?

978
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,430
Why did he glare at me?

979
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,260
Did I cross him somewhere?

980
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,390
Come on.

981
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,220
Leave him be.

982
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,350
His nephew

983
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,220
fell ill again.

984
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,830
No wonder.

985
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,350
I heard his nephew

986
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,470
is very smart

987
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,700
but he has terrible health.

988
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,430
See?

989
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,700
He falls ill so easily.

990
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,430
Should we

991
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,830
report to the higher-up?

992
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,390
What?

993
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,180
His nephew is ill.

994
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,430
What's there to report?

995
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,790
No.

996
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,030
I mean

997
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,950
we saw the car
from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

998
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,470
That's fine.

999
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,390
Why should we report it?

1000
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,990
Mr. Wan told us to forget it.

1001
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,660
All right.

1002
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,390
Sir.

1003
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,180
Forget what?

1004
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,430
In terms of our environment,

1005
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,260
infrastructure,

1006
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,350
culture, and tourism,

1007
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,540
Wan Village

1008
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,350
has certain advantages.

1009
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,660
But to be regarded as the richest village
in the entrepreneurship competition,

1010
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,740
the local business output value,

1011
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:41,580
job opportunity,

1012
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,100
and tax submitted

1013
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,990
still have to meet certain standards.

1014
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,740
They cannot be lower
than other competing villages.

1015
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,260
So

1016
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,260
work harder.

1017
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,830
Keep it going.

1018
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,700
At the end of this year,

1019
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,140
we might have a chance at hanging that title

1020
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,580
on this wall.

1021
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,310
Don't worry, Mr. Wan.

1022
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,030
We have

1023
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,140
the confidence.

1024
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,660
Good.

1025
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,950
Keep it up.

1026
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,350
And then, during the celebratory dinner,

1027
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,220
those who contributed the most
will be rewarded handsomely.

1028
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,700
I need to take this.

1029
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,470
Go.

1030
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,470
Sorry.

1031
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,510
Yes?

1032
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,180
What?

1033
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,540
When?

1034
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,310
Okay.

1035
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,470
I got it.

1036
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,180
Do your job.

1037
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:41,910
Sorry.

1038
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,950
Is everything all right?

1039
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:43,950
Yes.

1040
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,830
The guards

1041
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,350
spotted

1042
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,540
a car from the Ministry of Ecology
and Environment.

1043
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,390
Oh.

1044
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,470
Speaking of which,

1045
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,830
who has been giving nonsensical instructions
to the staff members?

1046
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,430
Be careful

1047
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,580
of fire, robbery,

1048
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,830
and Ministry of Ecology and Environment?

1049
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:57,540
Well,

1050
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,100
I...

1051
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,620
I'm sure

1052
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,260
they are kidding.

1053
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,740
This is not a joking matter.

1054
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,990
Also, have you heard?

1055
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,990
Shuiwei Village complained again,

1056
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,790
saying we polluted the stream

1057
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:11,830
and made

1058
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,310
their children fall sick.

1059
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,510
Of course, we have.

1060
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,870
They have been complaining for ages.

1061
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,790
But the ministry

1062
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,100
has been evaluating the water

1063
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,220
regularly.

1064
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,430
They find no problem.

1065
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,910
I think

1066
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,660
they are

1067
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,470
just too poor

1068
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,140
that they went crazy.

1069
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,350
Nothing can happen to them.

1070
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,580
And if something happens,

1071
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,060
it's on us.

1072
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,580
In my opinion,

1073
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,100
they just want to raise some issues

1074
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,390
before the merging with our village

1075
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,220
so that they get more favorable offers.

1076
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,540
Merging both villages

1077
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,470
with Wan Village as the lead

1078
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,910
is a decision from the higher-up.

1079
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,430
We got rich first

1080
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,510
so we should help the villages downstream

1081
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,430
to develop.

1082
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:50,620
All right?

1083
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,700
I'm ready

1084
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,180
to take a loss.

1085
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,540
But I won't agree to treat everyone as equal.

1086
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,180
Maoqin is sly.

1087
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,390
He's capable of this sort of thing.

1088
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,580
But you know what they say,

1089
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,540
nothing happens for no reason.

1090
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,220
Stay alert.

1091
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,990
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

1092
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,350
Mr. Wan.

1093
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,700
Even if there is something wrong,
he's too dumb to find it.

1094
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,180
I told you nothing's allowed to go wrong.

1095
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:14,660
Right.

1096
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,510
I was just saying.

1097
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,620
He's too dumb

1098
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,620
to find a fault,

1099
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,180
not to mention

1100
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:19,950
we've done nothing wrong.

1101
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,470
Good.

1102
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,470
[President's office]

1103
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,430
Mo, tell me.

1104
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,870
Is there anything wrong
with the wastewater treatment plant?

1105
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,740
No.

1106
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:49,910
Honestly.

1107
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,310
It's all perfectly normal.

1108
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,100
Do you get what I'm implying?

1109
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,180
Of course.

1110
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,620
I do.

1111
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,870
No more dirty tricks.

1112
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,700
Of course.

1113
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,030
That's for sure.

1114
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,580
However, Mr. Wan.

1115
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,260
If this

1116
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,910
carries on,

1117
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:07,790
our cost

1118
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,910
will soar through the sky.

1119
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,790
Say you let everything go fully operational,

1120
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,030
forget the salary cost,

1121
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,950
let's talk about ingredients.

1122
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,220
Activated carbon,

1123
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:14,990
powdered carbon,

1124
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:15,910
lye,

1125
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,100
and also,

1126
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,830
polyaluminium chloride,

1127
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,700
polyacrylamide,

1128
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,790
fuel,

1129
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:20,390
maintenance,

1130
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:20,910
and logistics.

1131
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:21,790
All in all,

1132
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,180
the cost to run

1133
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,030
the wastewater treatment plant is too high.

1134
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,260
Then find another way

1135
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,220
to cut costs.

1136
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,060
I have been trying.

1137
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,430
I have cut everything else to a bare minimum.

1138
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,790
There's nothing left.

1139
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,620
Mr. Wan.

1140
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,310
Our factory is situated on high terrain.

1141
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,470
The water here is fresh.

1142
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,510
Even if there's a pollutant,

1143
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,510
it will be diluted

1144
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,540
as it's washed away downstream.

1145
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,620
There won't be any issues.

1146
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,350
Everyone does this now.

1147
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,260
If you don't do this,

1148
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,390
your cost will be high.

1149
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,660
You won't have the edge over others.

1150
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,350
Nonsense.

1151
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,790
What did I tell you?

1152
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,060
If something...

1153
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,060
If something went wrong,

1154
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,060
who would take responsibility?

1155
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,950
Us.

1156
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,260
We will go to jail for this.

1157
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,620
