[Episode 27]

3
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,439
I was so

4
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,680
overwhelmed with work these days.

5
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,360
There are so many things to do in the firm.

6
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,280
I couldn't catch a break at all.

7
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,800
All this time, it was you

8
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,159
who was giving me a hand in secret.

9
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,360
Xingfu,

10
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:28,919
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,560
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,039
You burned

13
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,680
this dish.

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,759
No, I didn't.

15
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,319
What?

17
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,639
Dongshan Group

18
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:16,919
ditched us.

19
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,439
Why?

20
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,919
The meeting went smoothly.

21
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,719
Why?

22
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,800
Ask Wang Qinglai.

23
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,400
He's the reason.

24
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,199
What does he have anything to do with it?

25
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,639
I asked him to deliver my proposal,

26
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,439
but he still hasn't done it.

27
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,719
Dongshan Group then thought

28
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,400
we didn't work efficiently enough,

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
so they signed with another firm.

30
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,520
End of story.

Guan Tao.

32
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,319
Wang Qinglai is not good for us.

33
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,520
It's a case worth more than two million.

34
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,439
Two million!

35
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,120
Down the drain.

36
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,000
I see.

37
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,199
I'll deal with it.

38
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,439
Go back to work.

39
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,199
Hello?

40
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,439

[Fangyuan Law Firm]

42
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,120
Mr. Guan.

43
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,319
You know what happened, don't you?

44
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,800
Tell me now.

45
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,519
What was Wang Qinglai thinking?

46
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,839
Yes, it was me who suggested employing him,

47
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,600
so whatever mistakes he made,

48
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,959
everyone tried to move past them.

49
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,879
Due to him,

50
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,279
we now lost

51
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,439
a client.

52
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,319
We now lost two million yuan.

53
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,279
Mr. Guan.

54
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
I didn't know

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,439
it would be this serious.

56
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,120
Then...

57
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,120
Is it still salvageable?

58
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,120
Perhaps there was another reason.

59
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,279
But the reason they gave us

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,040
was that we were inefficient.

61
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,079
And that, we can't argue.

62
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,279
It's all my fault.

63
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,399
I didn't remind him enough.

64
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,439
How many times do I have to tell you?

65
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,120
He and you are two different individuals.

66
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,399
You have nothing to do with this.

We're all adults here.

68

Fire him then.

No, I did not.

aren't you busy with work?

Good boy.

92

Look how big you are.

93
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,200
Don't catch a cold.

94
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,559
Mom, where's Qinglai?

95
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,320
He came back yesterday

96
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,360
and went to sleep right away without eating.

97
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,879
Then, he left this morning.

98
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,799
Okay.

99
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,480
I'll go look for him.

100
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,440
I'll be back, all right, Dou?

101
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,240
-Your mommy is back.
-Be a good boy.

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,720
Don't wear yourself out.

104
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,120
All right.

105
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:51,720
Your mommy

106
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,000
left.

107
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,639
Did Guan Tao

108
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:20,679
fire me?

109
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,600
He didn't.

110
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,879
He said it's up to us.

111
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,240
I'm too ashamed to face them.

112
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,799
I didn't know it was that important.

113
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,879
I know you resent me

114
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,559
for botching a simple task like that.

115
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,720
The firm lost more than two million
because of this.

116
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,399
Even selling me

117
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,399
will not make up for the loss.

118
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,120
It's because office work
isn't what you want to do.

119
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,240
You want to work on a plot.

120
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,840
That's why you couldn't do it well.

121
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,639
What are you implying?

122
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,600
That I'm too vulgar?

123
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,879
Yes, I am.

124
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,559
And you have become all modernized.

125
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,639
This is not what I meant.

126
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,519
I don't get it. Back then,

127
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,919
you were capable and hardworking.

128
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,039
But once you were in the city,

129
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,759
you shunned physical labor.

130
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:27,759
You refused to learn

131
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,039
and wanted to take shortcuts.

132
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,840
You latched onto others.

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,159
Because I'm desperate.

134
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,919
Why?

135
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,279
Why?

136
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,240
Yes.

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,159
Why am I desperate?

138
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,320
He Xingfu,

139
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,840
let me tell you why.

140
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,039
How can I not be desperate when I witness

141
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,519
how quickly you grow?

142
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:51,360
Sometimes,

143
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
I couldn't sleep at night.

144
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,320
I hate it.

145
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,679
I don't hate others

146
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,960
or Guan Tao.

147
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,679
I hate myself.

148
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,000
Why can't I be like Guan Tao?

149
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,360
Xingfu.

150
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,120
Do you know?

151
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,720
I can work myself to death,

152
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,240
but I still can never be the one to teach you,

153
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,840
to enlighten you,

154
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,120
to instruct you how to drive,

155
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,120
or to guide you.

156
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,639
I think and think.

157
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,759
In the city, I would always fall behind.

158
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,039
Behind you!

159
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,799
And I kept dragging you down
with my incompetence.

160
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,919
Do you know

161
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,759
how it feels like to see the person

162
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,879
you're in love with

163
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,799
running in front of you,

164
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,440
and you know you can

165
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,759
never catch up,

166
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,440
but you still force yourself anyway?

167
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,519
Do you like farming that much?

168
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,559
I used to think

169
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,759
I prefer farming.

170
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,240
But after a few years in the city,

171
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,559
I realized

172
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,200
that I did not like it at all.

173
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,080
It's just I'm good at it.

174
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,320
What's so good about working on a plot?

175
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,200
You work under the sun.

176
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,200
You get soaked. You get mud everywhere.

177
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,960
You work yourself to death for a few coins.

178
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,600
I'd be lying

179
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,679
if I said I love it.

180
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,159
Then why did you come back here?

181
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,480
Xingfu,

182
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,879
after three decades,

183
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,240
I realized

184
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,279
this is the only thing I can do.

185
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,159
This is the only thing I'm good at.

186
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,720
Standing here and taking in the scent,

187
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,679
I can know right away

188
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,799
when to apply the fertilizer

189
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,440
and when to use the pesticide.

190
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:56,840
I just have to listen to it

191
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,720
to know when to thin

192
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,639
and when it will bear fruit.

193
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,320
It's reassuring.

194
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,399
It's reassuring,

195
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,039
but you can't stay
within your comfort zone forever.

196
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,159
You have to move forward.

197
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,039
So many people

198
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,759
leave rural areas to work in the city.

199
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,720
They get by perfectly.

200
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:22,879
Yes,

201
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,679
you keep telling me that.

202
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,720
The city is good.

203
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,240
Everyone wants to go there.

204
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
But in the city,

205
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,919
I feel like an idiot.

206
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,679
Every day,

207
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,080
I rush here and there,

208
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,840
gritting my teeth.

209
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,600
Afraid of screwing up

210
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,840
and being looked down upon.

211
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,240
And it's so weird.

212
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,200
Whatever I do,

213
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,440
it's always wrong.

214
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,240
I'm tired.

215
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,840
Very tired.

216
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,519
So is everyone.

217
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,679
Those who want to have a comfortable life

218
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,039
are all tired.

219
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,399
Xingfu,

220
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,159
I know

221
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,759
it's tough on you too.

222
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,200
You suffered a lot with me

223
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,200
in the past few years.

224
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:44,720
Go back to the city.

225
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,960
We're different.

226
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,240
You are meant to be the cloud in the sky,

227
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,159
and I am the soil.

228
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,639
I can never reach you.

229
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Go back.

230
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,679
You came to me for a divorce, didn't you?

231
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,600
Let's divorce then.

232
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,600
I won't weigh you down anymore.

233
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,110
All right. I'll make it brief.

234
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,750
So,

235
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,030
congratulations.

236
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:36,870
Look.

237
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,820
Another beautiful girl

238
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,030
joined Wan Village.

239
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,390
People come to me

240
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,580
for matchmaking

241
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,780
after

242
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,940
Xingfu married

243
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,180
into the Wang family.

244
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,390
Their wedding was a festive one.

245
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,750
Do you still remember?

246
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,180
Yes!

247
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,470
May they live

248
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,990
happily ever after

249
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,230
and have a harmonious marital life.

250
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:05,990
(Yes!)

251
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,230
Xingfu.

252
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,470
We

253
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,470
will live life to the fullest.

254
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,950
When you

255
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,990
are my age, you'll understand.

256
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,860
Nothing beats a family

257
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,230
(and a warm house.)

258
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,340
(You're young.)

259
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,510
(You should)

260
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,990
(venture out.)

261
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,340
(However,)

262
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,990
don't forget for what reason you venture out.

263
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,380
Don't lose yourself or your family

264
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,230
halfway through.

265
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,710
It's not worth it.

266
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,230
See?

267
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,580
In a blink of an eye,

268
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,540
your son

269
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,340
has grown this big.

270
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,340
(Keep him company.)

271
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,470
(Let him grow up beside you.)

272
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,990
(That will make a difference.)

273
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,140
Hi, could you tell me how should I get here?

274
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,140
This place?

275
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,580
Yes.

276
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,030
It's over there.

277
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,230
Okay.

278
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:27,670
Thank you.

279
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,060
Qinglai.

280
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,230
Qinglai.

281
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,950
Xingfu.

282
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,860
Breakfast's ready.

283
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,030
Qinglai.

284
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,380
Qinglai, why did you lock the door?

285
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,780
Is Xingfu with you?

286
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,380
She isn't here.

287
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,100
What?

288
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,580
What happened to you two?

289
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,030
Nothing.

290
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,620
Qinglai,

291
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,950
we noticed it.

292
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,470
Did I predict it correctly?

293
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,860
Is she enticed by city life?

294
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,340
Not at all.

295
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,430
You know,

296
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,380
Xingfu

297
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,030
is a very sensible wife.

298
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,140
Get back together if you can.

299
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,230
You hear me?

300
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,470
If it doesn't work,

301
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,140
keep Little Dou.

302
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,230
He's ours.

303
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,300
All right, Mom.

304
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,380
Just go down.

305
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,820
Let me rest up.

306
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,990
Just leave me alone.

307
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,540
I'll leave then.

308
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,820
Xingfu just made breakfast.

309
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,140
Remember to eat it later.

310
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,670
Mom, have you had breakfast?

311
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,780
Yes.

312
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,750
You left without breakfast. Where did you go?

313
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,860
I went for a walk.

314
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,270
Little Dou.

315
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,620
What is this?

316
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,620
Flower.

317
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,230
Flower.

318
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,990
Flower.

319
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,910
Does it smell nice?

320
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,910
It smells so good.

321
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,710
A red flower.

322
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,780
Flower!

323
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,580
Mom, I'm going upstairs.

324
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,750
What are you doing?

325
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,190
I'm packing for you.

326
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,750
You want me to leave already?

327
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,270
Let's do it now

328
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,820
and get it over with.

329
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,820
Pack these dates too then.

330
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,540
I love them.

331
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,190
Pack your things yourself then.

332
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,230
Why should I?

333
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,340
I'll have to put them back when I'm back.

334
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,230
What do you mean?

335
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,620
You would

336
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,510
return?

337
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,580
Qinglai,

338
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,950
I'm adamant and headstrong.

339
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,510
I don't think I will change,

340
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,620
nor do I want to change.

341
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,300
Since I decided to marry you,

342
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,380
you are my husband.

343
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,580
That will not change easily.

344
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,950
I can return here

345
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,620
for you

346
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,820
and for my child.

347
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,190
I'll accept it.

348
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,510
But Qinglai,

349
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,540
wherever I live,

350
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,100
I will not waste my life idling around.

351
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,270
I will move forward.

352
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,710
So make up your mind.

353
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,620
If chasing after me

354
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,710
is too exhausting

355
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,860
and you want a divorce,

356
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,540
it's fine by me.

357
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,510
I'll leave with Little Dou.

358
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,750
If you still want a life with me,

359
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,780
then you will have to

360
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,580
accept it too.

361
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:20,710
Then...

362
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,820
what about your city life?

363
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,470
I'll resign.

364
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,540
You mean

365
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,060
you'll come back here?

366
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,670
You won't work in the city?

367
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,060
Yes.

368
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,670
You would leave Guan Tao

369

371
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,190
Mr. Wan once told us

372
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,430
that if by venturing out,

373
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,230
we lost ourselves and our family,

374
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,190
it was not worth it.

375
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,950
I agree with him.

376
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,380

I'll buy new ones for you.

Yes.

Unfortunately,

385
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,710
the accommodation here is terrible.

386
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
If I can stay here longer,

387
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,750
I can take some touristic videos.

Sure.

Awesome.

My favorite

is the spring.

So?

404
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,750
Qinglai said he's too ashamed to return.

405
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,820
I decide to let him be.

406
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,950
We need another handyman then.

407

Not just a handyman.

416
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,470
and you're leaving too?

417
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,580
Didn't I say

418
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,140
that it could just be

419
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,430
Dongshan's excuse?

420
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,510
Either way, let's say

421
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,060
this is a human error.

422
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,230
It is Qinglai's.

423
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,780
Don't think otherwise, all right?

424

00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,500
and a responsibility.

528
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,020
I know where to focus.

529
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,370
My dream

530
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,850
is not achievable

531
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,170
only in a big metropolis.

532
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,890
It is already achievable back home

533
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,460
with my family.

534
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,570
So,

535
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,220
it's time for me to go back.

536
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,810
I see.

537
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,700
You have matured.

538
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,090
When you just arrived,

539
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,650
I wanted to help you

540
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,300
to expand your horizons.

541
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,740
But now that you have grown

542
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,460
and changed,

543
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,810
I realized

544
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,330
I prefer

545
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,810
the rural you.

546
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:09,730
All right.

547
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:13,980
Guan Tao.

548
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,250
Thank you.

549
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,170
My father passed away early.

550
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,460
Whenever something happened,

551
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,090
I had to deal with it as the eldest child.

552
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,340
And when something happened to me,

553
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,020
I could only rely on myself.

554
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,090
During those moments,

555
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,540
I longed

556
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,130
for an older brother.

557
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,570
Meeting you is a blessing.

558
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,980
You treat me kindly,

559
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,250
and I'll never forget

560
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,570
your kindness.

561
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,380
From now on,

562
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,730
I won't call you

563
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,690
Lawyer Guan

564
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,540
or Mr. Guan.

565
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,380
You'll be Guan.

566
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,380
Can I call you this?

567
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,820
Sure.

568
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,690
Whatever I say,

569
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,460
I can't dissuade you anyway.

570
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:01,940
So,

571
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,500
I just hope

572
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,500
that wherever you go,

573
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,420
you'll become

574
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,210
the best version of yourself.

575
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:12,980
Okay.

576
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:17,690
You know,

577
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,900
it's hilarious.

578
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,020
The other lawyer

579
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,420
was obviously ill-prepared.

580
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,020
He was stunned

581
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:25,940
by my questions.

582
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
And during the recess,

583
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,570
he was looking

584
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,500
so...

585
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,020
What's the matter?

586
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,610
Did something happen?

587
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,770
Can we take a photo together?

588
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,730
For memory's sake.

589
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:45,900
Come on.

590
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,730
Where?

591
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:49,770
A photo?

592
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,460
Underneath

593
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,570
the Fangyuan logo.

594
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,900
Around the front desk.

595
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,610
What's the matter, Xingfu?

596
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,820
You summoned me here in a hurry.

597
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,860
I haven't even had dinner.

598
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,980
I just had a bite.

599
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:32,820
Have some.

600
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,770
Thank you.

601
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,980
I'm starving.

602
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,060
Xingyun,

603
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,650
I'm going back.

604
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,210
I tendered my resignation letter today.

605
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,290
Once they find a new receptionist,

606
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,570
I'll head back to Wan Village.

607
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,250
What?

608
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,380
Why...

609
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,170
Why did you resign?

610
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,290
Are you crazy?

611
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,570
You started the business with Guan Tao.

612
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,420
It was so tough, but you persevered.

613
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,770
Now that it's getting better,

614
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,380
quitting is a huge loss.

615
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,130
Also, what are you going to do back home?

616
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,420
Have you thought about it?

617
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,900
I want to open an inn.

618
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,250
Xingyun,

619
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,980
I don't have enough money.

620
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,540
Can you lend me some?

621
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,060
What?

622
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,380
An inn?

623
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,090
Xingfu,

624
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,900
if you're going back to run an inn...

625
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:22,980
No,

626
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,090
I disagree.

627
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,980
You know what they said about inns?

628
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,690
They say it's how the villagers scam the money
out of the city people.

629
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,770
It has a bad rep.

630
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,250
Xingyun,

631
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,420
if I run my business with honesty,

632
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,420
no one will be scammed.

633
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,290
You just don't want to lend me money, do you?

634
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,540
That's not what I meant.

635
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:47,860
Xingfu,

636
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,500
you want me to help you.

637
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:50,770
Yes,

638
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,540
I do have a car

639
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,130
and a luxury handbag.

640
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,090
But to a certain extent, they are for my work.

641
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,130
I do not look as rich.

642
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,380
Also,

643
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,500
I don't have faith in this project of yours.

644
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,820
That's all.

645
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,860
I know you don't have it easy either.

646
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,860
Forget it, then.

647
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,420
Have your dinner.

648
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,290
But I...

649
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:24,730
Xingfu.

650
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,090
You know what?

651
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,060
I'll give you 10,000.

652
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,820
If you still need more for your living expenses,

653
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,570
I'll give you more.

654
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,570
No problem at all.

655
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,770
But if it's to start your inn business,

656
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,730
I won't help out.

657
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,420
Xingfu, think about it.

658
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,170
Your relationship with Wan Village
is strained enough.

659
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,500
If you want to open an inn,

660
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,290
you need to build one on their land.

661
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,380
You need water and electricity.

662
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,770
They will give you a hard time.

663
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,610
A dispute will break out sooner or later.

664
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,420
And when it does,

665
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,610
I represent them

666
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,460
and you are my sister.

667
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,380
I'm caught in the crossfire.

668
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,570
Proceed with impartiality.

669
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,090
If there's a conflict of interest

670
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,170
between Wan Village and me,

671
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,090
you do your job

672
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,460
and I do mine.

673
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,170
I shouldn't have told you this.

674
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,380
Xingfu,

675
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,170
I'll always remember

676
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,610
that I'm working hard for our family.

677
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,420
Do you still remember my promise?

678
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,420
I said

679
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
I would buy a big house in the city

680
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,730
where you and Mother can move in.

681
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,290
And then,

682
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,820
I'll marry someone rich.

683
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,500
No need.

684
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,090
I'll have my own house.

685
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:48,820
And don't

686
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,460
marry someone rich.

687
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,770
Rely on yourself.

688
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,170
-Xingfu.
-Enjoy.

689
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,540
What do you plan to do next?

690
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,420
I want to open an inn.

691
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,820
An inn?

692
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,540
In Niaofei Creek?

693
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,250
Yes.

694
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,650
The scenery there

695
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,570
is picturesque.

696
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,500
You see? Xingfu

697
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,210
is meant to be rich.

698
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,130
Xingfu,

699
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,420
do you have the money?

700
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,980
I have saved

701
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,540
more than 200,000 yuan.

702
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,820
That's a lot.

703
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,060
But it's not enough

704
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,610
to open an inn.

705
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:29,650
Right.

706
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,770
And you need to find your clients,

707
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,020
provide services,

708
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,770
and make it special.

709
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,290
It's not just about money.

710
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,250
It is about money.

711
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,730
To attract clients,

712
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,380
you put out ads.

713
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,540
For the services,

714
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,170
people need to be trained to use the software

715
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,570
and hardware needs to be bought.

716
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,770
They all need money.

717
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:48,940
Do you have any plans?

718
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,500
Tell us.

719
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,540
We can give you some ideas.

720
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,290
Exactly.

721
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,060
You see,

722
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,250
for the past two years,

723
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,340
I noticed many backpackers

724
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,290
and individual tourists

725
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,170
heading to my hometown.

726
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,940
It's because the village is quite close

727
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:00,730
to the city.

728
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,770
Around two hours of driving.

729
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,420
It's very accessible too,

730
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,860
perfect for a short stay during the holidays.

731
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,540
However, there isn't a proper inn.

732
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,210
I thought about it.

733
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,250
Other than winter,

734
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,170
people can visit during the rest of the year.

735
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,460
Let's be conservative.

736
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,500
Consider it open

737
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,610
for at least 200 days.

738
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,090
I don't want a big place.

739
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,420
Just a small one will do.

740
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,820
For its construction and renovation,

741
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:25,090
let's say I put in

742
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:25,980
two million yuan.

743
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,940
Then,

744
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,290
if six families visit,

745
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,170
one family will spend at least

746
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,460
400 yuan on food

747
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,420
and other expenditures.

748
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,770
One day, I'll earn at least 2,000.

749
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,130
And in a year, I'll earn

750
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,500
500,000 yuan.

751
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:39,820
It won't reach that number,

752
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,540
so let's put it

753
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,500
around 400,000 yuan.

754
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,060
Taking out the cost,

755
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,690
I can earn at least 200,000.

756
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:45,860
The cost can be recouped

757
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,650
in six to seven years.

758
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:47,820
And then,

759
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,610
it's pure profit.

760
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,980
Why a small one?

761
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,820
Build a big one.

762
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:53,820
In my opinion,

763
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,540
go big

764
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,540
or go home.

765
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,420
But if you want a big one,

766
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,770
her budget is only 200,000 yuan.

767
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,900
How should we find more money?

768
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,820
200,000 is definitely insufficient.

769
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,170
We can

770
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,290
try crowdfunding.

771
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,170
Crowdfunding?

772
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,420
You know that too?

773
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,060
When there's a will,

774
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,420
there's a way.

775
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,690
However,

776
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,980
the devil is in the details.

777
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,770
Think it through.

778
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,060
Sure.

779
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:25,940
Let's eat.

780
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,690
Let's not starve because of me.

781
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,770
Okay.

782
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,420
Let's eat.

783
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:30,860
It's boiling now.

784
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,460
Xingfu,

785
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,090
if you manage to open an inn,

786
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,250
the three of us

787
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,900
will be your first client, all right?

788
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,210
Of course.

789
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,340
I expect a discount.

790
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,860
Just that?

791
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,020
It'll be free.

792
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:43,730
Free?

793
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,860
Have some shame, at least.

794
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,170
Have some decency.

795
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,020
Come on.

796
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,210
Let's have a toast

797
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,210
to Businesswoman He here.

798
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:49,650
Come on.

799
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,210
Do take good care of us

800
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,940
when we visit.

801
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,380
Come on.

802
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,650
I wish you a prosperous

803
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:55,290
and profitable endeavor.

804
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,500
And I hope

805
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,460
your business will run smoothly.

806
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:57,980
Thank you.

807
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,610
Thanks.
