[Episode 36]

3
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,319
Don't just drink by yourself.

4
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,040
Drink by yourself.

5
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,000
I feel that something's off.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,959
Time to eat.

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,159
Have you finished your homework?

8
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,840
Not yet.

9
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,760
But I'm starving.

10
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,439
Even so, you have to finish your homework first.

11
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Let's head to the living room.

12
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Dad, you two can go ahead.

13
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,920
It's pretty tough for the kid, huh?

14
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,840
Anyway, I've told you

15
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,000
about the situation.

16
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,599
Is it impossible to make them drop their charges?

17
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,120
We've thought of everything we could.

18
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,079
Everyone else has dropped their charges

19
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,840
except for one family.

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,439
Have you spoken to the family yourself?

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I told Maoqin to approach them.

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,879
Initially, they said they would give it a thought.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,639
But now,

24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,240
they say they will see us in court.

25
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,080
That's strange.

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,599
How could they be sure

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,199
that the Wan Family was to be blamed for this?

28
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,719
I think

29
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,199
they just want to extort money from us.

30
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,520
It'd be simple

31
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,439
if that were the case.

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,240
We could just pay him.

33
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:41,599
If so,

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,840
why couldn't Maoqin handle him?

35
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,759
If not,

36
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,280
it might be because they
didn't take good care of their children.

37
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,319
They felt guilty

38
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,439
because of this incident.

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,719
They're using us as a scapegoat

40
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,120
so that they can feel better.

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,039
It wasn't that big of a deal initially.

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,879
How did it end up like this?

43
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,919
Now,

44
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,240
we have to go to court no matter what.

45
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,599
But you don't need to worry.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,120
We won't lose the case.

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,000
Even so, you can't deal with a case like that?

48
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,520
We have to become defendants again.
Does it sound nice to you?

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,719
Didn't you say you were going

50
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,199
to ask someone from the monitoring station

51
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,000
to assess our water quality?

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,680
Have you done so?

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,439
Yeah.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,680
The result is already out.

55
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,599
It passed every assessment.

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,439
This court case

57
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,759
is ridiculous.

58
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,800
Xiuyu,

59
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,680
look.

60
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,599
I took some pictures of you just now.

61
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,439
They're nice, right?

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,439
Let me post it on our website later.

63
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:15,840
Xingfu,

64
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:19,560
I finally straightened out my thoughts.

65
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:22,000
What do you mean?

66
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,759
I'll follow you home.

67
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,959
What did you say?

68
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:38,839
Hello?

69
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,879
Xingfu, it's me.

70
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,279
Are you free right now?

71
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,199
Yeah, go ahead.

72
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,040
There's a person named Li Chuanqiang

73
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,160
who's trying to sue
Wanjia Health Products Factory.

74
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,279
How did you hear about that?

75
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,120
They requested Guan Tao to represent them.

76
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,959
Coincidentally, I was interviewing his law firm.

77
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,480
Xingfu,

78
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,199
this would be huge

79
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,240
if it was true.

80
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,560
What's the factory's stand then?

81
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,839
Of course, they don't wish to go to court.

82
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,079
They firmly believed
that they were not in the wrong

83
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,360
and they didn't pollute the water source.

84
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,879
I got it.

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,439
If so, can you contact

86
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,600
the person in charge for me?

87
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,680
I wish to interview him.

88
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:20,879
Alright.

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,680
I'll ask him.

90
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,319
Thank you, Xingfu.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,680
Little Dou,

92
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,519
great job.

93
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:41,879
Here.

94
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,480
Use this.

95
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,199
We spent all of our lives raising our children.

96
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,480
Now, all of them have left the house.

97
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,639
Only the two of us are at home.

98
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,560
I stare at you, while you stare at me.

99
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,959
Our children have their own duties to fulfill.

100
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,800
That means our children are successful.

101
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,279
What else are you discontent about?

102
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,959
Just look at Xiuyu.

103
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,240
She moved to the hills
after returning from the city.

104
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,360
What's the point of raising a child?

105
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,800
If you do a bad job,
you'll be raising an enemy instead.

106
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,560
Dad, Mom,

107
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,759
Xiuyu and I are back.

108
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,120
Mom!

109
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,360
Mom!

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,079
You see.

111
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,800
Speak of the devil indeed.

112
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,480
You came back right after your mother
mentioned your name.

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,439
You still knew that this was your house, huh?

114
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,519
Have you eaten?

115
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,800
We have.

116
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:33,920
Xiuyu,

117
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,120
you should unpack your luggage
and clean your room first.

118
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,160
You can have a chat

119
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,399
with Mom later.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,319
You feel much better now, right?

121
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,480
It's all thanks to our daughter-in-law.

122
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,959
But of course.

123
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,040
I was the one who chose her.

124
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,800
Of course, she's excellent.

125
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,439
Dad, Mom,

126
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,639
Xiuyu was the one who said
she wanted to come back.

127
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,000
She might not say it out loud,

128
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,720
but she does miss you two.

129
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,199
Mom, I want to play outside.

130
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,120
Does my baby boy want to play outside?

131
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,079
I want to get my pinwheel.

132
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,439
I'll get it for you.

133
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,480
Be a good boy.

134
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,639
Don't run, okay?

135
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,879
Remember what I tell you. Don't hurt yourself.

136
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:24,879
Okay.

137
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,040
I'll bring

138
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,279
Little Dou outside.

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,639
You two can have a chat with Xiuyu.

140
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:31,600
Go now.

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,360
Mom,

142
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,160
hold my bag for me.

143
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,720
Be careful, okay?

144
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,240
♪My son has a big head and small palms♪

145
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,959
Are you heading to the fields?

146
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,519
Swing it with everything you have.

147
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,480
Xingfu.

148
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,600
Mr. Wan.

149
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,399
Little Dou.

150
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Your child is growing up fast, huh?

151
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,920
-Hello, Mr. Wan.
-He's running around now.

152
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,560
Hello.

153
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,639
Oh, yeah, here you go.

154
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,360
I have a piece of candy for you.

155
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,199
Say "thank you".

156
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:05,839
Thank you.

157
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,720
Where are you heading?

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,319
We're heading to the cultural square.

159
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,199
I'm heading there too.

160
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,800
Let's head there together.

161
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,000
Mr. Wan,

162
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,920
someone called Li Yancheng
from Shuiwei Village

163
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,879
wishes to press charges
against our health products factory.

164
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,160
You heard about that, right?

165
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,399
Yes.

166
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,079
The city's TV station
wishes to interview the person

167
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,279
in charge of our health products factory
regarding this matter.

168
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,720
So,

169
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,759
who do you think should go for the interview?

170
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,160
The TV station?

171
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,639
Why did they find you

172
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,920
instead of the factory?

173
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,360
The reporter is the girlfriend
of my brother-in-law.

174
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,560
She works for the TV station.

175
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:36,639
-Was that why you told them?
-She...

176
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,560
Xingfu,

177
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,839
this isn't something to be proud of.

178
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,080
Why should we appear on TV?

179
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,480
I beg to differ.

180
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,240
If our health products factory
did nothing wrong,

181
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,519
going to the court would be a great chance

182
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,080
to prove our innocence.

183
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
Why is it bad for us?

184
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,360
Xingfu,

185
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,960
you're still too naive.

186
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,799
Look at the Fushui River.

187
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,240
It may look

188
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,320
clear on the surface,

189
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,519
but you mustn't stir it.

190
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,519
When you stir it,

191
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,840
it'll become muddy.

192
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,080
It's because there's sludge down there.

193
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,879
If the water is clear,

194
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,120
it'll be clear no matter how you stir it.

195
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,120
Water that is too clear has few fish.

196
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,879
So, are you saying

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,480
that something's wrong
with the health products factory?

198
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,240
Look at what you're saying.

199
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,360
Of course, there's no problem.

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,679
Didn't you ask
the Environment Monitoring Station

201
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,639
to assess the water quality before?

202
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,159
Mr. Wan,

203
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,679
we cannot hide anything from you.

204
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,960
There's no need for you guys
to hide anything from me.

205
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:34,919
Mr. Wan,

206
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,600
I heard that the Group

207
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,600
spent a few million yuan in order to stop

208
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,759
Shuiwei Village
from pressing charges against us.

209
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,000
Why did you guys do so?

210
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,000
Why must you spend so much money

211
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,679
to reconcile with them

212
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,720
if there's nothing wrong
with the health products factory?

213
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,600
Who did you hear that from?

214
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,399
Chuanjia.

215
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,639
I didn't expect him to spend so much on it.

216
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,279
Xingfu,

217
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,080
it's like this.

218
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,000
Now, Wan Village is at a crucial moment

219
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,120
when we have to

220
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,720
win the national title

221
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,639
of Outstanding Entrepreneurial Village.

222
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,840
Having a court case

223
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,759
won't make us look good,

224
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,799
especially a water pollution case.

225
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,519
Rumors will spread

226
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,080
before

227
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,639
we have the time to prove our innocence.

228
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,799
Don't tell me you want to explain it
to every single person.

229
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,039
Am I right?

230
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,559
In my opinion,

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,159
it's best if we skip the court case.

232
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,840
Even if we do go for it,

233
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,559
we need to do it in secret

234
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,600
and we must win it.

235
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,639
I believe

236
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,720
we will surely win.

237
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,759
You know someone

238
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,840
from the TV station, right?

239
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,240
Just tell them

240
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,639
to forget about

241
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,000
the interview.

242
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,799
I'll make a move first.

243
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,559
Yancheng,

244
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,240
Madam,

245
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,120
we'll go to court tomorrow.

246
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,639
You guys must remember this.

247
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,639
You mustn't be nervous when you're in court.

248
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,799
Just answer whatever the judge asks you.

249
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,399
Just be honest

250
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,559
and tell them the truth.

251
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,120
Okay.

252
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,879
You guys mustn't be nervous

253
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
when their lawyer

254
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,120
is asking you too many questions

255
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,679
or trying to trick you.

256
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,240
We will interrupt them.

257
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,639
Okay.

258
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,639
By the way,

259
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,080
you guys must keep your emotions
under control too.

260
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,360
Try your best not to cry in court.

261
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,720
We're not there

262
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,639
to seek sympathy.

263
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,879
We're there to seek the truth

264
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,240
and justice.

265
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,120
However,

266
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,799
I can't stop myself

267
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:28,799
whenever

268
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,000
I think about my child. What should I do?

269
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,279
I guess we have no choice if you can't hold it in.

270
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
It's human nature to do so.

271
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,960
However, you mustn't lose control.

272
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,679
Meiqin,

273
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,720
are you done?

274
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,159
You better hurry. I'm ready.

275
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,399
Coming.

276
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,399
Qiang,

277
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,240
stop writing.

278
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,519
Pack your things. We're leaving.

279
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,440
Yancheng, check if the chicken coop is shut.

280
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,360
The chickens might escape

281
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,320
while we're gone.

282
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,919
Okay.

283
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,559
Qiang,

284
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,639
hurry and pack up your things.

285
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,720
I don't have time
to prepare breakfast for you today.

286
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,120
I've told Mr. Liu.

287
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
You will have breakfast at his house.

288
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,080
After that, you'll head to school
together with him.

289
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:05,960
Keep this.

290
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,639
Meiqin,

291
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,360
don't forget to give Qiang his medicine.

292
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,039
Don't forget.

293
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,320
I almost forgot.

294
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,720
Here.

295
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,559
Here.

296
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,960
Are you done?

297
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,200
Hurry up.

298
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,120
We still have to send our child

299
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,159
to Mr. Liu's house, you know?

300
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm done.

301
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,080
Let's go.

302
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:01,919
Dear,

303
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,279
are you heading to town today?

304
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,440
Yeah.

305
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,879
While you're there, head to the bookstore

306
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,080
and buy

307
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,840
some books

308
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,679
regarding how to run a cooperative, management,

309
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,039
and how to grow

310
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:15,679
crops.

311
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,960
Why can't you buy them yourself?

312
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,960
I need to head to Shuiwei Village.

313
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,840
I'm going to meet up with some farmers

314
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,000
who have land under their names.

315
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,679
I wish to check out their land.

316
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,279
After that, I'll discuss with them

317
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,759
whether they're willing to establish
a farmers' cooperative together with me.

318
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,000
The area of the river beach in Shuiwei Village

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,799
is pretty huge.

320
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,799
I wish to discuss it with Mr. Maoqin

321
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,240
and see if I can rent it for a low price

322
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,480
and modify it.

323
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,120
You're even targeting Shuiwei Village now?

324
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,200
Not bad, Wang Qinglai.

325
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,759
You're getting more and more ambitious.

326
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,960
Our villages

327
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,679
were combined into one major village, right?

328
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:51,600
What's the matter?

329
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,320
I was checking

330
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,519
if you looked like the president
of a cooperative.

331
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,440
Do I look like one?

332
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:05,559
You do.

333
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,559
You look exactly like one.

334
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,679
You like to tease me, don't you?

335
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,759
Alright, you should go now.

336
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,759
I'll make some preparations.

337
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:14,320
[People's Court]

338
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,039
(Li Chuanqiang)

339
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,240
(is pressing charges
against Wanjia Health Products Factory)

340
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,559
(for causing water pollution.)

341
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,679
(The case hereby begins.)

342
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,559
(The legal debate will start now.)

343
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,440
Dear presiding judge,

344
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,120
other judges,

345
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,440
people's assessors,

346
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,840
and civilians,

347
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,279
I'm Guan Tao from Fangyuan Law Firm.

348
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,000
I have accepted the request
of Li Yancheng and Xia Meiqin,

349
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,320
the parents of the plaintiff, Li Chuanqiang,

350
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,039
to become their legal representative

351
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,759
in this case.

352
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,639
Before today's hearing,

353
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,799
we've verified related evidence
in a serious manner

354
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,960
following a legal basis.

355
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,399
Through today's court investigation,

356
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,000
we've understood the situation
and nature of the case.

357
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,440
We will now express our opinion

358
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,200
according to the facts and law.

359
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,919
According to the water quality

360
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:54,960
assessment result shown

361
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,600
by the Environment Monitoring Station,

362
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,840
the water of the Fushui River was polluted.

363
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,039
They detected traces of heavy metal

364
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,159
and organic pollution.

365
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,919
These pollutants will cause harm
to the human body.

366
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,679
And these pollutants

367
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,320
were directly related to the actions

368
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,159
of Wanjia Health Products Factory.

369
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,159
According to the result of our investigation,

370
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,440
over the span of more than two years

371
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,279
after the health products factory
was built and put to use,

372
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,279
most of the children here

373
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,440
had fallen sick time and time again.

374
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,840
Shuiwei Village is located downstream
of the Fushui River.

375
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,279
Wan Village
is the only upstream village there is.

376
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,519
And their wastewater treatment plant
was built right beside the river.

377
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,159
Don't tell me

378
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,279
that was purely a coincidence?

379
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,759
After interviewing

380
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:35,720
some of the villagers,

381
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,960
we realized that it wasn't an exception.

382
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,480
Although the defendant has provided us

383
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,679
with the assessment report
of the Environment Monitoring Station,

384
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,679
according to the Interpretation
of the Supreme People's Court

385
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,759
[Presiding judge]
of Several Issues on the Application of Law

386
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,120
in the Trial of Disputes

387
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,919
over Liability for Environmental Torts,

388
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,919
according to Article 1,

389
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,159
for damage caused by environmental pollution,

390
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,840
a polluter shall bear tort liabilities
regardless of fault.

391
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,399
If the polluter claims no liability on the ground
that the discharge of pollutants

392
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,720
complies with national
or local pollutant discharge standards,

393
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
the people's court shall not support such a claim.

394
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,720
The river water of Shuiwei Village was polluted.

395
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,559
And the characteristics of its pollution

396
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,840
match the characteristics

397
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,399
of the pollutant released
by the health products factory.

398
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,039
For example,

399
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,000
both sources contained

400
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,519
lead,

401
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,440
arsenic,

402
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,000
organic pollutant, and so on.

403
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,480
If so, the health products factory

404
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,639
should bear legal responsibilities

405
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,759
for the pollution they had caused.

406
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,639
I couldn't find the books you requested
in the bookstore here.

407
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,480
I have to ask someone
to buy them for me in the city.

408
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:25,879
Alright.

409
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:26,919
I'll hang up for now.

410
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,990
Mr. Liu,

411
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,230
my stomach hurts.

412
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,390
I know.

413
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,580
Why hasn't the cab arrived yet?

414
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,750
I'll think of something.

415
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,870
Mr. Liu!

416
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:40,820
Xingfu?

417
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,750
What's the matter with him?

418
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,940
He has a stomachache.

419
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,390
We have to send him to the county hospital.

420
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:45,700
Alright.

421
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,630
I can send you guys there.

422
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,300
Alright. Let's hurry.

423
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,270
You'll be fine. Hang in there.

424
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,580
It hurts.

425
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,150
Here.

426
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,180
Be careful.

427
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,750
[Presiding judge]
Now, we will continue with the debate.

428
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,700
Defendant, you may express your opinion.

429
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,580
Regarding the plaintiff's charges,

430
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,470
we will express our opinion.

431
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,300
The plaintiff stated

432
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,030
that Li Chuanqiang

433
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,940
had been sent to the hospital

434
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,230
many times in the past two years

435
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,870
due to having a cold, fever,

436
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,230
stomachache, vomiting, and so on.

437
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,030
Thus, they suspect Li Chuanqiang

438
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,030
only got sick because the health products factory
polluted the river water

439
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,540
due to irresponsible waste treatment.

440
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,030
According to them,

441
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,910
it's because the wastewater treatment plant

442
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,140
was built upstream of the Fushui River

443
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,380
while Shuiwei Village
was located downstream of it.

444
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,540
We think that this argument is invalid.

445
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,270
Li Chuanqiang fell sick
because of his own health problem.

446
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,140
It has nothing to do

447
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,540
with Wanjia Health Products Factory.

448
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,375
[Plaintiff]

449
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,580
Qiang,

450
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,620
hang in there.

451
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,060
We'll reach the hospital soon.

452
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,300
Mr. Liu,

453
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,470
have you contacted his parents?

454
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,470
Not yet.

455
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,910
His father is Li Yancheng,

456
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
the one who was pressing charges
against the Wan Family.

457
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,820
He should be in court right now.

458
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,580
Is that so?

459
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,950
You will be alright.

460
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,620
You'll be fine after getting an IV drip later.

461
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,470
Qiang?

462
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,060
Qiang, wake up!

463
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,750
Don't fall asleep!

464
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,670
We'll reach the hospital soon!

465
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,380
Hurry!

466
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,270
I think the child fell unconscious.

467
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,380
We will emphasize this once again.

468
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,780
His sickness has nothing to do

469
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,910
with the health products factory.

470
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,380
There are many reasons why a child falls sick.

471
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,990
We cannot jump to conclusions

472
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,100
and think that his sickness
was caused by pollution.

473
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,710
There are three reasons.

474
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,340
First,

475
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,100
according to the medical history

476
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,230
of the child

477
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,670
that was retrieved by the court,

478
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,510
[Defendant]

479
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,340
it showed

480
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,670
that the child exhibited similar symptoms

481
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,270
even before the health products factory

482
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,030
was built.

483
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,230
Second,

484
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,620
the newest water quality assessment report

485
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,540
and its predecessors

486
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,340
have shown

487
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,340
that the factory's wastewater treatment standard
matches the standard determined by the nation.

488
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,270
Third,

489
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,540
although

490
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,380
there was a minute amount of harmful substances
in the wastewater they released,

491
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,230
according to the experts in the industry,

492
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,750
the volume wasn't high enough
to cause harm to the human body.

493
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,620
Doctor!

494
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,340
What's wrong?

495
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,380
The child fainted!

496
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,300
That's right. He had a stomachache.

497
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,300
Follow me to the ER!

498
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,340
Doctor!

499
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,750
Doctor, hurry! The child fainted!

500
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,430
Hurry!

501
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,780
What's the matter?

502
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,990
He fainted from a stomachache.

503
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,780
What's wrong with the child?

504
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,580
I don't know. It looks pretty serious.

505
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,780
Call the pediatrics department immediately.

506
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,540
Ask them to send a veteran here immediately.

507
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,190
A pediatric expert from the provincial capital

508
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:36,910
is holding a seminar here today.

509
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,340
Most doctors are attending the seminar.

510
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,750
Hurry and get them here!

511
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,190
Alright.

512
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,710
Next,

513
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,030
let's talk about

514
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,470
symptoms of Acute Gastroenteritis for kids.

515
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,380
These symptoms are...

516
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,470
Doctor!

517
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,270
Doctor!

518
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,540
Please save the child!

519
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,670
The child is inside the ER right now!

520
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,910
There's no pediatrician available!

521
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,540
Madam,

522
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,340
head to the outpatient department

523
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,270
and find the other doctors who are on duty.

524
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,860
Wang.

525
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,620
Doctor, please save the child.

526
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,820
His life is in danger.

527
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,910
Calm down.

528
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,780
Let's go and check it out.

529
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,780
Let's go.

530
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,190
Mr. Liu!

531
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,100
Here's our expert.

532
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:20,670
Doctor,

533
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,950
sorry for the trouble.

534
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,270
Did the child consume

535
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,910
anything dubious this morning?

536
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,510
This is Mr. Liu, his teacher.

537
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,270
I don't think so.

538
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,300
His parents

539
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,670
are attending a court hearing today.

540
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,230
They rushed to the city

541
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,270
after they sent him to me

542
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,140
without having breakfast.

543
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,300
At my place,

544
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,580
he had

545
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,340
a bowl

546
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,780
of porridge.

547
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,950
After that, he ate

548
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,380
a bun and some eggs.

549
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,470
Apart from those, I think

550
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,780
he took some preserved cucumbers.

551
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,430
If so,

552
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,470
has this child experienced

553
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,860
similar situations before this?

554
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,710
Yes, he has.

555
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:49,780
The child

556
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,230
kept having fevers and stomachaches
for the past two years.

557
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,270
Sometimes, he even experiences
headaches and vomits.

558
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,580
His parents suspected

559
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,780
that he fell sick
because Wanjia Health Products Factory

560
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,030
polluted the water source
with their wastewater.

561
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,820
That's why

562
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,510
they pressed charges against the factory.

563
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,710
They're attending the court hearing today.

564
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,910
Did other children

565
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,270
experience the same thing?

566
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,140
Yes.

567
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,750
There were quite a few of them.

568
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,750
They kept falling sick.

569
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,710
But not all of them had stomachaches.

570
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,990
Draw a blood sample

571
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,140
and check his blood lead level immediately.

572
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:19,860
Alright.

573
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,340
Over here.

574
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,950
That is all for today's court hearing.

575
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,100
We will announce the verdict another day.

576
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,270
The court will be adjourned for now.

577
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,950
[Plaintiff]

578
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,340
It's from Mr. Liu.

579
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,510
Hello?

580
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,620
Mr. Liu?

581
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,670
Just now, we were...

582
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,340
What?

583
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,380
Alright!

584
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,950
The court hearing has ended!

585
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,430
We'll rush there immediately!

586
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,030
What's the matter?

587
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,540
What's wrong?

588
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,100
Mr. Guan,

589
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,270
Mr. Liu called and told us

590
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,270
that Qiang's ailment

591
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,380
was acting up again.

592
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,910
They've already sent him to the hospital.

593
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,780
He's inside the ER right now!

594
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,300
Calm down for now.

595
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,190
I have a court hearing to attend this afternoon.

596
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,300
I'll ask Mr. Zhang to send you guys there.

597
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,190
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

598
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,340
Hurry!

599
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,270
What about you then?

600
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,510
I can hire a cab.

601
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,140
Alright.

602
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,300
Let's go.

603
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,140
Where is he?

604
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,950
Calm down.

605
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,580
Hello, miss.

606
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,750
Can you point us to the ER?

607
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,540
It's over there.

608
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,270
Thank you.

609
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,470
Calm down. Don't panic.

610
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,860
Okay.

611
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,030
Where is he?

612
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,670
Where is he?

613
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,060
Where's our child?

614
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,670
Qiang!

615
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:35,780
Yancheng,

616
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,990
will he be in danger?

617
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,750
He'll be fine.

618
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,580
Don't panic.

619
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,380
Calm down.

620
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,510
Call the teacher.

621
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,300
That's right.

622
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,710
Let me call Mr. Liu.

623
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,140
Don't panic.

624
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,540
Hello?

625
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,380
Hello, Mr. Liu?

626
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,140
Where are you guys? How's Qiang?

627
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,270
Don't worry.

628
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,140
Qiang pulled through.

629
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,580
He was just sent to the ward.

630
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,270
We're in Ward 302
of the internal medicine department.

631
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,620
Alright. Ward 302?

632
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,820
We'll head there immediately.

633
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,750
Qiang,

634
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,140
your parents will be here soon.

635
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,540
Doctor,

636
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,860
am I dying soon?

637
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,910
Will I no longer be able to attend school?

638
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,030
Child,

639
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,140
you mustn't say that.

640
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,540
You won't die from this.

641
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,470
Your stomachache

642
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,510
won't act up again

643
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,710
as long as you cooperate

644
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,060
with the doctors for your treatment.

645
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,860
Not only can you attend school,

646
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,860
but you will also become healthier.

647
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,300
I will do my best to cooperate with the doctors.

648
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,860
I want to be a doctor

649
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,230
when I grow up.

650
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,540
Good boy.

651
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,540
Dr. Fang,

652
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,270
your plane

653
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,100
will depart soon.

654
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,670
Your assistant is waiting for you downstairs.

655
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,750
Okay.

656
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,670
Boy,

657
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,780
close your eyes and take a nap.

658
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,100
I will go now.

659
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,230
Thank you, mister.

660
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,470
Goodbye, mister.

661
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,340
Goodbye.

662
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,860
Thank you.

663
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,140
Thank you so much.

664
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,710
Ms. He,

665
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,190
where's Qiang?

666
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,300
He's inside.

667
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:11,820
Okay!

668
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,270
Please go ahead.

669
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,510
Okay, I'll check on him.

670
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,950
Professor Fang,

671
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,470
we need to pick up the pace.

672
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,100
The airport is quite far away.

673
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,710
Alright.

674
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,340
Professor!

675
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,380
Professor,

676
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,430
I have a question.

677
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,990
Was it lead poisoning?

678
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,820
That's right.

679
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,950
According to the blood test result,

680
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,990
the lead content in his blood

681
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,340
was 320μg/L.

682
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,750
It's considered moderate lead poisoning.

683
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,580
Pass this message

684
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,750
to his parents.

685
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,990
Besides having the chelation therapy,

686
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,230
they can feed him some dried shrimps,

687
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,990
kelp, black fungus, soy products, and so on.

688
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,620
They can also feed him beef

689
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,100
if they can afford it.

690
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,140
Ask them

691
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:52,950
to feed him milk.

692
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,620
Alright, I got it.

693
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,860
Professor,

694
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,820
I have another question.

695
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,860
Why would he suffer

696
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,270
from lead poisoning all of a sudden?

697
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,190
I'm sorry.

698
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,190
Professor Fang has a flight to take.

699
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,430
We won't make it if you keep asking him.

700
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,140
If so, Professor,

701
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,270
can I have your contact number?

702
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:05,580
Sure.

703
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,910
It'll be easier for us to keep in touch this way.

704
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,430
Okay.

705
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,860
16801374255.

706
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,380
Call me

707
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,950
if you have any questions.

708
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,670
Okay.

709
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,300
Thank you.

710
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,140
Don't mention it.

711
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,470
Goodbye.

712
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,860
Be careful.

713
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,430
Thank you.

714
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,270
Liuhua, we have a guest.

715
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,540
Hello, welcome to Xingfu Inn.

716
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,710
Did you make a reservation?

717
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,620
Yes.

718
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,230
Let me assist you.

719
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,230
[Xingfu Inn]
Thank you.

720
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,710
No worries.

721
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,580
It's quite heavy.

722
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,100
It's fine.

723
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,780
Thank you.

724
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,620
Wait a minute!

725
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,030
What a coincidence!

726
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,470
I was planning to look for you.

727
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,620
Me?

728
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,710
That's right.

729
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,780
It's like this.

730
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,030
I'm Chu Yun.

731
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,540
What about you?

732
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,300
What's your name?

733
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,860
Xiuyu?

734
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,030
Xiuyu.

735
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:06,990
Hello.

736
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,990
You are?

737
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,340
I'm her sister-in-law.

738
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,670
She's also the owner of the inn.

739
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,990
The owner?

740
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,510
It's like this.

741
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,860
I'm a photographer.

742
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,950
I saw her pictures

743
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,270
on your website.

744
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,580
I thought it was great.

745
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
There's a melancholy

746
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,140
and quiet air about her

747
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,030
that I cannot put into words.

748
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,060
She's a perfect fit for the environment.

749
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,540
To be honest,

750
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,030
I used to do landscape photography.

751
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,380
Basically, I don't do human photography.

752
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,340
However, after I saw those pictures,

753
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,340
I thought

754
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,750
that my works

755
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,380
would be more touching and personal

756
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,030
if I added some people in them.

757
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,910
You have such great taste.

758
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,300
Xiuyu, what do you think?

759
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,910
I'm scared.

760
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,510
I haven't done this before.

761
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,710
There's nothing to be scared of.

762
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,750
Xiuyu is very photogenic.

763
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,270
Be more confident in yourself.

764
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,620
Even the photographer thinks it will work out.

765
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,710
Of course, you can do it.

766
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,430
I'm sure you can do it.

767
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,750
But let's make this clear first.

768
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,910
The pictures you took

769
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,380
should be provided to Xingfu Inn

770
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,300
and the village tourism cooperative

771
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,620
so that we could use them

772
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,990
for free.

773
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:03,820
Is that okay with you?

774
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,060
You're a businesswoman indeed.

775
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,430
If you do a good job at portraying her,

776
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,380
we'll be promoting your trade for you too

777
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,820
when we post them on our website.

778
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,620
It's a win-win situation.

779
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,710
Deal.

780
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,780
It's a deal then.

781
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,950
Just give it a try.

782
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,300
Xiuyu,

783
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,670
you rarely smile.

784
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,140
Why do you hate smiling?

785
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,300
There's nothing for me to smile at.

786
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,820
Shouldn't you be happy that you get to live

787
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,230
in such a gorgeous environment every day?

788
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,510
Xingfu Inn does live up to its name indeed.

789
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:47,950
Happy?

790
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,300
I don't feel happy at all.

791
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,230
It's only called Xingfu Inn

792
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,300
because my sister-in-law's name is He Xingfu.

793
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,540
Don't you feel happy here?

794
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,580
If I were in your shoes,

795
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,860
I would stay here forever.

796
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,990
I wish to explore the outside world.

797
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,670
What's the matter?

798
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,340
Are you unhappy about something?

799
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,990
I have nothing to be happy about.

800
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,950
I've been observing you

801
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,670
for the past few days.

802
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,030
It seems like you enjoy reading.

803
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,710
I assume you have good grades.

804
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,380
Your family isn't that poor.

805
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,300
Why didn't you attend university?

806
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,340
I did give it a try.

807
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,990
So,

808
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,580
did you fail the test then?

809
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,470
Ms. He.

810
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,820
Mr. Wang?

811
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,860
What are you doing here?

812
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,670
Here are your books.

813
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,670
We are in no rush.

814
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,580
You could have brought it here
when you happen to pass by.

815
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,820
You didn't need to deliver them to me personally.

816
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,430
I was heading to Yancheng's house anyway.

817
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,380
Is the verdict out?

818
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,910
No, not yet.

819
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,270
So,

820
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,510
how's his child?

821
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,510
Is he getting better?

822
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,030
Yeah. He was discharged.

823
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,750
Yancheng and his wife

824
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,510
plan to bring their child

825
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,950
and move into the city.

826
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,860
They plan to work there while helping

827
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,780
the child get the treatment he needs.

828
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,140
After our law firm

829
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,300
heard about it,

830
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,670
we gathered some donations

831
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,670
and I'm here to deliver them.

832
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,510
Guan Tao couldn't leave
because he had a court hearing.

833
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,380
That's why I'm here.

834
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,430
And I brought you the books.

835
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,510
Thank you.

836
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,340
Give me a second.

837
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:36,950
I'll donate to them too.

838
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,860
Let me tag along.

839
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,340
Okay.

840
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,540
Now that you guys are leaving,

841
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,950
I guess I have no one to talk to now.

842
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,510
We have no choice.

843
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,190
We can't just work for Wanjia Group.

844
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,860
We can sustain ourselves

845
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,820
by growing vegetables on our farm.

846
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,910
However, we don't make enough

847
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,990
to cover his treatment fee

848
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,670
and schooling fees.

849
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,860
But you guys are not familiar with the city.

850
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,140
How could you guys make a living over there?

851
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,710
There are plenty of opportunities there.

852
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,030
Just look at He Xingfu.

853
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,620
She became so successful

854
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,860
after she returned from the city.

855
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,300
Only 1 in 100 people

856
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,230
will make it big like He Xingfu.

857
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,030
We're just ordinary villagers.

858
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,820
How could we compare ourselves to her?

859
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,510
We have the same number of limbs.

860
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,060
Compared with her, I guess

861
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,430
we're only lacking

862
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,510
in the bravery department.

863
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,780
We don't dare to stand up for ourselves.

864
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,140
Ms. He, Mr. Wang,

865
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:35,750
over here.

866
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,470
Here's my house.

867
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,230
Here, please come in.

868
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,030
Meiqin.

869
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,270
Meiqin,

870
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,140
look who's here.

871
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,910
Coming.

872
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,140
Ms. He?

873
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,140
Mr. Wang? What are you guys doing here?

874
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,860
We're here to visit your child.

875
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,540
This is?

876
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,820
This is our neighbor, Madam Guo.

877
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,470
You've seen Mr. Wang before, right?

878
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,190
I have.

879
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,580
This is Ms. He, the manager I've mentioned before.

880
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,340
Nice to meet you.

881
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,300
So, you're Ms. He?

882
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,340
I heard about you long ago.

883
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,060
Am I that famous?

884
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,380
Ms. He,

885
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,300
we were lucky that you were there
to send our child to the hospital.

886
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,380
The doctor said the situation

887
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,950
might be different
if we were later even by a moment.

888
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,270
You see,

889
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,580
we haven't gotten the chance

890
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,670
to thank you in person yet.

891
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,380
I didn't expect you to visit us instead.

892
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,780
Why are you being so courteous?

893
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,670
Anyone else would've done the same.

894
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:27,820
So,

895
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,430
I'll make a move first.

896
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,340
You guys can continue.

897
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,540
Take care, Madam Guo.

898
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,380
Qiang.

899
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,100
Qiang, come here.

900
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,910
Hurry.

901
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,190
This lady over here

902
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:36,950
was the person

903
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,670
who drove you to the hospital that day.

904
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,750
She even got a pediatric expert to treat you.

905
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,380
She's your savior.

906
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,580
Hurry and bow to her.

907
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,300
Show your gratitude.

908
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,100
No need for that.

909
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,340
It's...

910
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,910
It's my duty.

911
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,750
Yeah.

912
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,820
What a sensible boy.

913
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:50,950
By the way,

914
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,910
what did the doctor say?

915
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,910
How did he get poisoned?

916
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,620
We had inquired about it.

917
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,710
The doctor said

918
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,750
it was called...

919
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,230
Lead poisoning.

920
00:31:59,380 --> 00:31:59,950
That's right.

921
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,540
He said there are many reasons
for lead poisoning.

922
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,470
He told us

923
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,230
to look for the source

924
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,060
to prevent further poisoning.

925
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,990
But we had no idea

926
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,270
what the source was.

927
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,270
That's why

928
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,140
we planned to leave the village

929
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,510
and have a change of environment.

930
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,510
Oh, yeah,

931
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,540
you guys are moving into the city, right?

932
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,710
You guys should take the money.

933
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,780
-This won't do!
-This won't do!

934
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,470
And this

935
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,190
is the donation

936
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,430
from the entire law firm.

937
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,100
You mustn't do this!

938
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,300
Ms. He, listen to me.

939
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,230
You already brought my child to the hospital
for his treatment.

940
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,380
And your law firm took on our case for free.

941
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,510
We haven't thanked you guys yet.

942
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,340
How could we take your money now?

943
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,230
This won't do!

944
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,230
Yancheng,

945
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,100
Meiqin,

946
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,190
just take the money.

947
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,430
You guys need some time

948
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,710
to get a job in the city.

949
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,140
You have to spend money on a lot of things.

950
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,620
But...

951
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,100
Besides, your child is still sick.

952
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,910
You guys should keep the money.

953
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,470
Yeah.

954
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,100
Keep the money.

955
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:48,950
This...

956
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,850
You guys are kind indeed.

957
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,940
We don't know how to repay you all.

958
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,500
Forget about repaying the favor.

959
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,220
We'll be happy

960
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,410
as long as he can recover from his sickness.

961
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,370
Thank you!

962
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,220
Thank you, madam!

963
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,940
Thank you, Ms. He!

964
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,500
Thank you!

965
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,020
Thank you, Mr. Wang!

966
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,570
Don't mention it.

967
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:21,810
Come in.

968
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,220
Mr. Wan.

969
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,610
Mo.

970
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,980
Do you have any good news for me?

971
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,130
Have a seat first.

972
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,700
The verdict is out.

973
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,700
We won the case.

974
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,650
This is great!

975
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,700
I knew we would definitely win.

976
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,090
Initially,

977
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,500
they just wanted to take advantage
of rich people like us.

978
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,540
But now,

979
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,810
not only did they not get their way,

980
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,130
but the others could not get their ways either.

981
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,780
I guess

982
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,810
this matter is finally resolved.

983
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:48,940
Next,

984
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,540
we have to focus on

985
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,300
our sales performance.

986
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,980
It's almost the end of the year now.

987
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:53,980
We need to put in extra effort

988
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,500
during the Double 11
and Double 12 shopping festivals.

989
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,610
We need to do our best,

990
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,020
improve our sales performance,

991
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,370
and win the title
of Outstanding Entrepreneurial Village.

992
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,740
By then, we can have a jolly new year.

993
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,890
Don't worry, Mr. Wan.

994
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,540
I've already made arrangements for that.

995
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,780
If there's nothing else, I'll resume my work.

996
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,850
Wait a minute.

997
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:12,890
Why the rush?

998
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,090
You just sat down.

999
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,940
Did you check out the official website

1000
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,060
of the tourism cooperative?

1001
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,020
I didn't.

1002
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:22,860
What's the matter?

1003
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,460
I don't know

1004
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,420
where they got a photographer,

1005
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,860
but the pictures

1006
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,130
on the website

1007
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,980
were pretty good.

1008
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,060
Look.

1009
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,540
Xiuyu does look pretty

1010
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,210
if she puts on makeup

1011
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,500
and dolls herself up.

1012
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,020
Yeah.

1013
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,900
Their website

1014
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,860
is pretty popular now.

1015
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,130
Xiuyu is almost an influencer now.

1016
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:43,690
Really?

1017
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,650
There were so many comments about it.

1018
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,500
Look.

1019
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,090
She's too gorgeous.

1020
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,980
I'm going to head to Wan Village because of her.

1021
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:49,980
And this.

1022
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,340
You see?

1023
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,090
She's so beautiful.

1024
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,210
Mom, I'm in love.

1025
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,130
So,

1026
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:53,860
what are you up to?

1027
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,820
Did you fall for her too?

1028
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,340
You should beware of your wife.

1029
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,610
What nonsense are you saying?

1030
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,540
I didn't say that.

1031
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,730
Many of our subordinates are saying

1032
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,650
that you have a crush on Xiuyu.

1033
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:09,770
Were they speaking the truth?

1034
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,820
Nonsense.

1035
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,340
Who said that?

1036
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,900
Sack them if they say that again.

1037
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,460
Actually, I didn't believe them.

1038
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:17,860
However,

1039
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,340
I do think you two

1040
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,380
have a peculiar relationship.

1041
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,380
Xiuyu and I...

1042
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,020
I don't need to explain myself to you.

1043
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,860
Do you have too much free time?

1044
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,540
If so,

1045
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,980
you should focus on
improving the sales performance.

1046
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,500
How dare you say that?

1047
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,170
Who do you think you are?

1048
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:37,730
Oh, come on.

1049
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,210
I was just joking. Stop reprimanding me.

1050
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,570
I've already thought about
how to improve our sales.

1051
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,170
I've always been thinking about it.

1052
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,170
Really?

1053
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,290
What solution have you come up with then?

1054
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:48,730
By the way,

1055
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,610
the publicity department

1056
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,090
just handed

1057
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,610
an advertising proposal to us.

1058
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,210
They said they needed a female model.

1059
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,610
I've heard about it.

1060
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,940
Have they found the female model?

1061
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,290
They haven't found a suitable one yet.

1062
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,650
Look at how inefficient they are.

1063
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,290
Wait.

1064
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,090
In my opinion, I think
Xiuyu is a suitable candidate.

1065
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,690
Do you truly think

1066
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,860
Xiuyu is a suitable candidate?

1067
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
Of course.

1068
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,420
She'll be up to the task

1069
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,500
as long as you agree to it.

1070
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:22,860
What about this?

1071
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,250
I think we should pick Xiuyu.

1072
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,570
We can save ourselves some money too.

1073
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,690
What are you saying?

1074
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,650
Mr. Mo, if you

1075
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,290
also think

1076
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,500
that Xiuyu is a suitable candidate,

1077
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,090
why don't we let her give it a try?

1078
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:35,820
If so, Mr. Wan,

1079
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,860
you need to tell Xiuyu about this beforehand.

1080
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,210
After all, she worked under you before.

1081
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,540
It's easier if you approach her.

1082
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:42,730
What do you mean by that?

1083
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,210
Are you assigning tasks to me now?

1084
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,460
Do your job and don't try to skive.

1085
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,500
Alright.

1086
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,170
If there's nothing else, I'll make a move first.

1087
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,380
I still have a client to entertain.

1088
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,290
Alright. Go ahead.

1089
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,860
People are born...

1090
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,250
People are born...

1091
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,090
Good-natured.

1092
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,500
Good-natured.

1093
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,690
Their characters are similar...

1094
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,060
Their characters are similar...

1095
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,690
But develop differently.

1096
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,130
But develop differently.

1097
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,940
Where did you go? It's pretty late now.

1098
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,340
Managing a business is so complicated.

1099
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,540
It's much more complicated than planting crops.

1100
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,690
Planting crops is way easier.

1101
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,250
Here.

1102
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:24,820
Hold the pen.

1103
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,460
I think...

1104
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,060
You can draw by yourself.

1105
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,420
I think I'll return to planting crops.

1106
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,900
I'll give up on the cooperative.

1107
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,900
What's wrong again?

1108
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:33,860
You see,

1109
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,380
when you plant crops,

1110
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,130
you only need to focus on one thing.

1111
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,770
It's fine as long as the crops grow well.

1112
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,500
It's my problem if they don't grow well.

1113
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,250
I just need to compete with myself.

1114
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,250
But now,

1115
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,860
I'm facing all kinds of issues.

1116
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,290
First, there are issues with the capital.

1117
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,900
After that, you need to think about

1118
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,650
the cooperative programs,

1119
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,860
distribution plans

1120
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,690
and so on.

1121
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,860
You can't just do whatever you want.

1122
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,570
My brain

1123
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,610
is overwhelmed

1124
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,730
by all those different opinions.

1125
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,020
What about this?

1126
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,210
You shouldn't just focus on those farmers.

1127
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,570
You can discuss this with Cai too.

1128
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,500
You can let him join you

1129
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,210
and persuade the supermarkets
to participate in the cooperative.

1130
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,060
You can even find Mr. Wan and Chuanjia

1131
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,380
and try to ask them
if the Group can be your guarantor

1132
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,860
for a bank loan.

1133
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:24,570
Dear,

1134
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,770
you're amazing indeed.

1135
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,380
You provided me with so many solutions
in just a second.

1136
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:30,820
Why don't you

1137
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,340
become our president?

1138
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,650
Just you wish. I won't do it.

1139
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,690
But I love you.

1140
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,130
Is that not enough?

1141
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,290
What did you say?

1142
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,610
I love you.

1143
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,540
Are you happy now?

1144
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,170
Don't force yourself.

1145
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,250
I'm not forcing myself.

1146
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:53,980
I'm serious.

1147
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,860
I don't want to become the president.

1148
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,090
I just want to support you behind your back.

1149
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,340
If so,

1150
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,770
do you think I can do it?

1151
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,020
How would you know when you haven't tried it yet?

1152
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,610
Of course, you can.

1153
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:11,690
Alright then.

1154
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,500
I'll be the president.

1155
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:19,650
Qinglai.

1156
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,420
Qinglai.

1157
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,540
Hello.

1158
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,460
Mr. Wan.

1159
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,130
You scared me.

1160
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:33,690
Goodness.

1161
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,980
Do you need anything?

1162
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,170
Mr. Wan,

1163
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,770
are you heading to work?

1164
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,380
I have an appointment with someone

1165
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,170
in the company.

1166
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,090
What's the matter?

1167
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:41,770
Mr. Wan,

1168
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,090
can the village

1169
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,290
support me

1170
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,290
in establishing another cooperative?

1171
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,020
It's a farming cooperative.

1172
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,210
It's just like

1173
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,060
the tourism cooperative

1174
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,860
established by Xingfu.

1175
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,460
So, it's a vegetable farming cooperative?

1176
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,570
It's more than just vegetables.

1177
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,860
Flowers

1178
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:56,900
and fruits are also included.

1179
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,060
You're the perfect fit

1180
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,650
for something like this in Wan Village.

1181
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,250
Lately, I've been making

1182
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,770
trips to the hills.

1183
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,290
I've persuaded over 10 farmers

1184
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,900
who had vacant lands to join me.

1185
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,730
I can teach them

1186
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,420
how to build

1187
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,020
greenhouses and grow organic vegetables.

1188
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,130
Next, I'll expand it to growing flowers

1189
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,340
and strawberries.

1190
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,060
They said

1191
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,820
they were willing to join me.

1192
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:18,900
It sounds pretty good.

1193
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,250
What about the sales then?

1194
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:20,690
You...

1195
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:21,460
You

1196
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,500
have to sell your produces somehow.

1197
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,060
I have my own means.

1198
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,460
Cai, the person

1199
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,900
who wanted to work together with me before,

1200
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,170
came looking for me again.

1201
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,210
He negotiated a deal with four supermarkets.

1202
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,170
And all four of them were willing

1203
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,130
to set up special counters
for our organic vegetables.

1204
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,060
Oh,

1205
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,170
this is great.

1206
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,090
I was still fretting about this.

1207
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,900
I was wondering how I could help
Shuiwei Village develop

1208
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,420
after they were merged into our village.

1209
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,770
We have excess manpower.

1210
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,730
The Group alone can't employ all of them.

1211
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,540
The factory doesn't require
that many workers either.

1212
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,650
This is a great idea.

1213
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,290
Not only do you need manpower to grow crops,

1214
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,540
but you will also need it for the packaging,

1215
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,690
organizing, transporting,

1216
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,730
and so on.

1217
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,650
Alright.

1218
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:55,690
I support your idea.

1219
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,020
Qinglai, just tell me

1220
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,860
if you need anything.

1221
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,020
The Group will support you too.

1222
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,250
Every other issue

1223
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,340
is easy to solve.

1224
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,570
The only issue here

1225
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,130
is the initial funding.

1226
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,290
Qinglai, you're making things
difficult for me here.

1227
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,210
The budget of the Group

1228
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,130
was planned in advance.

1229
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,500
How could I fork out the sum

1230
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,540
when you didn't tell me earlier?

1231
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,980
We don't need the Group to fork out the sum.

1232
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,170
We just need the Group to be our guarantor.

1233
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,460
And then we can approach the bank

1234
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,250
and request a loan.

1235
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,820
I'm sure this was Xingfu's idea.

1236
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,380
If I must say,

1237
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,020
your family is truly lucky

1238
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,130
to get a daughter-in-law like her.

1239
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,570
My parents said the same thing.

1240
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,820
Alright then. Let's go.

1241
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,980
You can follow me to the Group.

1242
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,210
You can talk to Chuanjia about it.

1243
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:37,500
Mr. Wan,

1244
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,460
it's fine as long as you agree to it, right?

1245
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,500
You just need to notify Chuanjia

1246
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,380
and everything will be fine, right?

1247
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,060
That won't do.

1248
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,570
Chuanjia is the GM of the group.

1249
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,420
This is under his jurisdiction.

1250
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,210
I cannot interfere with too many things.

1251
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:49,900
Let's go.

1252
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:54,940
Mr. Wan,

1253
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,940
you're maligning me here.

1254
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,020
Initially, I told the publicity department

1255
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,940
to approach Xiuyu.

1256
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,690
But the deal fell through.

1257
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,340
That's why I approached her personally.

1258
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,730
You approached her personally?

1259
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,820
What did she say then?

1260
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
She said nothing.

1261
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,770
She stood up and left

1262
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,170
when I mentioned your name.

1263
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,210
For some reason,

1264
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,650
I think Xiuyu

1265
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,540
holds a deep grudge against you.

1266
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:23,820
Fine then.

1267
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:24,610
Just forget it.

1268
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:25,940
I'll find

1269
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,020
a female model outside.

1270
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,250
This isn't even an issue.

1271
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,130
We just need to spend some money.

1272
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:30,900
Nonsense.

1273
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,250
How could it achieve the same effect?

1274
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,650
You guys can't even complete
a minor task like this.

1275
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,940
Useless fools.

1276
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:38,770
Mr. Wan.

1277
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:39,980
Chuanjia,

1278
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,420
Qinglai wishes to establish
a vegetable farming cooperative.

1279
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,130
He told me about his idea.

1280
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,460
I think it's viable.

1281
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,980
You two can discuss it in detail.

1282
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:46,900
I still have a guest to entertain.

1283
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,090
You guys can go ahead.

1284
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:48,900
Thank you, Mr. Wan.

1285
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,460
Don't mention it.

1286
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,170
Why are you still standing there?

1287
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
Resume your work.

1288
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,060
I'll go ahead then?

1289
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,860
Just go already.

1290
00:42:59,420 --> 00:42:59,980
Have a seat.

1291
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,130
Let's sit down and talk.

1292
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,130
Chuanjia.

1293
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,060
So...

1294
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,250
Just stop for a second there.

1295
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,610
Now, I hope you can do me a small favor.

1296
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,130
I'll give you my full support

1297
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,380
no matter what you want to do

1298
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,650
as long as you do me that favor,

1299
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:18,130
okay?
