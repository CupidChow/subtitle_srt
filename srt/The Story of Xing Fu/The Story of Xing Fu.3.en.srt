[The Story of Xing Fu]

2
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,950
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,760
Xingfu?

4
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,799
Your luggage for tomorrow's trip is packed.

5
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,280
Would you like to check it?

6
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,840
Never mind.

7
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,920
I'll carry whatever you pack.

8
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,799
Qinglai, you should check it.

9
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,319
Go on.

10
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,759
I know you're upset because I lied to you.

11
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,719
I couldn't

12
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,960
come up with a better idea.

13
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,759
There is this saying,

14
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,080
"Losing is a blessing."

15
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,000
When I first came here,

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,680
I wanted to voice my objection as well.

17
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,120
But I realized the error of my way over time.

18
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,680
Why has the saying

19
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
been passed down for generations?

20
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,240
It's because it makes sense.

21
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,479
I don't get it.

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,439
How is it making any sense?

23
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,319
Why do the elders tell us that saying?

24
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,199
It's because

25
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,599
we can't overcome the big problems
unless we overcome the small problems.

26
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,680
With experience, you won't be taken advantage of.

27
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,759
The matter

28
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,759
was brought to light.

29
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,800
He wouldn't care.

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,639
After all, he's the secretary.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,680
You may have won this time,

32
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,840
but he will

33
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,080
have a million ways

34
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,439
to give us a hard time.

35
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,360
When that happens,

36
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,439
our family

37
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,560
will live in fear of his threat.

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
That will be miserable.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,719
Mom, I don't get it.

40
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,240
Why are you afraid

41
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,599
of something that hasn't happened?

42
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,560
Maybe Wan Chuanjia

43
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,680
has learned from his mistake.

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,639
Maybe he won't

45
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,080
be such a scoundrel from now on.

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,240
You are...

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,960
Fine.

48
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,680
Xingfu,

49
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,599
perhaps I was too paranoid.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,120
Look, you are going back
to your mother's tomorrow.

51
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,360
Ask your sister

52
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,759
and find out what she thinks.

53
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,800
Okay?

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,759
Whatever the case is,

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,719
she is the victim of this matter.

56
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,039
Right?

57
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,520
Fine.

58
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,719
I'll ask my sister.

59
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,599
Your father had passed away,

60
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,439
so I didn't pack any cigarettes or alcohol.

61
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
As for the tonics,

62
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,439
these are gifts for your mother.

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,120
Thank you, Mom.

64
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,720
Youde,

65
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,399
go to the backyard and bring us

66
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,920
the preserved pork trotter.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,920
Hurry up.

68
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,360
Everyone feels like a stranger in this family.

69
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,120
When will this ever end?

70
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,040
Enough ranting.

71
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:47,879
Well,

72
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,439
send your mother my regard.

73
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:52,839
Xiuyu?

74
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,040
Why are you back?

75
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,000
What about work?

76
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,720
Your sister-in-law is going back to her mother's.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,920
Hey! Are you listening?

78
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,680
What's wrong now?

79
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,720
What's gotten into her?

80
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Leave her be.

81
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,800
She's too spoiled.

82
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:05,720
Take it.

83
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,240
Drive safely, Qinglai.

84
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,519
Mind the trucks.

85
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,319
We're going.

86
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,519
Okay, go on.

87
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,160
See you.

88
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,120
Hurry up.

89
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,920
Send my regard to your mother!

90
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,959
Bye, Xingfu!

91
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,279
Bye, Qinglai!

92
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,560
Ride safely, Qinglai!

93
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,839
Stay safe!

94
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,800
Qingzhi.

95
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,879
Your brother is now married.

96
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,079
It's your turn next.

97
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,720
Look,

98
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,480
there are plenty of pretty girls in the city.

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,759
Don't you find any of them attractive?

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,879
If you ever meet one,

101
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,199
inform me beforehand.

102
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,519
I'll get things ready for you.

103
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,920
There is one girl.

104
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,720
There is?

105
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,680
A girl from the city?

106
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,079
Her name is Yani.

107
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,879
She lives in the city, like me.

108
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,560
Qingzhi,

109
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,600
is she a local of the city,

110
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,279
or did she move into the city?

111
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,759
She's from the city.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,839
You should let us meet her.

113
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,399
Mom,

114
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,240
it's too soon for that.

115
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,519
What's so good about a girl from the city?

116
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,079
It's too costly to marry one.

117
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,839
Nonsense.

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,160
Don't listen to your father.

119
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,519
He only cares about his money.

120
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,199
Thankfully, he's flat broke.

121
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,399
If he was rich,

122
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,600
he wouldn't have gotten married.

123
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,120
He'd be married to his money.

124
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,480
Mom,

125
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,240
you have no idea.

126
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
The living cost in the city

127
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,120
is much higher than here.

128
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,639
Yani and I are in love,

129
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,480
but the pressure is too great.

130
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,680
Don't worry about that.

131
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,759
We used some of the savings

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,839
on your brother's wedding.

133
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,920
Your sister contributed around 30,000 yuan.

134
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,439
For your wedding,

135
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,319
we could ask her for the money.

136
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,399
I can't do that to her.

137
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,240
It's alright.

138
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,600
I know where she hides

139
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,759
her money.

140
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,279
When you see Xingyun,

141
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,759
don't bring the matter up.

142
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Let's not make it worse.

143
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,120
My eyes hurt because of the pepper!

144
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Stop rubbing it.

145
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,319
Wash it off with some cool water.

146
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,639
Hurry up, go.

147
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,879
He can't do any chores right.

148
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,480
What are you doing, Xiuyu?

149
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,439
What's the luggage for?

150
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,920
What is this about?

151
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,360
I'm going to the city for work.

152
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,480
But you're doing just fine here!

153
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,879
"Just fine?"

154
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,800
Of course you'd think that.

155
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,240
No one ever cares about me here.

156
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,560
What is going on now?

157
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,319
Qinglai got married and held a wedding.

158
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,920
I gave you the money as you asked.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
And now you're worried about Qingzhi's wedding.

160
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,519
Does any of you even care about me?

161
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,639
Am I your daughter or not?

162
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,560
Qingzhi,

163
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,120
all my money went into Qinglai's wedding.

164
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,040
I have none left.

165
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,120
You won't get anything from me.

166
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,639
I'm not after your money.

167
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,240
Tell me,

168
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,800
your brothers are your family.

169
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,879
Don't get so petty over some money.

170
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,439
You're embarrassing yourself.

171
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,519
Go back into the house.

172
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,279
Xiuyu, what's wrong?

173
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,519
What is it?

174
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,839
I was fired.

175
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't work

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,160
in the office anymore.

177
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,680
I lost my job.

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,959
What did you do wrong?

179
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:40,679
Why were you fired?

180
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,200
I did nothing wrong.

181
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,799
When I arrived at the office this morning,

182
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,039
Xuemei told me

183
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
I was fired from the job.

184
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,159
But why?

185
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,399
Did she really say that?

186
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,039
She could at least tell you the reason!

187
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,960
Why would she fire you?

188
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,879
It's because Xingfu hurt Chuanjia,

189
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,840
am I right?

190
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,799
What else could it be?

191
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,480
The whole company thinks

192
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,240
Xingfu is going

193
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,639
to have a lawsuit with Chuanjia.

194
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,360
I knew it.

195
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,600
He has the power and influence,

196
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,440
so now he can have a million excuses
to make us suffer.

197
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,000
I get it now.

198
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,279
As long as she's here,

199
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,360
I'll only live in misery.

200
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,879
I might as well go to the city.

201
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,799
Out of sight, out of mind.

202
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,039
Stop!

203
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,919
Xiuyu.

204
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,919
The undergraduates in the city

205
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,759
don't even make as much as you do here.

206
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,320
It's always about money.

207
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,519
All you care about is money.

208
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,720
Do you know what they say about me?

209
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,399
They say I was in an affair with Chuanjia,

210
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,799
and they think that was how I got the job.

211
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,240
I studied accounting

212
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,159
because I wanted to shut those people up

213
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,960
with my own strength.

214
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,960
But look at what happened.

215
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,639
Xingfu rubbed Chuanjia the wrong way,

216
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,039
and I can't even work in the office anymore.

217
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,799
Why should I stay here

218
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,480
and get myself embarrassed?

219
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,039
Xiuyu!

220
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,200
Xiuyu!

221
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,799
I don't think Mr. Wan

222
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,759
would be so vindictive

223
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,799
and petty.

224
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,399
If he was,

225
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,639
I'd reason with him.

226
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,240
Trust me.

227
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,159
We should talk this through.

228
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,399
That's right.

229
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,840
Come on, get back.

230
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,639
Back to the house.

231
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,480
We'll discuss it inside.

232
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,159
Xingfu, you're back?

233
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,320
Alright.

234
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,240
Mom?

235
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,039
Mom.

236
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:28,639
Xingfu.

237
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,279
I'm home.

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,879
Where is Xingyun?

239
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,000
She's taking a shower.

240
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,080
She has taken three showers a day
ever since she came back.

241
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,840
You should check on her.

242
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,600
Sure.

243
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,759
I'll go check on her.

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,919
Xingyun?

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,799
Xingyun?

246
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm home.

247
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,240
Xingyun?

248
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,360
Mom.

249
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,600
Mom.

250
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,120
I brought some gifts.

251
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,879
You don't need to bring us

252
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,200
any gifts.

253
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
It's too wasteful.

254
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,120
We prepared these before the wedding.

255
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,480
It's been a long ride.

256
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
I'll get you some water.

257
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,279
It's fine, Mom.

258
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,399
I'm not thirsty.

259
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,480
Well...

260
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,960
Xingyun...

261
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,039
Is she

262
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,639
alright?

263
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,519
How can she be alright?

264
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,120
She wouldn't eat anything

265
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,000
unless I beg her.

266
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,879
Her boyfriend is just as unbelievable.

267
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,279
He keeps calling her

268
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,519
and asks if the guy molested her

269
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,639
or saw anything.

270
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,720
It's hard for Xingyun to bring this up again.

271
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,919
It's...

272
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,679
It's all because Chuanjia

273
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,320
was wedding-hazing.

274
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,159
It is.

275
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,879
It's your fault too.

276
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,200
You are her brother-in-law.

277
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,879
Why didn't you stop him?

278
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,519
You could have stopped him.

279
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,480
Back then...

280
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,000
Back then...

281
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,279
Mom, the gifts.

282
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,559
Fine, enough about that.

283
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,519
I'll make dinner.

284
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
How did you get these marks?

285
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,039
Whatever happens,

286
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,559
don't hurt yourself.

287
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,960
Xingfu,

288
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,200
do you smell that stench on me?

289
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,559
What stench?

290
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,519
You smell great.

291
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,679
You just took a shower.

292
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,919
There is a stench.

293
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,000
It's the disgusting stench of alcohol.

294
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,600
I just can't get rid of it.

295
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,879
Xingyun, be honest with me.

296
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,159
You can tell me what's been bothering you.

297
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,080
I'll do anything to help.

298
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,000
Stay out of it.

299
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,360
Hello?

300
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,440
Qingzhi?

301
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,440
Qinglai,

302
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,000
when are you and Xingfu coming back?

303
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,120
What's wrong?

304
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,399
Xiuyu has been fired.

305
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,279
Now she wants to

306
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,440
move to the city for work.

307
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,200
Mom, Dad, and I tried to stop her.

308
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,320
She always listens to you.

309
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,480
Talk some sense into her.

310
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,879
She was fired?

311
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,399
Why was she fired?

312
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,080
Because of that thing?

313
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,159
Qinglai, they crossed the line this time.

314
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,720
This isn't Xiuyu's fault.

315
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,080
Why must they take it out on her?

316
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,919
Mom and Dad want to know

317
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,799
when you're coming home.

318
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,279
Right away.

319
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,919
We're on our way.

320
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,360
Xingfu?

321
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,120
Xingfu?

322
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,519
Xingfu?

323
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,720
What is it?

324
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,039
Something came up at home.

325
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,200
They need us back.

326
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,600
My sister is hurting, I can't leave her.

327
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,440
We'll talk later.

328
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,720
But Xingfu...

329
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,159
Xingfu?

330
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,879
We'll sleep together tonight.

331
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,320
I'll take this side.

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,759
Xingfu.

333
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,559
I feel exhausted.

334
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,480
Life feels meaningless to me.

335
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:49,960
Because of that day?

336
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,279
Is that why you think life is meaningless?

337
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,159
Don't be pessimistic.

338
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,840
Mom and I are proud of you.

339
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,960
You're the only one

340
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,600
who got into a university within miles.

341
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,679
And now, you're a lawyer.

342
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,879
Don't give up on living so easily.

343
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,519
Life can never be meaningless.

344
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,000
I might have to disappoint you and Mom.

345
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,679
Don't say that.

346
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,399
Don't even have that thought.

347
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,320
Xingfu,

348
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,279
I am not a lawyer.

349
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,770
What do you mean?

350
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,100
But

351
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,340
I saw your certificate.

352
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,020
It's just a qualification certificate.

353
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,050
I'm not officially a lawyer yet.

354
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,650
To become a lawyer,

355
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,570
I need a job

356
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,620
in a law firm.

357
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,690
Well, get a job.

358
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,620
I want to,

359
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,380
but it's not that easy.

360
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,340
I know you and Mom

361
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,650
have done a lot for me.

362
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,810
I want to make both of you proud.

363
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,980
So when I was in school,

364
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,620
I studied very hard.

365
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,740
I studied harder than everyone.

366
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,260
I always had great grades.

367
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,530
You know I worked hard.

368
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,940
But when it comes to job hunting,

369
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,770
it's been a few months since I graduated

370
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,290
and I still can't find a job.

371
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,290
Daxun says his father

372
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,460
can help me with that.

373
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,460
I wouldn't be so sure now.

374
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,810
Xingfu, I'm so tired.

375
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,050
Let me sleep.

376
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,980
Xingyun.

377
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,460
We don't have a lot of resources,

378
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,130
but if we work as hard as we can

379
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,660
and do our best to live,

380
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,130
whatever the future holds for us,

381
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,500
we'll never have any regrets.

382
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,500
We'll have no regret as long as we live.

383
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:33,770
Mom?

384
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,420
Mom, I need to go out.

385
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,370
The food is almost ready.

386
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,370
Where are you going?

387
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,740
I'm filing a police report.

388
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,420
I must sue that scoundrel.

389
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,980
No!

390
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,460
You mustn't!

391
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,660
Xingfu.

392
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,810
Wedding hazing

393
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,570
is normal in our village.

394
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,290
Making a fuss out of it

395
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,050
will only garner more gossip.

396
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,020
Mom, Xingyun is traumatized

397
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,570
because of that.

398
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,260
She's given up on living.

399
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,570
It's daytime and she is sleeping.

400
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,290
What if...

401
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,850
If this goes on,

402
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,500
something bad might happen to her.

403
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,660
I must press charges.

404
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,330
Xingfu.

405
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,660
Listen to me.

406
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,700
Calm down.

407
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,460
Listen.

408
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,460
I feel bad that Xingyun got hurt.

409
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,850
You are going up against the powerful.

410
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,810
You could very likely

411
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,290
ruffle the Wan Village's feathers.

412
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,810
Your life might only

413
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,330
get more miserable.

414
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,570
But...

415
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,610
Listen to me.

416
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,740
This is your first day at home since the wedding.

417
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,220
Let's enjoy the meal.

418
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,810
Save the discussion for later.

419
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,940
Qinglai, the food is ready.

420
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,050
Where is Qinglai?

421
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,090
What is going on now?

422
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,660
Why isn't he answering the phone?

423
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,460
Whatever, forget about him.

424
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,180
Let's start eating.

425
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,570
Mom, let me get you some soup.

426
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,500
You went to your sister

427
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,810
as soon as you arrived.

428
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,740
I was busy making food

429
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,330
and didn't welcome him properly.

430
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,260
He must think

431
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,810
he was disrespected.

432
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,180
This is our home.

433
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,330
It's not like he's at

434
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,420
someone else's home.

435
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,370
He's not a guest here.

436
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,130
He didn't care much

437
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,130
about my sister either.

438
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,610
This is my fault.

439
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,500
I was too busy preparing the food.

440
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,850
For the past few days,

441
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,570
I've been in distress

442
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,330
because of your sister.

443
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,660
Because of me?

444
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,850
Are you blaming me?

445
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,900
I'm not.

446
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,020
I'm just saying.

447
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,130
It's not your fault.

448
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,770
Come on, eat up.

449
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:08,980
Eat up.

450
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,180
Are you full already?

451
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,850
I thought

452
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,900
your mom and I

453
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,940
should kowtow to Mr. Wan

454
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,180
and apologize

455
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,810
and that should've settled it.

456
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,370
But Xingfu got too nosy.

457
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,940
She should've minded her own business.

458
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,700
Dad,

459
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
I don't think Xingfu has done anything wrong.

460
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,260
This whole thing

461
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,090
was Chuanjia's fault.

462
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,330
What do you possibly know?

463
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,570
All you know is studying,

464
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,810
and you've turned into a fool!

465
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,770
We saved every penny we could

466
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,770
and lived a frugal life

467
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,850
to pay your tuition fees.

468
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,980
What did that get us?

469
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,370
If you're so capable,

470
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,770
help your sister get her job back.

471
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,610
Where are you going?

472
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,570
I'll talk to Chuanjia.

473
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,180
Are you out of your mind?

474
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,810
He runs a corporation!

475
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,050
Who do you think you are?

476
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,460
I approved of this marriage

477
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,130
because I thought Qinglai

478
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,460
was honest and hardworking.

479
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,370
I thought you wouldn't get bullied there.

480
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,770
But it turned out he is just as stubborn.

481
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,570
Stubborn

482
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,900
but a coward.

483
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,660
Xingfu deserves a better husband.

484
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,460
Nonsense.

485
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,660
He's still your brother-in-law.

486
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,050
I am right about him.

487
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,460
My brother-in-law?

488
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,570
If he was my family,

489
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,980
would he have pretended not to hear anything?

490
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,980
I was screaming for help.

491
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,050
Xingfu could hear it from inside the house.

492
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,660
But he pretended to hear nothing.

493
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,460
Xingyun.

494
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,050
Today is your sister's first return.

495
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,330
Can we please just enjoy our meal?

496
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,570
Don't bring that up.

497
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,770
Be more sensible.

498
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,570
Fine, I'm the insensible one.

499
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,660
Xingyun?

500
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,460
She wouldn't listen to reasons.

501
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,660
There are things

502
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,850
she must figure out

503
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,940
on her own.

504
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,740
How has your married life been

505
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,130
over the past few days?

506
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,850
Did they pick on you?

507
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,090
They wouldn't dare.

508
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,770
I am the mighty He Xingfu.

509
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,810
No one bullies me.

510
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,420
Qinglai!

511
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,090
Why are you here by yourself?

512
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:07,980
Where is Xingfu?

513
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,090
Forget about her.

514
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,130
Xingfu called,

515
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,260
why did you hang up on her?

516
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,570
Have you seen Chuanjia?

517
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,570
The guard says he's away.

518
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,330
What are you two doing here?

519
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,530
Chuanjia,

520
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,260
we need to have a word with you.

521
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,290
What is there to talk about?

522
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,700
It was just wedding hazing.

523
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,020
If your wife wants to press charges,

524
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,850
I'll be waiting.

525
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,850
Chuanjia, that's not why we came.

526
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,330
It's about my sister.

527
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,850
Xiuyu?

528
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,740
What's wrong with her?

529
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,050
Xingfu rubbed you the wrong way.

530
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:05,940
You got upset.

531
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,810
I understand that.

532
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,940
But you could have come after

533
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,850
my brother,

534
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,660
his wife,

535
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,850
or even me.

536
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,220
It's not right to take it out on Xiuyu.

537
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,570
What is this nonsense?

538
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,740
I took it out on her?

539
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,940
What are you talking about?

540
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,020
Why did you fire her?

541
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,610
Who?

542
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,260
You mean I fired Xiuyu?

543
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,370
Why wasn't I informed?

544
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,850
Xiuyu has been crying all day.

545
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,420
Xuemei told her

546
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,460
she was fired.

547
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,770
Fine, I got it.

548
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,940
I'll get to the bottom of this.

549
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,530
Go home and wait for my message.

550
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,260
Guard!

551
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,180
No motorcycles in front of the gate!

552
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,290
This is outrageous!

553
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,922
[Wanjia Group]

554
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,770
Our business partner called.

555
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,980
They've received the health products.

556
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,090
When did you come here?

557
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,020
Am I not welcome here?

558
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,330
I need to see you.

559
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,050
Carry on.

560
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,260
Mr. Zhang is composing the contract.

561
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,180
When he's done,

562
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,500
he'll send us a copy for us to check.

563
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,420
So,

564
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,500
does Chairman Wan know?

565
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,020
Yes.

566
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,940
Chairman Wan thinks we shouldn't wait.

567
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,330
He wants you to write a proposal to him,

568
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,460
so he can plan ahead.

569
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,220
Alright, leave it on the table.

570
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,130
Bring me Xuemei.

571
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:12,770
Sure.

572
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,420
So, what brings you here?

573
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,020
The Health Center is purchasing

574
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,130
a CT device.

575
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,810
The Director wants me to discuss it with you.

576
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,980
The Director is always so bossy.

577
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,130
What is this device?

578
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,610
It's a CT scanner.

579
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,290
It can detect early-stage cancer.

580
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,660
Even the county hospital doesn't have it.

581
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,180
How much is it?

582
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,370
Around one million yuan.

583
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,020
We'll talk about it later.

584
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,810
We must discuss it now.

585
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,570
That is why I am here...

586
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,850
Mr. Wan, you asked for me?

587
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,900
Tell me,

588
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,090
did you fire Xiuyu?

589
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,570
-I...
-I fired her.

590
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,180
What?

591
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,330
You had her fired?

592
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,420
By what right?

593
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,370
Xingfu wounded you.

594
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,740
Why would you hire her family?

595
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,940
That was unacceptable for...

596
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,740
How dare you take it into your own hand!

597
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,940
Who do you think you are?

598
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,260
You don't get to fire my workers!

599
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,370
Do it now.

600
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:17,810
Tell Xiuyu

601
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,770
to come back for work.

602
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,050
Yes.

603
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,130
You hit me?

604
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,220
You hit me because of that woman?

605
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,260
Are you having an affair with her?

606
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,290
Are you out of your mind?

607
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,290
You can't fool me.

608
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:34,810
You always think

609
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,180
I'm having an affair.

610
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,660
How dare you interfere

611
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,740
with the company's affair!

612
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,130
You are embarrassing me!

613
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,570
You're embarrassing Chairman Wan!

614
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,850
Does it hurt?

615
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,370
Remember that pain and learn your lesson.

616
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,660
Remember that.

617
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,610
Now,

618
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,050
back to the device you mentioned.

619
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,020
Give me a file on that thing.

620
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,260
We'll talk about it at home.

621
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,130
Go on.

622
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,460
From now on,

623
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,330
don't come to the office.

624
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,180
You stubborn fool!

625
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,090
Listen to me.

626
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,370
Bring Xingfu back now!

627
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,090
No, I won't do it.

628
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,980
Are you going or not?

629
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,420
No.

630
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,900
I'll beat you until you go.

631
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,020
I'm not going.

632
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,130
I have a sister too.

633
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,700
What is wrong with you?

634
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,050
Dad!

635
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,020
You made her upset.

636
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,220
Stop lecturing him.

637
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,420
Xingfu doesn't want to come home.

638
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,090
You are not helping at all.

639
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,770
He just got you the job back.

640
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,810
You heartless brat.

641
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,090
Of course I am helping him.

642
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,770
You can't catch me.

643
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,610
No?

644
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,260
You're a grown-up, but I can still beat you.

645
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,500
Stay out of it. Dad is bluffing.

646
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,530
I'll beat you up...

647
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,850
What's wrong with you?

648
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,420
What are you chasing?

649
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,050
Oh.

650
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,460
You came just in time.

651
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,130
Come on.

652
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,420
Sit down.

653
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,260
Xiuyu, serve her some water.

654
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:09,810
Stop standing there.

655
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,020
Serve the guest.

656
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,130
Sit.

657
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,460
Guizhi!

658
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,980
Hurry up.

659
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,020
Madam is here.

660
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,940
What is going on?

661
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,290
Take a seat.

662
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:18,810
Hi!

663
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,050
Welcome.

664
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,850
You came at the right time.

665
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,090
Madam.

666
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,740
Thanks to you,

667
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,260
my son married someone

668
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,420
just as stubborn as him.

669
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,420
What do we do now?

670
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,050
What's the matter?

671
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,290
Xingfu went back to her mother's today.

672
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,610
The couple left early in the morning.

673
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,500
But because of Xiuyu's job,

674
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,850
Qinglai came back in a hurry.

675
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,530
The couple didn't talk it through
and are now giving each other

676
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,850
the silent treatment.

677
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,770
Qinglai refuses

678
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,530
to bring her back.

679
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,530
Qinglai thinks

680
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,660
we should not spoil her.

681
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,220
He wants her to come back on her own.

682
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,810
And now, his wife got all upset.

683
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,260
She hasn't come home since.

684
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,530
She went back to her mother

685
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,660
and is not coming home,

686
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,180
she'll make a laughing stock of us all.

687
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,130
I bet this is about

688
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,260
Xingfu's sister.

689
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,020
She went back to her mother,

690
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,370
so of course they'd talk about it.

691
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,260
Indeed.

692
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,530
That must be it.

693
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,090
It is about that incident.

694
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,180
Since her sister

695
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,610
was hurt in Wan Village,

696
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,220
the mother would certainly be upset.

697
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,810
Right?

698
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,700
But then again,

699
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,610
it wasn't our fault.

700
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,570
I've been thinking.

701
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,770
It's right not to let Qinglai pick her up.

702
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,570
That boy is clumsy with words.

703
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,020
If he let her get under his skin,

704
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,770
she'd be in control of this relationship.

705
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,740
Right?

706
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,020
Madam,

707
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:45,980
this is what I think.

708
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,770
You were the matchmaker

709
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,090
of their marriage.

710
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,570
So I might need to trouble you

711
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,810
to go to Xingfu's mother

712
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,850
and talk to her.

713
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,370
You two are unbelievable.

714
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,050
You're sending me off for an errand

715
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,500
right after I sat down.

716
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,700
We are old friends.

717
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,290
Do us a favor.

718
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,460
When the job is done,

719
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,660
my husband will send you another pig's head.

720
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,260
Gifts always come with a price.

721
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,460
I shouldn't have taken that pig's head.

722
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,460
It's getting late.

723
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,660
I'll go to her mother's

724
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,370
tomorrow morning.

725
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
-Yes, thank you.
-Thanks.

726
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,330
Thank you so much.

727
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,370
I told you

728
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,700
I am fine.

729
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,090
Don't lie to me.

730
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,770
I heard it from the phone call.

731
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,460
What did they do to you?

732
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,220
They didn't do anything to me.

733
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,850
They...

734
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,500
This is our custom here.

735
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,570
It was just normal wedding hazing.

736
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,940
Nothing happened, Daxun.

737
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:37,810
Nothing?

738
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,660
You screamed for help.

739
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,850
You called him a pervert.

740
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,020
I heard everything.

741
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,530
I am certain

742
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,530
it got out of hand.

743
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,220
Nothing happened.

744
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,180
Can we not talk about this anymore?

745
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,020
Is there nothing else

746
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,900
the two of us can talk about?

747
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,050
Why won't you

748
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,500
give it a rest already?

749
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,290
Let's not bring this up again.

750
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,810
Why can't we talk about this?

751
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,530
I want to know

752
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,530
what kind of wedding hazing

753
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,700
the villagers do!

754
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,660
Nothing happened, Daxun.

755
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,260
Xingyun.

756
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,330
I've been asking around.

757
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,610
I was told

758
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,460
those villagers could
do anything while wedding hazing.

759
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,660
You are my girlfriend.

760
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,810
I have the right to know.

761
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,770
I just want to know

762
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,180
what they did to you.

763
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,290
I have the right to know!

764
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,420
They didn't do anything to me!

765
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,260
They did nothing!

766
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,370
What is it you want to know?

767
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,610
I want to know

768
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,050
if he molested you.

769
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,530
Why did they pick on you

770
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,940
and not the others?

771
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,260
I ask myself

772
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,500
the same question too!

773
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,610
I don't know the answer either.

774
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,740
Why won't you give it a rest,

775
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,610
Daxun?

776
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,090
Please tell me, then!

777
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,850
Nothing happened.

778
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,540
What happened to you?

779
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,370
Tell me.

780
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,090
I don't know why.

781
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,890
I didn't want any of it to happen.

782
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,780
They didn't do anything to me.

783
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,300
You won't tell me?

784
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:06,980
Fine.

785
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,700
Daxun?

786
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,650
Daxun?

787
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,650
Daxun?

788
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,090
Daxun, please don't...

789
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,170
Xingfu.

790
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,370
Mom.

791
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,540
We can't let it go on.

792
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,610
Xingyun

793
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,020
is crying on the phone.

794
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,890
She can't live like that.

795
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,570
You should

796
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,780
think about your life.

797
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,860
What's wrong with me?

798
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,250
I live however I want.

799
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,250
Our main concern is her.

800
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,170
She'll make it through.

801
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,540
Time will heal her.

802
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,610
What is your plan?

803
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,250
Are you going home tomorrow?

804
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,090
Yes.

805
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,540
I must.

806
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,460
Good.

807
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,860
Talk to them

808
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,420
after you go back.

809
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,570
No.

810
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,090
I think

811
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,060
we should let Qinglai

812
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,210
bring you home personally.

813
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,570
If not,

814
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,340
you should stay

815
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,730
and live here.

816
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:10,820
Mom,

817
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,770
you are confusing me.

818
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,170
Just now, you wanted me

819
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,770
to go back and live my life.

820
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,340
Now, you want me to stay?

821
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,730
How can I live my life if I don't go home?

822
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,020
You don't get it.

823
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,090
They are sidelining you.

824
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,420
Qinglai isn't that calculating.

825
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,860
Qinglai isn't,

826
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,210
but I wouldn't be so sure about his mother.

827
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,020
If you decided

828
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,860
to go home right away,

829
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,170
you'd always be looked down on in the family.

830
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,290
If you ever run into trouble,

831
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,860
you'd never win a fight against them.

832
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,940
We're a family, there is no need to fight.

833
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,770
Silly girl.

834
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,420
You are married to the family.

835
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,860
It's not the same there.

836
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,690
Whatever the case is,

837
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,650
you will always be an outsider to them.

838
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,060
You should use this chance

839
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,210
to leave an impression on them,

840
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,250
learn to be smart,

841
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,500
and get Qinglai on your side.

842
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,900
Otherwise,

843
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,420
you'd be on your own.

844
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:22,770
Alright,

845
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,980
trust me on this.

846
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,650
I'll make the bed for you.

847
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,770
Go to bed.

848
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,460
Madam.

849
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,820
You're home.

850
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,130
What brings you here?

851
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,650
I was just passing by.

852
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,690
I thought I should drop by.

853
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,860
Please come in.

854
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,570
Here, take a seat.

855
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,820
You too.

856
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,420
Let's sit down.

857
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,940
I'll get you a glass of water.

858
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,420
I've been

859
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,420
coming here every now and then.

860
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,340
Some know

861
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,650
I matchmade your daughter.

862
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,820
But some might think

863
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,940
I'm fixing your younger daughter

864
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,290
with someone else.

865
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,730
Enough about her.

866
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,020
You might

867
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,860
still see her alive today.

868
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,130
If you were here tomorrow,

869
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,130
she might

870
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,540
already be dead.

871
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,340
Don't say that.

872
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,020
You were there too!

873
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,380
How could you not know about that?

874
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,610
Madam,

875
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,340
this isn't your fault.

876
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,940
You've been matchmaking for years,

877
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,020
but has anyone

878
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,900
hazed his brother's wedding?

879
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,820
Of course not.

880
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,570
You're right.

881
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,650
What he did

882
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,860
was not wedding hazing,

883
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,540
he was acting like a pervert!

884
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,250
The whole yard was full of people.

885
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,690
Were they all blind?

886
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,460
They were turning a blind eye to his action!

887
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,290
That was awful of them!

888
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,860
Xingyun is an undergraduate.

889
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,690
She is shy.

890
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,420
She's lost the will to live since she came home.

891
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,770
Tell me, what should I do?

892
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:02,860
Madam,

893
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,980
for that,

894
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,420
I owe you an apology.

895
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,340
Look,

896
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,060
it was very unfortunate.

897
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,380
I was

898
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,090
totally exhausted that day.

899
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,290
I had too much drink

900
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,210
and got drunk.

901
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,650
So I went home early.

902
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,820
But as soon as I left,

903
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,210
a bad thing happened.

904
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,690
If you ask me,

905
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,730
I don't care

906
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,170
who is at fault here,

907
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,540
we must demand justice.

908
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,650
Xingfu mustn't go home

909
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,860
unless we get an apology.

910
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,900
You are right.

911
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,980
We want

912
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,500
an explanation from them.

913
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,900
That is totally understandable.

914
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,210
But Xingfu

915
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,690
hit the secretary's son on the head.

916
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,250
His face was covered in blood.

917
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,090
He had quite a few stitches for the wound.

918
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,340
I heard his head

919
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,500
is still hurting.

920
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,130
She hit the guy?

921
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,650
I didn't know.

922
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,170
You didn't know?

923
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,380
She didn't tell me.

924
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,060
That was because she didn't want to

925
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,610
worry you.

926
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,340
According to the secretary,

927
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,570
he's taking his son

928
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,060
to a general hospital in the city

929
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,250
for a proper check-up.

930
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,980
After all, he has only one son.

931
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,210
His son is the general manager
of the Wanjia Group.

932
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,820
He's precious to the family.

933
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,900
But your daughter wounded him.

934
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,420
If he has any lingering issues,

935
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,500
he will press charges.

936
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,770
They will sue Xingfu?

937
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,020
How could Xingfu

938
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,860
hit him so hard?

939
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,380
I said the same thing.

940
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,650
I had

941
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,460
just come from the Wan Village.

942
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,650
You should know

943
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,090
that Qinglai and his mother

944
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,500
have been waiting

945
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,540
outside the Health Center
and the secretary's home

946
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,290
because of this.

947
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,340
If they had the time,

948
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,500
they wouldn't have sent me

949
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,820
to check on Xingfu.

950
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,090
That girl has crossed the line this time.

951
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,540
This is unacceptable.

952
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,570
Madam,

953
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,020
this is what I propose.

954
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,500
I'll look past

955
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,770
what he did to Xingyun.

956
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,020
Look,

957
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,460
there is no man in this house.

958
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,540
Tell the others we are willing

959
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,820
to make peace.

960
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,980
Sure.

961
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,940
We are old friends.

962
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,460
I'm glad to help.

963
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,380
Well said.

964
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,980
That settled it.

965
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,380
I must prepare the next meal.

966
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,540
After the meal,

967
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,210
take Xingfu with you.

968
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,460
That is great.

969
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,290
I'll do just that.

970
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,940
Madam.

971
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,860
Don't try to scare my mother.

972
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,690
I did hit his head,

973
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,770
but you exaggerated the injury.

974
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,610
Xingfu,

975
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,940
this is my advice for you.

976
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,650
Yes,

977
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,380
Chuanjia molested Xingyun.

978
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,380
He's in the wrong.

979
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,610
But then again,

980
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,860
you hit him in the head.

981
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,290
She is my sister.

982
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,820
He hurt my sister,

983
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,460
so I had to stop him.

984
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,900
But think about this.

985
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,940
Right from the beginning,

986
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,130
the Wang family

987
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,340
has done nothing wrong.

988
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,610
Because of you,

989
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,250
your in-laws

990
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,860
have been kowtowing to the secretary
to apologize for you.

991
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,980
Think about them.

992
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,290
Do they deserve this?

993
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,570
Why should they apologize to the secretary?

994
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:40,820
Fine,

995
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,460
let's set all of this aside for now.

996
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,690
What about your first trip home
after the wedding?

997
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,290
By our custom,

998
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,380
you must return to
your husband's home on the same day.

999
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,460
You should know that.

1000
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,020
You're breaking the rules

1001
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,420
that have been around for decades.

1002
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,650
Your in-laws

1003
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,130
are being mocked in the village.

1004
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:56,980
Now,

1005
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,170
isn't that your fault?

1006
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,090
How is that my fault?

1007
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,130
I wanted to go home yesterday.

1008
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,090
But Qinglai

1009
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,170
left me here

1010
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,610
without even telling me.

1011
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,020
Yes, she's telling the truth.

1012
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,170
I called him countless times,

1013
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:14,940
but he never answered.

1014
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:15,980
Ask him

1015
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,290
if I have been calling him.

1016
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,250
And eventually,

1017
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,770
he turned off his phone.

1018
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,060
He clearly doesn't want me to go home.

1019
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:24,900
Why should I

1020
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,380
embarrass myself by going back?

1021
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,460
It's humiliating.

1022
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,610
This is Qinglai's fault.

1023
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,340
Madam,

1024

tell Qinglai

1025
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,980
to come here and pick me up

1026
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,980
if he still wants me as his wife.

1027
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,650
Otherwise,

1028
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,770
there is another solution.

1029
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,500
What is it?

1030
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,130
Tell me.

1031
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,210
Tell him

1032
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,820
he is a grown man

1033
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,420
throwing a tantrum because of his wife.

1034
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,610
That's low.

1035
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,540
If he wants to prove his worth,

1036
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,980
he should go to Chuanjia

1037
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,500
and make the guy apologize to my sister.

1038
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,420
When he does that,

1039
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,690
I'll go back to the village

1040
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,980
on my own.
