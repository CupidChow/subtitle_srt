00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,359
Dad,

4
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,879
Mom,

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,200
things are different now.

6
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,239
It's all about

7
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,400
the law now.

8
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,680
Even the country must abide by the law.

9
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,560
So must the Wan Village.

10
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,920
I think

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
we should sue them.

12
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
If we win the lawsuit,

13
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,640
Wan Shantang

14
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,799
won't be as arrogant in the future.

15
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,359
But...

16
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,400
[Home]
He is the village secretary.

17
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,400
Mom.

18
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,400
Wan Shantang's paternalism

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,560
will become obsolete eventually.

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,200
Son, you made it sound too easy.

21
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,959
Mr. Wan is the government

22
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:11,359
in our village.

23
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
If we sue the government,

24
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,159
they might come after us.

25
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,199
Dad,

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,800
it's not that serious.

27
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,520
We are just

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,719
using a different method to fight.

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,120
No one is causing anyone trouble.

30
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,120
But,

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,919
this means

32
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,840
we will have a fallout with the village.

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,960
This is...

34
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,159
How should I face everyone in the company?

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
Do what you must.

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,800
We are the victims here,

37
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,919
not the victimizer.

38
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,759
We have nothing to fear.

39
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,439
Xingfu, you don't get it.

40
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,919
It's not as simple as you think.

41
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,080
I'm not an alien.

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,039
Why wouldn't I get it?

43
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,840
Some of the bootlickers

44
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,479
will sideline you

45
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,120
and isolate you.

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
You should ignore those people anyway.

47
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,879
If the management

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,639
or your superiors give you a hard time,

49
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,280
you can just quit the job.

50
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,759
We are still young,

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,360
we can make a living anywhere we go.

52
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,199
Qingzhi.

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,840
You're the educated one here.

54
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,919
You must handle this matter with care.

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,479
Don't worry, Mom.

56
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,479
Guan Tao

57
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,599
is a close friend of mine.

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,159
He's an outstanding lawyer.

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,840
Besides,

60
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,800
we have Xingyun to help us.

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,960
If we couldn't trust them,

62
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,680
there would be no one we could trust.

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,919
He has a point.

64
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,159
Right, Dad, Mom?

65
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,520
Even Qingzhi agrees.

66
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,960
Let's settle it.

67
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,000
We go take this to court.

68
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,479
Xingyun, hold this.

69
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,879
Senior, maybe I should

70
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,639
get you a room in the hotel.

71
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,599
Our home barely has anything.

72
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,080
Hey.

73
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,520
It's alright.

74
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
Your mother has been working all day.

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,919
If I don't stay here,

76
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,520
she'll be wasting her time.

77
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,879
He's right.

78
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,080
Besides,

79
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,800
we'll hear from your sister tomorrow.

80
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,479
It's more convenient

81
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,120
if I live close.

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,639
He's right.

83
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,120
Mr. Wu,

84
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,479
you can stay here tonight

85
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,840
if you don't mind.

86
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,599
Madam, please.

87
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,719
I find the place nice.

88
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,560
And

89
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,400
my surname is Guan.

90
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,479
Mom.

91
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,639
He's Guan Tao.

92
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,240
Forgive my bad memory.

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,520
Mr. Guan,

94
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,719
rest well.

95
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,080
Mom, rest well.

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,120
Senior,

97
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
rest well.

98
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,080
Let me know if you need anything.

99
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,759
I'll be fine.

100
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,360
Good night.

101
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:07,960
Good night.

102
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,039
Well?

103
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,680
Have you agreed on

104
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,879
what to do next?

105
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,759
Mr. Guan,

106
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,360
we talked it through last night.

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,199
We think

108
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,279
we should press charges.

109
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,120
Yes.

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,600
Yes.

111
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,040
If not,

112
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,240
there is nothing else we can do.

113
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,279
Very well.

114
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,399
We can start preparing

115
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,319
the letter of attorney.

116
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,120
Have a look.

117
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,879
If there are

118
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,120
no other problems,

119
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,959
I need your signature

120
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,600
on the last page.

121
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,959
Xingfu here

122
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,759
is capable.

123
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
She's a reasonable person.

124
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,040
She should sign it.

125
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,680
Xingfu,

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,240
wait.

127
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,079
But my sister is only your daughter-in-law.

128
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,040
Are you sure she should sign it?

129
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,959
Yes.

130
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,920
She is the head

131
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,600
of our Wang family.

132
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,839
I think Qinglai should sign it.

133
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,680
No.

134
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,480
Women call the shot here in the Wang family.

135
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,240
Yes,

136
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,759
I know the whole story.

137
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,560
I should sign it.

138
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,000
Here?

139
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,759
Yes.

140
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,519
Over here.

141
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,439
And there's another matter.

142
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,720
I heard that during the negotiation
about compensation,

143
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,720
Qinglai was kicked

144
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,639
and hospitalized.

145
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,160
Well...

146
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm alright now.

147
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,600
Well...

148
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,600
Everything is fine now.

149
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,120
I am

150
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,759
fine.

151
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,879
I think we should press charges

152
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,519
against them for beating Qinglai.

153
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,720
That should

154
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,160
give us an advantage

155
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,879
in the lawsuit.

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:51,839
The defendant

157
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,399
will have to concede even more.

158
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:54,759
Mr. Guan,

159
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,680
are you saying

160
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,439
we can make them pay even more?

161
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,399
Let's sue them.

162
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,079
Sue them for Qinglai's injury.

163
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,639
You can put it that way.

164
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,120
Qinglai.

165
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,439
Your medical record, the receipt,

166
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,480
and the radiographs, do you still have them?

167
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,959
Yes.

168
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,600
In that case,

169
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,240
we need you to sign this agreement.

170
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,079
This is for bodily harm inflicted on him.

171
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,639
For this,

172
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,519
Qinglai will have to sign it himself.

173
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,160
Sure.

174
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,879
Sure.

175
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,879
The thing is,

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,439
the cost of a case is 2,000 yuan.

177
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,480
Counting Qinglai's case,

178
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,199
the total for the cases

179
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:32,879
is 4,000 yuan.

180
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,399
Do you transfer the money

181
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,560
or pay in cash?

182
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,639
4,000 yuan?

183
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,360
Wait.

184
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,160
But we haven't gotten anything yet.

185
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,720
You want us to pay upfront?

186
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,720
That's a lot of money.

187
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,759
Can you lower the price a little?

188
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,160
Madam,

189
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,000
sir,

190
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,920
the whole legal proceeding

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,720
is a lot of work.

192
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,439
It takes a lot of time,

193
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,600
and then

194
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,040
we must gather

195
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,000
enough evidence

196
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,639
before handing over everything to the court.

197
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,560
Then,

198
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,079
we must analyze how the defendant will respond.

199
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,240
Then, we must get ready for the court session.

200
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,399
This is already the lowest price we can offer.

201
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,720
If it was in the city,

202
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,720
our law firm normally

203
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,439
would charge based on

204
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,639
the total amount

205
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,519
involved in the lawsuit

206
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,399
for this kind of case.

207
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,480
Mr. Guan is telling the truth.

208
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,240
This is the most cost-effective way.

209
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,480
Mom, of course the lawsuit will cost us money.

210
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,879
Look,

211
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,399
will you lose 4,000 yuan

212
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,920
or ten times the amount.

213
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,439
Guizhi.

214
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,600
Come with me.

215
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,360
They are here to make money from our predicament.

216
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,360
Let's not hire him.

217
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,839
Hire someone who doesn't make money out of us.

218
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,759
Of course people want to make money.

219
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,759
I want him to get paid,

220
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,519
so he can do his job right.

221
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:57,839
Besides,

222
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,600
Xingfu's sister is with him.

223
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,959
She will help her.

224
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
We'll hire them for the lawsuit.

225
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,639
Mr. Guan.

226
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
A lawsuit is quite a big deal for villagers.

227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,480
I hope

228
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,519
you wouldn't mind.

229
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm fine with it.

230
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,079
As a lawyer,

231
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,839
I must respect my clients' decisions.

232
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,680
Mr. Guan.

233
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
Thank you.

234
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,920
You have our thanks.

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,120
As for the money,

236
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,759
we don't keep cash in the house.

237
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,920
We put it in the credit cooperative.

238
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,279
We can't make any withdrawals just yet.

239
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,920
But we'll be able to soon.

240
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,799
When it's time,

241
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,120
we'll pay you.

242
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,919
Is that alright?

243
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,519
Mom...

244
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,320
Xingfu,

245
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,440
it's alright.

246
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,519
Madam,

247
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,200
we'll do as you say.

248
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,919
Thank you so much.

249
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,639
I'm sorry for that.

250
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,559
But thank you.

251
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,559
Come on, take a seat.

252
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,039
Sure.

253
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,360
What is wrong with this family?

254
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,480
It's like they don't want to pay us.

255
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,240
I don't mind it because you're my sister,

256
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
but Mr. Guan doesn't deserve this.

257
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,120
Mr. Guan.

258
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,200
My apologies.

259
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,240
My in-laws are more cautious

260
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,720
when it comes to money.

261
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,679
But I assure you

262
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,399
we will pay you the amount.

263
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,279
We won't give you a hard time.

264
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,759
It's alright. Money is not the problem.

265
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,159
The main concern is

266
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,639
that they haven't made up their minds yet.

267
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,879
I'm more concerned about

268
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,639
that if the lawsuit

269
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,279
is ongoing and the clients

270
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,279
change their minds,

271
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,039
things will get complicated.

272
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,639
My advice for you

273
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,440
is to make sure everyone is on the same page.

274
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,440
It's not too late to back out

275
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,399
from the lawsuit.

276
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,120
We can't just give up now.

277
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,600
We've come this far,

278
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,879
so we can't afford to give up.

279
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,639
Very well, we'll do our best.

280
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,120
We must go now.

281
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,159
Alright.

282
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,679
See you.

283
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,240
Mr. Guan, have a nice day.

284
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:57,720
Thanks.

Hello.

288
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,679
We wish to file two cases.

289
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,919
Thank you.

00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,559
Alright.

291
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,159
You have two cases.

292
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,960
Based on the asset involved,

293
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,200
the court cost the first case

294
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,360
is 4,100 yuan.

295
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,679
As for the battery case,

296
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,000
the court cost is 50 yuan.

297
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,799
Unbelievable.

298
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,799
What's wrong with you?

299
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,200
What got into you today?

What's wrong?

301
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,240
It just doesn't sit right with me.

302
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,879
The lawsuit hasn't even begun,

303
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,399
and we haven't got our money back.

304
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,759
Why are we paying them 4,000 yuan?

305
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,879
It doesn't feel right.

306
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,600
Dad,

307
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,559
if you can't make up your mind

308
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,240
and want to give up,

309
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,120
we can just do so.

310
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,440
They aren't forcing us.

311
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,000
That's not what I mean.

312
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,159
If we don't press charges,

313
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,600
we can't get our money back.

314
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,639
Well,

315
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,799
have you made up your mind?

316
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,360
We can still withdraw the charges.

317
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,919
It'd be problematic to withdraw

318
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,440
if we withdrew when the court session started.

319
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,799
I just think

320
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,600
it's too expensive.

321
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,080
It was only one case.

322
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,919
Right?

323
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,559
And then lawyers asked us
to file for another case.

324
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,120
It was Mr. Guan's idea

325
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,120
to press charges for Qinglai's injury.

326
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,720
Why are we paying for his idea?

327
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,360
But

328
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,519
you can't say it's his idea.

329
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,200
They are doing it for us.

330
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,759
You heard Mr. Guan.

331
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,080
Pressing two charges

332
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,559
will help

333
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,600
with the negotiation
of the compensation amount.

334
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,879
But what if we lose the lawsuit?

335
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,080
Are we going to pay even more?

336
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,879
Well...

337
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,279
Qinglai.

338
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,480
You're the victim.

339
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,879
You should decide.

340
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,120
Keep your dad from acting all paranoid.

341
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,879
I don't mind.

342
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,480
It's not hurting

343
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,480
and I'm almost fully healed.

344
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,039
You should decide what to do.

345
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,559
You should decide.

346
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,440
It's about you.

347
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
You must make a stance.

348
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,039
I think

349
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,120
if we sue Mr. Wan

350
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,440
because of the attack,

351
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,879
he might

352
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,080
be upset

353
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,720
when he sees me.

354
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,759
He is right.

355
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,200
We are suing the Wanjia Group

356
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,639
for the compensation.

357
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,679
That is an official matter.

358
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,000
But if Qinglai sues Mr. Wan,

359
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,799
he'll hold a grudge against us.

360
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,240
We shouldn't sue him.

361
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,919
After all, Mr. Wan and I

362
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,480
have known each other for decades.

363
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,799
We are old friends.

364
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:41,960
Xingfu,

365
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,080
call Mr. Guan now.

366
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,200
Tell him we're withdrawing

367
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,440
Qinglai's case.

368
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,399
What about the other case?

369
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,679
Yes.

370
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We must sue them for the land.

371
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,320
Okay.

372
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,519
I'll talk to Mr. Guan.

373
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,720
Xingfu,

374
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,080
when you call him,

375
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,480
tell him

376
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,360
we are withdrawing Qinglai's case,

377
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,480
so we only owe them 2,000 yuan.

378
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,840
Fine.

379
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,240
I'll call him now.

380
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm sorry, Senior.

381
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,799
I'm sorry you have to pay the court cost

382
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,879
before getting paid the attorney's fee.

383
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,840
Paying out of pocket for clients

384
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,200
is very normal.

385
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,159
Hello, Xingfu.

386
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,039
Mr. Guan,

387
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,159
where are you now?

388
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,879
We are filing the cases.

389
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,080
Well,

390
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,519
we are withdrawing Qinglai's case.

391
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,399
Really? Are you sure?

392
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,519
Yes, we decide not to sue them for the injury.

393
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:42,960
Very well.

394
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,120
I respect your decision.

395
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:46,840
I'll withdraw the case.

396
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,320
Sure, that's all.

397
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:51,720
They are withdrawing the case?

398
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,080
They gave up?

399
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,879
According to your sister,

400
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,120
they won't press charges

401
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,399
for Qinglai's injury.

402
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,039
Sorry,

403
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,679
we overpaid the sum.

404
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,159
We are withdrawing the second case,

405
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,120
which is the battery case.

406
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,000
You're withdrawing?

407
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,080
But I have already

408
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,440
keyed in the information.

409
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,360
And you paid the court cost.

410
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,720
The case has been filed.

411
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,519
If you're

412
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,519
withdrawing the case,

413
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,600
we'll process it as a withdrawal.

414
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,720
You can't have the money back.

415
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,120
That will do.

416
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,799
Do you still have the receipt?

417
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,039
Over here.

418
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,279
Thank you.

419
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,200
Don't mention it.

420
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,559
Thanks.

421
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,200
You're welcome.

422
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,840
Thank you.

423
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,799
Mr. Wan!

424
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,360
Mr. Wan!

425
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,159
What is it?

426
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,759
A notice from the court.

427
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,639
What?

428
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,240
The court session for the lawsuit
with the Wang family

429
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,159
will begin soon.

430
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,039
Therefore,

431
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,480
[People's Court, Fushui Town, Xiuchuan County]
as the legal representative of the Group,

432
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:57,759
you must appear in court.

433
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,000
They actually sued us.

434
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,240
See?

435
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,799
My father

436
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,960
dedicated his life

437
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,600
to Wan Village.

438
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,279
And now, he's getting sued by the villagers.

439
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,159
Ignore it.

440
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,159
Tell them I'm busy

441
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:16,679
and I can't be there.

442
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,960
If the Wang family is that capable,

443
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,320
send the court to arrest me.

444
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,399
Mr. Wan.

445
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,240
I think

446
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,799
we shouldn't take the matter too lightly.

447
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,559
Perhaps we should speak

448
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,720
to the higher-ups of the county.

449
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,039
This project is to develop the Wan Village

450
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,480
and is for everyone's interest.

451
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,120
Inform the higher-ups.

452
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,159
It's better safe than sorry.

453
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,039
That's unnecessary.

454
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,519
There is no way I'd lose the suit.

455
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,159
If I did,

456
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,080
I'd quit my job as the secretary.

457
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,759
We are going to court.

458
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:46,720
The court

459
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,320
wants members of the company
and the village committee to attend.

460
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,159
Chuanjia and I can go in your stead.

461
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,559
Fine.

462
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,960
You two will attend.

463
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,600
See what the judge has to say.

464
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,200
Call the lawyer, Mr. Hu.

465
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,120
I didn't pay him

466
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,159
just to make money.

467
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:08,720
Come in.

468
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,720
Chuanjia?

469
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,519
You asked for me?

470
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,559
Sit.

471
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,720
It's about

472
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,720
the Wang family's land.

473
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,639
They are suing us.

474
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,320
Did you hear that?

475
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,240
I know.

476
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,039
Can we win this lawsuit?

477
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,360
It's most likely

478
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,240
that we will

479
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,240
lose the lawsuit.

480
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,240
What?

481
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,930
Why?

482
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,620
They signed the compensation agreement.

483
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,170
They are being unreasonable here.

484
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,290
But it's been brought to court.

485
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,810
We can't do as we please

486
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,170
like in the village and the company.

487
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,530
There are legal procedures.

488
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,410
We don't get to decide what we get.

489
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,220
Right?

490
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,500
We must abide by the law.

491
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:45,980
Okay?

492
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,620
Only evidence speaks.

493
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,810
Enough fancy words.

494
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,650
Whatever it is,

495
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,100
the project must not be delayed.

496
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,340
It's simple.

497
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,260
Pay them, problem solved.

498
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,050
It's not that much.

499
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:55,740
Just pay them.

500
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,930
Fat chance!

501
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,140
Didn't I pay them?

502
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,650
I paid them twice!

503
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,140
They kept pushing it.

504
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,500
What now?

505
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,650
Do I have to pay for everything?

506
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,220
Why am I even paying you then?

507
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,220
I'm not giving them a penny.

508
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,650
You're the lawyer, so figure something out.

509
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,410
Wait.

510
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,890
I'm not the judge.

511
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,220
I can't do anything about this.

512
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,740
Hu.

513
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,570
Did you bribe someone
to get your lawyer's license?

514
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,530
Hey, you...

515
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,770
You had no problem living a high life.

516
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,130
So why are you having a problem

517
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,370
with this lawsuit?

518
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,260
I have two demands.

519
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:28,980
One,

520
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,530
I won't pay them a penny.

521

Two,

522
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,770
the project must not be delayed.

523
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,020
Settle this,

524
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,700
or get lost.

525
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,610
Fine.

526
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,700
What got you so worked up?

527
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,700
I do

528
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,570
have a way.

529
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,850
Problems

530
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,330
must be solved with reverse thinking.

531
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,220
We could

532
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,770
finish the work.

533
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,530
But you must have the guts for it.

534
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,660
Enough of your gibberish.

535

Are both parties willing to negotiate?

If that was the case,

I wouldn't be here.

547
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,090
We need the land
for the development of the village.

548
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,290
They should make sacrifices
for the greater good.

549
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,180
Why should we?

550
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,570
Just because you want us to make the sacrifice?

551

That is my home.

Your Honor,

554
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,660
we went through the era

555
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,220
where individuals were asked

556
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,090
to make sacrifices for the majority
and for the greater good.

to protect individual rights.

560
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,530

00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,610
the defendant's narrative unacceptable.

What more do you expect from me?

569
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,180
The acquisition of the land

570
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,130
was passed by the villagers'
representative conference.

571

They signed the contract

572

and we paid them.

573
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,460
We paid them more than once.

574
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,530
I have no idea

why they would take the matter to court.

I wouldn't have paid them.

I shouldn't have agreed to pay.

to our land.

He has disrespected the judge.

The defendant's attitude

631

should be taken into consideration
for the judgment.

Your Honor.

633
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,740
The Wang family's land

634
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,570
must be taken

635
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,740
to build a factory.

636
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,530
We told everyone the reasons.

637
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,370
Besides,

638
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,810
we paid for their lands.

639
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,050
As for the 60,000 yuan she mentioned,

640
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,740
it's not a compelling reason.

641
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,260
We deny its relation to this case.

642
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,220
On top of that,

643
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,500
they mentioned

644
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,700
that the construction damaged their shed.

645
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,900
But our company has informed them verbally

646
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,810
to clear

647
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,290
the space out as soon as possible.

648
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,530
They refused.

649
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,330
We think the plaintiff

650
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,980
is responsible for the consequences.

651
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,220
We hope that the Wang family
can consider the villagers' interest

652
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,980
and support the project.

653
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,810
If the Wang family refuses
to make way for the project,

654
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,460
we will let the court decide.

655
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,610
Did you hear that?

656
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,180
He's a lawyer.

657

He speaks with reasons.

658
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,740
You barely open your mouth when you talk,

659
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,740
and you call yourself a lawyer? How funny.

Bailiff, take them out.

680
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,500
What do you mean we lost the land?

681
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,810
Bring them outside.

682
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:12,980
Go on.

683
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,980
Go check on them.

00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,570
The court is adjourned.

688
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,220
Dad?

689
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,130
Go home now!

690
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,530
Wait.

691
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,610
What happened?

692
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,020
[People's Court of Fushui Town]
We lost the land!

693
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,330
They destroyed the land!

694
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,500
What do you mean?

695
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,090
They brought the bulldozers and tractors.

696
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,260
They leveled the place.

697
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,020
What about my vegetables?

698
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,050
Forget about the vegetables!

699
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:40,900
We lost the land!

700
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,050
Stop thinking about the vegetables!

701
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,330
They dug up a giant hole there!

702
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,180
They start laying the foundation.

703
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,020
You need to check it out now!

704
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,370
But the court hasn't ruled.

705
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,700
He has no right to destroy our land.

706
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,660
I'll talk to them.

707
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,290
Xingfu.

708
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,460
The court is adjourned.

709
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,130
Causing trouble

710
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,530
won't do us any good.

711
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,050
Look, go home first.

712
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,770
Trust me,

713
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,530
I'll handle it.

714
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,660
Mr. Guan,

715
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,220
you must help us.

716
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,770
Xingyun,

717
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,610
let's have a look at the damage.

718
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:03,940
We'll be going now.

719
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,050
Li,

720
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,530
it's time to get off work.

721
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,570
Alright.

722
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,460
Right away.

723
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,700
I'm going now.

724
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,610
Alright.

725
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,610
What brings you here?

726
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,370
I came because I missed you.

727
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,700
I don't need you to miss me.

728
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,700
Sit.

729
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,500
Come on.

730
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,980
It's never anything good when you see me.

731
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,220
There goes your officer's instinct.

732
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,090
You're no fun.

733
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,180
I bet

734
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,330
you're here because of the Wan Village's lawsuit.

735
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,500
You got that right.

736
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,850
I knew you were the right guy.

737
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,810
What is it?

738
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,260
I heard it was quite a merry court session.

739
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,180
Stop poking fun at me.

740
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,900
It can't be helped.

741
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,180
This is how it is in the village.

742
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,130
Law enforcement must treat everyone as equal.

743
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,770
It's about resolving problems.

744
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,850
I came here because I was hoping

745
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,980
that you could act

746
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,220
as a mediator.

747
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,220
The Wan Village

748
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,900
is under your jurisdiction.

749
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,050
You've known Wan Shantang

750
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,570
for many years.

751
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,130
You should be the mediator.

752
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,370
This time,

753
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,290
you miscalculated.

754
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,330
I did

755
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,610
whatever I could.

756
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,610
But it didn't work.

757
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,370
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

758
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,770
And because of the lawsuit,

759
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,770
Shantang has been quite upset with me.

760
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,180
He hasn't talked to me in days.

761
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:41,980
I think we should

762
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,420
leave it to the court.

763
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:44,980
But...

764
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,090
Do as you see fit.

765
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,220
That saves everyone the trouble.

766
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,770
I wish I could.

767
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,180
The case may appear simple enough,

768
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,180
but at this rate, it's going to get out of hand.

769
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,130
It's best that both parties
can come to a compromise.

770
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,900
Do whatever you must.

771
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,020
I'm staying out of this.

772
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,020
I'm going home.

773
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,020
But...

774
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,900
I'm going home.

775
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,940
You're going to leave now?

776
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,900
I'm getting off work already!

777
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,660
How about dinner? The bill is on me.

778
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,220
No.

779
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,290
No dinner.

780
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,770
You must have dinner with me.

781
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,810
I'm buying.

782
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,570
No way.

783
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,130
Your food is ready.

784
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,020
Thanks.

785
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,770
We agreed.

786
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,130
We are splitting the bill.

787
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,370
Come on.

788
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,370
Buying you dinner doesn't break any rules.

789
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,370
No.

790
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,940
We split the bill.

791
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,020
I don't want to owe you any favors.

792
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,810
The case itself is not that complicated.

793
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,330
Technically speaking,

794
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,660
both of them are right.

795
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,290
But there is a problem.

796
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,370
He destroyed the family's land.

797
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,460
He ruined their vegetables.

798
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,180
He didn't inform them
before the construction began.

799
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,700
And now, the Wang family
won't accept their terms.

800
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,530
If I must

801
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,220
pass judgment by the law,

802
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,810
it's doable.

803
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,180
But it's very likely

804
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,370
that none will be satisfied.

805
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,220
They will hold a grudge against each other.

806
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,530
That's not the purpose of our jobs.

807
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,260
Right?

808
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,180
Sir, madam.

809
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,460
Don't worry.

810
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,130
The more brazen they act,

811
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,610
the more likely we will win the lawsuit.

812
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,700
But they ran over our shed.

813
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,290
Those are our property!

814
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,700
The land too!

815
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,260
Those cost money!

816
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,130
We have to spend more money to buy the materials.

817
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,660
Xingyun and I

818
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,850
took photos as evidence.

819
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,530
Those in the wrong

820
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,050
must pay.

821
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,290
We will fight

822
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,500
to have the damage compensated.

823
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,130
Really?

824
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,530
Thank you.

825
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,700
If you can do that,

826
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,660
our money spent is well worth it.

827
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,220
Right?

828
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,330
Mr. Guan,

829
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,660
I still don't get it.

830
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,900
We took the case to court.

831
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,460
A lawsuit is underway.

832
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,260
Why would they do such a thing?

833
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,290
I speculate

834
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,260
there is only one reason.

835
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,810
They want to create an established fact.

836
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,530
Both parties

837
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,770
are already in contention.

838
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,530
One of the demands we make while filing the case

839
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,770
was to do as you said

840
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,770
and included

841
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,500
the demand

842
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,740
for the defendant to stop

843
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,020
reclaiming the plaintiff's contracted land

844
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,530
and the right of contracted management.

845
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,090
Normally,

846
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,660
a lawsuit that involves a plot of land

847
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,090
will take a long time.

848
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,180
Maybe their construction progress

849
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,130
was affected and interrupted.

850
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,180
But even so,

851
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,290
what they did was illegal.

852
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,090
They will pay for their wrongdoing.

853
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,900
Can we win this lawsuit?

854
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,660
As of now,

855
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,020
we are even more likely

856
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,260
to win the lawsuit.

857
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,500
Tomorrow morning,

858
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,850
I will speak

859
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,940
to the presiding judge.

860
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,330
Thank you.

861
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,260
Officer Li.

862
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:03,810
Hello.

863
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,530
We put the land leveling on halt.

864
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,570
Who ordered you to send in the construction team?

865
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,460
Are you aware of the consequences?

866
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,290
Everyone is saying our company

867
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,810
is exploiting the villagers!

868
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,020
This is not my fault.

869
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:45,940
All you want

870
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,220
is to avoid conflicts

871
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,530
so everyone would praise you

872
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,900
and call you a great leader

873
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,090
or a wonderful father.

874
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,290
Leaving the land there isn't doing us any good.

875
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,810
Look at the progress we're making.

876
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,050
They took the case to court,

877
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,290
so it's troublesome

878
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,220
and time-consuming.

879
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
If the court's ruling

880
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,660
puts us at a disadvantage,

881
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,700
we'll never be able to reclaim the land.

882
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,850
Where do we get the land

883
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,220
to build the sewage treatment plant?

884
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,330
When that problem arises,

885
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,570
our company will lose even more money.

886
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:22,660
Cailiang.

887
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,570
Did you know about this plan?

888
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,660
No.

889
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:27,660
Why you...

890
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,660
Enough.

891
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,850
Stop ranting.

892
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,660
Listen to me, Dad.

893
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,370
This is an established fact.

894
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,740
What the Wanjia Group did

895
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,660
was to create an established fact.

896
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,570
They disregard the law.

897
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,770
I asked you to come here

898
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,220
because I want to talk it through.

899
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:45,980
I want to see

900
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,610
if it's possible for the Wang family

901
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,260
to make some compromises.

902
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,810
Why?

903
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,370
They broke the law and we must make compromises?

904
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,660
Your Honor,

905
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,660
you call yourself a man of the law?

906
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:03,980
Of course I do.

907
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,130
Why wouldn't I?

908
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,570
My conscience is clear.

909
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:07,900
Guan Tao.

910
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,290
We are all men of the law.

911
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,660
We are people

912
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,220
who live in a rural area.

913
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,740
Our responsibility

914
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,530
is to ensure order and harmony in society.

915
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,850
Calm down.

916
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,130
I'll tell you my proposal.

917
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,260
Nowadays,

918
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,740
there are plenty of disputes
regarding land contracting.

919
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,020
We are paying

920
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,330
close attention to this case.

921
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,940
We've done a lot of investigation.

922
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,500
But there is a situation

923
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,530
before us

924
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,940
that the court can't decide.

925
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,050
If they were

926
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,130
to demolish the sewage treatment plant,

927
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,500
that small plot of land

928
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,090
will directly affect

929
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,570
the key project of our city,
the health products factory.

930
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,500
It's about the Wanjia Group's transformation.

931
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,220
On a bigger scale,

932
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,850
it might get in the way

933
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,740
of municipal or even provincial development.

934
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,460
But the defendant is too audacious.

935
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,220
Should we not uphold the law?

936
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,460
Yes, we must.

937
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,530
But the main problem is

938
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,260
that whether or not the construction has begun,

939
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,290
the factory

940
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,420
and the sewage treatment plant

941
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,130
must be built.

942
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,700
This matter concerns the Wan Village

943
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,900
and all its people.

944
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,460
We must take that into consideration.

945
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,370
In that case,

946
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,330
the court won't demand we restore the land

947
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,260
to its original state.

948
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,940
The cost would be simply too high.

949
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:26,810
Right?

950
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:27,980
Besides,

951
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,570
at least we have the land acquisition agreement.

952
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,740
We're not being totally unreasonable.

953
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,610
It's just a shed

954
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,740
and some plants.

955
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,530
We'll pay them.

956
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,940
It's not going to cost us.

957
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,220
This isn't just about the money!

958
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,330
Was this your idea?

959
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,050
I did it for the company's interest.

960
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,020
That doesn't mean

961
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,130
you can just do anything

962
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,130
outrageous!

963
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,330
Mr. Hu, you're not a child anymore.

964
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,500
Why did you give Chuanjia such a foolish idea?

965
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,570
Don't say that.

966
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,570
You made it sound like
I couldn't think on my own.

967
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,900
We shouldn't show any tolerance

968
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,500
to those who cross the line.

969
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,180
I did as you said

970
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,050
and talked to them.

971
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:06,700
And now?

972
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,980
They are suing us.

973
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,220
What should I do?

974
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,290
They kept asking for money,

975
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,500
and am I just supposed to pay them?

976
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,810
If we ever

977
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,330
need the villagers to cooperate,

978
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,290
no one will listen to us.

979
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,220
They would pull the same trick.

980
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,330
We should teach them a lesson.

981
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,020
Cut it out.

982
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,770
Go out.

983
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,020
Then...

984
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,330
I'll think about it.

985
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,290
Fine.

986
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,370
What do you propose, then?

987
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:37,850
Carry on.

988
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,220
Guan Tao.

989
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,940
You are a lawyer.

990
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,330
You should understand

991
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,460
that sometimes,

992
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,180
compromising

993
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,050
is a skill a lawyer must master.

994
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,470
You're right.

995
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,550
Legally speaking,

996
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,140
the law makes it clear

997
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,140
what must be done.

998
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,860
But the law

999
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,750
can't be followed blindly

1000
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,510
without considering the people of rural areas.

1001
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,990
What are you getting at?

1002
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,030
The local economic development

1003
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,660
must not be stopped.

1004
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,310
But the people's rights

1005
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,950
must be protected.

1006
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,100
I want to know if we can

1007
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,860
find a balance point

1008
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,820
given the situation.

1009
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,230
It's best

1010
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,790
if both parties can reach a consensus.

1011
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:26,820
Okay.

1012
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,820
I don't mind the negotiation.

1013
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,660
But look at what happened

1014
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,660
on the first day of court.

1015
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,660
They can't go unpunished.

1016
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,270
The law must not tolerate

1017
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,030
their bullying.

1018
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,550
Justice is important.

1019
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,420
But solving problems

1020
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,550
is the main goal, don't you think?

1021
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,180
Come in.

1022
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,620
My buddy is here.

1023
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,420
Come on.

1024
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,510
Don't bother knocking.

1025
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,750
[Wanjia Group]
Take a seat.

1026
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,790
Alright. Sit.

1027
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:08,950
See?

1028
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,270
You must have missed me.

1029
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,180
I don't miss you at all.

1030
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,830
I'm here to beg you.

1031
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,220
Forget it.

1032
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,700
Don't use that word with me.

1033
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,260
If this is about you,

1034
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,260
anything can be done.

1035
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,430
As for the other matters,

1036
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,220
don't even say a word.

1037
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,030
Li,

1038
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,220
I know you too well.

1039
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,070
You are here because

1040
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,180
we leveled Wang Youde's land.

1041
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,180
Shantang.

1042
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,700
When the Wang family was picked on by others,

1043
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,620
you were there to protect them.

1044
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,620
Why is different this time?

1045
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,620
Look at what you did.

1046
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,260
You took their land,

1047
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,180
you beat the son,

1048
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,910
and you refused to pay damages.

1049
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,950
You leveled their land

1050
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,700
before the court rules anything.

1051
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,300
You are leaving them with no choice.

1052
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,660
They could have come to me before they sued me

1053
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,620
and the company.

1054
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,780
If I don't suppress them,

1055
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,990
the other villagers

1056
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,780
will cause trouble too.

1057
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,950
The situation is different with them.

1058
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,220
So is everyone else.

1059
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,350
You could have talked nicely.

1060
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,580
Why did you have to level their land?

1061
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,910
Regard that,

1062
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,580
Chuanjia is in the wrong.

1063
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,660
I scolded him and the others.

1064
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,220
But then again,

1065
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,180
Chuanjia was worried

1066
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,030
because

1067
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:33,990
it concerns the common good.

1068
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,260
With proper development for all,

1069
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,580
the village will be benefited,

1070
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,780
including the Wang family.

1071
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,510
It's only right

1072
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,030
to teach them a lesson.

1073
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,550
What do we do now?

1074
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,910
Are you going to

1075
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,140
just ignore them?

1076
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
I'm not that cruel.

1077
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,070
I'm not a bandit.

1078
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,260
Look.

1079
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,220
The company will pay

1080
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,660
for the damage caused.

1081
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,870
On the other hand,

1082
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,510
I will pay for the 60,000 yuan

1083
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,300
they want.

1084
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,780
Then, I'll find a way

1085
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,140
to compensate them with a plot of land
the company owns.

1086
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,100
But on one condition,

1087
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,180
they must not get in the way of my project.

1088
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,740
See? I knew it.

1089
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,300
Chairman Wan here

1090
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,070
can be a little bossy,

1091
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,830
but he's not unreasonable.

1092
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,700
You wouldn't exploit them.

1093
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,950
The judge Mr. Wu was worried

1094
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,700
you might refuse to even communicate.

1095
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,780
I think he worried too much.

1096
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,870
He's not wrong.

1097
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,030
I wouldn't see him even if he was here.
I got my attorneys here.

1098
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,180
But since you came here personally,

1099
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,300
our friendship must mean something.

1100
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,990
Do you think this offer will satisfy them?

1101
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,830
You agreed to make compromises.

1102
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,390
I'm sure they will have no problem with it.

1103
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,580
But here's my question.

1104
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,870
This matter

1105
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,580
is a negotiation with both parties.

1106
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,070
We resolve the situation.

1107
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:49,830
Right?

1108
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,870
It's fair and square.

1109
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,990
I can't be the defendant.

1110
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,100
They are suing the company,

1111
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
not you.

1112
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,990
It's all the same!

1113
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,180
This project

1114
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,300
is a key project for our company.

1115
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,780
It's the star project of the city and the county.

1116
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,950
I can't be branded a villain just after it began.

1117
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,740
I want them to drop the case.

1118
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,580
Then, I'll make arrangements.

1119
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,700
Sure, that settles it.

1120
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:09,740
Wait.

1121
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,780
I got too upset

1122
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,510
and forgot about the tea leaves.

1123
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,180
I'll get them for you.

1124
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,350
Never mind.

1125
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,070
Wait, where did I put them?

1126
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,550
Alright, I'll send them to you later.

1127
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,620
I'll see you off.

1128
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,780
Hold on.

1129
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,870
Let's talk a little more.

1130
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,550
I think we can trust Shantang.

1131
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,830
It's all because

1132
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,830
of the money.

1133
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,220
The problem is solved.

1134
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,140
It's over.

1135
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,140
Right?

1136
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,030
Mr. Li,

1137
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,260
I disagree.

1138
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,100
They were only willing to negotiate

1139
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,030
after we sued them.

1140
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,830
They didn't want to make
any compromises before that.

1141
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,030
Otherwise,

1142
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,950
Qinglai wouldn't have been hurt.

1143
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,700
My father-in-law wouldn't have gotten sick.

1144
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,030
The court session has begun.

1145
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,030
We might as well bring this to the judge

1146
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,180
and talk it through in court.

1147
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,470
If we made the deal out of court

1148
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,220
and dropped the case,

1149
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,300
then he broke his promise,

1150
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,910
what do we do then?

1151
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,780
We were talking to the judge.

1152
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,220
Why do they suddenly want us back?

1153
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,140
The judge asked Officer Li for help.

1154
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,260
Sit.

1155
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,660
Sit.

1156
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,990
Officer Li,

1157
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,620
the case is now an ongoing legal proceeding.

1158
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,580
The court session began.

1159
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,390
There is no need to
talk the Wang family out of this.

1160
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,620
Young man.

1161
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,220
You lack experience.

1162
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,700
The law

1163
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,990
is good for us all.

1164
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,870
But in the countryside,

1165
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,740
we don't look at everything

1166
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,350
from the law's perspective.

1167
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,430
If you weren't a police officer,

1168
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,950
I would understand why you'd say that.

1169
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,950
But in any case,

1170
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,260
you are a law enforcer.

1171
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,070
You knew my client

1172
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,870
had already hired a lawyer.

1173
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,260
It's not appropriate to meet them in private.

1174
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,470
Mr. Guan.

1175
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,390
It's not about us here.

1176
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,260
This is about Youde's family.

1177
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,350
How about this?

1178
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,780
Youde,

1179
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,260
I've relayed

1180
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,100
Shantang's message for you.

1181
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,100
Your lawyer is here.

1182
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,620
What do you want

1183
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,260
and what do you choose?

1184
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,180
Tell him what you want.

1185
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,260
Tell him yourself.

1186
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,470
Dad.

1187
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,870
It took a great deal of resolve

1188
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,100
to get here.

1189
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,990
You must be certain about this.

1190
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,350
Mr. Guan.

1191
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,390
I have an idea.

1192
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,140
It's best

1193
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,870
that you stay out of this.

1194
00:39:59,100 --> 00:39:59,870
Mr. Guan.

1195
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,910
If we withdraw the case now,

1196
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,830
are they going to be held accountable

1197
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,260
for their wrongdoings in the village?

1198
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,700
If you withdraw the case,

1199
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,660
it's an out-of-court settlement.

1200
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,870
There is no right or wrong.

1201
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:18,580
Xingfu.

1202
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,100
Since

1203
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,220
Mr. Wan

1204
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,780
agreed to compensate us

1205
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,910
for the damage,

1206
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,700
we're not losing out

1207
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,260
on anything either.

1208
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,390
So,

1209
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,660
what's the point of the lawsuit?

1210
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,510
You...

1211
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,780
He's right.

1212
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,260
Well...

1213
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,740
That settles it.

1214
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,990
We all live in this village.

1215
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,510
We thought of everything we could do.

1216
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,180
The judge agreed.

1217
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,870
Mr. Wan agreed.

1218
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,260
See?

1219
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,300
Officer Li

1220
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,780
had to come all the way here.

1221
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,740
It must be very tiring.

1222
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,990
Let's do as Officer Li says.

1223
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,260
But, Mom...

1224
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,300
If we withdraw the case,

1225
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:10,660
no one in the village

1226
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,350
will think they're at fault.

1227
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,780
They might think

1228
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,550
we are slandering Mr. Wan
and blackmailing them with the land.

1229
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,470
That isn't right.

1230
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,660
We don't get to say what's wrong.

1231
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,430
Mr. Wan agreed

1232
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,180
to pay us.

1233
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,300
That means

1234
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,470
we are right all along.

1235
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,830
The villagers are wrong.

1236
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,910
Yes. At first,

1237
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,620
we only wanted compensation.

1238
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,350
But we wanted to defend our rights, too.

1239
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,470
We deserve justice.

1240
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,350
Are we just going to let it slide?

1241
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,470
Mr. Guan,

1242
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,140
what is your take on the matter?

1243
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,070
I'm a lawyer.

1244
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:53,990
I only hope

1245
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,620
for my client to be satisfied.

1246
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,550
If you insist on withdrawing the case,

1247
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,620
I need to draw up

1248
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,700
a settlement.

1249
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,830
That's right.

1250
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,780
It's decided.

1251
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:04,990
Well...

1252
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,470
That's it.

1253
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,990
It's a win-win for all.

1254
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,260
Mr. Guan.

1255
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,550
I'm terribly sorry

1256
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,100
for the trouble.

1257
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,950
It's alright. This is very common.

1258
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,030
But if we follow through
with the legal proceeding,

1259
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,950
we might be able to get better compensation.

1260
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,550
Mr. Guan.

1261
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,510
Life in the village

1262
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,510
is not the same as city life.

1263
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,910
They are just a small household.

1264
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,510
What matters is not losing out.

1265
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,180
Taking advantage of others is never good.

1266
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,830
How could you say that?

1267
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,870
We follow the legal procedures

1268
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,260
to defend the rights of my clients.

1269
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,390
You've been a police officer for years,

1270
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,620
how could you say such a thing?

1271
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,620
Well,

1272
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,470
the law is not without mercy.

1273
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,030
The villagers here

1274
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,300
are close.

1275
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,620
They should all live in harmony.

1276
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,030
Right?

1277
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,990
Alright, carry on. I must get going.
