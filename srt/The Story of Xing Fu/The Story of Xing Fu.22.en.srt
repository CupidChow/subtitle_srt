As to how others asked for your help to get a job,

00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,319
don't tell a word to Yani's father.

5
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,000
I heard from Guan Tao

6
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,920
that it's against the law.

7
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,000
For real?

8
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,239
Why are there so many laws nowadays?

9
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:46,680

Your apartment is well-decorated.

15

Not another gift.

16

Oh, come on.

20
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,400
I just received my commission.

21
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,159
Besides, this is the latest rice cooker.

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,040
You can preset the cooking timer.
It's very useful.

23
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,599
I can't come in empty-handed.

How much is your commission?

26
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,680
Oh, Qinglai.

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,960
With me, it's alright.

28
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:13,879
But when you're out there,

29
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,599
don't ask

30
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,800
anyone this kind of question,

31
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,439
including their salary.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,719
It's rude.

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,039
Is that so?

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,400
We weren't aware of it.

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,800
No worries.

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,719

37
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,000
how are you coping in Fangyuan Law Firm?

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,439
I heard

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,840
that they have been running a deficit.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,919
If that carries on,

41
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,319
it won't last long.

42
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
You need to have a plan.

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,319
Haven't I told you

44
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,520
that my work there with Guan Tao was fine?

45
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,560
Also,

46
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,919
it's not right to leave them

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,080
when they are in a crisis.

48
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,240
But even a puppy

49
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
needs to be fed.

50
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,000
It's just a kind reminder.

51
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,759
I'm not a puppy.

52

That's not what I meant.

And when the client was about to leave,

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,680
Stay hydrated, Mr. Liu.

180
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,639
But the working condition here

181
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,839
is a tad too rudimentary.

182
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,120
It's because we just started.

183
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,800
We start small.

184
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,639
Exactly.

185
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,560
Well,

186
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,319
Xingfu.

187
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,480
We need a moment with Mr. Liu.

188
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,800
Can you go outside for a while?

189
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,279
You can go back to your work.

190
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,680
Go.

191
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,639
Okay.

192
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,040
Don't mind it, Mr. Liu.

193
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,720
It's okay.

194
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,759
Carry on without me first.

195
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,600
Xingfu.

196
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,039
In a moment,

197
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,200
I'll need you to refill the water.

198
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Bring this in as well.

199
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,600
Okay.

200
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,000
Yidao was working with us

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
to handle the company's legal affairs.

202
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,120
Do you know

203
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,240
Mr. Han?

204
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,159
We have heard of him.

205
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,320
Is that so?

206
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,600
Yes.

207
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,240
Guan Tao used to work for him.

208
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,759
So...

209
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,320
What do you think of Mr. Han?

210
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,639
That's a complicated matter.

211
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,720
Guan Tao doesn't usually discuss

212
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,440
other lawyers behind their backs.

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,799
So we aren't too sure.

214
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,039
I see.

215
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,480
Because my friend

216
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,360
said Mr. Guan Tao

217
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,399
was a very decent person.

218
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,559
You two look young.

219
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,519
Have you handled

220
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,679
any major cases?

221
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,720
Mr. Liu,

222
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,840
you probably weren't aware of this.

223
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,480
Age

224
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,639
has nothing to do

225
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,159
with whether one has taken part
in major cases or not.

226
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,679
Yes.

227
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,879
Truth be told,

228
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,559
we have dealt with cases

229
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,279
that involved more than ten million yuan.

230
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,960
Can you tell me

231
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,120
more about it?

232
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Unfortunately, it's confidential.

233
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:50,919
Yes.

234
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,799
We signed

235
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,559
an NDA.

236
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,279
I see.

237
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,519
Then

238
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,120
can you tell me

239
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,240
who you represented?

240
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,679
I'm afraid we can't.

241
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,879
Yes,

242
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,720
we signed

243
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,360
an NDA.

244
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,240
We have to respect

245
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,360
our clients.

246
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,919
You see.

247
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,759
The cases themselves

248
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,000
is confidential.

249
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,399
The clients involved

250
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,879
are also confidential.

251
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,559
Yes.

252
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,240
It's quite unheard of.

253
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,279
Well, here's the thing.

254
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,679
A law firm

255
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,120
has its own rules.

256
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,440
We

257
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,159
are very serious

258
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,440
about our clients.

259
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,960
Xingfu,

260
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,639
refill, please.

261
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,320
Okay.

262
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,720
I know the firm isn't that big yet, Mr. Liu.

263
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,159
Right.

264
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,159
We just started.

265
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:03,759
Here,

266
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,480
Mr. Zhang.

267
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,799
What is this?

268
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,919
The court verdict.

269
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,440
The court verdict?

270
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,039
The court verdict

271
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,799
of your previous case is out.

272
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,799
We won.

273
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,639
Oh, that case.

274
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,279
That was a tough case.

275
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,320
Very tough.

276
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,000
Mr. Wang here

277
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:27,879
took on

278
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,159
a lost case

279
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,279
and finally

280
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,159
won the appeal.

281
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,639
But isn't this...

282
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,159
Xingfu.

283
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,679
Go back

284
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,480
to your work.

285
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,360
That's quite impressive.

286
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,679
I'm flattered.

287
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,720
You won the appeal

288
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,639
of a lost case.

289
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,360
You see,

290
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:53,919
our country

291
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,159
has put in place an appeal system.

292
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,279
It's like

293
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,080
a second hearing.

294
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,159
For this case,

295
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,039
the other lawyer

296
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,440
was a bit careless during the first hearing.

297
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,320
He missed one key piece of evidence.

298
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,639
We used it

299
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,919
in the court of appeal

300
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,200
to turn the tide.

301
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:08,879
Exactly.

302
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,480
Then,

303
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,720
as to my case...

304
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,240
Why don't you tell us more?

305
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,279
We need

306
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,200
more details.

307
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,240
Sure.

308
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,480
You see.

309
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,600
Please

310
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,840
have a look.

311
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,120
Sure.

312
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,639
This is...

313
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:33,960
Don't worry.

314
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,799
We'll do our best.

315
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,960
Come, Mr. Liu.

316
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:42,440
Okay.

317
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,440
Thank you. Bye.

318
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,120
Take care, Mr. Liu.

319
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,919
Sure.

320
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,120
So?

321
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,600
This might be the highest-paid case

322
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,679
since the establishment of this firm.

323
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,360
Xingfu.

324
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,799
It's all thanks to you.

325
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,039
Without you,

326
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,279
Mr. Liu

327
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,480
could never be convinced.

328
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,360
What?

329
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,039
What do I have to do with it?

330
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:12,879
You didn't get it?

331
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,320
You see,

332
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,120
One of Guan Tao's friends

333
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,000
recommended our firm to Mr. Liu.

334
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:18,919
Guan Tao

335
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,679
thought

336
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,519
he wouldn't pick us.

337
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,639
But we two

338
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,480
believe that if we can convince Mr. Liu,

339
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,039
it'll be our best chance
to turn things around here.

340
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,480
So both of us decided

341
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,639
to meet with Mr. Liu.

342
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,360
The rest is what you saw.

343
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,240
He wasn't too happy with our firm.

344
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,720
He thought it was too small

345
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,039
and we were too inexperienced.

346
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:37,879
Right?

347
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,600
But it's okay.

348
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,240
Weicheng

349
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,039
was my shill.

350
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,039
He said I was experienced

351
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:46,679
and efficient.

352
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,320
And you put up the perfect show.

353
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,879
Oh.

354
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,600
Especially you, Xingfu.

355
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:51,360
You

356
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,000
look trustworthy,

357
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,240
natural,

358
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,159
and graceful.

359
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,279
That dispelled the doubt left

360
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,279
in Mr. Liu.

361
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,639
You have contributed tremendously

362
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,080
to our law firm.

363
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,320
What are you doing?

364
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,240
Nothing.

365
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,759
We got Mr. Liu as our client.

366
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:09,799
That's all.

367
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,360
Are you sure?

368
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,519
I remember

369
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,360
he's hard to please.

370
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,879
He is.

371
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,639
But we have a secret weapon.

372
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,639
What secret weapon?

373
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,480
You extorted him?

374
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,120
What?

375
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,440
We would never do that.

376
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,960
Our secret weapon

377
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,919
is Xingfu.

378
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,639
Come with me to organize the documents.

379
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,840
Ask Xingfu if you have questions.

380
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,320
Hey.

381
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,919
Xingfu.

382
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,399
What happened?

383
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,159
They

384
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,840
met Mr. Liu who's recommended here by your friend

385
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
to talk about a case.

386
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,639
Then Mr. Zhang asked me

387
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,120
to send in a court verdict halfway through.

388
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,639
He then claimed that he won

389
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,519
an appeal.

390
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,919
But in fact,

391
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,799
I delivered

392
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,799
the court verdict

393
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,279
of the traffic case last week.

394
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,279
Mr. Liu suspected nothing

395
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,639
and proceeded to entrust them with the case.

396
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,559
Mr. Guan,

397
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,960
they lied.

398
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,519
Do you think it's right for us to do this?

399
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,840
Guan Tao.

400
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,440
I think

401
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,240
you're overreacting.

402
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,720
This is not a big deal.

403
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,320
Exactly.

404
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,840
No matter whether we took on big cases before

405
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,440
or won any appeals,

406
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,399
it won't affect him at all.

407
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,519
Once we take his case,

408
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,720
we'll do our best.

409
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:43,720
Won't that cut it?

410
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,159
Do you believe a word

411
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,240
you said?

412
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,159
If this won't affect anything,

413
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,360
why did you two

414
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,279
lie to him?

415
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,919
Because we're inexperienced

416
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,600
and he

417
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,279
might lose confidence in us.

418
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,840
If they don't have confidence in us,

419
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:00,679
we should do something

420
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,360
to inspire confidence.

421
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,279
I'll call

422
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Mr. Liu

423
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,879
to explain this to him.

424
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,960
Are you two okay with it?

425
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,759
No, Guan Tao.

426
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,559
I think

427
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,200
you're out of your mind.

428
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,320
Why can't we work on this case

429
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,679
to solve our current crisis first?

430
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,260
Once we have enough liquidity,

431
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,570
you can show your integrity then, all right?

432
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:24,930
No way!

433
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,930
You're lying.

434
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,770
Should we earn money by lying?

435
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,650
When the going gets tough,

436
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,530
you choose the easy way out.

437
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,530
Some deeds

438
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,810
are to be avoided forever.

439
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:36,930
If you commit it once,

440
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,500
it'll become a habit.

441
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,570
Right.

442
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,340
Yes.

443
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,050
I agree with you.

444
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,460
We understand.

445
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,020
But we're doing this

446
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,930
for our law firm.

447
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:46,650
All right?

448
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,220
Once we take on Mr. Liu's case

449
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,340
and the cash flows into the firm,

450
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,740
your salary will increase too.

451
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,620
Also, Guan Tao.

452
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,530
If you call him,

453
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,340
everything will be ruined.

454
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,410
Do you think it's worth it?

455
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,090
Why did we establish

456
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,180
our own firm?

457
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,660
Because we didn't like the work?

458
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,980
We didn't like the pay?

459
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,740
It's because we didn't like

460
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,740
their ethics.

461
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,050
We established our own firm

462
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,180
so that we can do what we think

463
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,130
is right.

464
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,050
But now, to get a big case,

465
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,020
the end justified the means.

466
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,050
So why did we even open this firm?

467
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,500
You're right, Guan Tao.

468
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,700
But who'd have thought

469
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,810
that it would be so hard at the start?

470
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,420
No one trusts us.

471
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,050
We don't even have

472
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,770
a proper case.

473
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,290
If this carries on,
this firm will be closed down soon.

474
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,220
What's the good of persisting
with your principles?

475
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,370
Then I'll quit!

476
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,810
If you don't want to stay, let's break it off here!

477
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,020
Also,

478
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,900
the decision has been made.

479
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,220
Before we sign the deal,

480
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,420
I have to clarify

481
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,370
everything to Mr. Liu.

482
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,260
Even if it means we can't get this case,

483
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,900
Fangyuan Law Firm

484
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,980
will not be a cheat!

485
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,530
Mr. Han,

486
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,330
Mr. Liu is waiting for you in the office.

487
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,775
[Yidao Law Firm]

488
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,260
Mr. Liu.

489
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,370
You sure are a busy man.

490
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:28,900
Zhao,

491
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,500
you're dismissed.

492
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:29,850
Okay.

493
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,460
Why are you here?

494
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,570
I thought you handed the case

495
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,050
to another law firm.

496
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,810
Mr. Gong

497
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,770
from Xiyan

498
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,020
recommended Guan Tao

499
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,610
to me.

500
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,940
He used to work here.

501
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,570
Guan Tao?

502
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,900
He left

503
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,850
not too long ago.

504
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,980
He established a small law firm

505
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,460
with some young lawyers.

506
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,980
I like to experiment.

507
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,740
I want to give the youth a chance

508
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,940
so I visited his law firm.

509
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,050
But I never heard of

510
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,330
any impressive cases

511
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,570
under his belt.

512
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,700
Well, I actually

513
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,050
know something about that.

514
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,570
You know, everyone

515
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,050
starts somewhere.

516
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,740
If you guys like each other that much,

517
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,500
why did you come here?

518
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,020
Truth be told,

519
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,980
before I headed to their law firm,

520
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,940
I hoped to use this case

521
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,370
to establish

522
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,740
a long-term partnership

523
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,180
with them.

524
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,530
Mr. Liu.

525
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,850
I gave you an inch. Do not take a mile.

526
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,370
You have signed the contract

527
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,530
and you came here.

528
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,090
Are you trying to brag?

529
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
If I

530
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,660
signed the contract with them,

531
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,180
why would I come here?

532
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,570
What do you mean?

533
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,900
I was thinking

534
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,570
that you

535
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,370
should handle this case.

536
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,570
It sounds like

537
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,020
there's more

538
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,290
to your story with Fangyuan.

539
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,530
I thought

540
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,460
the young ones should be

541
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,020
straightforward

542
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,090
and honest.

543
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,330
But guess what happened?

544
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,460
They

545
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,290
tried to con me.

546
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,660
Con you?

547
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,530
Please. Tell me everything.

548
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,090
They tried

549
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,290
to con a sly fox like you?

550
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,570
What did they say?

551
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,700
I want to learn from them.

552
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,940
They made things up.

553
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,130
They told me

554
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,980
they had worked on big cases.

555
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,260
I asked them what kind of big cases

556
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,460
but they couldn't answer.

557
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,530
And they claimed

558
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,700
that they had won the appeal

559
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,290
for a lost case.

560
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,420
Honestly,

561
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,850
I can understand

562
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,090
that young people

563
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,370
are less experienced.

564
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,530
But

565
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,660
if they think

566
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,940
they can always take the easy way out...

567
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:56,940
Once this becomes a habit,

568
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,050
it'll be grim.

569
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,290
Also,

570
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,530
when I was there,

571
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,180
I never said I wanted to look

572
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,290
at their achievements.

573
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,610
So...

574
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,020
I thought about it

575
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,530
and decided

576
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
to give you the case.

577
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,260
At least, I know

578
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,740
what you're capable of.

579
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,420
As expected of someone shrewd like you.

580
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:18,900
Sure.

581
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,980
A fine choice, it is.

582
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:22,850
You know what?

583
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,020
I'll let

584
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,500
He handle it.

585
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,420
She's familiar

586
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,180
with your company.

587
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,460
Deal.

588
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,290
Dig in.

589
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,770
Mr. Guan.

590
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,020
What are you doing?

591
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,530
Why are you buying me a meal?

592
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,130
Can you guess?

593
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:44,810
Is it because

594
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,610
the firm is closing down

595
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,090
so this is like a farewell meal?

596
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,500
Can you be more positive?

597
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:52,980
I...

598
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,220
I'm just worried that I won't receive

599
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,090
my salary this month

600
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,260
and I have to look for jobs again.

601
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,260
You

602
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
work very hard

603
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,770
but you don't get paid a lot.

604
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,570
Why are you so adamant

605
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,740
about doing things the right way?

606
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,530
My mother-in-law said the same thing too.

607
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,900
That I'm adamant

608
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,020
and headstrong.

609
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,900
But I don't think

610
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,980
it's a bad thing.

611
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,660
We should know

612
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,500
what's right and what's wrong.

613
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,220
Don't you think?

614
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,420
So

615
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,610
I treat you to this meal

616
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,260
to thank you.

617
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,980
For what?

618
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
I kept thinking,

619
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,090
if you weren't there to keep an eye on me,

620
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,180
to question me,

621
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,570
and to ask for justifications,

622
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,260
or if I knew about this

623
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,370
in a more private setting,

624
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,570
would I have acquiesced in their decision?

625
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,530
After all, this case

626
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,090
would bring in

627
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,420
a lot of money to the firm.

628
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,810
And we need money.

629
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,740
So you're thanking me for this?

630
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,330
Would you have condoned it then?

631
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,610
I don't know.

632
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
Do you think I'd have done it?

633
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,020
No.

634
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,130
Starting your own business

635
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,530
is as difficult as it is.

636
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,370
But you remain

637
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,090
a man of integrity,

638
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,330
a man of his word,

639
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,900
and a man who's hardworking.

640
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,980
You're trustworthy

641
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,020
and you can give people a sense of security.

642
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,460
I don't think you will do such a thing.

643
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:20,940
Xingfu,

644
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,420
you're more resilient than me.

645
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,900
You're an amazing person.

646
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,850
Don't you make fun of me.

647
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,130
If I'm amazing,

648
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,940
then everyone else

649
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,460
will be spectacular then.

650
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,020
Let's eat.

651
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,460
Hello, Xingyun.

652
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,570
What's the matter?

653
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,570
Senior.

654
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,610
Did Mr. Liu

655
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,220
[Archive]
go to your firm?

656
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,050
Yes.

657
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,260
How did you know?

658
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,050
He came to Yidao today

659
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,940
and has signed the contract.

660
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,980
I thought about it

661
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,980
and I felt the need

662
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,610
to inform you.

663
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,700
When Mr. Liu came today,

664
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,500
he left

665
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,330
scathing remarks about your firm.

666
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,180
I see.

667
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,460
It's just a reminder.

668
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,660
It's not good to get on a client's bad side.

669
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,610
I know.

670
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,530
Thank you.

671
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,420
I'm eating with your sister.

672
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,660
Do you want to talk to her?

673
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,180
No, thanks.

674
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,610
This is not a convenient time.

675
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,980
We can have a chat when we meet.

676
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,130
Sure. See you.

677
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,050
All right. Bye.

678
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
Xingyun told me

679
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,330
that Mr. Liu's case would no longer

680
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,050
be handled by us.

681
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,460
And it's their firm

682
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,220
that took over.

683
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,130
What?

684
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:41,980
Why?

685
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,220
I don't know.

686
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,290
Apparently, Mr. Liu

687
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,180
wasn't very happy with the meeting.

688
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,090
I didn't notice.

689
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,570
He seemed very happy

690
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,700
when he left.

691
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
He even said he would bring more documents.

692
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,370
What a sly fox.

693
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,740
It's okay. It's all in the past now.

694
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,850
Forget it. Just eat.

695
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:04,770
Here.

696
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,900
This soup is good.

697
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,900
Why are you on the bed?

698
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,020
Don't you have a night shift?

699
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,940
You came back late.

700
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,370
I sent you a message

701
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,290
and said I'd be late.

702
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,500
Guan Tao treated me to a meal.

703
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,290
And then we went back

704
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,420
to do some paperwork.

705
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,660
He treated you to a meal?

706
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,700
Why?

707
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,220
Just to talk about some business.

708
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,700
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

709
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,090
Let me cook some noodles for you.

710
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,570
Get up now.

711
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,020
Why would Guan Tao treat you to a meal?

712
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,530
It's about a case.

713
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,330
A businessman wanted us

714
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,570
to handle a case

715
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,370
but then something happened

716
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,700
and everything went sour.

717
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,130
And he treated you to a meal for that?

718
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,260
Is he crazy?

719
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,660
You won't understand anyway.

720
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,740
Guan Tao just said

721
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,700
that thanks to me,

722
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,740
he avoided doing something wrong.

723
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
You're just

724
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,900
a janitor.

725
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,330
What did you do to help him

726
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,290
to deserve a free meal?

727
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,330
You...

728
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,370
What's wrong with me being a janitor?

729
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Not only did I clean,

730
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,090
but I did a lot of other stuff too.

731
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,940
The three young lawyers there

732
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,020
don't have an assistant.

733
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,700
I helped them

734
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,980
with many things as well.

735
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,770
Don't you underestimate me.

736
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,460
I'm an important member of the firm now.

737
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,260
And maybe one day,

738
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
I'll become a receptionist.

739
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,460
And you'll be shocked.

740
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,370
You make yourself sound so capable.

741
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,020
You might think that you are important to them.

742
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,370
But they are probably thinking otherwise.

743
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,980
I don't care what people think of me.

744
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,850
I just have to do my duty.

745
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,610
I even wondered

746
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,370
when we could head back to the village.

747
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,330
Then I can ask around

748
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,130
and recommend our law firm

749
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,610
to those who need a lawyer.

750
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,530
You're even helping them

751
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,850
to look for more clients.

752
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,290
Will they pay you more?

753
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,050
You cannot think it that way.

754
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,180
If the firm declares bankruptcy,

755
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,610
I'll lose my job too.

756
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,740
I just think it's odd

757
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,770
that he treated you to a meal.

758
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,610
I'll invite you next time.

759
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,500
Then it won't be odd, right?

760
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,740
For this month,

761
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,020
the rent is 18,000 yuan.

762
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,460
The utility bill

763
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,740
is 4,200 yuan

764
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,020
in all.

765
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,900
The administrative expenditure

766
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,610
is 5,600...

767
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,810
I'll round it up to 5,700 yuan.

768
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,610
Xingfu's salary

769
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,610
is 1,500 yuan.

770
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,420
[Utility, Administrative Expenditure, Salary]

771
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,020
How much is it in total?

772
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,900
29,400 yuan.

773
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,530
We only had

774
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,810
a few small cases this month.

775
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,850
We'd be considered lucky

776
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,420
if we could earn 20,000 yuan.

777
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,500
See?

778
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,180
Another month in deficit.

779
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,090
The beginning is the toughest.

780
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,260
Oh,

781
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,610
after Mr. Liu

782
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,850
left,

783
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,220
he never came back.

784
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,180
I called him

785
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,260
and he never gave me a clear answer.

786
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,700
Did something happen?

787
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,130
His case

788
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,500
is now handled by Yidao.

789
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,180
We need to find a way

790
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,420
to look for new cases.

791
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,020
I never knew looking for clients

792
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,530
was this difficult.

793
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,530
Come in.

794
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,180
Mr. Guan.

795
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,050
Hi.

796
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:52,980
Madam,

797
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,290
this is Mr. Guan.

798
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,810
He represented my family

799
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,180
in the land dispute case.

800
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,330
Mr. Guan.

801
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,420
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Guan Tao.

802
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,330
Please have a seat.

803
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:03,770
Okay.

804
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:04,810
Take a seat.

805
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,500
Please sit here.

806
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,290
Xingfu.

807
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,090
Serve some water.

808
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,810
I'm not thirsty.

809
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,260
Don't go.

810
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,370
Stay here.

811
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,530
I...

812
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,530
I'll sit here then.

813
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,530
Have you encountered any problems?

814
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,570
Are you really from Wan Village?

815
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,940
Well, I couldn't tell at all.

816
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,610
I'm just in my work uniform. That's all.

817
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,220
I just started

818
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,290
working here.

819
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:39,900
Madam,

820
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:40,980
can you tell us

821
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,900
more about your problem?

822
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,260
Mr. Guan is here.

823
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,330
You know, Shiqiao Village...

824
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,020
It's just

825
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,050
when I mention it,

826
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,130
I get overwhelmed.

827
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,940
Calm down.

828
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,980
There's no outsider here.

829
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,850
Just tell me.

830
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,530
We plant apples there.

831
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,900
A few years ago, thanks to good sales,

832
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,370
a company came

833
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,810
to sign a bought deal.

834
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,020
They offered 1.5 yuan for one jin of apples

835
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,180
and they wanted all our produce.

836
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,460
We thought

837
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,900
even though it was lower

838
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,940
than the market price,

839
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,020
it saves us the hassle

840
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,130
and the risk.

841
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,570
So everyone

842
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,530
in the village

843
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,660
converted their farmlands

844
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,290
into orchards.

845
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,940
Now that the apple trees have matured

846
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,130
and the apples are ripe,

847
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,330
everyone has their land decked
with heaps of apples.

848
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,180
Not long ago,

849
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,290
they told us

850
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,940
apples weren't in high demand anymore

851
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,700
so they decreased the price

852
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,940
to 1.2 yuan per jin.

853
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,500
We thought to ourselves

854
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,420
that there were just

855
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,980
too many apples to be sold by ourselves.

856
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,090
So we agreed to it.

857
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,940
But then

858
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,260
they never came.

859
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,530
We were so desperate

860
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,420
and we went to them.

861
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,940
Then they told us

862
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,610
that apples were unsalable now

863
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,850
so they would withdraw from the deal.

864
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,940
We were at our wit's end

865
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,370
so we turned

866
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,290
to our previous clients

867
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,220
but they wouldn't buy from us again.

868
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,090
They had already bought enough apples.

869
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,770
It's so unfair.

870
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,660
A year of hard work

871
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,050
is now rotting

872
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,770
at our home.

873
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,050
They violated the agreement.

874
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,180
Madam,

875
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,850
did you guys sign a contract?

876
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:16,850
Yes, we did.

877
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,940
Of course, we did.

878
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,660
But they refuse to acknowledge it.

879
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,700
Why is our life

880
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,050
so tough?

881
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,900
Right.

882
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,370
I sympathize with you.

883
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,900
But we have Mr. Guan here.

884
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,290
He'll help us.

885
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,050
I'm so worried.

886
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,420
One year of hard work

887
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
is rotting at home.

888
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,020
My baby still needs to be breastfed.

889
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,290
Due to my anxiety,

890
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,660
I stopped lactating.

891
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,850
Now that I cannot breastfeed my baby,

892
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,570
he cries every day.

893
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,370
It pains me to see it.

894
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,940
Wipe your tears, madam.

895
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,050
Why are they crying?

896
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,810
I know, right?

897
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,330
Why...

898
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,740
Why are they both crying?

899
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,050
You idiot.

900
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,980
This is Xingfu's strategy

901
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,130
to bond with the client.

902
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,290
A strategy, you say?

903
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,050
Maybe you can pull it off in front of me

904
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:30,530
next time.

905
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,420
Being with you here

906
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,020
and ranting to you

907
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,980
has made me feel better.

908
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,330
Actually, my family

909
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,650
was against my signing the contract

910
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,740
with the company.

911
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,410
But I insisted

912
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,610
that a sales and purchase agreement

913
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,940
with a large company like that

914
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,810
would be very reliable.

915
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,330
That's why I signed it.

916
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,810
Now that this has happened,

917
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,570
my family resents me.

918
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,300
I don't have a space to vent.

919
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,940
Do you think I can be helped?

920
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:07,940
Of course.

921
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,300
There must be a way.

922
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,570
You

923
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,570
came here

924
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,330
to look for a solution, didn't you?

925
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,740
Like

926
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,570
talking

927
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,020
to the lawyers?

928
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:18,540
Yes.

929
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,060
But I don't know anything.

930
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,460
That's precisely

931
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
why lawyers represent us

932
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,810
in a legal case.

933
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,220
Madam,

934
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,300
if you trust me,

935
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,570
you should trust Mr. Guan too.

936
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,220
He'll definitely help us.

937
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,370
All right.

938
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,370
If you say so,

939
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,570
I believe you.

940
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,980
But I don't have a lot of money.

941
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,060
Don't worry

942
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,410
about the money.

943
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,810
We can discuss it

944
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,940
once the case

945
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,780
is settled.

946
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:58,780
But now,

947
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,220
I want you to give me

948
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,090
the name of the company you signed

949
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:02,650
the contract with

950
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,020
and the content

951
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,890
of the agreement.

952
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,090
Here, madam.

953
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,130
See you.

954
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,290
Take care.

955
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:17,940
Xingfu.

956
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,290
I'm so glad

957
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,730
that I found you.

958
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,770
I'll let them

959
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,940
handle this case then.

960
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,420
We're from the same region.

961
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,290
Keep an eye on my case, will you?

962
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,500
Don't worry.

963
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,290
They

964
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,610
are very hardworking.

965
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,980
I'm sure they'll handle it very well
without any supervision.

966
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,020
All right.

967
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,690
I'll leave then.

968
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,210
If you ever head back,

969
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,290
do take a detour

970
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,770
and drop by my place.

971
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,570
Of course.

972
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,540
Please keep an eye on my case.

973
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,420
Have a safe trip.

974
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:41,860
Okay.

975
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,650
Bye.

976
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,650
Bye.

977
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,250
Mr. Guan.

978
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,130
How much is this case worth?

979
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,650
Not a lot.

980
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,570
But it's okay.

981
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,210
It's not a lot

982
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,460
but it's for the greater good.

983
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:07,730
Can't...

984
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,690
Can't win an argument against you then.

985
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,290
But you save money

986
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,290
little by little.

987
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,500
I earn 1,500 yuan per month

988
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,540
and you don't see me complaining.

989
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,340
Talking about money again?

990
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,210
If you want a raise,

991
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,210
just tell me.

992
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:24,860
Xingfu.

993
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,500
Don't worry.

994
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,340
You just

995
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,500
found us

996
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,250
a huge case.

997
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:31,940
What?

998
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,290
Didn't you just say

999
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,610
it's a small case?

1000
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,060
Her case alone

1001
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,250
is a small one.

1002
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,820
But what comes after

1003
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,020
is a lot.

1004
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,170
If we win this case,

1005
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,730
more farmers will turn to us

1006
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,980
for legal affairs.

1007
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,900
Slowly but surely,

1008
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,290
we'll get the money rolling.

1009
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,290
Right.

1010
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:53,650
Oh.

1011
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,380
Be prepared.

1012
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,690
You have a business trip
to Shiqiao Village in a few days.

1013
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,500
What business trip?

1014
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,170
It's just like

1015
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,210
what I did with your sister last time.

1016
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,460
We went to your hometown.

1017
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,900
We'll go to Shiqiao Village

1018
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,940
to understand

1019
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,900
the difficulty they face.

1020
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,460
What can I do there?

1021
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,770
A lot.

1022
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:15,940
Okay.

1023
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,940
Then

1024
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,460
did I make

1025
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,820
a contribution?

1026
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,340
Will I be allowed

1027
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,770
to visit my child on my way back?

1028
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,060
What do you say,

1029
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,060
my friends?

1030
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,690
I...

1031
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,340
Stop pretending.

1032
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,020
That's a yes.

1033
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:33,770
Yes.

1034
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,250
Qinglai.

1035
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,130
You said Mr. Xu was your uncle

1036
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,900
but he always

1037
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,210
ignores you.

1038
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,650
Are you sure?

1039
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,130
Am I supposed to show you

1040
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,130
how close we are?

1041
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,730
My brother keeps pestering me.

1042
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,610
Is the favor he asked for

1043
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,690
feasible or not?

1044
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,420
Of course.

1045
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,610
Definitely.

1046
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,130
The Provincial Bureau

1047
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:55,980
asked our department

1048
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,460
to do the report this time.

1049
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,940
I had my secretary

1050
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,570
send you the report materials yesterday.

1051
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,380
Have you looked at it?

1052
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,210
I have.

1053
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,420
Actually,

1054
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,210
you didn't need to go through me.

1055
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,770
Just report

1056
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,650
the facts.

1057
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,610
Right.

1058
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,420
But

1059
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,210
this is a serious matter.

1060
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,060
If I have the support from you, the mayor,

1061
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,610
it'll be safer.

1062
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,060
Uncle.

1063
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,340
Uncle.

1064
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,610
How is Mrs. Xu?

1065
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,340
Lift the bar up.

1066
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,090
Are you sure Mr. Xu is your uncle?

1067
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,460
Apparently not.

1068
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,610
Once you're an official,

1069
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,380
you become too lofty for your relatives.

1070
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,900
[Serve the People]

1071
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,210
Who's that?

1072
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,650
My rela...

1073
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,380
Not even a relative.

1074
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:20,980
A distant relative

1075
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,250
from my hometown,

1076
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,500
at most.

1077
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,730
You gave him the job?

1078
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,420
Back then,

1079
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,730
several guards complained

1080
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,090
about the low wage

1081
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,020
and left.

1082
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,290
We needed people

1083
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,820
so I recommended him to them.

1084
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:34,860
But of course,

1085
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,690
the security department decides
if he's up for the job.

1086
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,250
Be careful.

1087
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,940
Don't make others think

1088
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,170
it's nepotism.

1089
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,650
Thanks for the reminder, Mr. Mayor.

1090
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,770
I will take note of it.

1091
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,090
Hey.

1092
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,770
Qingzhi.

1093
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,170
Tonight,

1094
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,690
if you're free,

1095
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,860
come visit.

1096
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,650
I need to talk to you.

1097
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,290
Dear.

1098
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,210
You're back.

1099
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,020
You're off-duty now?

1100
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:26,980
I have left some dishes for you.

1101
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,730
Eat them.

1102
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,860
Why are you packing?

1103
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,340
For a business trip.

1104
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,090
What?

1105
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,610
Business trip.

1106
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,650
It means the company pays me

1107
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,610
to travel to another place for work.

1108
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,730
It's near our house

1109
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,770
so I can visit Little Dou.

1110
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,060
Look at you.

1111
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,340
What can you do?

1112
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,250
To help with a case, of course.

1113
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,090
I helped the law firm

1114
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,940
get a big case.

1115
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,570
Guan Tao asked me to tag along.

1116
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,650
Look how happy you are.

1117
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,570
He could be trafficking you

1118
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,020
and you would still be clueless about it.

1119
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,900
I'm not worth a lot anyway.

1120
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,210
Why would someone traffic me?

1121
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,250
You're paid 1,500 yuan per month

1122
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,770
and you have to handle cases too.

1123
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,130
I think he's treating you like a slave.

1124
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,500
You're being taken advantage of

1125
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,500
and you happily comply.

1126
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,460
Wang Qinglai.

1127
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,130
Why are you so distrustful?

1128
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,610
He thinks highly of me.

1129
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,690
Also, what do I have?

1130
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,610
What do I have to be taken advantage of?

1131
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,060
They like to bully people from rural areas.

1132
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,130
Other than those born in the city,

1133
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,940
even those who came from the rural areas

1134
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,060
turn into a different person
once they become rich

1135
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,610
and powerful.

1136
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,460
Who are you talking about?

1137
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,500
Who else could it be?

1138
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:44,900
Qingzhi's father-in-law.

1139
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,500
He thinks he's all high and mighty.

1140
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,170
He travels around

1141
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,250
but he just ignores me.

1142
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,500
I went to greet him

1143
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,250
with a smile

1144
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,340
but he didn't even look at me.

1145
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,090
Isn't he just a director?

1146
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,290
Back then, I thought he was someone important
in the county.

1147
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,290
But now I know

1148
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,940
that he's no one major in the city.

1149
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,690
You're a security guard.

1150
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,340
Why do you have to approach him?

1151
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,130
I can't?

1152
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,290
Because I'll bring disgrace

1153
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,250
or shame?

1154
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,290
In that case,

1155
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,500
just fire me.

1156
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,020
I...

1157
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,130
I wanted to help

1158
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,340
but now, it's a problem.

1159
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,570
Sorry,

1160
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,770
Mr. Xu.

1161
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,730
If you think it's inappropriate

1162
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,380
for him to work there,

1163
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,420
I'll find another job

1164
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,690
for him.

1165
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,690
If you could,

1166
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,060
I wouldn't have to help you.

1167
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,570
I just need you

1168
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,820
to tell him

1169
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,380
that he and I

1170
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,460
are two individuals.

1171
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,130
We have no relation whatsoever.

1172
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:36,650
All right?

1173
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,860
I don't want any trouble.

1174
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:38,570
Don't worry.

1175
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,570
I'll make it clear to him.

1176
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,650
I'm sure you know

1177
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,020
my wife disapproves

1178
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,060
of you

1179
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,210
and Yani.

1180
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,250
And I have been having your backs.

1181
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,250
You know why?

1182
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,460
Because I believe in you.

1183
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,900
I know you'll be successful.

1184
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,570
Yani will have a happy life with you.

1185
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,730
If you let me down,

1186
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,570
then it'll reflect badly on me

1187
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,820
in front of my wife.

1188
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,690
I understand, Mr. Xu.

1189
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,340
I do.

1190
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,020
Did the Organization Department

1191
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,540
get in touch with you?

1192
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,980
They assigned me

1193
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,380
to be the secretary

1194
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:17,980
for Deputy Mayor Xiang.

1195
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,090
This is an important step

1196
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,170
in your life.

1197
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,690
Life is quite simple

1198
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,610
when you look at it.

1199
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,020
There are only

1200
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,340
a few turning points

1201
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:28,900
in life.

1202
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,610
Pick the right turn

1203
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,540
and you'll have a bright future.

1204
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,730
Before you take up the post,

1205
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:36,380
I have

1206
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:37,540
a warning for you.

1207
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:40,570
Mr. Sun

1208
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,060
of the Provincial Bank

1209
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,420
is under investigation.

1210
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,250
Are you aware?

1211
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,610
Yes.

1212
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,650
Including his secretary

1213
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,420
and his driver.

1214
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,460
Secre...

1215
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,060
That's why

1216
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,090
secretary

1217
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,730
is a risky job.

1218
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,570
Do it well

1219
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,860
and you might get promoted quickly.

1220
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,570
It's a fast track.

1221
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:03,290
But if you are not careful,

1222
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,250
you lose

1223
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,210
