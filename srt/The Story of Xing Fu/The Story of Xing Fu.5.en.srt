This custom

13
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,760

16
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,439

Wedding hazing isn't allowed now?

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,560
If so, there's no meaning in holding the wedding.

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,919
It will no longer be lively.

27
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,120
I think this is pretty good.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,439
Wedding hazing has been getting out of hand
for the past few years.

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,520
When the Song family of Shuiwei Village
was getting a daughter-in-law,

30
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,439
their wedding hazing went too far.

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,319
The bride committed suicide on the same night.

32
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,000
So...

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,680
The wedding became a funeral instead.

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,840
Exactly.

35
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,719

You're worried for nothing.

40

I think his wife

41

is still unborn yet.

42
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,879
Maybe she's still inside her mother's tummy.

I hope Xiuyu

174
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,959
can achieve everything

175
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
she wants in life.

176
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,319
Thank you, Qingzhi.

177
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,199
You should stop it.

178
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,439
If you continue this,

179
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,959
she'll become prouder and prouder.

180
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,279
By then,

181
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,920
even the Wan Village wouldn't be enough for her.

182
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Mom, what are you saying?

183
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,800
Mom, I think it's great that Xiuyu

184
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,160
wants to improve herself.

185
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:32,759
Xiuyu,

186
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,040
tell me

187
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,079
about your ambition.

188
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,480
I'll support you all the way.

189
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:38,959
Qingzhi,

190
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,240
I don't want to work in the Group's office.

191
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,440
I just do menial tasks

192
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,799
and run errands every day.

193
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,559
Even an uneducated person can do the same thing.

194
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,679
Even so,

195
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,759
the people in the company
were still gossiping about me.

196
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,879
They said I got the job

197
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,759
by relying on my ties with Chuanjia.

198
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,840
They say I'm earning a lot by doing a little work.

199
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,240
That infuriates me.

200
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,799
Look at you.

201
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,480
You're a woman.

202
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,200
Isn't it great to have an easy job?

203
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,320
Why are you still not content?

204
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,320
Xiuyu, I support you.

205
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,279
What about this?

206
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,559
You can tell me

207
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,759
what books you need.

208
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,679
I'll buy them for you.

209
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,080
Thank you, Qingzhi.

210
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,679
In the future, I'll deal with all the chores.

211
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,720
You just need to study.

212
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,879
I support you too.

213
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,960
You guys should stop spoiling her.

214
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:21,799
Qinglai,

215
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,679
let me refill your cup.

216
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,399
Come on.

217
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,039
Let's have another cup.

218
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,360
Okay.

219
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,960
Alright.

220
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,279
Who offended you?

221
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,480
What's with the long face?

222
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
Does the food taste bad?

223
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,519
Who do you think offended me?

224
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,600
What do you mean by that notice?

225
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,039
That's just like slapping my face in public.

226
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,159
You better know what's good for you.

227
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,600
You're one of the party leaders too.

228
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,279
How dare you say that

229
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,600
when you didn't have the guts
to own up to your mistake?

230
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,600
I'm cleaning your butt for you.
(*clear up a mess)

231
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,759
But now, you're upset with me?

232
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,679
We're eating now.

233
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,360
Stop talking about the butt.

234
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,480
Besides,

235
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,279
I'm not disabled.

236
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,320
I don't need your help.

237
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,240
Ask her to come to me if she's that capable.

238
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,600
Ask her to come to me.

239
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,320
I'll show her the power of the Wan family.

240
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,159
Try it if you dare.

241
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,559
Are you done?

242
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,080
Listen up. You better stop.

243
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,559
You better listen carefully.

244
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,000
Never mention that again.

245
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
If you don't listen to me,

246
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,879
I'll strip you of your position
as the general manager.

247
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,600
I hate it when you do that.

248
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,480
Can't we just target the issue at hand?

249
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,159
Why must you suppress me

250
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,759
with your stupid rank and power?

251
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,519
In the company, I'm the chairman.

252
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,919
In the family, you're my son.

253
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,879
Why should I keep you around

254
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,159
when you don't listen to me?

255
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,960
Look at how arrogant you are.

256
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,000
Fine, you're the best.

257
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,200
You're amazing.

258
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,639
That's all you can do in front of me.

259
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Do you really think that I know nothing?

260
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,480
You're just admitting your mistake

261
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,519
and bowing down to her

262
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,759
by publishing that post.

263
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,679
Can you use your brain for once?

264
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,120
Don't you know this well enough?

265
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,360
Do you know how many incidents

266
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:52,879
have happened

267
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,919
because of wedding hazing

268
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,679
all these years ago?

269
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,120
This is a great opportunity.

270
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,559
We should abolish it

271
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,559
using this opportunity.

272
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,279
So, according to you,

273
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,240
I've made some contributions, huh?

274
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,000
Dear,

275
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,240
here.

276
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,240
Here's your foot bath.

277
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,120
What?

278
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,200
Are you not ignoring me now?

279
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,960
I don't dare to ignore you.

280
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
You're amazing.

281
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,559
Even Mr. Wan is listening to you now.

282
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,039
He's not listening to me.

283
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,480
He's just upholding justice for me.

284
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,200
Yes.

285
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,879
With justice on your side, you can go anywhere.

286
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,559
This time, I can tell

287
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,320
that Mr. Wan is a reasonable individual.

288
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,159
I will show him respect in the future.

289
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:47,679
Okay.

290
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,000
Come on, let me add some water for you.

291
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,399
Raise your feet.

292
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,840
Okay.

293
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:03,679
Actually,

294
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,879
when you think about it,

295
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,879
everyone wishes to lead a good life,

296
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,799
don't you think so?

297
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,840
When I was suffering in silence,

298
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,200
I was thinking

299
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,679
that my family could make a comeback

300
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,000
if I endure the suffering and support

301
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,759
my siblings for their studies until they make it.

302
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,720
By then, we don't need to bow to anyone.

303
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,200
It's especially tough for my family

304
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,240
to get to where we are now.

305
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,879
And my parents are old now.

306
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,200
This family

307
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,399
can only depend on us in the future.

308
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,039
That's why we have to see the bigger picture.

309
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,519
Don't worry.

310
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,440
Both of us are the eldest child of the family.

311
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I can understand your feelings

312
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,960
perfectly well.

313
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,840
However, I do not agree with one thing.

314
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,360
Although we should avoid trouble,

315
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,840
it doesn't mean we need to avoid confrontations.

316
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,919
We can't just allow people
to bully us for no reason.

317
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,399
You have a great personality.

318
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,600
No wonder Mom was praising you to no end.

319
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,759
Even Mom is praising me.

320
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,919
Why aren't you praising me, then?

321
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:18,360
Huh?

322
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,080
I did praise you.

323
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,279
When?

324
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,519
I...

325
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,919
I praised you in my heart.

326
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,879
That doesn't count.

327
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,600
You have to praise me with your words.

328
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,120
I can't bring myself to speak.

329
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
You have to do it.

330
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,440
I'll do it then.

331
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,639
Get me a son.

332
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,960
You're out of your mind.

333
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,759
How did you know?

334
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,519
Xingfu,

335
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,960
you're already awake?

336
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,559
Mom, you're up?

337
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm not used to sleeping in.

338
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,080
When I was at home,

339
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
I had to get up early to prepare breakfast

340
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,879
for Xingyun before she headed to school.

341
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,639
I'm getting older.

342
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,679
I don't sleep that much now.

343
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,320
I fell asleep happily last night

344
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,799
when I heard that you had returned.

345
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,480
Don't do that!

346
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,080
I can prepare the firewood
since I haven't washed my hands.

347
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,200
You can prepare the noodles.

348
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,919
Mom, you should sleep
without any worries in the future.

349
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,399
Just leave all the cooking to me.

350
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,120
Let's cook together.

351
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,279
We can cook together.

352
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,519
Breakfast

353
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,240
is ready?

354
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,879
Come here.

355
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,399
What time did you guys wake up to prepare them?

356
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,519
Qingzhi,

357
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,559
the flatbread that Xingfu made is delicious.

358
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,080
She'll serve them soon.

359
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,200
Coming.

360
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,720
Xingfu.

361
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,240
Here.

362
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,000
Here's the fresh flatbread.

363
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,559
It's piping hot.

364
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,080
Have this.

365
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,759
Eat up.

366
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,840
Xingfu,

367
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,159
the flatbread you made is amazing.

368
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,799
It's better than my mom's.

369
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,120
You're forgetting about your mother already?

370
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:16,960
Don't say that.

371
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,279
I don't dare to compete with Mom.

372
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,639
I'll make more once you finish them.

373
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,399
Xingyun

374
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,720
loved the flatbread I made when I was at home.

375
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,039
But now, she can't have them
since she's in the city.

376
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:26,639
Xingfu,

377
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,399
I'll return to the city later.

378
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,279
What about this?

379
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,639
You should pack some for me later.

380
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,679
I'll deliver them to Xingyun.

381
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,200
Really?

382
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,360
Qingzhi,

383
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,679
I have another favor to ask.

384
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,399
You see, Xingyun

385
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,720
just graduated from university.

386
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,639
She's still new to society.

387
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,039
Do you have any jobs

388
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,919
you can recommend to her?

389
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,559
She was a law student.

390
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,919
It's best if she can get a job

391
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,440
as a lawyer.

392
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,159
It's fine if you don't have any jobs for her.

393
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,600
Please take care of her for my sake then.

394
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,120
A young girl like her is living in the city alone.

395
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,320
She's unfamiliar with the place too.

396
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,440
I'm just worried about her.

397
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,480
Xingfu,

398
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,000
now that you've mentioned it,

399
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,120
one of my friends happens to work in a law firm.

400
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,120
Later, I'll ask him

401
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,559
if his law firm is recruiting any new employees.

402
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,159
That's great!

403
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,559
Thank you, Qingzhi.

404
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,519
Why are you thanking him?

405
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,399
We're a family.

406
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,679
It's Qingzhi's duty to do so.

407
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,440
Yeah, Xingfu.

408
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Why are you being courteous with me?

409
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,559
We're a family.

410
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,120
-Thank you.
-Let's dig in.

411
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,360
You must take care of yourself

412
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,120
when you return to the city.

413
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,810
Greet your girlfriend for me.

414
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,340
You're a man. Be the bigger person.

415
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,290
Qingzhi!

416
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,020
Xingfu.

417
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,570
Qingzhi,

418
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,740
here's the flatbread.

419
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,140
You can have one pack.

420
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,650
Please deliver the other pack to Xingyun.

421
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,500
Alright.

422
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,570
I'll leave Xingyun to you then.

423
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,690
No problem, Xingfu.

424
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,980
Thank you for the flatbread.

425
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,690
Don't mention it.

426
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,980
By the way, Xingfu,

427
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,890
please take care of my parents.

428
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,260
Look at what you're saying.

429
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,530
It's my duty.

430
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,220
Don't worry.

431
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,890
Remember to eat well, okay? Don't starve yourself.

432
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,570
Alright, you may go now.

433
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,410
Be careful.

434
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,260
See you.

435
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,530
Be careful, okay?

436
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,260
Be careful.

437
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,380
Goodbye, Dad, Mom, Xingfu!

438
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,700
Watch out for vehicles, okay?

439
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,850
Goodbye!

440
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,050
Hello?

441
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,850
Qingzhi?

442
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,530
What's the matter?

443
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:40,530
Hello,

444
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,180
Xingyun?

445
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,020
I just returned to the city.

446
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,660
Your sister told me to bring something to you.

447
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,660
Where are you?

448
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,740
I just finished my interview.

449
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,420
Alright.

450
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,810
I'll send you my location then.

451
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,050
You can come here.

452
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,130
Okay.

453
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,660
See you later.

454
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,740
Okay, goodbye.

455
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,770
Goodbye.

456
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,500
Over here!

457
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,700
Xingyun.

458
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,050
So,

459
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,530
this is the flatbread

460
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,090
your sister told me to give to you.

461
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,700
Keep them well.

462
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,050
-Thank you.
-I think they're cold now.

463
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,260
It's my favorite.

464
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,130
Xingyun,

465
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,570
how's your job hunting?

466
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,810
I haven't found a job yet.

467
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,700
Don't be anxious.

468
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,500
I'm meeting with a friend who works in a law firm.

469
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,220
We got to know each other
because we played sports together.

470
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,900
However, I haven't told him

471
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,370
about the favor yet.

472
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,220
He's pretty eccentric.

473
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,370
I'm afraid he might not show up

474
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,370
if I tell him about the favor.

475
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,900
What?

476
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,180
If that's the case,

477
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,770
why don't you guys go ahead?

478
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,020
I'll make a move first.

479
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,220
Don't go!

480
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,090
You have to be here.

481
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,740
You see, you're a young lady,

482
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,180
and this is your first meeting with him.

483
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,220
I'm sure he's too embarrassed
to reject your request.

484
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,330
What if it works out?

485
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,130
Am I right?

486
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,090
Just sit down. It'll be fine.

487
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,090
He's coming.

488
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,050
Guan Tao.

489
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,370
Yes, that's the place.

490
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,290
I'm already here.

491
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,330
Guan Tao!

492
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,130
You found yourself a nice place, huh?

493
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,660
I almost got lost.

494
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,420
It's pretty good. Long time no see.

495
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,940
Long time no see.

496
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,020
It's been so long.

497
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,610
Let me introduce someone to you.

498
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,020
This is Xingyun, the younger sister

499
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:19,700
of my sister-in-law.

500
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:20,980
Xingyun,

501
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,220
this is Guan Tao,

502
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,500
the buddy I had mentioned

503
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,020
to you just now.

504
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,420
I'm Guan Tao.

505
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:25,980
Nice to meet you.

506
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
I'm He Xingyun.

507
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,770
Nice to meet you.

508
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,500
Nice to meet you.

509
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:30,900
Don't sit here.

510
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,700
Sit over there.

511
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,660
I have to put my bag here.

512
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,220
You've gained some weight.

513
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,610
Seems like you're doing well
as a government servant.

514
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,020
Do you still play sports?

515
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,050
I don't have time for that.

516
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,570
I'm busy with work all day.

517
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,330
What about you?

518
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,220
I do play sports occasionally.

519
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,370
But when I get busy,

520
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,420
I feel like punching someone.

521
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,770
This place is pretty nice.

522
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,940
I haven't been here before.

523
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,530
It's a new place.

524
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,980
Order some food.

525
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,290
Ladies first.

526
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,570
You don't even know that?

527
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,660
-Go ahead.
-I don't know what to order.

528
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,330
You should do it.

529
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,020
If so, I'll order something for you guys.

530
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,700
Guan Tao,

531
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,180
I have something to ask you.

532
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,020
Is your law firm recruiting any new staff lately?

533
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,460
It's like this.

534
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,570
Xingyun just graduated
from university this year.

535
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,740
She's a law student too.

536
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,770
She's a top student of the province's law academy.

537
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,500
So she's one of the alumni as well?

538
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,530
Hello, Senior.

539
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,700
Hello.

540
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,370
You want her to join our law firm?

541
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,050
Yeah.

542
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,420
I think you should forget it.

543
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,660
It's not that we're not recruiting.

544
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,500
Mainly, our boss

545
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,810
is too strict with the newcomers.

546
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,180
That's fine.

547
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,940
Senior,

548
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,050
I'm not afraid of hardships.

549
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,500
This isn't about hardships as a whole.

550
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,850
Even if you're there,
you can't learn anything new.

551
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,460
Not only that,

552
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,770
but you will also be led astray.

553
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,900
It's better if you don't join us.

554
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,770
Guan Tao, what about this?

555
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,700
You should introduce her to your boss first.

556
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,530
We can talk about it
when the boss doesn't like her.

557
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,660
Even if he doesn't like her,

558
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,020
we can treat this as an opportunity,

559
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,570
am I right?

560
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,500
Don't worry.

561
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,940
It's fine even if it doesn't work out.

562
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,130
Why can't you get it?

563
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,330
I just don't want to harm her.

564
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,610
She's such a fine lady.

565
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,220
I cannot afford to take responsibility

566
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,660
if she's led astray right after graduating.

567
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,850
Besides, I don't really

568
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,460
get along with my boss.

569
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,940
Introducing her to him would be useless.

570
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,570
Let's dig in.

571
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,660
Here.

572
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:31,610
Here.

573
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,500
It's fine. You can have it.

574
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,260
Let's share it.

575
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,940
This bun is delicious.

576
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,220
Mom,

577
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,570
the buns you made are delicious.

578
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,740
It's the best.

579
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,460
Xingfu made the filling.

580
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,420
I'll make them more often if you like them.

581
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,050
Xiuyu,

582
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,850
I heard that the Wanjia Group is going
to build a health products factory.

583
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,980
They're discussing the deal now.

584
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,050
What kind of health products?

585
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,940
What are they used for?

586
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
I don't know either.

587
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,020
Maybe it's to boost our immunity.

588
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,700
They say it can cure anything.

589
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,740
People nowadays are strange.

590
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,660
There are no plagues or disasters.

591
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,500
But instead of having proper meals,

592
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,020
they're taking medicinal pills.

593
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,180
Mom,

594
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,980
when I join the factory,

595
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,900
I'll get the latest medicinal pills for you.

596
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,180
You wish to join the factory?

597
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,370
The health products factory
has higher productivity

598
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,260
and they provide a higher wage too.

599
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,460
I took accounting

600
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,980
just so I could join a health products factory.

601
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,940
I took a peek at the budget.

602
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,810
If I become an accountant there,

603
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,500
my wage will be increased by this much.

604
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,290
50 yuan?

605
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,220
It's 500 yuan.

606
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,530
500 yuan?

607
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,610
That's a lot.

608
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,500
If so, this is a good thing.

609
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
What were you guys talking about?

610
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,610
Xiuyu

611
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,330
wishes to become an accountant
for the health products factory.

612
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,050
She can earn 500 yuan more per month
if she does so.

613
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,180
Really?

614
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,940
Xiuyu is the best.

615
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,740
Xiuyu,

616
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,290
they will lack manpower

617
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,980
after the factory is completed, right?

618
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,610
They will transfer a batch of workers
from the tiles factory to the new factory.

619
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,180
However, they need to retrain them.

620
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,090
I heard

621
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,900
that they plan

622
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,460
to recruit new workers from Shuiwei Village.

623
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,570
Qinglai,

624
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,740
why don't

625
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,810
you join the factory too?

626
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,050
Just like your sister.

627
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,460
You don't need to wake up early

628
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,770
and work on the fields until late at night

629
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,740
and tire yourself out

630
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,810
while earning less money

631
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,370
than your sister.

632
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,570
Mom,

633
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,530
I...

634
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,980
I don't know how a factory works.

635
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,220
No one is born all-knowing.

636
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,290
If you don't know something, learn it.

637
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,260
Alright, Mom.

638
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,570
Let's see how it goes.

639
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,420
Look, who else in the village

640
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,180
is still willing to work on the fields?

641
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,940
Everyone is fighting for a spot

642
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,530
in the factory.

643
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,050
You're the only one
who wants to work on the fields.

644
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,090
What are you saying?

645
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,130
Don't you work on the fields too?

646
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,700
Every food we eat

647
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,260
is grown on the fields.

648
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,610
Hey,

649
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,180
this is really nice.

650
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,610
I've already had six of them.

651
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,330
It's all your fault.

652
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,050
You brought Qinglai to the fields since young.

653
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,700
You've worked on the fields all your life.

654
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,660
Now, you plan to let your son do the same?

655
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,460
Dad, Mom,

656
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,700
everyone has their own way of making a living.

657
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,290
We don't need to be jealous of others.

658
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,180
Since Qinglai loves to work on the fields,

659
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,810
we should let him do what he likes.

660
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,660
At least he's comfortable

661
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,660
with working on the fields.

662
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,850
It's better than anything else.

663
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,370
You're open-minded indeed.

664
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,020
You didn't look down on him
even though he is from the countryside.

665
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,850
Xingyun is calling me.

666
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,980
Maybe Qingzhi found her a job.

667
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,420
That would be great.

668
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,940
Eat up.

669
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,090
No.

670
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,130
His friend rejected the favor immediately.

671
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,900
He said I couldn't learn anything
even if I joined the law firm.

672
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:07,940
It's fine.

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,990
Your apprenticeship period
was two months, right?

842
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,780
You can request your wage accordingly.

843
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,470
Mr. Han thinks that this isn't the firm for you.

844
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,990
You should find another law firm.

845
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,990
[Director's Office]
He's too ruthless.

846
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,950
He ordered me around for two months for free.

847
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,990
I think

848
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,100
you should quit.

849
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,260
This law firm is inhumane.

850
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,620
The previous assistant was the same.

851
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,260
She was told to quit

852
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,580
even before her apprenticeship period was up.

853
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,180
I think

854
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,140
you'll suffer the same fate.

855
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,100
They're just treating us

856
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,620
as cheap labor workers.

857
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,910
I think I'll give it a try.

858
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,030
Suit yourself.

859
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,510
All these are the tasks

860
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,350
you need to do.

861
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,470
As for your other tasks,

862
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,350
essentially, you're an office girl.

863
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,390
You have to do anything they tell you to do.

864
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,180
Hello, Xingyun?

865
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,260
Hello?

866
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,140
Xingfu?

867
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,100
I have good news for you.

868
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,100
I found a job.

869
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,580
Really?

870
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,260
You found a job?

871
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,780
That's great.

872
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,180
How did you get it?

873
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,430
I barged into the law firm and got myself a job.

874
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,990
My sister is the best indeed.

875
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,140
Alright.

876
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,260
I can finally be at ease
now that you've found a job.

877
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,580
Okay.

878
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,030
Xingfu,

879
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,100
I still have work to do.

880
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,830
I'm just notifying you about it.

881
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,910
I'll hang up first.

882
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,870
We can continue our chat tonight.

883
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,350
Sure! I'm working too!

884
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,390
Alright.

885
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,260
Did she find a job?

886
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,510
That's fast.

887
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,550
Isn't she amazing?

888
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,550
Yeah.

889
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,870
Senior Guan?

890
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,075
[Director's Office]

891
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,260
What are you doing here?

892
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,350
Where's Zhao?

893
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,030
I took over her spot.

894
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,550
Senior, do you need anything?

895
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,180
I need Mr. Han's signature.

896
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,350
Mr. Han just came back.

897
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,260
He's inside.

898
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,870
Alright.

899
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,070
Talk to you later.

900
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,030
Isn't that Cai?

901
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,300
Cai!

902
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,870
Are you done with your work?

903
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:11,830
Not yet!

904
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,030
Come to our house and take a look

905
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,100
at our farm when you're done!

906
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,580
Alright!

907
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,470
I'll be there!

908
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,830
Your vegetables are full of holes.

909
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,660
I can only count them as second-grade vegetables.

910
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,430
I'll pay you 40 cents per 500 grams.

911
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,990
What are you saying?

912
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,140
I harvested them according to
the standards of first-grade vegetables.

913
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,550
I was going easy on you.

914
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,180
Buddy, you must be dreaming.

915
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,870
Your vegetables

916
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,780
look terrible with all these holes.

917
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,550
Supermarkets won't even take them.

918
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,140
How could you sell them for a good price?

919
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,990
-I...
-Listen.

920
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:47,990
Look.

921
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,870
And here.

922
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,470
Look at the hole.

923
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,300
It's full of holes.

924
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,830
That means it's good.

925
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,140
That means I don't use pesticides
for my vegetables.

926
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,990
I use organic fertilizer on them too.

927
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,950
Organic food is all the rage in the city, right?

928
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,470
Zhang even came to buy these types
of vegetables from me.

929
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,030
Of course I know who Zhang is.

930
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,470
That's why he failed.

931
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,220
He sells his vegetables to his regulars.

932
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,700
And he sells organic vegetables at a high price.

933
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,030
However, his customer base is small and unstable.

934
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,470
Listen, buddy. I'm different.

935
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,740
I supply vegetables to supermarkets.

936
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,550
I don't care if they're organic or not.

937
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,180
I only focus on the looks.

938
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,910
I'll buy them for a high price if they look good.

939
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,140
I'll do the opposite if they look bad.

940
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,870
Understood?

941
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,180
If so,

942
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,620
doesn't that mean I have to sell
my organic vegetables at a loss?

943
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,300
I've invested a lot in them.

944
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,180
And now, I can't sell them

945
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,260
for a high price even though I have a low yield?

946
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,870
How could you do that?

947
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,140
Why can't you understand what I'm saying here?

948
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,550
This is the current trend.

949
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,660
What's wrong?

950
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,780
He said he could only buy our vegetables

951
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,260
with a second-grade price.

952
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,870
It's obvious that he's picking on us.

953
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,910
Mister, what's going on?

954
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,180
Zhang was buying them

955
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,990
at a special-grade price before this.

956
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,950
But why are you buying them at a lower price now?

957
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,780
You're trying to cheat us here.

958
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,260
Hey,

959
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,180
watch your words.

960
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,180
Look at what you're saying.

961
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,700
Listen,

962
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,470
I'm doing long-term business here.

963
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,580
I don't cheat anyone.

964
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,620
I just explained everything

965
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,030
to your husband.

966
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,390
I supply vegetables to supermarkets.

967
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,700
Supermarkets buy vegetables
based on their looks.

968
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,870
I cannot do anything about it.

969
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,260
But supermarkets have counters
for organic vegetables.

970
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,260
Why aren't you supplying

971
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,390
our vegetables to them?

972
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,180
Although that's the case,

973
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,180
your yield is too low.

974
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,620
I buy them in bulks.

975
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,510
In bulks.

976
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,990
I can't just sign another contract with them

977
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,260
because of your organic vegetables.

978
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:11,910
Besides,

979
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,740
your farm is tiny. If you can't
provide enough vegetables,

980
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,070
I'll be in trouble with the contract
I signed with the supermarkets.

981
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:16,780
Do you know that?

982
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,350
What if we can supply enough vegetables to you?

983
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,140
What if we can supply you
with the number of vegetables you need?

984
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,550
If so, can you purchase them based on the price

985
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,550
of organic vegetables?

986
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,300
It would be great if you guys

987
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,180
could expand your farm.

988
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,180
If so, I can negotiate with the supermarkets

989
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,580
to prepare a counter
for your organic vegetables.

990
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,910
However, there's one thing.

991
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,990
You guys have to make sure
that you will provide enough of them on time.

992
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:37,830
Can you do it?

993
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:38,910
Of course.

994
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,510
Set up some rules then.

995
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,510
Tell us how much you need

996
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,470
and how we can deliver them to you.

997
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,700
I have to discuss it with the supermarkets first.

998
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,580
Mainly, it depends on their needs.

999
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,780
I'm just a middle man.

1000
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,300
Besides,

1001
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,510
with a tiny farm like this,

1002
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,350
you will

1003
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,620
definitely fail.

1004
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,660
You don't need to care about that.

1005
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,870
If you can purchase our vegetables
according to the price

1006
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,740
of organic vegetables,

1007
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,510
we will expand our farm and increase our scope.

1008
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,780
We will build greenhouses

1009
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,070
and increase our yield.

1010
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,550
Alright then.

1011
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,140
You guys will get rich

1012
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,990
if you can do that.

1013
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,510
And

1014
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,740
I can earn more too.

1015
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,580
Is that so?

1016
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,990
Alright then, mister.
Give me your contact number.

1017
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,350
Alright.

1018
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,070
You should discuss it with the supermarkets
as soon as possible.

1019
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,220
We need to discuss this too.

1020
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,100
What should we do about them then?

1021
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,100
I've already harvested them.

1022
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,030
About them...

1023
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,950
I can't do anything about them either.

1024
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,430
Listen, after I take them,

1025
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,620
they'll be mixed with vegetables
from other farmers.

1026
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,780
You think you have a lot of them here.

1027
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,140
But they're meaningless to me.

1028
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,620
They might be meaningless to you,
but they're meaningful to me!

1029
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,950
Look at all the vegetables I have here.

1030
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,870
How about this, mister?

1031
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,470
I won't force you to buy them
according to the price

1032
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,470
Zhang had offered.

1033
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,990
But you shouldn't buy them
at a normal price either.

1034
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,660
Let's each take a step back.

1035
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Maybe we would work together more often
in the future

1036
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,100
after the greenhouses were built.

1037
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,260
Alright then.

1038
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,990
Since you're so straightforward,
I'll do the same too.

1039
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,990
It's decided then.

1040
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,260
Okay.

1041
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,100
Alright.

1042
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,620
1,168 yuan?

1043
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,990
It's not too bad.

1044
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,100
We didn't lose too much.

1045
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,140
Xingfu,

1046
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,550
you're the best.

1047
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,350
You managed to coax him
into preparing a counter for our vegetables.

1048
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,780
Who tried to coax him?

1049
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,660
I think Cai's words reminded me of something.

1050
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,140
This is an opportunity.

1051
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,550
We should try to make it big.

1052
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,030
You're excellent at growing vegetables.

1053
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,510
It's a waste of your talent to be growing them

1054
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,550
on a tiny farm like this.

1055
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,700
Who owns those lands over there?

1056
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,300
What do you plan to do?

1057
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,260
I wish to own them.

1058
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,740
Really?

1059
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,350
Yeah.

1060
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,550
When you go back, go and find out

1061
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,780
who owns it and how much they're selling it for.

1062
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,030
You don't need to care about the rest.

1063
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,740
Let's go.

1064
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,030
Let's go.

1065
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:06,510
What are you doing?

1066
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,580
I'm doing the accounts. Don't interrupt me.

1067
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,350
Look at what you're saying.

1068
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,260
How am I interrupting you?

1069
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,180
I've inquired about the land for you.

1070
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,470
Do you want the intel or not?

1071
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,580
Oh yeah.

1072
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,950
Who owns the land? How much mu in total?
(*a Chinese measuring unit)

1073
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,030
In total, there are three owners.

1074
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,070
Chunxian, Fusheng, and Guancai.

1075
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,470
In total, it covers 15 mu.

1076
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,070
It costs 400 yuan per mu if we wish to rent it.

1077
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,260
If so, it'll cost us

1078
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,740
6,000 yuan per year.

1079
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,260
It'll take 18,000 yuan

1080
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,220
for every greenhouse per mu.

1081
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,470
18,000 yuan

1082
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,740
times 15

1083
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,700
equals 270,000 yuan.

1084
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,700
If we include the cost of the seeds,

1085
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,910
in total,

1086
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,910
it'll cost around 400,000 yuan.

1087
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,740
According to the price Cai gave to us,

1088
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,030
we can earn around 8,000 to 10,000 yuan

1089
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,300
per mu every year.

1090
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,830
If so, we'll get back our capital in two years.

1091
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,390
I think this can work.
