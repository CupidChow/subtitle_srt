00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:09,259
This summer, two directors who once used to be a student and a mentor
got together and came up with a strange and unfamiliar film project.

2
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,179
Why don't you two
shooting a film together?

3
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,932
Two movies bound in a
single cinematic structure?

4
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:17,392
So, it's like a relay race?

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,037
Director Kim, vacation, right?

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:22,981
I think you have to get out of
the obsession about "vacation."

7
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:29,612
Why do people cheat? Director Kim Tai Sik
revisited his old script called "XX Vacance"

8
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:34,159
The story about you being a wedding
officiant of your favorite student?

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,514
In the surface level,
being a wedding officiant

10
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,289
of my favorite student is
not a 100% good feeling.

11
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,852
But if you want to see
beyond that surface level,

12
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,418
it could a psychological movie.

13
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:51,926
Anxiety is a key issue for Director Park Chul Soo's life. He
jokingly talked about how he felt at his favorite student's wedding.

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,388
Do you know Sunmook Cho, right?

15
00:00:55,681 --> 00:01:01,246
I heard about you too making a
film together from producer Kim.

16
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,247
I believe you can do that.

17
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,564
Only if you too are my director.

18
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:12,822
The project progressed quickly after they met
producer Cho Seon Mook, who used to be an actor.

19
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,829
You know actress Jinjoo Lee
whom we met the other day?

20
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:24,667
I wanna work with her.

21
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:28,338
Give me some advice.

22
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,217
I think she has talent.

23
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:39,474
With Youngsoo Ha's help,
casting also went fast and smooth.

24
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:57,116
Directed by Kim Tai Sik

25
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,334
One month ago

26
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,344
I think he is cheating on me.

27
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,055
You look so happy today.

28
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,182
I'm going on a vacation.

29
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,893
Vacance! Wow, great!

30
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,186
Where to?

31
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,396
Abroad...

32
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,439
Abroad?

33
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,606
By plane?

34
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,525
Yeah, it's the first time in
my life I got on the plane!

35
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,443
I'm jealous!!

36
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:14,944
That one.

37
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,431
Ms, are you alright?

38
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:25,972
Ms, are you alright?

39
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:28,584
What?

40
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,652
"Travel Agency"

41
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,863
You look great on this dress.

42
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,053
You're sure we're
leaving tomorrow, right?

43
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,764
What? No problem!

44
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,996
Stay there.

45
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,770
You screw up my poison.

46
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,901
I love you, Heerae. Pretty sweetie!

47
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,652
Ah! I'm coming!

48
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,239
Ah! I'm coming!

49
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,538
I have a long-time lover,

50
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,708
and he has a longer-time wife.

51
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:05,401
I will have a nice
vacation with him...

52
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,404
When I imagine going on a
long overdue vacation with him,

53
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,806
it makes this
30-something get excited.

54
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,632
Taemook, what is going on?

55
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,363
Hello, is this 911?

56
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:54,724
Did you receive a phone call
about a car accident on the highway?

57
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,317
Where the hell are we going?

58
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,446
Just tell me! And...

59
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,828
where did you get this car?

60
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,791
Just take off that f**king ring.

61
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:31,385
Can't you tell a real one
from a fake? Dummie!

62
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,481
Let's go back home.

63
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:29,235
We are doing this exactly for 5
hours and 12 minutes, you know?

64
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,781
It's dangerous.

65
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,743
Let me drive.

66
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,456
You are going to kill both of us.

67
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,983
"Typhoon number 9, Eco, Is approaching the
Korea-Peninsula accompanying strong rain clouds."

68
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,528
"Currently, a typhoon watch is issued
for Jeju Island and the Southern coast,"

69
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,846
"and torrential warning, around the middle,
Eastern, and Southern area of the Peninsula."

70
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:02,370
"But it is expected that tomorrow the typhoon
watch will be issued all around the nation."

71
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:06,791
"Now, Eco moves up the
southwestern coast of Jeju."

72
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:12,296
"Tomorrow at noon, it will pass through
Jeju, and move up along the West Sea."

73
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:24,707
"The typhoon will be landing on the
western part of North Korea in two days."

74
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,572
"The number you
dial is not available."

75
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:31,589
We are expected to have over 300mm rain
nationwide by the day after tomorrow morning.

76
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,621
She asks me.

77
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,874
Do you love her?

78
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,252
Still love her

79
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,048
and will love her.

80
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,011
She asks me again.

81
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,890
Why you just standing
there and let it happen?

82
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,435
I am scared. What are you doing?

83
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,822
Go get him!!

84
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:45,120
Stop there. Go get him.

85
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,310
Dogs don't lie.

86
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,104
Is this what you call love?

87
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:57,109
Love? We're just friends.

88
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,821
When did it start?

89
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:02,990
Just a very short time ago.

90
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,451
Believe me it was a
really short time ago.

91
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,705
Don't dance around! When did it start?

92
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,584
Six years ago.

93
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,879
What?! Six years ago?!

94
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,983
Well.. I...

95
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,550
Lie down flat!

96
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,888
How dare you f**king
cheat on me for six years!

97
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,224
- Well, I...
- Shut the f**k up!

98
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,395
A dog does what its
master tells him to do!

99
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,814
One more thing.

100
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,213
The pension register said
you stayed here last April.

101
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:41,946
Isn't that right?

102
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:48,118
Well, when you were
sick, I was very stressed out

103
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,705
so I came here to take a short rest...

104
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:55,501
What? Take a rest when
I was In the hospital?

105
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:02,091
You motherf**ker!
You f**king asshole...

106
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,348
I will cut your heart
out. You damn asshole!

107
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,559
How dare you, mother f**ker!!

108
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,192
I'm sorry. I Was not myself.

109
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,945
I shouldn't have asked you
to go on a vacation with me.

110
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,614
I'm sorry.

111
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,663
Hello?

112
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,712
I'm stuck here!!

113
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,818
I'm so sorry.

114
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,466
I have an emergency situation now.
Can you come to M pension in Muju?

115
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,136
You know the place, right?
I'll be there soon. Hurry!

116
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,535
I love you!!

117
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:41,857
OK, I'll be there
soon. I love you, too.

118
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:03,796
Boksun! Boksun! Let's talk.

119
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:08,258
Where the hell are you? Answer me?

120
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,686
Boksun! What are you doing? Stop it!!

121
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,943
In my next life, I will
be born as a flower.

122
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,781
Although it is born,
blossoms and dies someday,

123
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:36,495
I want to be a happy flower.

124
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,252
What the f**k. F**k!! F**king flower!!

125
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,797
Boksun! Boksun!

126
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:52,321
Stop swearing and
stop reading the poem.

127
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,805
You make me feel dizzy.

128
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,851
Boksun! Boksun!

129
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,565
I Told you it just happened.

130
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,942
I don't believe in love.

131
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,443
I don't even know what love is!

132
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:16,242
F**k!!

133
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:23,333
Love!! You are f**king
kidding me, mother f**ker!

134
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,255
Hey! Isn't this gasoline?

135
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,259
It's my fault. This is
really going to kill me.

136
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:39,016
No way!! Boksun!

137
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,270
Let's all meet together. I will
give you a written promise!

138
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,731
Boksun! It's my fault.

139
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:46,982
Help me, Boksun!

140
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,151
I'm really sorry!

141
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,361
It's my fault.

142
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,341
Why are you crying?

143
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,595
I am f**king embarrassing myself...

144
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:55,175
Stop the car! Stop it.

145
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:00,889
Don't follow me!

146
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,604
No, this is not what I want...

147
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,899
I want to go back to him.

148
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,860
I am sorry.

149
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,857
Why? It's not working
with me any more?

150
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,528
Take it! Take it!

151
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:02,659
Take it!

152
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,158
Strike this three times
short, and three times long.

153
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
Meow...

154
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,375
Meow...

155
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,893
It's me...

156
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:21,590
You are gonna kill
me... please stop it.

157
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,383
Bokson, please.

158
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,309
Please forgive me, Boksun.

159
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:34,770
I Feel like I am dying...

160
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:39,858
Boksun...

161
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,366
Heerae.

162
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,285
KA-POW!!

163
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,253
Crack written by Yum Boksun.

164
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:47,551
Because I am afraid
that you feel burdened,

165
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,762
I was pretending not to be lonely,

166
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,056
not to be hurt,

167
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,141
not to be upset,

168
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,478
not to be sick...

169
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,731
I pretend to be happy.

170
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,528
That happiness is the most
painful happiness in my life.

171
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:14,870
When I started pretending,
you showed me a little crack.

172
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,708
The crack was too tiny to
be recognized at first but

173
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,855
The more you pretend to love me,

174
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,672
Pretend to like me,
Pretend I am the only one,

175
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:31,636
Pretend, pretend, and
pretend nothing happened.

176
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,306
The crack gets bigger.

177
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:41,438
Now we are far apart from each other,

178
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,399
And makes you weak.

179
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:48,630
But I am still
pretending I was not hurt.

180
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:52,240
I will overcome this only to collapse.

181
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:59,122
Oh my heart... my mind...
be as strong as steel!

182
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:04,252
Oh, my mind..my heart... F**k!

183
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:33,633
Hey, get up...

184
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:39,139
Are you alright?

185
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:51,276
I'm sorry. I am sorry.

186
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,114
I'm here.

187
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,451
It seems like everybody
is fully awake...

188
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,411
Honey,

189
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,706
stop this.

190
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,542
I'm sorry... I mean it. I am so sorry.

191
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,670
Wow, a f**king animal is talking!

192
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,756
Stop, please stop!

193
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,551
Stop talking and bark like a dog.

194
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,095
Please stop this!

195
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,223
I'm sorry! Okay? It's all my fault.

196
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,185
- Stop!
- Oh, you scare me! Oh!

197
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,603
Stop!

198
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,815
Heerae, what are you too doing?!

199
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,446
You, bitch! You're
f**king high, aren't you?

200
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,116
How dare you two!

201
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:41,951
What? How dare we?

202
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:47,916
What are you doing? Drop that!

203
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,461
You, stop there! Stop!

204
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,029
You stop!

205
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,430
What are you doing? Boksun!!

206
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,182
What am I doing? I
am going to kill you!

207
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,952
F**k... I'm f**king tired!!

208
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:59,005
What... what.

209
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,025
Please... help me!

210
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,196
Please... help me! I am trapped.

211
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:43,735
Everybody is crazy!!
This is all crazy.

212
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,119
What's the matter with
having one or two lovers?

213
00:31:55,611 --> 00:31:57,612
I am living in hell anyway.

214
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,134
You think you are stronger than me?

215
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,468
Your pretty face cannot
beat mine either! You bitch!

216
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:47,420
Hey, it hurts!

217
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,109
Wait a minute!

218
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,059
You bitch!

219
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:02,730
You, f**king bitch!

220
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,871
Hey! Wait!

221
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,998
I am sorry!

222
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,042
I am sorry!

223
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:25,545
I am sorry!

224
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,601
Hey, let's take a
break... I'm too tired.

225
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:05,084
She asked me what made
me fall in love with him...

226
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,338
why her husband,

227
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,260
and who started it first,

228
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,015
if I really love him,

229
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:26,606
whether it was true love.

230
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,904
And she also asks...

231
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,865
Did you give him
your f**king ass, too?

232
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:43,580
We always do it behind...

233
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,082
What? We?

234
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:50,338
Wait!

235
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,555
Move over!!

236
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,603
- You bitch...
- Stop.

237
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,243
Shin Taemook!

238
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,538
Don't kill yourself!!

239
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,042
Hey, why are you just standing there?

240
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,088
Sweetie.

241
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:16,590
Crazy bitch... Crazy!

242
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,639
I'm so sorry. I have an emergency situation
now an you come to M pension in Moojoo?

243
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:49,582
You know the place, right? I'll
be there soon. Hurry! I love you!

244
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,126
F**king traps are all over.

245
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:10,394
Do you want me to be
gone because I cheated?

246
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,448
Why did you do this to me?

247
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,369
Tell ME.

248
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,924
It's successfully got back together...

249
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:57,566
I wanted to give it back
to you without damage.

250
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:11,455
Vacation is over... but
summer is still here...

251
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,756
I'm sorry.

252
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,575
I shouldn't have asked you
to go on vacation with me.

253
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:46,319
When I Heard about your
character in director Kim's movie,

254
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:52,033
I think that was fun.
So I am thinking about

255
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:57,580
changing your character into
a professor again in my film.

256
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,730
Inhye, can you come here for a minute?

257
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:15,496
Director Park was sure that Cho Seon Mook can develop his character
perfectly and was very satisfied with the newcomer actress Oh In Hye.

258
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:22,169
Directed by PARK Chul Soo

259
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:31,971
Suji!

260
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,952
Even the slightest
movement of her little fingertip

261
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:40,062
or single hair always arouses me.

262
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,774
To me, holding her sensual body Is
like possessing an absolute power.

263
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:49,363
Today, she got married.

264
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,575
I was there as her wedding officiant.

265
00:40:54,327 --> 00:41:00,499
She looked faithful, beautiful,
wearing her grandmother's dress.

266
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:07,172
The stirring but thrilling affair
with her is finished as of today.

267
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:08,382
Having an affair?

268
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,678
Me being her wedding officiant?

269
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,264
Was it not indefensibly shameless?

270
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:36,619
"We found a talented young screen
writer. Please contact us anytime!"

271
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,457
A young screen writer?

272
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,386
Not long ago, my only daughter
got married and I got divorced.

273
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,596
I feel like now I have no family.

274
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,244
I am called "professor"
because I lecture at college

275
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,436
but I am not a "real professor".

276
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,292
But I now find myself in
this unexpected space,

277
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,567
thanks to my friend
who is mad for wine.

278
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:55,823
"M Story!"

279
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,452
I don't really like the word, "story."

280
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:05,142
But Suji loves the soft sunshine
in the backyard of this bar.

281
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,937
And she loves wine.

282
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:09,837
This place fits her who love wine.

283
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:14,967
And, slowly, I am building a good
connection with this space as well.

284
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,670
"It's me!"

285
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,723
"It's me,"

286
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:39,510
I'm so relieved!

287
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,096
I was worried that you
may have disappeared.

288
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,737
Something's changed here.

289
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,333
You missed me, right?

290
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,966
You're supposed to
be at the airport now.

291
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,553
You asked me to come.

292
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:23,887
Did I?

293
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,643
I definitely heard you whisper.

294
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:58,505
You want me to go?

295
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,117
Since she graduated,

296
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:10,434
I thought I could never see her again.

297
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,979
But I saw her at my new
film conference again!

298
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:19,651
You always try unconventional
forms and styles in your films.

299
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:24,990
Some say this isn't helpful
to attract an audience.

300
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:26,950
What's your own opinion about it?

301
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:32,206
Well, I've not thought
about it that much...

302
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,169
Well, maybe so.

303
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:41,423
Your question itself is my answer.

304
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:46,803
Next questions please.

305
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:48,805
There, what is your question?

306
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:54,019
I think this movie is also about
anxiety, like your previous ones.

307
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:57,648
Where do you think your own
anxiety comes from exactly?

308
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,692
Well,

309
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:10,494
if I knew where it came
from, I could stop making films.

310
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,789
Bullshit! Arrogant son of bitch!

311
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,443
It's been a quite while.

312
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,780
Where have you been hiding?

313
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:51,326
I know you've desired
me a lot, right?!

314
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:53,912
Not only that.

315
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,179
Wait a second.

316
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:30,365
I wish we were somewhere
else, a place only for us.

317
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,373
Let's go to "M Story"?

318
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,334
M?

319
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:48,967
Crazy drunk!

320
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:51,803
Cry baby!

321
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:53,805
Loser!

322
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,808
Silly sausage!

323
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:59,269
Whang Whang... whatever!

324
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:02,522
Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!

325
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,569
Well, a socially-unfit loser like
you can make such good movies.

326
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,863
I can't believe it!

327
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,907
Socially unfit?

328
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,284
I like that.

329
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:18,413
You do? Me, too, then.

330
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:21,917
Search my pocket.

331
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:23,794
Umm.. here?

332
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:26,671
No, right one.

333
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:32,844
What's this?

334
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,222
You want me to throw it away?

335
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,746
Oh' It's good! So good.

336
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,209
Wait a minute!

337
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:18,260
Why didn't you put on
the tie I bought for you?

338
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,558
Um, I saved it for a special occasion.

339
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:34,192
I was struggling to hold
my tears during my wedding.

340
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,790
I wanted to shout out loud, I
want to confess to everyone.

341
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,295
The truth is "I love him,"

342
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:57,132
just like this.

343
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,573
The past few months,

344
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,491
we were like creatures
tangled all up together

345
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:08,059
as If we couldn't ever be
separated physically or mentally.

346
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:14,649
But today, shamelessly, I had
to be your wedding officiant,

347
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:17,610
which means we aren't
supposed to see each other again.

348
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:21,948
Is it your makeup?

349
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,829
You look like a stranger now!

350
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,276
You don't have to.

351
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:09,973
Here.

352
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:13,560
Hello?

353
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:19,441
Oh, really?

354
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:24,070
I'm with Professor Kim now.

355
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,532
I'll be there soon.
I'm sorry. Promise.

356
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,995
OK, I see.

357
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:37,167
Wait a second please!

358
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,598
Ah! No. no... I spilt my coffee.

359
00:55:58,439 --> 00:55:59,230
Ah, I'm sorry...

360
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,065
I'll give you a call back soon.

361
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,611
I'm OK, now.

362
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,551
What are you gonna do this Saturday?

363
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:30,906
Why you ask?

364
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,949
I'm going to Director
Paek's new film preview.

365
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,682
Can you come with me?

366
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,727
Not this Saturday.

367
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,104
You have a date?

368
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,481
Yeah.

369
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,650
All day?

370
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,110
I can go on Sunday.

371
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:49,174
I can't.

372
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:51,491
I have an appointment
with my daughter.

373
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,882
OK, you look pissed now.
Why? Because I have a date?

374
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:14,055
I will never let you
go even one second.

375
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:16,827
Every single part of my body

376
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:18,935
remembers you vividly.

377
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,540
Since I met you,

378
00:57:21,564 --> 00:57:25,817
I think I've grown-up again
but without getting old.

379
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:29,153
Don't be a grown-up for me!

380
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:36,327
I don't want to sound
like a nagging husband.

381
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,999
But don't suddenly stop talking
to me without saying anything.

382
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:46,087
OK, I won't, silly.

383
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:50,777
What are you gonna do from now on?

384
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,719
Write a script?

385
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:55,388
Right,

386
00:57:57,141 --> 00:58:01,519
There's nothing we can do right now.

387
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:07,358
You just leave for the airport or...

388
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:15,533
OK.

389
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:17,785
I'll be there right on time.

390
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,039
I Said I'll be there!

391
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,334
OK. I'm sorry.

392
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:29,130
I'll be there soon, OK?

393
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:31,883
Jesus Christ!! She'll
be leaving in 30 minutes!

394
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,969
Just f**king 30 minutes!

395
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:44,164
It took 30 minutes

396
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:46,940
but I feel like we had a
deep intimate conversation.

397
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:50,318
You're really good.

398
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,445
Can you do it one more time?

399
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,158
I can do it again.

400
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:52,315
"You know I can't do
anything without you!"

401
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,694
"Where the hell are you at this hour?"

402
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:08,539
"Come here immediately!"

403
01:01:25,808 --> 01:01:27,786
"If that son of bitch
holds you back right now,"

404
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:30,997
"just punch him in
his face and leave!"

405
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,688
"Trust me!"

406
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:49,997
"I'll pick you up there."

407
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:21,339
I'm a wreck when I'm not
with you, even for just a minute.

408
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:22,757
I am nervous.

409
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,343
Why don't you get re-married?

410
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,639
Me?

411
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:32,099
Yes.

412
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:42,109
I've been getting more and
more obsessed with Suji.

413
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,715
The number you dial is not available.

414
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,698
Leave the message after the beep.

415
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,451
"When are you are
going to meet the writer?"

416
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,954
"This is Lee Kwanwoo hospital."

417
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:55,081
"Please come by to get the
results of your medical test."

418
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:58,186
The number you dial is not available.

419
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,169
Leave the message after the beep.

420
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,469
Hey. It's me.

421
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:54,223
It's me.

422
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,146
I bought a tie for you.

423
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:02,106
And a shirt.

424
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,400
Why didn't you call me?

425
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:21,083
You have to ask me why I
couldn't make it to our date.

426
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:30,176
I can do whatever you want me to do.

427
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,442
Please let me do it.

428
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:50,798
I'm going to get married.

429
01:06:57,097 --> 01:06:58,389
Get married?

430
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,559
When?

431
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,353
Soon...

432
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,397
How soon?

433
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:12,027
Why do you want to get married?
You're so beautiful and talented.

434
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:16,031
I guess I'll just let it happen.

435
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,617
You too did that.

436
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:24,081
Marriage is like a magic show.

437
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,876
So, who is that guy?

438
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:31,255
Just a guy.

439
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,884
He said he wants to meet you.

440
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:36,635
He wants to see me?

441
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,804
That's what he said.

442
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,232
Can I ask a favor?

443
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:52,693
What is it? Tell me.

444
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:58,490
You have to be the one to marry us.

445
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:06,790
Maybe it would be better to announce
our relationship at your wedding

446
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:15,007
and be punished than to keep a secret
like some kind of moral hypocrite.

447
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:22,223
You could but what would
you get by doing that?

448
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:24,974
You. I can get you.

449
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,983
I'm yours already.

450
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,110
How can you get
something you already have?

451
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:41,617
Please come to my
wedding, be my officiant.

452
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:51,626
I wish there was a law like someone
like me is not allowed to marry couples.

453
01:08:52,087 --> 01:08:55,005
Then, you'd have to break the
law, pay the fine and come to me.

454
01:08:55,382 --> 01:08:56,090
Why?

455
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:59,134
Are you scared?

456
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:07,142
If people knew about our relationship,
it would be strange for you to marry us.

457
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,144
But they don't know!

458
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,648
And more importantly, I
am your favorite student!

459
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,066
Is that right?

460
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:20,948
So, if you weren't the one to marry
us, that would be even more strange.

461
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,914
I've faced so many ups
and downs in my life.

462
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:32,543
I made it through
with guts and patience

463
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:36,422
whether things turned out good or bad.

464
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:43,637
But you are the only person
who is beyond my control.

465
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:55,482
Ah, I wish my father were still alive.

466
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:19,715
I am leaving.

467
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:33,145
You don't have to
see me off at the door.

468
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,224
Wine or rice wine, anything you want.

469
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:11,934
Wine please.

470
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:14,186
Suji, you want wine?

471
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,105
No. I'll have rice wine this time.

472
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,649
Really? You want rice wine?

473
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:19,817
I just...

474
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:30,577
- Allow me to pour you some wine.
- That's OK.

475
01:11:42,424 --> 01:11:44,758
I think you've had a long
break since your last film.

476
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:46,677
Maybe.

477
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:49,054
Why don't you make another?

478
01:11:57,105 --> 01:12:00,107
Why do you love Suji?

479
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:03,485
I Just love everything about her.

480
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:08,490
I see.

481
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:27,176
How do you feel about Suji's wedding?

482
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:30,220
Maybe you're sad, right?

483
01:12:31,306 --> 01:12:32,639
Why did you say that?

484
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:36,143
Obviously, you won't be
able to see her as much, right?

485
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:38,353
Is that so?

486
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:40,898
Maybe.

487
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,442
Please, don't feel too bad.

488
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:46,278
I'll let her meet you occasionally.

489
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:47,821
Thank you.

490
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,868
Oh, by the way, as for
your wedding blessing,

491
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:57,915
"Do your best to create a happy marriage
but if it doesn't work, get out quick!"

492
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:00,125
Is that what you said?

493
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:02,794
That's very funny.

494
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,132
I know you're joking.

495
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:25,169
What if I love Suji more than you do,

496
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:28,445
what are you gonna do about it?

497
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:36,328
Wish I could say that out loud.

498
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:42,876
I think it must be the perfect
place for creative work.

499
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:44,920
It's very quiet.

500
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,759
It's a more perfect place

501
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:56,390
to make love to Suji!

502
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:01,103
Wish I could say that out loud.

503
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:06,066
I think it's definitely the
perfect place for creativity.

504
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:07,776
Perfect!

505
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,487
Right, perfect!

506
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:12,739
Have some more wine!

507
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,994
Since when have you known each other?

508
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,808
Since she was a college student.

509
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:22,207
It's been a long time.

510
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:27,004
Then you two must know
each other really well.

511
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,137
Why don't we arm wrestle?

512
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:40,267
If you lose, you don't
deserve to marry Suji. Agree?

513
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:47,608
And I don't have to be
the one to marry you two!

514
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,406
No. No, you don't have
to. You've already won.

515
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:09,504
Just like that, she got
married and I married them.

516
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:12,735
Although wedding is said
to be a sacred matrimony

517
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:16,864
and the origin of all human happiness,

518
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:20,807
frankly I couldn't congratulate
her on her marriage.

519
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:24,830
II come back soon.

520
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,730
I couldn't properly thank him.

521
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:28,649
It doesn't take long.

522
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:30,669
You go to the airport first.

523
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:33,403
Your friends are
waiting for you to see off!

524
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,658
Your speech was great today!

525
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:42,681
"Do your best to make a happy marriage

526
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:47,167
but if you are bored and
tired of it, get out quick?"

527
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:50,671
Why didn't you say that?

528
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:53,632
I was looking forward to hearing that.

529
01:15:56,427 --> 01:16:02,808
I was addicted to you so I
was too blind to see the real you.

530
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:07,187
That's right. It's over.

531
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:28,667
Don't. I have to go!

532
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:32,879
Please don't!!

533
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:44,766
I'm sorry.

534
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:52,691
I'm so sorry.

535
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:02,576
When I said I loved you, I
meant it. I really meant it.

536
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:03,512
On...

537
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,141
at the wedding...

538
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,393
in front of people...

539
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:12,979
INside your wedding dress...

540
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,567
I should have done this.

541
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,695
Why?

542
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:22,614
Why didn't you?

543
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,176
So,

544
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,993
I'm doing it right now.

545
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:28,703
Right.

546
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:43,898
Wow, that's strong.

547
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,860
If I were a tropical wind,
you would be a typhoon.

548
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:52,115
I hope my part gives you
enough space for your imagination.

549
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:56,828
Did you decide what the movie title is?

550
01:21:57,163 --> 01:21:58,330
Do you have a good idea?

551
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:00,290
That's right. We don't have one yet.

552
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,959
Damn Vacation?

553
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,586
What is that?

554
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:06,087
I've got it.

555
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:23,480
Can they find their way free of cinematic formula such as
stereotypes in actors, cinematic forms, and ethical stoicism.
