1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The End

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Who is it?

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't know who it is.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But one day,

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the bridegroom asked me

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to send some pictures to the other side of the city.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
She didn't let me ask,

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
nor did she let anyone see

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the picture of the bridegroom.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I kept an eye on it.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I found out that the bridegroom

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
had left the house and had not left the city.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But the bridegroom went to the house

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and had a more suspicious look.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's all?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And...

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I thought it was a big piece of work.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So I put the picture down.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
After the wedding, I made a few notes.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It was the manor's work.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I bought some fake goods and made some money.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So the picture of the bridegroom is still there?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes, it is.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I left it there to find the bride.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Go and get it.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Your Highness,

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
it's night.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Take off your clothes.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Chu Jia,

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
there is nothing left.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was a enemy.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I was a secret agent.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I was afraid to go back to the palace after the war.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But I found out

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
that the picture was broken.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What do you want to see?

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's not him.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's you.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's too cold.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What do you want to hear?

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want to hear your name.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm just a child.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I've never had any memories.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Until that day.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yang Yang,

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
try this soup.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This soup is very fresh.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's play a game.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hello!

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,720
The

52
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,000
Lord has been sent to us.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
None of our soldiers came,

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,440
but no one

55
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,800
And they'll sell them to the followers.

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
I have.

57
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Young Master, run! Run!

58
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
The people in the yard...

59
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
can't be changed.

60
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Then why did you change to the Wu Family?

61
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
There are two reasons.

62
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
First, I know that this is a human's fault.

63
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
It's a big mistake.

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I have a secret case.

65
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Someone always keeps it secret.

66
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
I can't keep it secret.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,800
These people are all wronged by the Wu Family.

68
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
If it's not necessary,

69
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
they won't do that.

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Second, the Crown Princess Consort

71
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,800
and the Empress are now chosen to be my eldest sister.

72
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,800
But after I became the Wu Family's eldest daughter,

73
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
you also got a wife.

74
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,800
After that, Wu Tongchang was born.

75
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
She was born in the UK.

76
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
She was a man.

77
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Did you not get a chance to find out?

78
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
The old King of Li was in the army for many years.

79
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
You could have asked for help from the Gu family.

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
At that time, I was too young.

81
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
No one believed me.

82
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I was not in love with anyone in the family.

83
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I was dead.

84
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
In the end, I was in the dark.

85
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I was in the dark.

86
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I couldn't get rid of it.

87
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I was the one who killed my own son.

88
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
But I never gave up.

89
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I was even stubborn.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I didn't know what to do.

91
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
When I was in the palace,

92
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I would do the same thing as I did with Rong Yao.

93
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
But I found

94
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
that I had no evidence.

95
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
So what you wanted to do

96
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
was to find out what the Wu family was in the Chu family.

97
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,800
What was that black man's intelligence?

98
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Did I think of it together?

99
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
That jade pendant.

100
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
So we made the same thing.

101
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Maybe Wu family will be in trouble.

102
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
It's hard for you.

103
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Jia Yu.

104
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
To tell the truth,

105
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
the Wu family didn't want me.

106
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Now,

107
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
we can rely on each other only.

108
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
But thanks to you,

109
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
the details of the jade pendant

110
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
can remind me of the thing that the black man was holding.

111
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
How dare I forget?

112
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Every day, I remember the ten times

113
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
to forget the details.

114
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
So he went to the Wu family in the front room.

115
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
He even wanted to mess with the Wu family.

116
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
It was all to find some evidence.

117
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
In their evil will,

118
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I was just a pawn.

119
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Chu Jingyan,

120
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
this time,

121
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
I am willing to give up my life

122
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
and go to the end.

123
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
My lord,

124
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Cui Hu ran away.

125
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
I was also in Cui Hu's place

126
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
to set up a ambush.

127
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
As long as he goes back,

128
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
he will be able to hold it.

129
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Great.

130
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
With this one-to-one map,

131
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
we can make the same thing.

132
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
If there is really this thing,

133
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
we just need to find out where it is.

134
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
We have evidence.

135
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Good.

136
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
But what's the use of this jade pendant?

137
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Jia Yu,

138
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
you go and get the jade pendant.

139
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Chu Yi and I will go to Cui Hu.

140
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Okay.

141
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
I will go and get it.

142
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
My lord, you are injured.

143
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
It's okay.

144
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
It's on the outside.

145
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Shen Hu Xin,

146
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
I am really okay.

147
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Chu Yi,

148
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
let's go back.

149
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Chu Jing Yan,

150
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
you are injured.

151
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
It's just an injury on the skin.

152
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Let me see.

153
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
It scared me to death.

154
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
My lord,

155
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
I will go and get the jade pendant.

156
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
You know,

157
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
I am afraid you will get hurt.

158
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Hurry up and find a doctor to check it.

159
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
I am really sorry.

160
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
I am really sorry.

161
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
I am really sorry.

162
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I am really sorry.

163
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
I am really sorry.

164
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
I am really sorry.

165
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
I am really sorry.

166
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
I am really sorry.

167
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
I am really sorry.

168
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
I am really sorry.

169
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
I am really sorry.

170
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
I am really sorry.

171
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
I am really sorry.

172
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
I am really sorry.

173
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
I am really sorry.

174
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
I am really sorry.

175
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I am really sorry.

176
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
I am really sorry.

177
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
I am really sorry.

178
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
I am really sorry.

179
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
I am really sorry.

180
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
I am really sorry.

181
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
I am really sorry.

182
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
I am really sorry.

183
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
I am really sorry.

184
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
I am really sorry.

185
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
I am really sorry.

186
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I am really sorry.

187
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
I am really sorry.

188
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
I am really sorry.

189
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
I am really sorry.

190
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
I am really sorry.

191
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
