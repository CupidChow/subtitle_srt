1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,480
This is the End estar

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,220
Thanks for watching

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What should I do about Yu Bi's case?

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What are you looking at me for?

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I have my own way to deal with Yu Bi.

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I think the person who did it just introduced you to her.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You've seen her before.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I've seen her?

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who?

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, right.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Who?

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't know.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't know.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't know.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't know.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't know.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who?

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've ignored an important information.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm just happy about Yu Bi's case.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I forgot that Cui Hu's fiancÃ©e is very suspicious.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Why did Cui Hu say that he was expelled from the Chu family

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and that he had to be killed?

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He said that he was still alive.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He must have a motive to kill.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Report!

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Chief, the suspect found the suspect.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Prepare the horse.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Tell me about Cui Hu's life.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I want to do something for you.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He must be very careful.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Trust me.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's all right.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll go.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Chu Yi.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Follow me.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Cui Hu.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Cui Hu.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Cui Hu.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Cui...

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You killed Cui Hu.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I can't keep it anymore.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Before I die,

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll give you a chance to see

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
how I'm doing.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll go.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll go.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Before I die,

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll let you guys have a good time.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Go.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Can you try it on me?

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm a man.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No matter who you are.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Help!

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Help!

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Help!

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Help!

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Cui Hu.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Help!

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Chu Yi.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The prince asked me to protect you.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Where's the other one?

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Qiang Yue.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't touch the shoot.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Don't touch the shoot.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Please go.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm a female.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You have a female Zarally One.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
...

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A femalearty on the way.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,220
It's reported.

74
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,500
Well, I will call for your reservation in private.

75
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,140
Okay, I understand.

76
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,060
See you.

77
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,660
We mustAUDIENCE for tonight.

78
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,140
Yeah, right.

79
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,320
Okay, bye.

80
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Is this usually the new concubine that she wants to marry?

81
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,600
You are right.

82
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I... I...

83
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I... I...

84
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
I didn't see anything.

85
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
What's his name?

86
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
We've heard about the Soul Book long ago.

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,600
It's just that you're young and young.

88
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I'm still not fully recovered.

89
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Blood...

90
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
What?

91
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
The one who's dead!

92
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Jia Yu!

93
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Jia Yu!

94
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Jia Yu!

95
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Stop!

96
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Jia Yu!

97
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Jia Yu!

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Jia Yu!

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Jia Yu!

100
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Jia Yu!

101
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
My lord, the Princess Consort has been dead.

102
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
She could wake up within three days.

103
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Even if she's in danger,

104
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
she'll be released.

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,600
I'm afraid she'll have to return to the capital.

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
But the way back to the capital...

107
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Three days, right?

108
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Guards!

109
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
My lord, please.

110
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I have to return to the capital by two o'clock

111
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
as soon as I get the carriage.

112
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
The rest of the troops will go to the capital.

113
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I'll arrange for them to leave.

114
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Yes, my lord.

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Hurry!

116
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Take my carriage to the palace and ask for the imperial doctor.

117
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Stop!

118
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
The imperial doctor has already been resting at night.

119
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
He can't be invited.

120
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I'll explain this to my lord.

121
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
The imperial doctor has been resting at night.

122
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
He can't be invited.

123
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I'll explain this to my lord.

124
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Imperial doctor!

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Why should I invite the imperial doctor?

126
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
I'm hurt.

127
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Why are you here?

128
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Who allowed you to enter the palace?

129
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
No one in the palace can cook.

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
A servant from the previous family went to the capital to find a wife.

131
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
She seemed to have lost her reputation in the palace.

132
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Fortunately, Your Highness came back to see her.

133
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,600
You should thank her.

134
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Besides,

135
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
you don't want to let others know

136
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,600
that you are not at the palace in these days.

137
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
My lord,

138
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
why did you sleep at night?

139
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I just feel so good.

140
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
You are a stranger.

141
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Who allowed you to enter my room?

142
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
If you don't want to be taken by others,

143
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
you can let me in at night.

144
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Please invite the imperial doctor for the imperial doctor.

145
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
You are a servant in the palace.

146
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
You should have this ability.

147
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Right?

148
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
I'll try my best.

149
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
My lord.

150
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
My lord.

151
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
My lord.

152
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
What?

153
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
You are awake.

154
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Who is there?

155
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Great. Great.

156
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm saved.

157
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Who are you?

158
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Where is Zhou Jinyan?

159
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
I'm Song Zhao Zhao.

160
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I was taken by the emperor to cure you.

161
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Please save my lord.

162
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Save me?

163
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
I'll go.

164
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
This is the place where the imperial doctor

165
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
and the servant Song Zhao Zhao live.

166
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Many noble women are looking for the imperial doctor.

167
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I dare not knock on the door.

168
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Why don't we wait until the day is over?

169
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
My lord.

170
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Do you want me to sleep for a while?

171
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
If you don't want to be in danger,

172
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
you can go save her with me.

173
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
When will the queen wake up?

174
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
It's been so long.

175
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
It's good to wake up.

176
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Wait for me.

177
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
If you don't remember the medical skill,

178
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
I'll change myself.

179
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
No. No. No.

180
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
No need to change.

181
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
I can.

182
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
I'm the best doctor in the capital.

183
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
The best doctor.

184
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Don't play the fool.

185
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
If she has any problems,

186
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
you can send her away.

187
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
That's it.

188
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Really?

189
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Yes.

190
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
I'll call her back.

191
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Okay.

192
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
