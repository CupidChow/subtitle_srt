1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Choose this thread to flee.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:13,180
Use the end thread to make itρώ

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,200
Move the thread to the first thread.

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,200
This is the most important part.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,840
It only applies once per thread.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,720
Your Highness,

7
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,360
how did the maid

8
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,720
and first lady Xufeng

9
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,280
go through a long period?

10
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,240
Your Highness,

11
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,440
a few days ago,

12
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,240
how did Lady Xu and Lady Liu Li go so far?

13
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Didn't she get brought into the palace

14
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
by the Empress from childhood?

15
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,040
What's the relationship between Lady Liu Li and you?

16
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,640
Lady Xu is the maid in the Empress' room.

17
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Yes, all the maid in the palace knows.

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,160
Lady Xu.

19
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Lady Xu.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,040
Your Highness,

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,640
there's nothing here.

22
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,160
What are you doing?

23
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,840
The capital is full of people.

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,520
But there was once a month

25
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,840
where the Empress was studying for the Holy Buddha.

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,240
What people lose is just their own debt.

27
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,480
What do you mean?

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
What's the relationship between them?

29
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,320
Your Highness, are you afraid of regret?

30
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,360
Everyone is afraid of it.

31
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,360
But I don't regret it.

32
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,160
What about you, Lady Xu?

33
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,160
I'm still afraid.

34
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,040
Your Highness,

35
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,720
Lady Liu Li has something to ask for.

36
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
It's about the future of the Wu family.

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,240
Tell me.

38
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,240
What's the matter?

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
You can leave now.

40
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Yes, Your Highness.

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Sister, if you don't make a mistake,

42
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,240
that maid must have taken the person who lost her heart

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
away on purpose to frame us up.

44
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
What do you know about the Wu family?

45
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
I only know that the Wu family is my sister's wealth.

46
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
And my sister is the wealth of our Wu family.

47
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Chu Jingyan and Shen Jiayue

48
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
are not from where to come here.

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
They must be against my sister.

50
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
You're quite smart.

51
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
I only care about my sister.

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
If my sister is willing to come here with me,

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
I'd be willing to kill her.

54
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Fine.

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
You don't know how to make a living.

56
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
You dare to mess with the country.

57
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
I don't know anything about the Chu family.

58
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
I don't need a Yanpian.

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Lady Liu Li,

60
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
if you want to live,

61
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
you'd better not come here.

62
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
After I leave tomorrow,

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
you can leave.

64
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Ru Yue,

65
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
would you like to do something for me?

66
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,240
You'll be my life.

67
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
I'll do whatever it takes.

68
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,240
Yaoyao, what's wrong?

69
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
I'm a little dizzy.

70
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Are you drunk?

71
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Maybe.

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Do you want me to go to the garden with you?

73
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Fine.

74
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
I'll go with you.

75
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Fine.

76
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Let's go.

77
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Be careful.

78
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
But you can go back.

79
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
You'll be fine after a rest.

80
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,240
It's okay.

81
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Put Chu Jingyao and Mr. Li in the house.

82
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
When everyone is looking for him,

83
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
they'll have a close relative.

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
The queen will be mine.

85
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Of course, he won't be the queen's choice.

86
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Don't worry,

87
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
I'll take care of it.

88
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,240
I'll go with you.

89
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
What's going on?

90
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Miss!

91
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Miss!

92
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Let's go.

93
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Let's go this way.

94
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Miss!

95
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Mr. Xu,

96
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
you're right.

97
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
I'm not qualified.

98
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
I have a close relative.

99
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Why do you have to do this to him?

100
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
But you did the right thing.

101
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
The contract is indeed your master's.

102
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
I'm not married to Cui Hu.

103
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
We're two.

104
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
How could we be married

105
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
when we're not old enough?

106
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
I'm not married.

107
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
It's just that Cui Hu is willing to marry him.

108
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Mr. Xu has given the responsibility to Cui Hu.

109
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
He killed the whole Chu family.

110
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
You're not worthy of that.

111
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
How dare you!

112
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
I remember that day,

113
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
when the Chu family was in a hurry,

114
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Miss Jingyao was not in a good health.

115
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
The queen sent her back to the palace.

116
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
When the banquet was back,

117
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
we were the ones who came to help.

118
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,240
But I didn't expect...

119
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Then why did Yu Bi Hu get Cui Hu's seal

120
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,240
on your hand?

121
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
I don't know.

122
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,240
It was you who ordered Xia Yao to poison my family 32 times.

123
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
It was you who burned my whole family.

124
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
I don't know.

125
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Chu Jingyao,

126
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
you'll never know this.

127
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Chu Jingyao,

128
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,240
you'll never know this.

129
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Come.

130
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
You'll see.

131
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
You'll see.

132
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
You'll see.

133
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
You should rest.

134
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
You should rest.

135
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
You go out first.

136
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
You go out first.

137
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
You go out first.

138
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
You go first.

139
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,240
these things

140
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
have something to do with Wu Tong Cang.

141
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
Young queen,

142
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
is too young for you to take care of the Cheng strong.

143
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,320
He has nothing.

144
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,480
My lord,

145
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,040
we have enough evidence.

146
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,240
How can we move to the Wu Family?
