1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Finally I guess I can do that

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,280
Enjoy my fun

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,680
Customize your collection

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,440
Yeah, it looks fun

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,240
Yes

6
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
Why did you do such a strange dream?

7
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
Could it be that...

8
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,240
...Chu Jinyan is not trying to take over the Hu family's reputation...

9
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
...but to take over the Hu family?

10
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
Who's there?

11
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,240
Interesting.

12
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,240
I'm the one who keeps the police under my control.

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm not a spy.

14
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
Someone is trying to take over the Hu family's reputation.

15
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Your Highness.

16
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Your Highness,

17
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
you've been training for years.

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,240
You're a good example of your skills.

19
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Would you like to give other people some trouble?

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
I've been in a mess with Pingluan for two years.

21
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,240
I've been through a lot.

22
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
I'm not in a good mood.

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
I'm just a person who might not be able to...

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
...to keep up with the people's efforts.

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Besides, there's a soldier who you must be interested in.

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
He's the one who's been trying to take over the Hu family's reputation...

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,240
...when he was in the House of Wang.

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Now, he's been thrown into the south.

29
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
I'll tell you the truth.

30
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
The south is his area.

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
If I go there, I'll only ask for the disaster.

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
I won't ask for anything else.

33
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,240
Your Highness, I'm changing clothes for you.

34
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Your Highness.

35
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
I haven't seen you for a night.

36
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
I'm really worried about you.

37
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,240
I've prepared a hot pot for you.

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,240
I didn't disturb you and my sister.

39
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Your Highness, it's getting cold.

40
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
I'll buy you some clothes first.

41
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
I'll go get changed.

42
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Your Highness, it's getting cold.

43
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Go get changed.

44
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
You're really up.

45
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
You're really moving.

46
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Your Highness, I'll do it.

47
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
I'll leave it to Jia Yue.

48
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Jia Yue, come and change for me.

49
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Your Highness.

50
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Your Highness.

51
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
You've been awake for a long time.

52
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,240
You've been with me for a long time.

53
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
But where are you from?

54
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Don't worry. I have a way.

55
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,240
How can I let Liuli do such a small thing?

56
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Liuli, you're the daughter of Lord Wu.

57
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
His Majesty has appointed you as his concubine.

58
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,240
I'll leave you to the big deal.

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Thank you, Your Highness.

60
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,240
I'll do my best.

61
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Sister.

62
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
I have good news for you.

63
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,240
I'm the noble family of Mingmen.

64
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
As the heir to the court,

65
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,240
I must be a good person.

66
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,240
The title of the sword is Su Pi Wen Ming.

67
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm afraid I can't eat it anymore.

68
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
I'm afraid I can't eat it anymore.

69
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm afraid I can't eat it anymore.

70
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
I'm afraid I can't eat it anymore.

71
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
I'm afraid I can't eat it anymore.

72
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,240
I'm afraid I'm going to suffer a lot.

73
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
So I'm going to find a way.

74
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
I'll eat it.

75
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
I'll have to stay here for a day.

76
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
I can't stay here for a day.

77
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
I don't understand what you're saying.

78
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
But if you're not late,

79
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,240
you'll have to be the descendant of the court.

80
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
I'll eat it.

81
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
I'll eat it.

82
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Since you've eaten it,

83
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
you should go and rest.

84
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
You came for this?

85
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Of course.

86
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Then you're done eating.

87
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
You're lying to me?

88
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,240
I just spit out the snacks I ate.

89
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Sister, what's wrong?

90
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
What's wrong?

91
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
Do you need a doctor?

92
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
I just ate some snacks.

93
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,240
I'm a little thirsty.

94
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Uncle, go get me a bowl of sour plum soup.

95
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,240
How can you drink sour plum soup in this cold weather?

96
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Sister, it can't be.

97
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Yun Jue, please get a doctor.

98
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Yes.

99
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Congratulations, Your Highness.

100
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
You're happy now.

101
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Of course.

102
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Congratulations, Sister.

103
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
You're so good, Sister.

104
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Uncle Yun,

105
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
let's go and tell the prince about this.

106
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
I'll keep it in my stomach.

107
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Do you understand?

108
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Your Highness,

109
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
I'm going back to my mansion.

110
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
I'm going back to my mansion.

111
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm the only lady in the capital,

112
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
the only one in the whole of the capital.

113
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,240
I wonder what's wrong with you coming to my house?

114
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
What you said is right.

115
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Sister is kind-hearted.

116
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
I'm not a good person.

117
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
I'm just a good person.

118
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
I'm just a good person.

119
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
I'm just a good person.

120
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
I'm just a good person.

121
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
I'm just a good person.

122
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
You're kind-hearted.

123
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
I'm thinking,

124
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm in the mansion.

125
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
I'm in the mansion to take care of you.

126
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm not here to report to the doctor.

127
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,240
How can it be that you're a good person?

128
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Jia Yu.

129
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Jia Yu, are you okay?

130
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Father, mother,

131
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
why don't you look at me first?

132
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Father, mother,

133
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
I have a good news to tell you.

134
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
So I can't be too anxious.

135
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Really?

136
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Then why don't you tell me about it?

137
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Father, mother,

138
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,240
I'm pregnant now.

139
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
What?

140
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,240
What a good news, sister.

141
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
I heard that the woman's pregnancy

142
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,240
can only be done in the month of January.

143
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Who is pregnant?

144
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Father, mother,

145
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
if you say so,

146
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
you'll have to tolerate me.

147
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Can you speak well?

148
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Don't cry and shout at me.

149
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Don't look at who's father and mother.

150
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Father, you knew about the situation that day.

151
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,240
You said that you had a wife with Prince Li.

152
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,240
That means you're pregnant.

153
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
I forgot about that.

154
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,240
That's why you're so good at it.

155
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
I can't even give birth.

156
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
What should I do?

157
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
But sister,

158
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,240
I dare not look at you like that.

159
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
When I was just entering the house,

160
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
I didn't shout at my parents.

161
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
You were the one who shouted at me.

162
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
It's a bit of a shame.

163
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Really?

164
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Then I'll give you a cup of tea.

165
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
I'll believe you.

166
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
You...

167
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Father, mother,

168
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm still not going back to the palace.

169
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
I'd rather stay at home.

170
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Liuli,

171
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,240
I'll give you a cup of tea.

172
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Mother.

173
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Liuli,

174
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,240
you have to leave the house in the afternoon.

175
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Come on, get some tea.

176
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,240
I'll give you a cup of tea.

177
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Sister,

178
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
please have some tea.

179
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Thank you, sister.

180
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
My stomach hurts.

181
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Jia Yu.

182
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Jia Yu.

183
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
What did you drink?

184
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Blood.

185
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
I'm bleeding.
