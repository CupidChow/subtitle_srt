1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How these awesome masks lay body parts most Duchu Jujube Lava are available in Japan or in local shops

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
They will be totally different in size and fitted with different range items

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,920
It is yeessa wrapping paper with Koz его

4
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,880
The last night, the sky was on fire.

5
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,880
The Li family were all dead.

6
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
The Chu family was gone.

7
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
I heard that there was a little boy.

8
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,880
The sky was dark and the stars were very dark.

9
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
I don't think he could survive.

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,920
No, no, no.

11
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,920
No, no, no.

12
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:19,920
No, no, no.

13
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
The rules of the Yulin Army are different.

14
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
No one is the son of the family.

15
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
They all know how to protect the concubines.

16
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
You don't know where the wild species comes from.

17
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,920
You are so brave to fight against the chief.

18
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,920
I won't give it to you.

19
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,920
What's wrong?

20
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Brothers, fight me.

21
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Fight him.

22
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Young Master, run. Run.

23
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,920
What are you doing?

24
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,920
Give me some more.

25
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Battalion?

26
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Your Majesty.

27
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
You are...

28
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
The people of the Yulin Army.

29
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
The people of the Yulin Army?

30
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Good.

31
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
The Hu family has a merit.

32
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
I want to reward you with a lot.

33
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Say it.

34
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
What's your name?

35
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Chu Jingyan.

36
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Chu Jingyan?

37
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Are you the son of Chu's master?

38
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Why did you appear here today?

39
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
If I don't tell you the truth,

40
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
I'm afraid I won't have the chance to see you.

41
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Prince Li is the title of the Xijue.

42
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,920
You have a merit today.

43
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,920
I want to reward you with a lot.

44
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
What do you think?

45
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
This...

46
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

47
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
You are right.

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Even if I'm the Xijue,

49
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,920
I'll have to be the son of Chu.

50
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Chu Jingyan is not enough.

51
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
I'm afraid he's not enough.

52
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Then why?

53
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,920
You should be the son of Chu.

54
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,920
You should remind me of the family situation after the new year.

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Okay.

56
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Go to the Empress Dowager's place to see.

57
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Your Majesty.

58
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Go with Chu to the Yulin Army.

59
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Okay.

60
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Don't bother.

61
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Uncle Wu.

62
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
I have something to tell you.

63
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
What?

64
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,920
You still think that you are related to my family?

65
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
You were so arrogant just now.

66
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,920
You should have told me the truth.

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Uncle Wu is joking.

68
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,920
I want to apologize for the misunderstanding.

69
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,920
I shouldn't have suspected you.

70
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
I was surprised and I was surprised.

71
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Now I have a new position.

72
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,920
It seems that you are the one who has two families.

73
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,920
I hope you can remember the relationship between you and your father.

74
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
The ancestors must have a revenge.

75
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
It's a long story.

76
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
I will do what I have to do.

77
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
You had a nightmare?

78
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,920
What kind of nightmare would make you do this?

79
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,920
You want to tell me what kind of person I am?

80
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,560
You're the one who's still in the manor.

81
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,200
You're the one who's still in the manor.

82
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,520
You don't have to protect me like this.

83
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,440
I locked you up to make you feel safe.

84
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
What?

85
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,760
I only found out recently that you're so interesting.

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Tell me.

87
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,960
What do you know?

88
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,240
Your Highness, you're trying to get me married?

89
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,240
I'm not allowed to be with you.

90
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,240
You said you wanted to see if I could bring you back.

91
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,720
Could it be that you can't go?

92
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Let me think.

93
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,160
This is a mess in the south.

94
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,520
The south is the foundation of the left.

95
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,160
But this time,

96
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,600
there's a rebellion.

97
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,080
So the people in the left are not allowed to see.

98
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Your派遣令 is too late.

99
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Am I right?

100
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,080
Sounds interesting.

101
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
The Wu family is not as close as the left.

102
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,680
You and the Wu family have the right to see.

103
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,880
It's a family matter.

104
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,800
You just have to let His Majesty see your talent.

105
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,840
Then this派遣 is still not your fault.

106
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,040
People are not sure about it.

107
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,200
It's also a leftist.

108
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,520
What do you think of this talent?

109
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,040
You're the one who killed the officials.

110
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,000
I can protect you.

111
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,240
I can also hand you over.

112
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,240
If you don't use me,

113
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,920
or lie to me,

114
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,280
I'll use your life to get rid of your sister.

115
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
First of all,

116
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,360
I didn't push you yesterday.

117
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Second,

118
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
you can ask me,

119
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,320
which means you've already believed in Wu Zheng.

120
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
You don't trust yourself that much?

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's to protect Wen Qin.

122
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I think we should stop laughing.

123
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,840
But I still prefer the one who will be fake and protect me.

124
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
You're in such a hurry to go to the south.

125
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,520
I'm sure there's something important to explain.

126
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,920
The truth about the Chu family is related to it, right?

127
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,240
Such a temptation

128
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,880
is not a stable one.

129
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,680
You can leave now.

130
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
You try to overtake me.

131
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Taste your wine.

132
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:57,680
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not

133
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:27,680
sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure

134
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:48,270
if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if
