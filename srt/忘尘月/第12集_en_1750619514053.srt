1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,020
A monument of the God of War

2
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,860
Episode 06

3
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,560
Is there anyone?

4
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,860
Is anyone there?

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the hill.

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the hill.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the hill.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the hill.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the hill.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The white-haired boy of that time.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Is that really him?

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
To remind myself that I'm not a child.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To remind myself not to forget that you have so many things to hide from me.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't be so obsessed with your lies.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then you're sober.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you want me to help you?

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Chu Yi.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Since you got the information of the Scythe of the Crashing,

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
you take the paper and go ahead.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The prince said that he would let me be at ease.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I hope that the prince will do the same.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't be so close to me.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Qian Yi.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The Wu Family is just a matter of time.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't have to face you.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm worried that I might be able to compromise.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm worried that I might not be able to compromise.

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is the red flower.

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is the rose.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is the red flower.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is the rose.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is the rose.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That is the spring flower.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Your Highness.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wu Liuli is back to the palace.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The queen brought her here herself.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
She asked the prince to be in charge.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What's the prince's reaction?

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The prince agreed.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not clear about men's words.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What?

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're feeling better.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm really worried.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I just came back from the palace.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can't wait to see you.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I know you're not willing to compromise.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm a very kind person.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've been looking for a good person for a hundred years.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I hope you won't be angry.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm not angry.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm taking care of my body now.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll leave it to him.

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This life is full of wine.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're the best, Your Highness.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're so beautiful.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then,

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I have to thank you.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Please have a rest.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll leave now.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Please help me to make a beautiful hairstyle.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Beautiful?

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's right.

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Since I was a child,

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I haven't seen my sister.

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think she has a physical disability.

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, I especially worshiped my family.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm a close friend of my sister.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What are you doing?

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What's your idea?

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What are you afraid of?

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Are you afraid that my sister will know you're not good at everything?

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Or are you afraid that I'll tell the whole family

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
that I'm a member of the family?

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Your Highness has been sent back to the palace.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You have no intention to leave.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Please don't go to the palace.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why are you so nervous?

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're acting like a ghost.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's too late.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Today, the Empress especially invited me to the palace.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll be at the house tonight.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Wait for me.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm here to visit Empress.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm here to say good bye.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're welcome.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Get up.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The family dinner is already over.

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We're sisters.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We don't need to be polite.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You must be here.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I came to thank you

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
to send out a female servant to help you.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Kneel down.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sister.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Who told you to help me get out of the palace

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and help others?

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm begging you to be kind to me.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Do you know that this is the same thing as the other one?

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Your Highness.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I have no choice.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're lying to me?

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You didn't let me in outside the palace that day.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Actually, the Empress doesn't know

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
that I'm here to beg for a sword, does she?

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The Empress.

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
She's already killed my sister.

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You have to punish her.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I just invited her to the palace for a few days.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The Empress said that I was forced to do it.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The woman is already dead.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I have to investigate.

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Get up.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Sister.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't listen to her nonsense.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
She's looking for excuses.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Lord Xu sent a letter for me.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Princess Consort Li, Shen Jiayue

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
has been with you for a long time.

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
She's been in a bad state.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
She's been ill for a long time.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll go to the palace to interrogate her.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you satisfied?

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Thank you, Sister.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The Empress
