00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,020
The End

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,420
Episode 5

3
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
What are you doing?

4
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,840
I'm scared that you're going to get a higher form.

5
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Now the situation is changing.

6
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
You still have the leisure to talk nonsense here.

7
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Wuliu and Gong Li have already pulled a relationship.

8
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
If you want to deal with them,

9
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
you still need to use Shen Jiayue to treat them.

10
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
You are right.

11
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
You are not leaving.

12
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm afraid that you will forget that he is the daughter of the Wu family.

13
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
I especially remind you.

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Don't forget your big sister.

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:11,840
The

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
The

17
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
The

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
You are awake.

19
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
The

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
The

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Prince.

22
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Know that you are not useful.

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Don't create trouble.

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
I am afraid that you will worry.

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
You think too much.

26
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
I have two princesses.

27
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Why should I worry about you?

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
I just remind you.

29
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Protecting me is not your duty.

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Recognize your nature.

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
Don't think that you can have any special place

32
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
when you go out with me.

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Then,

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
you worry that I will get hurt.

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
I am the prince and you are the princess.

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
That's all.

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
I am not the daughter of the Wu family.

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
I am not the daughter of the Wu family.

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
I should not be selfish.

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
I should not be selfish.

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
I should be loved by him.

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
Take care.

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
No.

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
The princess is awake.

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
Can you let me go back?

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
I haven't seen you for a day.

47
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
How can I be a bad person?

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Prince.

49
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
You are so careless.

50
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Why do you go to the river?

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
I don't know how is sister.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,840
I am going to see if you want to go with me.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
She is awake.

54
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
It's good.

55
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
I should go to see her.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
You have been treating your parents

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
with love and respect.

58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
I didn't punish you.

59
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
But I never ordered you to go back.

60
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Prince.

61
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
I am so kind.

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Why do you hate me so much?

63
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
When sister is not here,

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
I am not good at talking.

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
I am a good person.

66
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
I am not good at talking.

67
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
I am a good person.

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
You are a good person.

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,840
Yes, prince.

70
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,840
You are not in the palace.

71
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,840
You have to work hard.

72
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Besides, it's late.

73
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
If we go out now,

74
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
we will be in the dark.

75
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
It's not safe.

76
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
So you should go now.

77
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
What?

78
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
What is the reason you stay in the palace?

79
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Chun Yi.

80
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Send princess back to the palace.

81
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Prince.

82
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
Princess.

83
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Please.

84
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
She is injured.

85
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
I should be sent out.

86
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
All right, my lady.

87
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
You are injured.

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
I am here.

89
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
You are coming back.

90
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
What is the use of you?

91
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Sit down.

92
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
It's a matter of time.

93
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
You are a good person.

94
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
You are not to blame.

95
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
No use.

96
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
You are not to blame.

97
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Why don't you use it?

98
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
My lady.

99
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
You are not to blame.

100
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
You are not to blame.

101
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
If you go out,

102
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
you will be punished.

103
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
But you are injured.

104
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
You are injured.

105
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Chu Jingyan is a woman.

106
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
She is not to blame.

107
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
Why do you involve the prince?

108
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Do you want me to tell the princess?

109
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
She is so timid and timid.

110
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Why do you keep her?

111
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Your highness is willing to do that.

112
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
I can't do it.

113
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
But even if you tell the princess,

114
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
I can't tell her.

115
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,840
I think the princess is also responsible.

116
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,840
I said it.

117
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
It's so annoying.

118
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,040
Your highness,

119
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,840
I need to persuade you to accept my Met 69ots' orders and take charge of the entire palace.

120
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Your highness,

121
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
have you come back?

122
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Are you bullying me?

123
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Are you bullying me?

124
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,840
I will come back for you.

125
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Are you bullying me?

126
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Heaven televises evil deeds.

127
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,840
I've seen too many of them in the house.

128
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,840
So I said that it's not possible.

129
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,840
We must take back the Prince's heart.

130
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Otherwise, he will come back at any time to kill us.

131
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
This is not an impossible thing.

132
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Even if he can live like me.

133
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
What? Where did I just say?

134
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Kill us.

135
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
Yes, kill us both.

136
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,840
It's not impossible for the Prince to come back and kill us.

137
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
The Prince threatened me with his family's life.

138
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
He kept me here and didn't tell you.

139
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
He even begged me to stay.

140
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,840
This is just a simple and cruel thing.

141
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,840
If I don't take you back, I won't let you get out of this door.

142
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Did you misunderstand him?

143
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Absolutely not.

144
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,840
You are not a criminal in the Prince's heart.

145
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
I'm confident to help you get back your favor.

146
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
Then you let me go.

147
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
I don't want to see him.

148
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
I don't want any more trouble.

149
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Instead of being in a relationship with Xiao Qing and Xiao Ai.

150
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Why don't you come to the war?

151
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Do what you should do.

152
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Go far away and be nice to him.

153
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,840
Look at the weather today.

154
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,840
I'm telling you, it's normal to be cold.

155
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
Just walk around.

156
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,840
When I get back, I'll make you a lotus root soup.

157
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Why is there someone in the daytime?

158
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
I'm not cold.

159
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Why is there someone in the daytime?

160
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Do you know where the Prince is?

161
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Prince...

162
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Speak.

163
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
I dare not answer your question.

164
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Speak.

165
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
The Prince was imprisoned in the morning.

166
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
What?

167
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Why?

168
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,840
I heard that it's Doctor Song's high-heeled dress.

169
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Let's go to the palace and see.

170
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Be careful.

171
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Prince, I have a message. You two have to leave the palace.

172
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm afraid of you.

173
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
The situation is in the palace.

174
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
I'll leave the palace sooner or later.

175
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
It's Lady Xu.

176
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,840
Prince drove the Wuliu Li and that lady away for you.

177
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
He's afraid that they'll be disturbed.

178
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Really?

179
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Then...

180
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Prince, don't be nervous.

181
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
He can handle it.

182
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Okay.

183
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
I said you...

184
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Forget it.

185
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
I have to confirm it again.

186
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
I can't do it.

187
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Father.

188
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
How is the woman's condition?

189
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
How else can she be?

190
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Prince Li came back from the palace

191
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
and went straight to the palace.

192
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Moreover,

193
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
the woman Song Tai gave her

194
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
didn't get hurt.

195
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
His Majesty didn't punish her.

196
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
I'm sorry.

197
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Lady Xu.

208
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
It's all your good idea.

209
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
I won't let you die.

210
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Stop.

211
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
What are you doing?

212
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
That's the woman's condition in the palace.

213
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Look at you now.

214
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Father, are you going to help the outside world

215
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
bully your daughter?

216
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
I...

217
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,840
I used to think that I was sorry for you.

218
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
I thought that Jia Yue was going to kill you.

219
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
But this time,

220
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,840
you're living a peaceful life.

221
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
You're challenging the woman's condition.

222
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,840
My daughter's life is so hard.

223
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
I was pushed down by the cat-panel.

224
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
And I was sent back to my mother's house.

225
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
The cat-panel was a minor illness.

226
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
It was a minor injury.

227
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
My daughter was going to be a doctor.

228
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,840
I was worried that my father wouldn't be able to take care of her.

229
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
But no one was worried about my daughter.

230
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
In the end,

231
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,840
it was all my fault.

232
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
I begged my daughter to be my real father.

233
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,840
It hurts. It doesn't hurt me.

234
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Ling Li,

235
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
how could I not hurt you?

236
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Who doesn't you hurt?

237
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Right?

238
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
By the way,

239
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
I have a big tiger.

240
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
You must like it.

241
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Right?

242
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Let's go.

243
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
I'll take you there.

244
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840

00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
I'm sorry.

00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
I'm sorry.

258
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm sorry.

00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
I'm sorry.
