Your Highness, you are

4
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,680
The empress is so fast.

5
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,280
You're afraid that she won't be able to catch up?

6
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,280
I'm afraid that you can't explain to her when she's around.

7
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,280
You're worried about me?

8
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,080
No.

9
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,280
I'm afraid that the Hu family won't be able to make it.

10
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
You'll be able to make it first.

11
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,180
Your highness

12
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,580
It's really bye.

13
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:15,080
Yes.

You're welcome.

I'm sorry.

17
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,440
Chu Jingyan,

18
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,800
I don't care.

19
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:45,740
She was lying on the как 어머 to show our liking

20
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,740
After leaving the city gate,

21
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,740
His Highness has decided to meet with the King.

22
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,740
He will come back with a girl.

23
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,740
We'll see what he can do.

24
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,740
If His Highness finds out that you are hiding in the car,

25
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,740
he will send someone to bring you back.

26
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,740
Maybe he will punish you.

27
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,740
Why don't...

28
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,740
How can I doubt that you can't see His Highness?

29
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,740
Let's meet him first.

30
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,740
Why can't he come out?

31
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,740
Sister Liuli, Minister Xu.

32
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,740
His Highness asked me to search for you in the house.

33
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,740
Let's go, Sister.

34
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,740
I want to ask His Majesty to take me out of the city.

35
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,740
I'll be there in a few days.

36
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,740
Please let me know if you don't come.

37
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,740
I dare not. I don't dare to be the King.

38
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,740
Don't worry.

39
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,740
Chu Jingyan?

40
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
How come I'm here?

41
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,740
You are so smart that you are also being beaten up.

42
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,740
If you weren't saved by Chu Yi,

43
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
I would have been a great help.

44
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,740
I'm not a good person.

45
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,740
I'm not a good person.

46
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,740
I'm just a good person.

47
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,740
I'm not a good person.

48
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
I'm just a good person.

49
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
I'm just a good person.

50
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
I'm just a good person.

51
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,740
I'm not being saved by Chu Yi.

52
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,740
I'm afraid that if you don't live in the palace,

53
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,740
you won't be left with a lover.

54
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,740
The road ahead is slowly passing.

55
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,740
I want to be a good person like this.

56
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,740
Don't be too self-conscious.

57
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
Don't worry. I'm here.

58
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
I'll go to the south.

59
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,740
Then what I'm doing is...

60
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,740
Chu Yi took me to the city.

61
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
I have other things to do.

62
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,740
Then what plan have you got to go to the south?

63
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,740
Plan?

64
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,740
I'm afraid that the Crown Princess will be upset.

I had to make a plan for him.

72
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,760
To fight against the court.

73
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,120
I deserve to die. I deserve to die.

74
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,320
What else?

75
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
What else?

76
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,520
No... No more.

77
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,520
You came and knew it was me.

78
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Are you going to fight against the court

79
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,520
or are you going to take revenge on me?

80
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,320
I dare not.

81
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
I was deceived by someone.

82
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,120
The hounds said that to make the people alive,

83
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
I was forced to do it.

84
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Please forgive me this time.

85
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,920
As long as you are a noble man,

86
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,920
I will do what you say.

87
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
Really?

88
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Yes.

89
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,320
But you are a man of the past.

90
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
What should the court do?

91
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
How about

92
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
using his weapon

93
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
to say that you escaped?

94
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,320
I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't.

95
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
You want to pretend?

96
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Cui... Hu...

97
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,320
The prince is really a famous tea lover.

98
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Don't tell me

99
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,320
that those traitors are not the opponents.

100
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
You still want to be a spy?

101
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Cui Hu?

102
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,320
I don't know what the prince is up to.

103
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Get out.

104
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Mr. Cui is a wise man.

105
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
I like to talk to him.

106
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
Before the case,

107
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Mr. Cui was the last person to be killed.

108
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
What happened then?

109
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I was chased all the way.

110
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
I have some evidence.

111
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Wait.

112
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
A noble man like you

113
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,320
is always a scary man like me.

114
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I have a maid in the palace

115
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
who has a green-haired horse.

116
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
She has a baby.

117
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,320
I went to the mansion to look for her.

118
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,320
But I didn't expect her to beat me up.

119
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
I thought

120
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,320
she was afraid that she would hurt the noble man's eyes

121
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
and want to get back together with me.

122
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
So I went to the mansion again

123
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
to ask for a word.

124
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
But

125
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
the old prince was not well-off

126
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
due to the wife's reputation.

127
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
Even if she was a maid,

128
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
she wouldn't do anything.

129
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,320
She beat me up again.

130
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
So you just took revenge

131
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,320
and put the fire on my sister's chicken feet?

132
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
I was not that brave.

133
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,320
The old prince was afraid that I would disturb the chicken feet

134
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,320
and sent someone to send me out of the capital.

135
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320
So I had a maid now.

136
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
But

137
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
the woman who beat me up

138
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
didn't have any good intentions.

139
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
So the Chu family

140
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
kicked out the family.

141
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,320
So you can guess my intentions.

142
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
But the Chu family has nothing to do with you.

143
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Of course it has nothing to do with me.

144
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
But

145
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
I know

146
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,320
the real culprit behind this case is

147
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
the Wu family.

148
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Do you have any evidence?

149
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Of course I do.

150
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,320
As long as you lead me to the capital safely,

151
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,320
I will give you the evidence.

152
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Your Highness,

153
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
he didn't say the truth.

154
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
If he really has evidence,

155
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
why didn't he bring out the good news?

156
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
He said he would return to the capital

157
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
and return to the army.

158
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
He was running away.

159
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
He really has evidence.

160
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
His Highness won't find out the truth.

161
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Let me think of a way to find out the truth.

162
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Why bother?

163
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
If he didn't say the truth,

164
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
he wouldn't have to keep his life.

165
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Maybe he doesn't know anything.

166
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
I...

167
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I said it.

168
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
I saw the Wu family

169
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
on the plane.

170
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
I'm sorry.
