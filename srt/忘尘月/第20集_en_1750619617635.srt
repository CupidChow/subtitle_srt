1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,740
BELLAM

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Emperor

3
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,120
Lord Wu wants me to give the account to the Emperor directly

4
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Listen to the Emperor's punishment

5
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,120
Or Lord Wu will tell me first

6
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
The truth of the Chu family

7
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
Maybe I can ask for love for Lord Wu

8
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,520
My father and I are good brothers who grew up together

9
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,480
I know him, he is a martial artist

10
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
He has a kind of crazy illness

11
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,760
Every time he has a white hair

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,160
He will not remember anything around him

13
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
And he is a martial artist

14
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,720
But he doesn't remember anything

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Old Li told me to keep this matter

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,240
But I don't see anything on you

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,720
No one has a disease in the world

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,240
But your father told me

19
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
He is a martial artist

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
He defeated the enemy in the battlefield

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
And won the whole family

22
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
And finally became a foreign player

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
My father has a disease

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
But he never hurt anyone around him

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Why are you jealous of this new life

26
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
And you want to kill the Chu family

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
I am just a civil servant

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,920
I see your father is doing his best in the battlefield

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
And he is not giving up

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
But I still remember the old Wu

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
I know the empress is trying to kill her

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Because of jealousy

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
I made a wrong decision

34
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
To find the empress

35
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Or you just have to see the empress

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
You don't have to mention Lord Li

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Now he is out of the palace

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Your daughter is going to be the empress

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
And she is going to be the official

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
And she is going to be the rebel

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
You have to tell the empress the truth

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
And the empress is going to be the emperor

43
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
I understand

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,160
I won't let the empress be in the hands of the Chu family

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
So you sent someone to fire the fire

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
And burn Lord Li's mansion

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
How did you do that

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
I know Li'er is a good person

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
He wants to send Ruyue

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
And also the female official to the Lord Li's mansion

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
And also the female official

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
To the Lord Li's mansion

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
And also your sister Situan

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
I will find Cui Hu

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
And put the poison in the kitchen

56
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
of your Lord Li's mansion

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Cui Hu is more than enough

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
To be poisoned by your Lord Li's mansion

59
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
He has already been in a grudge

60
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
And he is using my money to make trouble

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Of course he is willing to do this for me

62
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
But I did this

63
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Just to let my Li'er escape

64
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
The mansion is not ready to fire

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Is it Li'er?

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
If you are willing to do this

67
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
If you are willing to do this

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Lord Wu will not tell the truth

69
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Lord Li

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
I have already sent all of them

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
I will report them to the Emperor

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
If I have sent all of them

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
I will report them to the Emperor

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Chu Jin Yan

75
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
You know I am the real Wu's daughter

76
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Why don't you tell me

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Why do you still want to marry me to a dead brother

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
In your eyes

79
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
What am I to you

80
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
There is no second person in this world

81
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
I think Lord Wu will not

82
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Take you out

83
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
To protect the bloodline

84
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,200
But how can I live on

85
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,200
You still have me

86
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
If

87
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
If you still have one more chance

88
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
To care about me

89
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Can you give me a chance to parents

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
I will do it

91
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Chu Jin Yan

92
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
If you continue to support Fu Chou

93
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
We still can't be together

94
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
But I am not the King of Li

95
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I am just a guard

96
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I am just a guard

97
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I am just to protect the Chu family

98
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
To protect the Chu family

99
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I don't care who you are

100
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
I care about you

101
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I care about our relationship

102
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Chu Jin Yan

103
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I will live with you

104
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
For the rest of my life

105
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
I will never see you again

106
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Jia Yuan

107
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Go

108
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Go

109
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Go

110
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Go

111
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Go

112
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Go

113
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Don't worry

114
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
I will be there

115
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I care about our relationship

116
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
I will be there

117
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
I care about you

118
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
I care about you

119
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I care about you

120
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
I care about you

121
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I care about you

122
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I care about you

123
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
I care about you

124
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I care about you

125
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
I care about you

126
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I care about you

127
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
I care about you

128
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
I care about you

129
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I care about you

130
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
I care about you

131
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
I care about you

132

I care about you

136
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
I care about you

137

I care about you

I care about you

139
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
I care about you

140

I care about you

141
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
I care about you
