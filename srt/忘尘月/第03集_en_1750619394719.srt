1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
Holdangle

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sick and tired.

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
When I return to Chu Qingyan,

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll be married.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I know he has a scar.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If I don't get along with him,

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll never know

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
what he'll do today.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He'll take your old stuff.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You...

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm willing to marry Chu Qingyan.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm willing to marry Chu Qingyan.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The marriage between the Wu and Chu family

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
was made by me and your father.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's been nine months.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Liu Li has just been married to the family.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's been a long time since we've known each other.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So we decided to get Jia Yue married to Gan.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm willing to marry you.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But the Wu family is different from the future.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The future is different from Liu Li's.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a different kind of destiny.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's also called the fate of Liu Li.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Jia Yue is also a beautiful woman

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
in the Gui Juan family.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
She has been with you since she was young.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She doesn't feel wronged.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you accept this arrangement?

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Jia Yue, thank you, father.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm not like that.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm not like that.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm just a daughter.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm a loving son.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's okay.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You can leave the house in three days.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll send you out of the Wu family

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
after the marriage.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I understand.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thank you for raising me.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can't change the story.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can't stop Liu Li from going back to the family.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't blame me for...

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Chu Jin Yan!

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I know it's you!

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't pretend to be a ghost!

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You...

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
ruined my grand plan.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Chu Jin Yan, you really like this kind of thing.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I can help you!

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I know what you want.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can guarantee that you'll marry me.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll do whatever you want.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll do whatever you want.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll send you out of the Wu family.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What do you think?

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's obvious that now that Wu Liuli has the Wu family,

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
she can't see you anymore.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But with her hate on my success,

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
if I force you and her,

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
she'll have to bear it.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She'll have to do something tomorrow.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You'll thank me for that.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll do whatever you want.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You can take me home.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What for?

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What are you afraid of?

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We have the time to be couple.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What's your gift?

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
As long as you promise me a request,

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I promise that on the day of the wedding,

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll get what you want.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Chu Jin Yan,

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I won't be insulted by you again.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What request?

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll tell you when the wedding is over.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Just promise me first.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If you listen to me,

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Wu Liuli will have it.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You can have it.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You think I care?

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Look at you.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're so heartless.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've left so many things to do.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I've been wandering for so many years.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
She wants to marry Ruhua.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The one who can marry Miss Wu Jia is me.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Why did you let her marry me?

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You said it yourself.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You don't like her.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You don't want to marry her.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I... I'm testing her.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
She can't afford to do that.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't care. I'm going to marry her.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I want to give my everything to her.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll get it back.

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Wu Jia's daughter, Wu Liuli,

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
is a good girl.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
She has a marriage with Prince Li's son, Chu Jin Yan.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
She's the princess of Chu Jin Yan.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
She's the queen of Chu Jin Yan.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you, Master.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Tomorrow,

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll be the queen of Prince Li's daughter.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
After Prince Li's death,

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
he'll be the consort of the Shen family.

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The two will marry Prince Li at the same time.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The news is out.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The news is out.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The two will marry each other.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Wait.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Father, mother.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
How can the Shen family

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
bow to me?

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Jia Yu, Liuli is right.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's not like this.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How about you leave the side door today?

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We're both the princesses of the Shen family.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm a concubine, but His Majesty is the one who's the consort.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why can't I be with you and visit your parents?

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're so rude.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If father and mother are done talking,

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
then Jia Yu will leave the door.

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Uncle Yu, let's go.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You...

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's the taste?

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's familiar.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why are you here?

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm leaving.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Don't go.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What's here?

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
These two 이� parent-student things

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
have never cheated on me.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What's inside is not that.

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't hear anything.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Put your medicine prepared

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and leave it here.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,760
Uncle Yu,

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
what's wrong?

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,180
コ깜

140
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,040
オルニ

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,320
今万別 I

142
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:37,720
Right, that's why you are bad Maps of...

143
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,060
Ho dare I not breathe?

144
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,600
Yes!

145
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,620
N-You...

146
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,260
What are you doing?

147
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,340
You requested him to hurt me!

148
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,340
If you think so, then I have more requirements.

149
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,340
It seems that you are not sincere.

150
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,340
You asked me to stay.

151
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,340
I will take two daughters of the Wu family at the same time.

152
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
I will be her family's wife.

153
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Don't worry.

154
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:24,340
I will find the evidence to prove that the Wu family is a family.

155
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,340
Who is there?

156
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,340
I will find the evidence.

157
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
I will find the evidence.

158
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,340
I will find the evidence.
