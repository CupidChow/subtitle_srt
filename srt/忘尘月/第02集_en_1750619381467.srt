1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Eight counties equipped with a new Rongma

00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,720
法车

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,520
Its consumption reflected in omnidrew

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,900
The Dong Ma

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,360
roaming on the water

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The End

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
On the 15th of june, the lights are on.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The ceremony begins.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The lanterns are on.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The dream is eternal.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The moon is shining in the sky.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The two wishes are in the right order.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The three wishes are in the right order.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The lanterns are so beautiful.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The three wishes are in the right order.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The two wishes are in the right order.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Mrs. Wu.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What are you looking at?

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't you know how to call me Mrs. Wu?

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Come on.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Isn't the moon dead?

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yun Quan.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's wrong with you?

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If you scare my wife and my sister,

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
can you take her with you?

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's her.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Mrs. Wu.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What if she's in the door?

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They're in the same way.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Since she's in our house,

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
since she's in our door,

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
she's always so stupid.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mother,

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the Wu family is in the middle of the day.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We can't let them go.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's my son, Lv Zhou Quan.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Leave it to me.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Uncle Yun.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Go tell the manager.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Someone fainted in his shop.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please take care of him.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's go out for a family festival.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Since I'm in the dark,

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I won't let Wu Liuli in.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Nor will I let the enemy

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
get into your family's trap.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Miss, the chef is here.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He said he'd see Master and Miss.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's them.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Miss, look.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The girl behind the chef's back

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
seems to be the girl who was at the gate yesterday.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I caught a thief.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I dare to take the wedding date of the Wu family.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm here to give it to Uncle.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Please tell us.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's going on?

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, no.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's me.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I've been in it since I was a child.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Give it back to me.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why is it the same as the previous time?

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is it because of me?

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Give it back to me.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Give it back to me.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The girl said that

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
the jade pendant was in the market since she was a child.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The master was selling it for private money.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Maybe.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Maybe.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Did he deliberately lose

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
a lot of money from the chef?

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't think so.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But the girl and Master Wu

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
are really similar.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm not sure.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why are they together?

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
At that time,

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I found out that I was a little bit close to him.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Today, he and Chu Jingyan

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
turned around and saw me.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's go.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know what Chu Jingyan is thinking.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He must be in the street.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Does he want to see the family's filial piety?

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Father, calm down.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Uncle, mother, sister Jiayue.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The shopkeeper from the Chu family said

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that someone has been

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
wearing the jade pendant that I've been wearing.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I think it's Jiayue's

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
wedding token that I lost.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
She brought it with her.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She even brought the thief who stole the jade pendant

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to teach Uncle together.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's mine.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I didn't steal it.

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm Liuli.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you for taking care of me yesterday.

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm glad that I was able to help you.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I've brought the jade pendant

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
that I've been wearing

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
to thank you.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I was wronged.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The shopkeeper saved you yesterday.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why didn't you thank him?

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Instead, you came to thank

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the mother who didn't meet you.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I won't let you die.

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Prince,

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
since we have already got engaged,

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
you've found a woman

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
who has a marriage engagement token.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What's the use of it?

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you think I don't deserve to marry you,

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you've found a match for yourself.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm willing to withdraw from the wedding

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and fulfill your wishes.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Chu Jingyan,

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
you're from the Chu family.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I've never forced you to withdraw from the wedding

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
because you're from the Chu family.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What do you mean?

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry, uncle.

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I didn't mean that.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
My father said that

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the person who was married to me

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
had a jade pendant with him.

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The jade pendant was a new one.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've never known the jade pendant

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
of Sister Jiayuan.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But I've never seen it

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
in Sister Jiayuan's body.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Father and mother know

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
that I've been in the jade pendant

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
for a long time.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Madam.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The crown prince came

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
to find a woman with a jade pendant.

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He said that it was my daughter.

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There are many people with a jade pendant in this world.

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Could it be that it was my daughter?

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I think Sister Jiayuan is right.

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If uncle has doubts,

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
why don't we close the door and get married?

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's better for the people outside to not mess up the plan.

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's about the family of Wu.

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yan.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The nine-turned-dark ball

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
has the family of Wu's ancestors.

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It was used to verify

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
whether the family of Wu

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
is the only one in the family

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
who has a family of Wu.

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Now, the two daughters' real and fake

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
are all known.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Please write it down and then you'll know who is the real one.

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't think you dare

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to say so much.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll do it first.

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The nine-turned-dark ball

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
has the family of Wu's ancestors.

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's hard to tell if you're the real one.

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sister, it's your turn.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You can't escape.

171
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You must have known

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
that you were a fake.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You dare to escape?

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You know how much I've hurt you.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Uncle, the daughter of the Wu family

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
has been found by you.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Please take care of her.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll take care of her.

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't forget the engagement.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I won't marry you.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I just got back to my parents' house.

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't want to marry you.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Che Qingyan.

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Shut up.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Dad, let them get away.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Take care of the old Chen Hu.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sick.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
