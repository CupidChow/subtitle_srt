1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
These cute sexy lights themselves have an 이잉

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,300
Once again, Leslie

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,300
Here you go

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,800
There is a clue, without footaru

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,000
As I always breath in there's no way I can play

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,200
Throw a ball down

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,700
Fly to the辦法

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,200
ought of use

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,200
The End

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
This is the medicine.

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Please take a look.

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Is there anything wrong?

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Noble Lady Wei, this medicine is not at all wrong.

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
But if a common person is in a bad mood,

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
it can cause a fever,

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,200
and cause a fever.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Sometimes it can cause a stomachache.

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Does the doctor know that this medicine is for special use?

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Especially in this deep-sea hospital?

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Noble Lady Wei, if this medicine is for women in a rural area,

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
it will stop the bleeding of the blood,

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,200
and cause symptoms of deep pregnancy.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,200
You mean, it's a fake pregnancy?

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,200
I don't know. I'm just trying to prove it.

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
How can you cure it?

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
This medicine is not a poison.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
It's a good medicine for the cold.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Can any medicine be cured?

29
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Exactly.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
For example, cold tea,

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,200
or some cold food can be cured in winter.

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
But if it's for women,

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,200
please pay attention to the sudden improvement of the blood pressure.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
It's not worth it.

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,200
I didn't expect that your hands were so cold.

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Go find the servants you like

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,200
and change the hot and cold clothes in the house into cold clothes.

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
It's already changed.

39
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Chu Jinglian is not a good person to be treated.

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
What is her purpose?

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Why did she learn to stay in the forest?

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,200
She took my position and treated me to death.

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Is her real goal a lonely family?

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
I've been away for two days.

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
I don't know that I've had children and left my family.

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,200
I'm so busy.

47
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
I misunderstood.

48
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
I misunderstood.

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,200
I caused the crime of murder and nearly saved the family.

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
I only said that we had a father and a wife.

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,200
I didn't ruin your friendship.

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,200
You ruined your friendship, didn't you?

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
I don't care.

54
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
And I know

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
why you gave me the power to grow up.

56
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
As long as I'm a camp,

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,200
I'll make sure that my family will not be destroyed.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,200
In order to make me and her a match,

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
the prince is in good hands.

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
What's the point?

61
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
It's a mess.

62
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
It's a mess.

63
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Why do you have such an idea?

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Chu Jinglian,

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,200
let's make the Wu family suffer together.

66
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
How?

67
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
You're smarter than I thought.

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
But smart people don't live long.

69
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,200
I remember you said that you don't care about these things.

70
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
But now you're asking me for help.

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
What's the point?

72
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
I can do more than you think.

73
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
For example,

74
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,200
I want to rebuild the prince's mansion.

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,200
But there's a problem with the prince's mansion.

76
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
I also understand.

77
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Are you threatening or seducing me?

78
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I hate this letter.

79
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
You just want to leave, right?

80
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
I want to use your hands

81
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,200
to take revenge for your power.

82
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,200
If you can live until I come back to Nanbu Palace,

83
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
I'll consider your proposal.

84
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Uncle,

85
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
did Yunjue tell you

86
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,200
that you and Yunjue

87
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,200
were cheated by your sister?

88
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Why did you do that?

89
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,200
That bitch is still here for me!

90
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Uncle!

91
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Yunshuo!

92
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Yunjue, wake up!

93
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Yunshuo!

94
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,200
How dare you wake up in the prince's mansion?

95
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,200
You're the only one who can stop me from being a maid!

96
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
How can you make my maid come here?

97
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
I just found out that

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
you wanted to investigate the situation

99
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
and give my maid a clear explanation.

100
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
You also want to help me.

101
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
In my opinion,

102
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Yunshuo and Yunjue are two girls.

103
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,200
They can go back to the house and play tricks.

104
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Or,

105
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
it's your sister who's so mean.

106
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
You're so mean.

107
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,200
You're really a good girl.

108
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Do you have any evidence?

109
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Evidence?

110
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,200
As long as you're being serious,

111
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,200
there's always someone who will be the first to say it.

112
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
No one will say it.

113
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
You're the one who will say it!

114
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
It's my fault!

115
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
I've been so naive.

116
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
I've been so naive.

117
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Please let her go!

118
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Please!

119
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Miss, I'm going to leave now!

120
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Yunshuo!

121
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Miss,

122
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
someone has kidnapped my maid.

123
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
It's all my fault.

125
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,200
I can't let this happen.

126
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
No!

127
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
How could I just listen to her?

128
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm going back to the house!

129
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
I don't believe it!

130
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Let me go!

131
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Let me go!

132
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
If you don't want to leave,

133
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Shen Jiayue will go to tell Ning Yue Sha's maid

134
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
that she's not good for the house and the mansion.

135
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Why is everyone in trouble?

136
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Everyone is sorry for her.

137
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,200
But there's no one who can take care of her.

138
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,200
How could I know that she's the one?

139
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Come on!

140
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
You're so beautiful!

141
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Come on!

142
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
You're so beautiful!

143
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
How could she do this to me?

144
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
As far as I know,

145
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,200
it's because you betrayed the Prince after entering the Wu Family.

146
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
That's why the Prince will change his mind.

147
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Wait!

148
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
The Prince wants to see Miss Wu.

149
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Please follow me.

150
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
The Prince is waiting for you in the front.

151
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
I'll take you there.

152
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Where's the Prince?

153
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
I'm here!

154
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Prince!

155
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Prince, I'm here!

156
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
It's you?

157
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
You want to hurt me?

158
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Do you dare?

159
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
If I do,

160
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
what's the difference between you and me?

161
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I'm not afraid of you.

162
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm afraid of you.

163
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm afraid of you.

164
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
I'm afraid of you.

165
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I'm afraid of you.

166
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I'm afraid of you.

167
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Prince, save me!

168
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Be careful!

169
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Prince,

170
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Sister Jiang Yue is hurting me.

171
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Thank goodness you let her save me.

172
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Thank goodness you let her save me.

173
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I didn't expect you to be so stubborn.

175
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Not bad.

176
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
There are many things you don't know.

177
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
You know a lot about things you don't know.

178
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Prince,

179
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
