How did your First Brother Ling come?

3
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,000
No wonder you're here, Mr. Chou.

4
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,680
Sui yeti is staring upwards from her back,

5
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,820
pretending to be drunk,

6
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,640
sitting with the wила one figure's reaction.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,040
Officer He's here.

8
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,440
What's that?

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,400
Nothing Except for today.

10
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Is he hiding the truth?

11
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,200
Go in the open.

12
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,600
Organize the money.

13
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,040
You're the one.

14
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,960
I sentrate Yan away to Xunchi's capital the other day.

15
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,840
That's all?

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

22
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,400
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,400
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,400
I can't get the key to the door.

26
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
This is...

27
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,640
I get to play Battle UCLA...

28
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,900
not really my fault!

29
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,660
Look at that...

30
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:04,480
how long have you been using it behind your back?

31
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,540
I don't think I've left that in mind...

32
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,500
That thing on the screen doesn't work at all!

33

retirement ceremony.

34
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Sister, why bother to fight with me?

35
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,280
I can't hide from you for a day.

36
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,280
When I came back, you thought you'd be checked.

37
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,280
But I didn't expect you would come.

38
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,280
I always think you'd be happy.

39
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Because even if you don't come,

40
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
I still have to find a way to see you.

41
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
The Prince was so determined to find a fake jade pen.

42
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
He also asked me to borrow it.

43
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,280
He was just trying to knock down the town.

44
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,280
He even found the real murderer who killed the Chu family.

45
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,280
You know about the Chu family?

46
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,280
I know a lot.

47
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
If you want a real jade pen,

48
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,280
why don't you go with me?

49
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
What do you want?

50
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Wu Tan.

51
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,280
As long as you give me the position of the Princess of Chu,

52
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,280
I will definitely return to you with the real jade pen.

53
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
If you don't believe me, forget it.

54
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
How can I believe you

55
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
until I find the real jade pen?

56
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
I don't mind.

57
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,280
If I don't believe you,

58
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
I won't have any loss.

59
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,280
I can't go to the Prince to get a jade pen.

60
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
But if I believe you,

61
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,280
I will be the only Princess of Chu.

62
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,280
I will see when you can make me believe

63
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,280
that I am the only Princess of Chu.

64
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Your Majesty.

65
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
I am here to inform you that

66
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
the Princess of Chu is not going to the Empress.

67
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,280
She is going to the Imperial Court to report to the Imperial Court.

68
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
I have been in the cold.

69
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,280
I beg you to keep yourself away from the house.

70
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I am very sorry.

71
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
You can go back today.

72
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Your Highness.

73
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
I just returned to the house.

74
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Don't let me leave.

75
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
If you insist,

76
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
you can go to the Prince's Mansion.

77
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
I dare not to resist the order of the Empress of Chu.

78
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
How did you offend the Empress?

79
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
I didn't.

80
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
I...

81
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,280
I just didn't want to leave the Prince.

82
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,280
If the Prince insisted on me leaving,

83
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
I would die here.

84
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
How dare you!

85
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
You are not even smart.

86
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,280
I will now obey the Empress and send you to the temple.

87
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Your Highness, calm down.

88
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,280
I am just worried about you.

89
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
I didn't mean to offend you.

90
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
I am willing to accompany you to the house.

91
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
What do you think?

92
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
What did you say?

93
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,280
I have been a spiritual leader for many years.

94
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
I should have stayed away from you,

95
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
but I couldn't do it.

96
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
You should have accepted the punishment.

97
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Thank you, Sister.

98
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
I am not afraid of you.

99
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Your Highness.

100
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Your Highness.

101
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
I am willing to go back to the house.

102
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
You...

103
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

104
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
I will leave now.

105
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Your Highness.

106
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,280
You are useless.

107
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
You have lost both the face of the Wu family.

108
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,280
You have been sent back to the house for three days.

109
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Why don't you both die?

110
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Father,

111
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
it is the Empress who punished Liuli.

112
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
I am sorry that she is missing.

113
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
I have been seen by more people.

114
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Why don't you go home and talk to her?

115
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
You are right.

116
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
If Liuli is the only one who knows,

117
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
why do you follow her back?

118
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,280
You still think that my son is not that skinny?

119
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Mother,

120
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
you are thinking for me.

121
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
You came back with me.

122
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Jia Yu,

123
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,280
although you are now our adopted daughter,

124
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,280
we are still raising you.

125
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,280
You still have to be grateful.

126
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,280
I will go with Prince Li tomorrow.

127
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
If you don't want to influence the Wu family,

128
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,280
you two should stay at home.

129
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
I am being taught.

130
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Xin is not going to be mine anymore.

131
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
I will send her home.

132
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,780
I do not think you are needed anymore.

133
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,780
What are you doing?

134
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,780
I left this alone.

135
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,280
I thought you were disloyal to my sister.

136
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,280
If you have anything to substantial need

137
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,280
to bring me me theже or trouble you have here in lido,

138
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,280
please return to the woman's clinic.

139
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,280
It's indeed something that can't be seen by the Noble Lady.

140
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
The family is a long-standing family.

141
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
It's just that the appearance is noble.

142
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
It's just that the inner heart is rich.

143
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
The inner heart is rich.

144
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
That's the real happiness.

145
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,280
The world is vast and the past is gloomy.

146
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,280
It's the same with the dress, the food, the tea.

147
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
What's the relationship between them?

148
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,280
I didn't know that you are such a generous person.

149
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
I should toast to you.

150
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
How do you know the secret?

151
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Of course, the Empress's daughter-in-law told me.

152
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,280
I don't even drink the tea that I toast.

153
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
How dare I be so heartless?

154
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
But I can hear the sound of the water.

155
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,280
The Empress is not the Crown Princess of the late Emperor's Art.

156
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Our Empress is doing this for the current status.

157
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
She asked the Chu family's servant, Xu Niu Guan,

158
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,280
to do something that can't be seen by the people.

159
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Then the jade coin is on Xu Niu Guan's body.

160
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,280
Then you really know how to be so generous?

161
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
I know.

162
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Then do you know where Xu Niu Guan hid the jade coin?

163
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
It's too much.

164
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,280
So you were trying to urge me to make arrangements.

165
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Then I won't disturb you.

166
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Please add me later.

167
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
I'm sorry.

168
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
I'm sorry.

169
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,280
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
