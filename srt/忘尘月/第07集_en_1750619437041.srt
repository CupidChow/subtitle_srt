00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
old

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
through

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
camera

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
sick

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
illness

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
let's stop

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
ten

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
odor

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
gr connector

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
8

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,160
glass

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Episode 1

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,160
Your Highness, sorry to bother you.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,360
I came here to collect some food for the southern tribes.

17
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,860
Please excuse me.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,960
Of course.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,560
Your Highness, the moon and the sun in the palace

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,160
are for the two of you.

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,160
Send someone to the warehouse.

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,760
Yes, Your Highness.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,360
Your Highness, please.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,160
Your Highness, the food in the mansion is here.

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,160
I will send someone to the warehouse to collect the food.

27
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,160
We will take the food away.

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,160
We need to hurry to the next house.

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Wait.

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
This...

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Your Highness, what's this?

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,360
This is what Your Highness meant.

34
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,960
The food in the mansion is for the southern tribes.

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,760
If there are some dust, the villagers won't mind.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,760
But if there are people in the house,

37
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,360
they will not thank you for the food.

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
So, you can make sure to make the food in the mansion.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,760
If you have the potential,

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,360
I hope you won't be trapped in the courtyard.

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,360
But people are more affectionate than blood.

42
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,760
It's impossible for you to know that.

43
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
I think it's better to stay.

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,560
What role do I play?

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,760
How do you care about me?

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
I don't care.

47
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
You're right.

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Your Highness, you must have seen my value.

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,160
What do you plan to do when you are in the house?

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,160
When the imperial guards are in the house,

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,760
I will go to the southern tribes to collect the food.

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,160
If you don't mind,

53
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,760
do you think he will take this opportunity to come to the harem?

54
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,260
But you can't sidle top-modeliddes.

55
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,120
What's more, he has his role.

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,120
I am still a gentle man to you.

57
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Otherwise, my heart would feel sad because I was yoled by you.

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,680
Can we leave today in the peace of the world?

59
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
What?

60
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,760
The two soldiers today are in a new area.

61
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,760
They don't look like soldiers.

62
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
They are more like people from the palace.

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,760
The time that the prince left for me to deal with the Wuliu Forest is really precious.

64
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
I can't do it.

65
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,760
Such a good opportunity.

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,760
How could it be crazy?

67
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
Father.

68
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Mother.

69
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
You are still here?

70
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
What have you done to Liuli?

71
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Mother saw it with her own eyes.

72
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
Liuli killed the prince's son.

73
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
She asked him to come back to the manor to be free.

74
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,760
Mother said that.

75
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
I'm afraid she is too biased.

76
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
The prince is going to the south palace to do his work.

77
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,760
I came back to know about it.

78
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Don't worry about Liuli.

79
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Liuli is not at home.

80
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
I will take care of her.

81
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,760
She will not see anyone when she comes back to the manor.

82
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,760
I, Wuliu Li, am free to stay at home.

83
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,760
I was appointed as the ancestral home owner.

84
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
I came to visit my eldest sister.

85
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
I want to see you, Mother.

86
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,760
I, Wuliu Li, am free to stay at home.

87
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
I was appointed as the ancestral home owner.

88
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
I came to visit my eldest sister.

89
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
I beg your help.

90
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,760
I, Wuliu Li, am free to stay at home.

91
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,760
I, Wuliu Li, am free to stay at home.

92
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
I, Wuliu Li, am free to stay at home.

93
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Your Highness,

94
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,760
we don't have any jade seal.

95
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
We don't have any official seal.

96
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Little girl, you are so rude.

97
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,760
You are so rude.

98
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,760
You used to be a noble and noble person.

99
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
You came to see me.

100
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Please, Your Highness, please, see me.

101
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Your Highness,

102
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
I have a good intention to remind you.

103
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
If you are shocked by His Majesty,

104
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
I am afraid that you will be punished

105
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
if you don't see me.

106
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
By then,

107
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,760
you will be in trouble.

108
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,760
How did you know?

109
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Why did you come here?

110
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
It's not that I know.

111
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
It's that Your Highness knows.

112
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Your Highness sent me to help you.

113
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
I am afraid that Your Highness

114
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,760
is overdoing some things in the house.

115
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,760
It's not that the more you are in trouble,

116
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,760
the more you are in the heart of His Highness.

117
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,760
But he also told me to go back to the Wu Family.

118
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
It's okay.

119
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
I will accompany you back.

120
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Your Highness,

121
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,760
you still have to give me the face of His Majesty.

122
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Wait.

123
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
As long as there is a place,

124
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
you can bring more.

125
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
His Highness doesn't like to be in the imperial court.

126
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
He has to have a new clothes.

127
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
wilt

128
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
sound

129
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
mood

130
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,280
even

131
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,760
You seem to understand me very well.

132
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
I'm used to it.

133
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
Did you find the fox?

134
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,880
At least,

135
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,440
at least, I don't have a day left.

136
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,760
You're the master of the palace.

137
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
I don't dare to do anything to him.

138
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,520
Your Highness, go and order something.

139
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,000
Sheng Zhi told me that you're leaving tonight.

140
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,540
Just a moment.

141
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,920
Shen Jiayue.

142
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,240
Are you missing something?

143
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,100
Why is it all done here?

144
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,880
Put that clothes on and take them.

145
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,660
Remember not to let anybody down.

146
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,240
I was cold-hearted,

147
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,760
but I was cold-hearted.

148
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,840
I wonder why you are so anxious.

149
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,520
Why don't I help you?

150
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
What a coincidence.

151
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,280
Your Highness is going to the south.

152
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,480
She will leave tonight.

153
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,680
It's good that you are back.

154
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,120
If it's too late,

155
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,320
I can't see you.

156
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,240
This time, you are alone.

157
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,280
No one is taking care of you.

158
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,600
I think you should

159
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,400
take care of yourself.

160
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
It's good that you are back.

161
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,400
I should tell the prince.

162
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,480
This is the minister in the palace.

163
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,320
What's your name?

164
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,520
This is...

165
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,840
I'm Xu.

166
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,760
I'm the maid of the Empress.

167
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,680
I just met the Empress today.

168
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,040
I sent her back here.

169
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,280
So it's you, Xu.

170
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,480
Sorry.

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,640
Is there anything else?

172
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,960
Thank you for waiting.

173
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,280
I am on the canteen.

174
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,800
You told me to wait here.

175
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

176
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
