Uncle pren�를

00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,820
Professor Tonkoc

5
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,940
Simply find a friend.

6
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,160
Man shall not be destroyed for tonight.

7
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,160
Be a firstly-rounded man...

8
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,900
...who hueepers will fell in love with you.

9
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,480
Never become the princess of Tatham WHATEVER I WANT.

10
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,820
We're just ahead.

11
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
But why can't we make up?

12
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,820
I'm afraid you're anxious.

13
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,820
You're not a good person.

14
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,820
So I brought you here to marry Yubi.

15
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
But you don't trust me.

16
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
You and I were watching

17
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,820
by Lady Xu while we were in the Jinbi.

18
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,820
How could that be?

19
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,820
Lady Xu?

20
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,820
That's right.

21
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
Yubi is on Lady Xu.

22
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,820
She's waiting for me in front of you.

23
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,820
Let's go.

24
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,820
We're just ahead.

25
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,820
Hurry.

26
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,820
This is it.

27
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
You said you'd take me to Lady Xu.

28
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,820
She's a maid in the palace.

29
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,820
How could she hide in the woods?

30
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,820
Don't worry.

31
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
The secret of the crown prince is unknown.

32
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
Let's go and see if Lady Xu is here.

33
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,820
Let go of me!

34
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,820
Let go!

35
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,820
Now I understand.

36
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Will it be too late?

37
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,820
Go!

38
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Why are you here?

39
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
Yes, I'm here to see you.

40
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,820
Your Highness.

41
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,820
Master Xu.

42
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,820
You...

43
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
You're fighting with me!

44
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
That maid is so good at telling lies.

45
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
She's the one who's trying to trick me.

46
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,820
I'm here to kill her!

47
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
How did you know I was lying to you?

48
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
Lady Xu is dead.

49
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
Are we going to meet a dead person here?

50
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,820
Tell me.

51
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
Is Yubi with you?

52
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,820
Or you've already given her to the Queen?

53
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
I've been with Lady Xu for many days.

54
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
How come I don't know she's dead?

55
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,820
I need to move out of her body.

56
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Do you want to tell the truth?

57
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
Chu Yi, wake up!

58
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
I'm Chu Jingyan!

59
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,820
What are you doing?

60
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
Chu Yi, wake up!

61
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,820
Chu Yi!

62
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,820
Your Highness, I...

63
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Chu Yi!

64
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,820
Chu Yi!

65
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,820
Chu Yi!

66
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,820
Chu Yi!

67
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,820
Chu Yi!

68
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Chu Yi!

69
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Chu Yi!

70
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,820
Chu Yi!

71
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,820
Your Highness...

72
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,820
I...

73
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
I should call you Chu Yi.

74
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Do you remember?

75
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
But without you,

76
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
Chu's family would have been gone long ago.

77
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,820
Your Highness,

78
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
you've never treated me like a servant

79
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
like your own son.

80
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
It's my life's fate

81
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
to take you out of the world.

82
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,820
No.

83
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
It's not your life's fate.

84
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
When I'm gone,

85
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
you don't have to bear the consequences.

86
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
Why did you save me?

87
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Liuli,

88
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
when you were little,

89
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
you said you wanted to marry me.

90
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
Now, you can't achieve it.

91
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
You have to promise me

92
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
to let Chu Hen go.

93
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
You must live a peaceful life

94
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
with confidence.

95
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
But I'm not my own daughter.

96
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
I'm the god of the family.

97
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
I don't think...

98
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
I really don't think...

99
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Chu Yi...

100
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,820
I...

101
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Chu Yi!

102
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,820
Chu Yi!

103
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Chu Yi!

104
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Chu Yi!

105
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
Chu Yi!

106
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
Chu Yi!

107
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,820
Chu Yi!
