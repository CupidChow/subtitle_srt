1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Which side is better?

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You will never find the truth.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The maid told me that you wanted to see me.

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But you...

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Liu Li!

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Jiaming!

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Jiaming!

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Liu Li!

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Jiaming!

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hurry up and find the doctor!

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's definitely a poison. The poison is very dangerous.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And the poison is colorless.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's been put on the cup of water.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It won't be found easily.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lord Wu.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Although you two are guilty now,

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
but you are not guilty to death,

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
why did you just go back to the Wufu Poison?

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Can you say that

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Lord Wu has no idea about the treatment?

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Plus,

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Jiayue has been unwell.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
She is still weak.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Please give me an explanation.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I didn't say that there is no cure.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The poison can be cured.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But the medicine is special.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It needs to be treated with the blood of the person who is responsible for the medicine.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Otherwise, the more you are filial,

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the more dangerous the situation is.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's okay. It's my fault.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's just Jiayue...

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Jiayue is also a child of Lord Yuenmu.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Maybe she has a miracle.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Please let Yuenmu be with her forever.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hu Liuling said that she knew where this jade was.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
As long as I give her the position of the princess,

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
she will give me the jade.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You always wanted this, right?

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You took me to the Wufu Poison.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
As long as you...

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Stop it!

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I am a young man.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't need a woman to help me.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Especially, I love you.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Get some rest.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I love you.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Jiayue.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What are you doing?

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Where is Hu Liuling?

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hurry up and let her do her job.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You have worked so hard to get all this.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Is it worth it to let her do it?

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Have you ever thought that if she lied to you

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
or she didn't take it, how could you break up with her?

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
As long as it's for you,

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I am willing to try it.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I...

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's not worth you doing this for me.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I have been living for revenge.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't have my soul.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But I know that I met you.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But our identity is so familiar.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So,

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
you still want to push me away?

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Chu Yi, why are you here?

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
His Highness forgot that he is from the Wu family.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Never mind.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I just want to remind you.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I will do it.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Your Highness, you are awake.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Come.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This...

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's great.

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Your wife's blood is not wasted.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I have a long dream.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Someone keeps telling me not to give up.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But I can't see their faces clearly.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Tell me,

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
did His Highness come here?

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
His Highness is in the hall right now.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You and Your Highness are in a lot of trouble.

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And Liu Ling is poisoned too?

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's strange.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You just said

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
what did you waste?

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Your Highness, you don't know.

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This poison needs to be cured.

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Only then can it be cured quickly.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You are bleeding every day.

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You are finally awake.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But you still don't know how Her Highness is.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Right.

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Is it that

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
it's not the daughter of the Wu family?

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Water.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Water.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Water.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Where is Jia Yu?

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Is she awake?

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Your Highness,

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
you should go back to her.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I knew it.

106
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I knew it.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I had the antidote beforehand.

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Your Highness.

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Your Highness.

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wait for me here.

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Zhu Yin, come with me.

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Zhu Yin,

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I have something to ask you.

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Can you promise me?

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Your Highness,

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm doing my best

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
to do my best.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Go to a place with me tomorrow.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't tell His Highness about it.

120
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Your Highness,

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I still need to report this to His Highness.

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Zhu Yin,

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
here.

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I love him so much.

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Only you gave me the antidote.

126
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I can't take it anymore.

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I can't take it anymore.

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Only you can help me, right?

129
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Here.

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What does Your Highness want me to do?

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Help me kill someone.

132
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's nothing to you.

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I promise

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
he's a bad guy who doesn't want to be killed.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This is the fate between you and me.

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry.
