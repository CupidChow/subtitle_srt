1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
Seriously?

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,020
We victimized humans when we're out here?

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,020
I'm going to make a little bit of a

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,020
little bit of a

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,020
little bit of a

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,020
little bit of a little bit of a

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,020
little bit of a little bit of a

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,020
little bit of a little bit of a little

9
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,020
bit of a little bit of a little

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,020
bit of a little bit of a little

11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,020
bit of a little bit of a little

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,020
bit of a little bit of a little bit

13
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,020
of a little bit of a little bit of

14
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,020
a little bit of a little bit of a little

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,020
bit of a little bit of a little bit

16
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,020
of a little bit of a little bit of

17
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,020
a little bit of a little bit of

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,020
a little bit of a little

19
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,020
bit of a little bit of a little

20
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,020
bit of a little bit of a little

21
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,020
bit of a little bit of a little

22
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,020
bit of a little bit of a little

23
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,020
bit of a little bit of a little

24
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,020
bit of a little bit of a little

25
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,020
bit of a little bit of a little

26
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,020
bit of a little bit of a little

27
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,020
bit of a little bit of a little

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,020
bit of a little bit of a little

29
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,020
bit of a little bit of a little

30
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,020
bit of a little bit of a little

31
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,020
bit of a little

32
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,020
bit of a little

33
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,020
bit of a little

34
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,940
bit of a little

35
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,020
bit of a little

36
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,960
bit of a little

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,820
bit of a little bit

38
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,520
of a little

39
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,100
bit of a little bit of a little

40
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,320
bit of a little bit of a little

41
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,020
The first one to report is

42
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,020
the Judge of the Court,

43
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,020
Even so, you are looking at me growing up.

44
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,020
You know me.

45
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,020
Jia Yu, you are still as stubborn as you were when you were a child.

46
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,020
But you have forgotten your identity.

47
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,020
It seems that the personal thing of the Sui army is true.

48
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,020
Family blood and blood, sister love.

49
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,020
Replying to Empress, I don't have any.

50
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,020
Do you dare to take responsibility for what you said?

51
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,020
I dare.

52
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,020
Good. Take the witness.

53
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,020
Greetings, Empress.

54
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,020
I have no reason to prove it.

55
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,020
When I was in the south, I was left alone in the house of Shen Jia Yu.

56
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,020
Empress, I was with Shen Jia Yu in the royal house.

57
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,020
Shen Jia Yu framed me and made me go back to the royal house.

58
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,020
To keep an eye on people, I let people find out that he secretly left with the royal family.

59
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,020
If there were no servants in the house to visit,

60
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,020
and it seemed that the road was lead by the street,

61
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,020
I had to go back to the house.

62
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,020
Otherwise, I wouldn't know about this.

63
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,020
But I wouldn't know, it doesn't mean that others wouldn't know.

64
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,020
Empress, Shen Jia Yu is the queen of the royal family and the daughter of the Wu family.

65
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,020
She is so quiet, how can the world see the Wu family?

66
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,020
Is there any other evidence that you can prove this?

67
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,020
Your Highness, I am the only one who can prove it.

68
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,020
And the daughter of the Wu family, Mr. Xu, can also prove it.

69
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,020
Shen Jia Yu was brought back by the prince that day.

70
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,020
To tell the truth, I still can't prove that I am in the army.

71
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,020
Bring her here.

72
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,020
Empress, I remember that this lady is a man.

73
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,020
The female pulse is different from the man.

74
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,020
I have been a doctor for more than ten years, this is not wrong.

75
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Shen Jia Yu, what else can you tell me?

76
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,020
Enter the dungeon, listen to the rumors.

77
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,020
I have two princesses, why should I worry about you?

78
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,020
Just to remind you, to protect me is not your intention.

79
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,020
To recognize your own nature.

80
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,020
Don't think that you can have something special to do with me.

81
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,020
Consort, you have been imprisoned for so long.

82
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
Isn't the prince really going?

83
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,020
Your Highness is really great.

84
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,020
You are hurt.

85
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,020
I am fine.

86
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
What happened?

87
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,020
A group of mousetrapes have been killed.

88
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,020
Do you need to ask the imperial doctor?

89
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,020
No need.

90
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
I am fine.

91
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
I am fine.

92
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
Do you need the imperial doctor?

93
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
No need.

94
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,020
I can go by myself.

95
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,020
Okay.

96
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,020
Sister, Shen Jia Yu has been imprisoned.

97
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,020
Why didn't he go to the dungeon?

98
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,020
How dare you!

99
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,020
He can die in anyone's hands.

100
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,020
But he can't have anything to do with the house.

101
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,020
Let the world be at ease.

102
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,020
Empress, Prince Li is here.

103
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,020
He said he has a treasure to give to the Empress.

104
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,020
Did he think it through?

105
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,020
Greetings, Empress.

106
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,020
Your Highness, this is the Empress's house.

107
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,020
Why did you come here?

108
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,020
I don't know.

109
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,020
I must have been a traitor when the Chu family was in trouble.

110
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,020
I was in the house.

111
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,020
I was taken by the greedy thief.

112
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,020
I have made a special offer to return to the Empress.

113
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,020
This is your sister's gift to me.

114
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,020
It is also her gift.

115
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,020
You can keep it.

116
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,020
Empress, you are here to prove my innocence.

117
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,020
Did you forget?

118
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,020
Shen Jia Yu designed me.

119
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,020
The emperor must have designed it too.

120
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,020
And Lady Xu also lied to me.

121
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,020
He must have been a help.

122
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,020
I forgot.

123
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,020
Your Highness's only sister is a white-skinned girl.

124
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,020
But the other one is not necessarily...

125
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
Enough!

126
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,020
Wu Liuli, you are going to the Wu family.

127
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,020
You can't be at peace.

128
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,020
I dare not.

129
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,020
Empress, you are a wise woman.

130
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,020
If you don't admit it,

131
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,020
you will never know the cause of the Wu family.

132
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,020
Shen Jia Yu has been released from the house for no reason.

133
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,020
He is 30 years old.

134
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,020
Wu Liuli is not a man of speech.

135
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,020
He is 30 years old.

136
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,020
Your Highness,

137
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Sister Empress,

138
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,020
how can you punish me?

139
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,020
I am doing this for the Wu family.

140
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,020
Lady Xu designed me.

141
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,020
She is also wrong.

142
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,020
I am the Empress's maid.

143
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,020
How can I take part in the Prince's Mansion?

144
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,020
I am here to wake up.

145
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,020
I should have gone with my parents.

146
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,020
Greetings, Your Highness.

147
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Come.

148
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
Fight.

149
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,020
Shen Jia Yu has been released from the house for no reason.

150
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,020
He is 30 years old.

151
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,020
I won't love you anymore.

152
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:32,020
I will only believe in myself.

153
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,020
But there is no future.

154
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,020
Jia Yu.

155
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Jia Yu.

156
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,020
No.

157
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,020
Don't look at me.

158
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
Don't look at me.

159
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
Don't look at me.

160
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
Don't look at me.

161
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
Don't look at me.

162
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,020
Your Highness,

163
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
I am sorry.

164
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,020
Your Highness.

165
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,020
Your Highness.

166
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
Your Highness.

167
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,020
Your Highness.

168
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Your Highness.
