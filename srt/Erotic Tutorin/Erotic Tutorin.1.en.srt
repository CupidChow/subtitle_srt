No.

3
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:32,803
No one's around.

4
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:34,555
Do you want to do it?

5
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:37,725
Really?

6
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:39,018
Here?

7
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:40,436
Is that okay?

00:00:40,644 --> 00:00:41,812
Yes.

No, I like it.

What part timer sleeps
in the owner's chair?

35
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,118
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

36
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:50,120
I don't need you.
Get out of here.

00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:20,526
I wasn't...

44
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:24,196
I think you got the wrong idea.

45
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:26,448
Yes?

46
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:34,206
Look at you.

47
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:36,417

I'm doing okay.

53
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,776
You're doing okay?

54
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,446
Are you fired again?

55
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:49,656
What? How did you know?

56
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:54,161
I'm not fired.
I'm doing really well in Seoul.

00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,038
Of course you are.

on when I hear your voice.

Dad, that's not it.

I really don't think this is the answer.

65
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:49,550
I need to go back to Se-in.

67
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:04,314

you waiting for outside?

I should have stayed
at that company.

Nice to meet you.

122
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:25,075
I'm way too old for a tutor.

You little brat.

124
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,705
Do you think you could
take the test alone?

125
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:33,458
But this is just wrong, dad.

126
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,586
I don't want to hear anymore.
Just do as I say.

127
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,968
She's going to stay in the
guest room for a while.

00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:53,562
Of course.

00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:54,896
Go ahead.

132
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:57,440

133
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:58,859

- Goodness.
- What are you doing over there?

136
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:09,990
I was just checking if the
hot water is working.

00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:12,200

I was just so curious about this.

143
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:53,408
This one.

144
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,618
Did you want to study that much?

145
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,287
Yes.

146
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:00,915
Please give me a minute.
I'll go get dressed.

147
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,792
Of course.

148
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:23,039
He goes. And a modifier comes after.

149
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:27,877
That's why you have an adverb...

150
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,922
Pay attention.

151
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,383
This is basic grammar.

152
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:34,634

153
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:37,220
I'm not really good at English.

154
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:42,517
You're worse than I thought.

155
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:48,982
I wasn't going to do this.

156
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:02,829

158
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:12,589
I'm going to show you this much today.
As an orientation.

159
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:16,176
Do you understand what I'm saying?

160
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,846
Then what do I need to do?

161
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:24,309
If you follow my lesson from now on,

162
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:26,603
things will be fun once in a while.

163
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:40,200

on this practice test,

164
00:19:41,284 --> 00:19:43,912

172

So you live alone in Korea, Eun-ji?

179
00:22:58,606 --> 00:23:00,024
Yes.

180
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:03,778
My family moved to Australia few years ago.

181
00:23:05,655 --> 00:23:08,199
I'm here alone.

182
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,493
Why didn't you go with them?

183
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:14,414
We don't really get along.

184
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:20,753
How long has you been single?

185
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:26,551
It's been over 5 years.

After my wife died, I was
done with my life in Seoul.

187
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:36,853
I came down here and run this
guesthouse and the farm.

188
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:39,188

189
00:23:40,189 --> 00:23:41,190
Yes.

190
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:43,067
It's a small farm for now.

191
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:49,949
Anyway, if you help him
to get his life together,

192
00:23:50,283 --> 00:23:55,163
I'll double what I promised to pay you.

193
00:23:55,788 --> 00:23:58,082
- Really?
- Of course.

194
00:23:58,374 --> 00:23:59,834
I wouldn't lie.

195
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:02,170
So please take good care of him.

196
00:24:02,295 --> 00:24:03,504
Okay.

197
00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:06,424
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

198
00:24:18,436 --> 00:24:21,022
I need to use the bathroom.

199
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:23,107
Sure. Go ahead.

200
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:30,615
Goodness, what's wrong?

201
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:34,660
Are you okay?

202
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,667
What are you doing, dad?

203
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:46,797
I think Eun-ji drank a little too much.

204
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:48,799
But still.

205
00:24:49,842 --> 00:24:51,427
I'm okay.

206
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,890
Goodness, are you all right?

207
00:24:56,474 --> 00:24:58,726
Dad, how much did you give her?

208
00:24:59,352 --> 00:25:01,896
She didn't drink that much.

209
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:04,815
Dad, I'm disappointed in you.

210
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:31,861
No.

211
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:38,701
Weren't you drunk?

212
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:42,121
I can drink a lot.

213
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:50,713
Fine.

214
00:26:51,797 --> 00:26:54,258
I'll give you a kiss if you get 80%.

215
00:26:56,052 --> 00:26:57,970
Really?

216
00:26:58,346 --> 00:27:00,765
Okay. You can't change your mind.

217
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:12,943
Why did you take so long?

218
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:15,404
She's so drunk.

219
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:17,657
How could you make her drink that much?

220
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:21,285
- She and I were only...
- Anyway,

221
00:27:21,702 --> 00:27:25,414
I put her in bed.
Don't do anything funny.

222
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:29,502
Do you think you could
say that to your father?

223
00:27:29,585 --> 00:27:32,338
I'm going to stay up all night.
Please go to bed.

224
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:37,176
You're going to play game all night again?

225
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,053
I'm going to study.

226
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:42,598
Study, my ass.
Since when did you study?

227
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:44,684
Gosh.

228
00:28:52,126 --> 00:28:53,419
Who is it?

229
00:28:58,007 --> 00:28:59,008
Who is it?

230
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:04,305
Are you here for the guesthouse?

231
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:15,024
No.

232
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,360
I saw the job posting.

233
00:29:23,073 --> 00:29:27,244
(Help Wanted: Bonus of 5 thousand
dollars if student passes the exam)

234
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:29,371
Yes.

235
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:56,440
Your specialty is Korean.

236
00:29:56,524 --> 00:29:58,818
And yours is English.

237
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:00,694
That's good.

238
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,947
I'm good at Korean as well.

239
00:30:04,782 --> 00:30:09,578
But since she's specialized in Korean...

240
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,747
I'm good at English too.

241
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:20,840
You don't have a twin sister, do you?

242
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:23,133
I'm an only child.

243
00:30:23,717 --> 00:30:24,844
Why do you ask?

244
00:30:25,594 --> 00:30:27,054
Never mind.

245
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:29,807
Anyway,

246
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,562
you're all here for Won-gi,

247
00:30:35,062 --> 00:30:38,941
let's get him to pass the test first.

248
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:43,904
Then who gets the bonus?

249
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:45,656
Excuse me?

250
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:49,243
I already taught him all the basics.
What are you talking about?

251
00:30:50,578 --> 00:30:52,746
He didn't pass yet.

252
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:58,711
Goodness. Okay, okay.

253
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,922
Let's do this then.

254
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:04,466
Since we're all here,

255
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:08,637
how about you two teach him in turns?

256
00:31:09,763 --> 00:31:11,307
I'd appreciate it.

257
00:31:13,893 --> 00:31:16,604
Gosh, one class is hard enough.

258
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:18,188
You little brat.

259
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:22,526
Could I go change first then?

260
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:24,862
Of course.

261
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:26,071
Go ahead.

262
00:31:58,145 --> 00:31:59,271
Yes.

263
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,816
I'll take my share and leave.

264
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:13,285
This one. The crime itself
isn't the condition.

265
00:32:13,452 --> 00:32:16,872
It is a requirement for establishment.

266
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:18,916
Article 6 of the constitution.

267
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:20,793
You want to highlight this.

268
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,258
If a non Korean citizen commits a crime
against a Korean citizen outside of Korea,

269
00:32:28,676 --> 00:32:30,803
Korean criminal law applies.

270
00:32:30,844 --> 00:32:32,638
This is very important.

271
00:32:32,888 --> 00:32:34,390
Highlight it.

272
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:43,107
And it needs to be proved with evidence.

273
00:32:44,024 --> 00:32:48,737
And this one. Criminal law.

274
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:51,365
If a non Korean citizen commits a crime...

275
00:32:51,657 --> 00:32:53,659
against a Korean citizen
in Korean territory.

276
00:32:55,786 --> 00:32:59,373
You need to remember this too.
Highlight it.

277
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:07,673
A civil servant must attend to his or her duties...

278
00:33:08,132 --> 00:33:09,591
It's very important.

279
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:13,429
Should we keep reading?

280
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:22,229
Please read it out loud.

281
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:23,897
Okay.

282
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:22,372
Attention.

283
00:34:23,165 --> 00:34:24,750
- Okay?
- Okay.

284
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:30,339
Steamboat.

285
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:32,216
Correct.

286
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,430
- Reconstruction.
- Good job.

287
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:43,602
Innovation.

288
00:34:44,394 --> 00:34:45,604
Correct.

289
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:49,650
Good.

290
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:52,736
Direction.

291
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:54,947
Great job!

292
00:35:00,911 --> 00:35:02,121
Imperial.

293
00:35:03,497 --> 00:35:05,165
Correct.

294
00:35:08,293 --> 00:35:09,336
The last one.

295
00:35:09,378 --> 00:35:11,004
Resource.

296
00:35:14,424 --> 00:35:16,051
Five stars.

297
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,470
- Five stars.
- Five.

298
00:36:33,003 --> 00:36:35,464
I'm going to die trying
to get my son tutors.

299
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:42,137
No.

300
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:43,639
No.

301
00:36:47,267 --> 00:36:49,561
Shower.

302
00:36:50,395 --> 00:36:51,980
I need a shower.

303
00:36:58,362 --> 00:36:59,947
I need a shower.

304
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:05,035
- Gosh.
- Are you okay?

305
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:07,120
I'm okay.

306
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:11,625
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

307
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:13,502
Let's get you up.

308
00:37:13,627 --> 00:37:15,003
I'm fine.

309
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:18,090
Wait, wait.

310
00:37:18,131 --> 00:37:19,591
Wait, wait.

311
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:23,178
I'm okay.

312
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:27,349
Wait, wait.

313
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:33,605
I'm okay. I can lie down now.

314
00:37:35,107 --> 00:37:36,316
Gosh, my back.

315
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,068
My back.

316
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:43,573
- Goodness.
- Are you really okay?

317
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:45,701
Yes. I'm okay.

318
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:47,995
I think I just pulled a muscle.

319
00:37:49,037 --> 00:37:50,330
I'll be okay.

320
00:37:50,956 --> 00:37:54,543
Then take your clothes off.

321
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,255
My clothes?

322
00:37:58,505 --> 00:38:00,716
Don't think anything weird.

323
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:03,677
I can give you an oil massage.

324
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:07,723
An oil massage?

325
00:38:17,566 --> 00:38:19,109
Okay.

326
00:39:00,192 --> 00:39:02,778
- Hey.
- Where did you go this late?

327
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:07,783
I couldn't sleep.

328
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:10,410
I was going to get a beer before bed.

329
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:13,163
You should have told me.

330
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,667
I couldn't let you pay for this.

331
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:27,844
Thank you.

332
00:39:30,263 --> 00:39:34,142
What did you do before you came here?

333
00:39:35,894 --> 00:39:38,355
It's a little embarrassing to tell you.

334
00:39:40,232 --> 00:39:41,858
You don't have to, then.

335
00:39:57,207 --> 00:39:58,333
How is it?

336
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,877
Do you feel better?

337
00:40:02,462 --> 00:40:04,172
Yes.

338
00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:09,803
Ms. Park. You're really good at this.

339
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:11,763
Of course.

340
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:13,723
I even have a license for this.

341
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:15,642
What?

342
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:17,561
Really?

343
00:40:19,896 --> 00:40:23,775
That explains. It's so nice.

344
00:40:26,945 --> 00:40:32,451
I was actually teaching after school class.

345
00:40:33,326 --> 00:40:35,579
It paid a lot.

346
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:39,916
Then why are you here?

347
00:40:43,795 --> 00:40:46,465
I was engaged.

348
00:40:47,966 --> 00:40:50,218
He taught at the same school.

349
00:40:51,636 --> 00:40:54,848
He got into gambling.

350
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,476
He had quite a bit of debt.

351
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:02,105
I paid for it.

352
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:06,985
And he dumped you?

353
00:41:08,862 --> 00:41:10,405
That's so messed up.

354
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:13,658
I wouldn't say he dumped me.

355
00:41:16,328 --> 00:41:19,998
There was a rumor that I was
cheating on him with a student.

356
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:23,376
That's why he left.

357
00:41:26,796 --> 00:41:30,383
I couldn't work in the industry anymore.

358
00:41:34,429 --> 00:41:37,057
I was scared to meet people.

359
00:41:39,976 --> 00:41:45,065
Teaching and talking in front of people...

360
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,692
felt scary.

361
00:41:49,778 --> 00:41:51,780
I'm sorry.

362
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:53,865
I shouldn't have asked.

363
00:41:55,575 --> 00:41:57,202
It's okay.

364
00:41:57,786 --> 00:41:59,746
It's all in the past.

365
00:42:02,374 --> 00:42:06,169
I can get my paycheck and the bonus...

366
00:42:06,545 --> 00:42:08,296
start a new life.

367
00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:12,175
The bonus isn't a lot of money.

368
00:42:20,684 --> 00:42:21,977
That feels good.

369
00:42:35,115 --> 00:42:36,408
By the way,

370
00:42:37,784 --> 00:42:41,955
you look like the girl I used to like.

371
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:44,749
Really?

372
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:50,130
That's why you asked me
if I had a twin sister.

373
00:42:54,676 --> 00:42:57,929
How much did you like her?

374
00:43:02,267 --> 00:43:03,768
It was a crush.

375
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:08,124
Does this count as kissing
the girl you had a crush on?

376
00:44:09,626 --> 00:44:12,003
I'm sorry.

377
00:44:12,629 --> 00:44:15,548
I got carried away.

378
00:44:53,211 --> 00:44:54,379
Please don't do this.

379
00:44:54,546 --> 00:44:55,797
I can't take it anymore.

380
00:44:57,132 --> 00:44:59,467
Didn't you want this?

381
00:45:01,428 --> 00:45:02,762
Yes, but...

382
00:52:17,155 --> 00:52:18,322
Sir.

383
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,577
Are you really going to give
the guesthouse to your son?

384
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,204
Of course.

385
00:52:25,705 --> 00:52:28,291
I worked hard for it.

386
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:31,586
If he passes the test,

387
00:52:31,878 --> 00:52:34,255
I'll give it to him.

388
00:52:37,258 --> 00:52:38,634
Then,

389
00:52:39,594 --> 00:52:40,678
what about me?

390
00:52:40,845 --> 00:52:42,054
What?

391
00:52:44,182 --> 00:52:45,308
You?

392
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:52,148
You'd be the one who made him pass.

393
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:58,946
Then are you giving me the guesthouse?

394
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:07,830
Okay.

395
00:53:08,247 --> 00:53:09,624
I'll give it to you.

396
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:11,083
But,

397
00:53:12,543 --> 00:53:14,420
make him pass the test.

398
00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:17,882
Then I'll give you the guesthouse.

399
00:53:19,258 --> 00:53:20,635
You promise?

400
00:53:23,262 --> 00:53:24,931
Yes.

401
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:29,310
You can't change your mind later.

402
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:32,563
Of course not.

403
00:53:33,189 --> 00:53:36,651
You can have it all.

404
00:53:37,235 --> 00:53:38,569
Okay.

405
00:54:18,734 --> 00:54:20,569
They really look alike.

406
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,370
They really do.

407
00:54:31,914 --> 00:54:33,124
Delete.

408
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:36,335
Delete.

409
00:54:58,482 --> 00:55:01,110
You're studying early in the morning.

410
00:55:02,903 --> 00:55:06,615
I want to pass and get you the bonus.

411
00:55:54,914 --> 00:55:56,082
Dad, what's wrong?

412
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,542
It went down the wrong pipe.

413
00:56:17,186 --> 00:56:18,479
What's wrong with you?

414
00:56:20,356 --> 00:56:22,149
It went down the wrong pipe for me too.

415
00:56:22,691 --> 00:56:24,610
You weirdo.

416
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:51,554
Why are your scores going down?

417
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:56,142
It's fine as long as I don't fail English.

418
00:56:57,351 --> 00:56:58,686
But still,

419
00:56:59,437 --> 00:57:02,064
you can't take the test with this scores.

420
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:08,446
What did I say I'll do for you
if you do better than 80%?

421
00:57:13,909 --> 00:57:18,038
I must be stupid.
I just can't do English.

422
00:57:18,289 --> 00:57:20,291
Korean is so much easier to learn.

423
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:22,042
What?

424
00:57:23,961 --> 00:57:27,715
Memorize these words by today.

425
00:57:28,507 --> 00:57:30,134
Or else.

426
00:57:30,134 --> 00:57:32,761
How am I supposed to
memorize these in a day?

427
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:34,597
You can do it.

428
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:36,056
Why not?

429
00:57:36,807 --> 00:57:38,392
Memorize it by today.

430
00:57:40,102 --> 00:57:41,937
What if I don't?

431
00:57:42,688 --> 00:57:45,357
Is my dad supporting you now?

432
00:57:46,358 --> 00:57:47,485
What are you talking about?

433
00:57:48,527 --> 00:57:50,613
I'm telling you to
memorize it as your tutor.

434
00:57:52,281 --> 00:57:53,908
Fine, I will.

435
00:57:54,116 --> 00:57:55,409
I'll try.

436
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,849
Did something happen?

437
00:58:19,975 --> 00:58:23,687
No. Let's study Korean now
that I'm done with English.

438
00:58:23,896 --> 00:58:24,980
Come on.

439
00:58:25,022 --> 00:58:27,149
It's not time yet.

440
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:29,485
It's fine.

441
00:58:30,152 --> 00:58:31,195
Let's start now.

442
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:33,322
Where were we?

443
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:45,042
Are you done already?

444
00:58:47,378 --> 00:58:48,379
What's wrong?

445
00:58:49,338 --> 00:58:51,173
I think he doesn't want my class.

446
00:58:51,924 --> 00:58:54,301
What did this bastard do?

447
00:58:54,635 --> 00:58:57,137
- I'd just go and...
- No.

448
00:58:59,431 --> 00:59:01,308
Won-gi isn't the problem.

449
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:03,185
It's that sly fox.

450
00:59:03,936 --> 00:59:05,145
Who?

451
00:59:05,854 --> 00:59:07,147
Ms. Kim?

452
00:59:09,692 --> 00:59:12,027
I don't know what she did with him,

453
00:59:12,861 --> 00:59:15,030
but there's definitely something
going on between them.

454
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,992
What do we do then?

455
00:59:19,243 --> 00:59:22,037
You can fire her, that's what we do.

456
00:59:23,372 --> 00:59:24,623
Fire her?

457
00:59:26,584 --> 00:59:27,668
Should I?

458
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:30,963
But the test is right around the corner.

459
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,591
I don't care, then.
Do whatever you want.

460
00:59:34,508 --> 00:59:37,052
I don't care if he fails English.

461
00:59:37,595 --> 00:59:39,680
Okay, okay.

462
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:41,223
Calm down.

463
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:43,309
I'll take care of it.

464
00:59:43,475 --> 00:59:44,518
I will.

465
00:59:44,685 --> 00:59:45,728
Don't worry.

466
00:59:49,273 --> 00:59:54,570
"He seemed to think it's
attractive when women are fussy."

467
00:59:54,987 --> 00:59:56,947
The reason why this sentence
is wrong is that...

468
00:59:57,281 --> 01:00:04,788
"picky" is the right
word here, not "fussy."

469
01:00:12,254 --> 01:00:15,424
You're staring at me.

470
01:00:16,675 --> 01:00:18,761
Why are you so pretty?

471
01:00:19,011 --> 01:00:21,347
What, me?

472
01:00:22,139 --> 01:00:23,724
Then who else is there?

473
01:00:29,229 --> 01:00:31,649
I was so surprised at breakfast earlier.

474
01:00:31,815 --> 01:00:32,858
Why?

475
01:00:33,776 --> 01:00:35,736
If you do that with your foot...

476
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:37,446
Do what?

477
01:00:37,863 --> 01:00:41,033
Earlier, with your foot...

478
01:00:42,618 --> 01:00:43,744
Never mind.

479
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:45,287
No need to be shy.

480
01:00:46,038 --> 01:00:47,414
Silly.

481
01:00:51,085 --> 01:00:52,503
- Wait.
- What?

482
01:00:52,628 --> 01:00:53,796
Your eyebrow.

483
01:01:08,394 --> 01:01:11,355
What are you doing in class?

484
01:01:12,314 --> 01:01:13,899
It's not what it looks like.

485
01:01:14,024 --> 01:01:15,567
Ms. Kim.

486
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:17,111
I need to talk to you.

487
01:01:17,236 --> 01:01:19,947
What is it, dad?
I need to study.

488
01:01:19,947 --> 01:01:21,490
You're not studying, you little brat.

489
01:01:22,908 --> 01:01:24,034
Ms. Kim.

490
01:01:25,035 --> 01:01:26,203
A moment, please.

491
01:01:26,787 --> 01:01:27,996
Okay.

492
01:01:38,298 --> 01:01:39,758
Thank you for your work.

493
01:01:40,342 --> 01:01:41,385
What?

494
01:01:42,219 --> 01:01:45,097
I think it'd be better if you leave.

495
01:01:46,682 --> 01:01:49,226
But the test is so soon.

496
01:01:50,102 --> 01:01:52,104
I don't want you to confuse my son.

497
01:01:53,397 --> 01:01:55,566
Let's just end it here.

498
01:01:57,109 --> 01:02:00,362
If it's about money, I don't need it.

499
01:02:00,696 --> 01:02:02,823
I just want to finish what I started...

500
01:02:02,948 --> 01:02:05,284
Your employer wants you to stop.

501
01:02:05,993 --> 01:02:07,286
I don't want to hear anymore.

502
01:02:17,045 --> 01:02:18,338
Okay.

503
01:02:23,677 --> 01:02:25,179
Aren't you going to take this?

504
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,475
It's okay.

505
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,270
You let me stay here all this time.

506
01:02:34,938 --> 01:02:36,315
Thank you.

507
01:02:42,321 --> 01:02:43,322
What is it?

508
01:02:43,697 --> 01:02:45,115
What did he say?

509
01:02:47,284 --> 01:02:49,369
You worked hard.

510
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,746
What is it?

511
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:52,164
Did he tell you to leave?

512
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:53,624
Why so suddenly?

513
01:02:53,957 --> 01:02:56,502
Your grade is so much better.

514
01:02:56,877 --> 01:02:59,755
You can focus on English
for the rest of the time.

515
01:03:00,255 --> 01:03:03,091
What do you mean? I have
so much more to do.

516
01:03:03,467 --> 01:03:05,052
Why do you always do whatever you want?

517
01:03:05,385 --> 01:03:06,512
What did you say?

518
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:09,807
Who are you to decide
everything about my life?

519
01:03:10,057 --> 01:03:11,767
You bastard!

520
01:03:12,684 --> 01:03:14,186
You little brat.

521
01:03:16,271 --> 01:03:18,899
I don't know what that English
tutor said to change your mind,

522
01:03:19,483 --> 01:03:23,195
but I'm not going to take
the test if she quits.

523
01:03:24,863 --> 01:03:26,156
What did you say?

524
01:03:26,365 --> 01:03:27,407
You little brat!

525
01:03:41,088 --> 01:03:42,339
Get inside now.

526
01:03:42,673 --> 01:03:45,175
You didn't do anything to deserve this.

527
01:03:45,884 --> 01:03:47,219
Don't be like that.

528
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:48,846
I'm okay.

529
01:03:53,976 --> 01:03:55,644
I can do better.

530
01:03:55,853 --> 01:03:57,729
I can pass.

531
01:04:00,148 --> 01:04:01,233
Yes.

532
01:04:01,483 --> 01:04:02,734
You'll do well.

533
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:04,987
Gosh.

534
01:04:12,953 --> 01:04:14,288
Are you really leaving?

535
01:04:17,624 --> 01:04:18,959
I need to.

536
01:04:20,544 --> 01:04:25,215
I got my courage back thanks to you.

537
01:04:26,133 --> 01:04:28,010
I want to teach in front of people now.

538
01:04:29,636 --> 01:04:31,013
Are you sure?

539
01:04:31,597 --> 01:04:32,890
Will you be okay?

540
01:04:34,266 --> 01:04:35,684
I'll be fine.

541
01:04:37,477 --> 01:04:43,692
I hope you study hard
and pass the exam.

542
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:37,681
You should eat more.

543
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:39,850
I don't really want to eat.

544
01:07:04,374 --> 01:07:05,876
Pass the test.

545
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:08,920
Then I'll come back to you.

546
01:07:09,755 --> 01:07:10,881
Bo-young.

547
01:07:20,474 --> 01:07:21,850
I'll try.

548
01:07:22,267 --> 01:07:23,602
Can't be that hard.

549
01:07:24,269 --> 01:07:26,229
I'll show him what I can do.

550
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:38,909
(Studying)

551
01:09:16,631 --> 01:09:19,342
Won-gi, you should eat
breakfast before you go.

552
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:21,803
It's better to go on an empty stomach.

553
01:09:23,138 --> 01:09:26,850
Don't be nervous.
Just relax while you take the test.

554
01:09:27,475 --> 01:09:29,519
If you don't know,
the answer is always 3.

555
01:09:29,603 --> 01:09:31,730
No, 4 is the popular answer.

556
01:09:31,813 --> 01:09:35,358
- I'm leaving.
- Good luck, son!

557
01:09:47,287 --> 01:09:48,496
What is this?

558
01:09:48,705 --> 01:09:49,789
Rice cake.

559
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:53,084
- I really don't want it.
- I didn't buy it

560
01:09:54,544 --> 01:09:55,921
Gosh, dad...

561
01:09:56,087 --> 01:09:57,547
Your dad didn't buy it either.

562
01:09:59,549 --> 01:10:00,967
Then who did?

563
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,304
Ms. Kim sent it.

564
01:10:04,804 --> 01:10:06,723
She asked me to give it
to you before you go.

565
01:10:08,391 --> 01:10:10,393
Really?

566
01:10:17,525 --> 01:10:19,486
I'll get 100% on English too. Okay?

567
01:10:20,403 --> 01:10:21,613
Okay.

568
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:48,598
(Police Employment Test
Identification number)

569
01:11:24,884 --> 01:11:27,512
It's okay. You did well.

570
01:11:28,263 --> 01:11:29,681
There's always next time.

571
01:11:31,016 --> 01:11:32,100
Dad.

572
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:33,810
Do you have any lawyer you know?

573
01:11:34,853 --> 01:11:36,229
Why?

574
01:11:36,855 --> 01:11:38,523
Did you get into a trouble again?

575
01:11:39,983 --> 01:11:42,360
You need to transfer registration.

576
01:11:42,485 --> 01:11:43,695
To my name.

577
01:11:45,113 --> 01:11:46,448
Transfer registration?

578
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,784
You passed, didn't you?

579
01:11:50,535 --> 01:11:53,788
I passed!

580
01:11:56,124 --> 01:11:59,044
You tricked me!

581
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:00,545
Good job, son!

582
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:03,048
Good job.

583
01:12:25,862 --> 01:12:26,946
Ms. Kim.

584
01:12:30,116 --> 01:12:31,659
You said you'd come.

585
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,831
Did you pass then?

586
01:12:38,666 --> 01:12:41,795
Thanks to the rice cakes you sent me.

587
01:12:46,466 --> 01:12:48,134
Rice cakes?

588
01:12:48,426 --> 01:12:50,428
I didn't send you that.

589
01:12:52,806 --> 01:12:55,809
Whatever. I passed.

590
01:13:05,527 --> 01:13:07,278
Congratulations.

591
01:13:08,321 --> 01:13:09,614
That's great.

592
01:17:32,627 --> 01:17:33,795
Won-gi.
