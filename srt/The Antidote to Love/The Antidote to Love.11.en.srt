2
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,440
Zhen Hu.

3
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,860
Your Highness, you shouldn't be here.

4
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,100
General Wushuang.

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,400
The imperial physician said

6
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,640
my blood could save him.

7
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,420
But...

8
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,760
General Wushuang,

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,260
something's off about this.

10
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,300
Only when he wakes
will we know the truth.

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,520
Let her in.

12
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,020
Your Highness.

13
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,640
You've found the Fire Lotus?

14
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,560
Have the medicine prepared.

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,920
How is Zhe now?

16
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,100
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,240
I failed to protect you.

18
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,580
How dare you.

19
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,640
Don't you dare take her away from here.

20
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,180
He serves my brother.

21
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,600
He wouldn't dare harm me.

22
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,620
Pretend to take me hostage.

23
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,080
Let's escape together.

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,680
Take it.

25
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,760
What are you doing?

26
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,560
Like you,

27
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,320
I don't want him to die.

28
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,320
I'll save my brother myself.

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,060
Leave.

30
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,800
He, what are you doing?

31
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,820
Here.

32
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,220
He.

33
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,160
This wooden carving looks like you.

34
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,780
It's a gift from me.

35
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,220
Let it keep you company from now on.

36
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,220
It will look after you.

37
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,680
It'll always be by your side

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,280
just like I do.

39
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,480
Alright?

40
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,140
Thank you.

41
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,420
Your Highness.

42
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,500
Did you let her in?

43
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,540
Yes.

44
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,820
I believe she means
no harm to Prince Qi.

45
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,520
You may leave now.

46
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,660
Yun Yao,

47
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,160
do you believe me?

48
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,760
I'd rather believe the truth

49
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,620
than believe you.

50
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,340
His brother wiped out my clan.

51
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,340
I've long wanted revenge.

52
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,060
Zhe.

53
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,070
Zhe. Fetch the imperial physician.

54
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,460
Yun Yao.

55
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,580
Please eat something.

56
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,940
Zhen Hu.

57
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,260
Hurry to Prince Qi's bedchamber.

58
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,260
Prince Qi is awake.

59
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,640
Did you hear that?

60
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,320
He's awake.

61
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,220
Seems my blood worked.

62
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,240
- What are you doing?
- Don't touch me.

63
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,900
- This could kill you.
- Don't touch me.

64
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,720
Prince Qi has passed away.

65
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Zhe!

66
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,260
(Mourning)

67
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,860
Zhe.

68
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,300
This is your favorite wooden carving.

69
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,360
I'll place it by your side.

70
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,400
With it beside you,

71
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,660
it'll be as if I'm right here.

72
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,540
You won't feel lonely or afraid anymore.

73
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,360
Your Highness.

74
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,300
Please accept my condolences.

75
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,160
In the afterlife, Prince Qi

76
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,020
would not wish to see you grieve.

77
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:46,060
(Mourning)

78
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,160
You may leave.

79
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,380
I wish to see him one last time.

80
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,520
Don't let her in.
