2
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,860
Zhe.

3
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,400
You're still alive.

4
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,440
What happened?

5
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,960
It's been days since we met.

6
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,720
Sorry for making you worry.

7
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,640
Why did you fake your death?

8
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,000
And why wear
the Chief Diviner's robes now?

9
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,520
If you want to know so badly,

10
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,760
come with me.

11
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
He,

12
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,580
do you remember this place?

13
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,740
Of course.

14
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,100
It's where we lived as children

15
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,140
in the Cold Palace.

16
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,000
It's grown much quieter.

17
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,260
Mother.

18
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,380
Mother, please don't leave us.

19
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,640
Eunuch Li, I beg you

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,180
to find the imperial physician
and save my mother.

21
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,370
Get out of my way.

22
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,320
Move aside.

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,840
I thought it was something serious.

24
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,840
Just two princes out of favor.

25
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,540
Mother.

26
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,010
You don't deserve treatment.

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,020
You can't speak of my mother like that.

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,340
Don't speak ill of her.

29
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,980
- Zhe.
- What a fool.

30
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,440
Let me make this clear to you.

31
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,480
Even if this discarded consort
dies here today,

32
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,980
no one will claim her body.

33
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,920
What a fool.

34
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,380
Fool.

35
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,480
You wretched creature.

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,860
What a fool.

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,340
Fool.

38
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,920
- I beg you.
- Brat.

39
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,440
- Please stop.
- Brat.

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,400
- I beg you.
- How dare you bite me?

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,300
You wretched creature.

42
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,540
He,

43
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,140
why didn't they save Mother?

44
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,300
This imperial palace

45
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,320
is filled with coldness and greed.

46
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,940
Zhe,

47
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,420
I promise you.

48
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,360
From now on, I won't let you be bullied.

49
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,620
Since that day,

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,160
you threw yourself into training.

51
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,220
Later on,

52
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,640
you achieved great feats in battle.

53
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,260
Father asked your wish for a reward,

54
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,360
but you only asked
for a spacious chamber.

55
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,800
I remember you told me

56
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,660
that this

57
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,040
would be our home.

58
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,620
I was overjoyed at that moment.

59
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,260
We finally had a home.

60
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,420
I remember it all so well.

61
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,920
But what about you?

62
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,460
You forgot all you promised me.

63
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,900
You said we'd grow stronger together.

64
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,450
To keep our promise,

65
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,340
I became the Chief Diviner.

66
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,600
I wear this mask each day
to please Father,

67
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,840
speak well of you in front of him,

68
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,600
and take the beatings for you.

69
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,340
How did you become like this now?

70
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,800
I never wanted this.

71
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,400
But you're far too kind,

72
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,140
so I became the one to bear the blame.

73
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,240
This one here

74
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,360
is the eunuch who refused to save Mother

75
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,240
when we begged him in tears.

76
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,300
This one is

77
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,360
the official who impeached you days ago.

78
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,580
And this one here.

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,560
That's enough.

80
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,940
Have you lost your senses?

81
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,740
No.

82
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,780
You have.

83
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,240
For the sake of a woman,

84
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,920
you'd throw away our future together.

85
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,600
I cannot allow that.

86
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,580
The Moon Clan is honest and kind,

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,840
not at all as the rumors claim.

88
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,680
Enough.

89
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,840
I will never approve

90
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,260
of this marriage.

91
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,260
Let me be clear.

92
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,360
If you refuse to go this time,

93
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,480
I will take back your military power.

94
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,880
From now on,

95
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,120
you are no longer my son.

96
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,960
- Father.
- Guards.

97
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,680
Take him away.

98
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,040
So, five years ago,

99
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,320
it was you who led the slaughter
of the Moon Clan.

100
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,900
That's right.

101
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,960
I forged the imperial edict

102
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,920
and promised you the marriage.

103
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,820
On your way to the Moon Clan,

104
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,360
I drugged you to make you faint

105
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,520
and went to war in your stead.

106
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,800
I wore your North Army armor

107
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,180
and changed my face to look like you.

108
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,620
At that moment, I became you.

109
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,680
Prince Ning, Zhao He.

110
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
Zhe.

111
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,060
You...

112
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,080
Do you wish to know
how I crushed the Moon Clan?

113
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,620
Your Highness,

114
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
this is the North Army survivor
from back then.

115
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,680
Sir,

116
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,040
do you still remember
what happened then?

117
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,520
Back in those days,

118
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,680
when we left the Moon Clan

119
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,720
and returned to Dawei,

120
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,620
the soldiers in the brigade
that destroyed the Moon Clan

121
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,380
died mysteriously

122
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,800
from poison one after another.

123
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,920
By some luck, I survived.

124
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,900
So,

125
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,680
on your way to the Moon Clan,

126
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,480
did you run into an ambush?

127
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,280
Yes.

128
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,360
After we were ambushed,

129
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,600
Prince Ning

130
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,200
nearly fell unconscious from his wounds.

131
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,680
When we set out again,

132
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,120
he seemed

133
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,720
like a different man.

134
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,840
A different man?

135
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,000
Could it be

136
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,300
he was already swapped then?

137
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you recall

138
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,900
anything odd about him

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,500
after he was ambushed?

140
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,740
There were times

141
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,100
he'd even mix up our names.

142
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,360
Oh, right.

143
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,380
On the back of his neck,

144
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,380
there is

145
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,660
a bean-sized

146
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,380
brown birthmark.

147
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,540
A birthmark?

148
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,260
Yes.

149
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,960
He serves my brother.

150
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,360
He wouldn't dare harm me.

151
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,920
(The Chief Diviner is Zhao Zhe.)

152
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,740
(He was the one who destroyed my clan.)

153
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,820
(How should I tell Zhao He the truth?)

154
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,060
Well.

155
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,940
What do you think of this tale?

156
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,240
It's quite a story.

157
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,240
Why destroy the Moon Clan?

158
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,860
Because their blood could be used

159
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,620
to craft the immortality elixir
for Father.

160
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,240
Do you know my reason
for making it for Father?

161
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,540
It's for you to rise high.

162
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,160
But five years later,

163
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,100
that medicinal slave saved you again.

164
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,780
I can't let her have a chance
to hurt you again.

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
Turn around.

166
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,400
Turn around and look at me.

167
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,020
So, you faked your death to frame her.

168
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,480
You'd rather have me believe
you were gone,

169
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,740
right?

170
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,220
Forgive me.

171
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,000
I made you worry.

172
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,540
He.

173
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,840
Please, don't be angry.

174
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,420
Don't be angry.

175
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,080
He.

176
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,700
Please, don't be upset with me.

177
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,960
Don't be angry.

178
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,500
Don't be upset.

179
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,740
Don't be mad.

180
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,300
You're what you are today

181
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,620
because of me.

182
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,260
From now on,

183
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,880
I'll smooth the path for you.
