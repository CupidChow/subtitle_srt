2
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,120
(Oh, no. Yun Yao is in danger.)

3
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,460
Burn her.

4
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,020
Demoness.

5
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,440
Burn the demoness.

6
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,240
Burn the demoness.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,080
Burn the demoness.

8
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,340
Burn her.

9
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,260
Burn the demoness.

10
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,880
Yun Yao.

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,320
Yun Yao.

12
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,160
- What to do?
- Wait here.

13
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,600
Zhao He.

14
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
Zhao He.

15
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,920
Zhao He, open the door.

16
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,900
Zhao He, Zhao He.

17
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,260
They've mutated.

18
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,100
Zhao He.

19
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,520
(The North Army has always protected
the people.)

20
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,040
(I can't bear to raise my blade
against you.)

21
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,520
- Zhao He.
- (Sorry, everyone.)

22
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,080
Zhao He, open the door.

23
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,380
Zhao He.

24
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,260
(Yun Yao...)

25
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,380
Who are you?

26
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,000
Tell one more lie,

27
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,300
and I'll make your pain a hundredfold.

28
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,220
Don't let her in.

29
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,660
It was me.

30
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,680
I was the one who brought you back.

31
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,480
It happened because of me.

32
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,660
It was I who brought ruin
to the Moon Clan.

33
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,000
Why did you lie to me?

34
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,180
Why?

35
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,340
Why did you deceive me?

36
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,440
Why?

37
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,640
I led the attack on the Moon Clan
on the wedding day.

38
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,400
(Yun Yao, let me protect you this time.)

39
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,440
Zhao He.

40
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,800
Zhao He, go now.

41
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,320
Zhao He, don't worry about me. Go now.

42
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,650
Zhao He.

43
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,520
Go, Zhao He. Hurry.

44
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,140
Zhao He, leave now.

45
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,800
Zhao He!

46
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,340
Zhao He, just go.

47
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,460
Zhao He!

48
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,410
Zhao He.

49
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,840
Zhao He.

50
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,560
Zhao He.

51
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,800
Your Highness.

52
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,800
Zhao He.

53
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,940
Zhao He, the North Army is here.

54
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Zhao He.

55
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,900
Zhao He.

56
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Zhao He.

57
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,040
Your Highness.

58
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,060
The villagers have been under control.

59
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,680
Is His Highness still unconscious?

60
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,080
(The poison has spread throughout.)

61
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,800
(Even if he wakes,
his cultivation may not return.)

62
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,360
General Wushuang.

63
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,380
Have you found those herbs?

64
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,020
I've asked them to look.

65
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,480
Good.

66
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,520
- Are you okay?
- Hang in there.

67
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,040
Be careful. Here.

68
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,800
Hold on a bit.

69
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,980
Thank you.

70
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,650
Thanks.

71
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,760
That's not the right way to bandage.

72
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,560
You need to wrap it like this.

73
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,660
Alright.

74
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,740
Your Highness.

75
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,960
His Highness can't control himself now,

76
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,300
so the medicine can't be given.

77
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,020
Get lost.

78
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,440
Are you okay?

79
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,620
I'm fine.

80
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,180
But His Highness...

81
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,640
Go back and rest.

82
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,020
Yes.

83
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,860
Zhao He.

84
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,220
Zhao He, please don't be like this.

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,840
Zhao.

86
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,540
Zhao He, it's me.

87
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,160
It's me.

88
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,880
Go.

89
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,280
Go away.

90
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,100
Zhao He.

91
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,060
Zhao He.

92
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,880
Don't do this.

93
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,900
Zhao He.

94
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,320
Please don't do this.

95
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,860
Zhao He, don't do this.

96
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,700
Leave.
