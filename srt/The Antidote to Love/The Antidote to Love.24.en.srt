=Episode 24=

2
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,980
Thank you for all your help.

3
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,240
If not for you,

4
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,320
the Moon Clan's revival
wouldn't be so swift.

5
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,780
Seeing you doing well,

6
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
I suppose it's time I go.

7
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,460
Where will you go?

8
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,780
Well,

9
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,900
I'll roam the vast lands freely

10
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,980
and have the wind welcome me
even at the edge of the world.

11
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,980
By the way, I'm curious.

12
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,940
If I make a wish at the Sacred Pool,

13
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,420
will my wish truly come true?

14
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,030
This is our special coin.

15
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,090
It can make your wish come true.

16
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,960
When making a wish,

17
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,940
a sincere heart is key.

18
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,940
Give it a try.

19
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,760
Do you feel it?

20
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,060
What?

21
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,060
Maybe I wasn't sincere enough.

22
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,100
Forget it.

23
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,500
Bye.

24
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,510
Be careful on your way.

25
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,980
How is Father?

26
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,700
Your Highness, you have come at last.

27
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,620
His Majesty's health is frail.

28
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,220
Please go see him now.

29
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,820
Father.

30
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,140
I have returned with Zhe.

31
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,740
Zhe...

32
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,020
What happened to him?

33
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,940
It's my fault

34
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,060
for failing to protect him.

35
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,620
It's my fault.

36
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,900
Zhe.

37
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,540
Zhe.

38
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,860
My child.

39
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,660
When Zhe became the Chief Diviner,

40
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,500
he once told me

41
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,580
he'd give anything

42
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,940
to have you become

43
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,860
the eternal commander of the North Army

44
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,780
and the future sovereign.

45
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,180
No.

46
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,700
Father,

47
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,220
none of these are what I wish for.

48
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,700
This land isn't yours or mine.

49
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,380
It belongs to the people.

50
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,500
Indeed.

51
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,100
Indeed.

52
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,780
During my reign of over 20 years,

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,420
I restored cities, opened granaries,

54
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,820
lessened taxes and labor,

55
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,220
and aided the poor

56
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,540
to free the people from famine.

57
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,060
I hope Dawei

58
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,740
may last for generations.

59
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,260
Yes.

60
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,500
You've achieved much,

61
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,100
yet you failed the Moon Clan.

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,660
It was my greed

63
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,220
that brought ruin to the Moon Clan

64
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,500
and hurt you two.

65
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,820
He.

66
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,140
He.

67
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,780
Come.

68
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,780
Father.

69
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,180
He,

70
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,780
I wish

71
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,540
for nothing more.

72
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,140
The future of Dawei rests with you.

73
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,140
Draft the imperial edict.

74
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,420
By the Mandate of Heaven,

75
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,540
the new Emperor issues this edict:

76
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,540
As fated,

77
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,420
the world is at peace.

78
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,700
The Moon Clan of the borderlands

79
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,740
is a sacred land of Dawei.

80
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:29,060
We shall remain friendly for generations

81
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,100
to maintain the peace

82
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,210
in the world.

83
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,700
Thus decreed.

84
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,980
Don't you dare touch her.

Zhe.

116
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,660
I have good news for you.

117
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,780
Wushuang has enlisted your subordinates

118
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,780
into the North Army.

119
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,000
Now,

120
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,820
they're helping
with guarding the nation.

121
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,580
Your Majesty,

122
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,680
why did you bury Prince Qi here?

123
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,580
This is where we grew up together.

124
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,300
By the way, how is Wan?

125
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,900
Don't even mention her.

126
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,700
She's always with the young men

127
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,580
and doesn't act like a lady at all.

128
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,900
Sounds a lot like you.

129
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,220
Bye.

130
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,500
Your Majesty.

131
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,580
Where are you going?

132
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,740
I'm off to play Go.

133
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,340
You lost.

134
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,240
This is so annoying;
I've never won once.

135
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,540
I lost again.

136
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,540
Young Master.

137
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,760
The Moon Clan is holding
a matchmaking event today.

138
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,020
Shall we go take a look?

139
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,040
If you want to go, go yourself.

140
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,660
I'm not interested.

141
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,970
Oh, right.

142
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,500
Speaking of the Moon Clan,

143
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,080
I have something to ask you.

144
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,220
Did you ever make a wish
at the Sacred Pool?

145
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,060
Does it truly work?

146
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,940
What did you wish for?

147
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,310
I wished

148
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,530
to be with Yun Yao

149
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,100
forever.

150
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,340
Forget it.

151
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,260
It's okay if you don't want to say.

152
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,820
Let's play another round.

153
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,170
This time,

154
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,460
I will win for sure.

155
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,620
If you ever need help later,

156
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,510
I will aid you without question.

157
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,500
All I ask is

158
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,170
for you to lose.

159
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,660
Mother.

160
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,100
Why are you so excited?

161
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,300
What's wrong?

162
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,260
Many handsome men
have come to seek a match.

163
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,540
You should go take a look.

164
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,260
Having you is enough for me.

165
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,300
Mother, having a child
shouldn't stop you

166
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,500
from finding me a dashing father.

167
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,940
What nonsense are you saying?

168
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,740
If you won't go, I'll go myself.

169
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,680
Hey.

170
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,300
Mother, I'll help you choose.

171
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,940
Slow down.

172
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,900
Got it.

173
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,300
This child...

174
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,450
Miss.

175
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,940
I have thousands of mu of fertile land

176
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,100
and vast family wealth.

177
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,500
No.

178
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,180
(Seeking a Live-in Husband)
Why?

179
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,160
With my qualifications,

180
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,220
many women in the capital
would chase after me.

181
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,350
Yet you refuse my offer.

182
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,140
I want the man to take care
of the household.

183
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,300
How tall are you?

184
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,300
I stand seven chi high.

185
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,140
Seven chi?

186
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,740
You look

187
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,180
like five chi to me.

188
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,060
Listen, my mother is stunning.

189
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,140
How stunning is she?

190
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,300
