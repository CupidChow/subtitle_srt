(Prince Ning's Mansion)

20
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,660
We found a North Army soldier
from the Moon Clan massacre.

21
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,860
Where is he now?

22
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,980
In Cao'ao Village.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,720
A clue appeared out of nowhere.

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
Something feels off.

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,800
Don't tell the Consort yet.

26
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:27,920
Don't tell who?

27
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,880
Your Highness.

28
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,700
He.

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,240
I heard everything.

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,480
You can go at ease.

31
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,620
I'll look after Yun Yao.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,840
Don't tell her.

33
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,860
Alright.

34
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,820
Why lock the door?

35
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,660
Yun Yao.

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,580
I promised He to look after you.

37
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,320
What do you mean?

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,520
I heard they found a clue.

39
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,180
They feared you might be in danger,

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
so they entrusted you to me.

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,440
Just stay here.

42
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,540
Open the door.

43
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,860
Open the door!

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,940
Unlock the door.

45
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,300
- Hurry!
- Yun Yao.

46
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,140
Open the door.

47
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,780
- Yun Yao.
- Open the door.

48
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,620
Yun Yao.

49
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,340
- Open up.
- Yun Yao.

50
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,200
Your Highness, just open the door.

51
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,860
No.

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,960
I promised He to guard it.

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Are you hiding something?

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,920
Is that why you kept us here?

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,260
They might be there to erase evidence

56
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,500
or change what was said.

57
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,120
My brother isn't like that.

58
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,400
Fine.

59
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,100
Since you say so,

60
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,740
how will you prove it?

61
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,520
My brother is always upright.

62
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,500
He's never...

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
Who?

64
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,140
Yun Zhi.

65
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,740
You...

66
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,920
What are you doing?

67
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,040
Something's off.

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,080
Let's go back.

69
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,800
You're with the North Army.

70
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,620
We just want the truth.

71
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,820
We won't harm you.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,920
Enough.

73
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,220
How hypocritical.

74
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,180
All are just empty words.

75
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,490
You set up this trap

76
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,150
to kill me, right?

77
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,760
And you.

78
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,720
I know you're from the Moon Clan.

79
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,740
That year, all of us in the North Army

80
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,100
died because of your people.

81
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,220
I'll kill you.

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,640
Do you know who I am?

83
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,500
Prince Qi.

84
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,820
Of course, I know you.

85
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,180
He serves my brother.

86
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,540
He wouldn't dare harm me.

87
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,940
Pretend to take me hostage.

88
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
Let's escape together.

89
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,100
Take it.

90
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,420
But...

91
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,460
Enough talking.

92
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,180
Stay back.

93
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,860
Step away.

94
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,180
Or I'll kill him now.

95
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,180
You wouldn't dare.

96
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
Why wouldn't I?

97
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,220
His brother wiped out my clan.

98
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,980
I've long wanted revenge.

99
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,520
I'll say it again.

100
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,360
Step back.

101
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,720
Yun Yao.

102
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,480
Zhe.

103
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,540
Zhe!

104
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,660
Zhe.

105
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,720
Zhe!

106
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,160
(How did this happen?)

107
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,600
Zhe.

108
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,900
He.

109
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,140
Zhe.

110
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,640
Hold on, Zhe.

111
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,160
He.

112
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,380
Please don't blame Yun Yao.

113
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,920
Zhe, don't say that.

114
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,120
It's not her fault.

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,840
Zhe.

116
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,060
Zhe...

117
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,380
Zhe.

118
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,420
Wake up.

119
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,580
Zhe.

120
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,500
(Prince Ning's Mansion)

121
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,580
How is he?

122
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,520
Your Highness.

123
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,960
Prince Qi's wound is fatal.

124
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,380
I can do

125
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,800
nothing more.

126
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,640
You must save him.

127
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,480
Or I'll kill you.

128
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,680
Please calm your anger.

129
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,940
Let me think.

130
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,000
There may be a way to prolong his life.

131
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,640
How?

132
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,680
Your Highness,

133
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,380
there is one rare herb we can try.

134
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,440
The Fire Lotus blooms once in ten years.

135
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,180
It needs harsh conditions to grow.

136
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,220
It must be picked

137
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,100
when all nine bloom.

138
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,400
I do not know where to find it.

139
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,010
Your Highness.

140
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,040
I'm here to see Mr. Jiang.

141
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,000
Young Master, you're needed.

142
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,480
Did she get into trouble again?

143
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,320
It's not her.

144
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,320
I'm searching for a rare herb.

145
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,240
Please tell me where Fire Lotus is.

146
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,840
I have it here.

147
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,120
What are you waiting for?
Go fetch it.

148
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,730
If you ever need help later,

149
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,530
I will aid you without question.

150
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,260
Thank you.

151
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,440
Young Master.

152
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,700
How could you give him Fire Lotus?

153
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,820
You got it after spending
seven days and nights

154
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,280
with the chief of the Romance Sect...

155
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,810
What?

156
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
Where did you hear such things?

157
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,200
The whole martial world knows about it.

158
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,620
I...

159
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,240
Zhen Hu.

160
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,520
Your Highness.

161
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,660
You shouldn't be here.

General Wushuang.

163
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,160
The imperial physician said

164
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,200
my blood could save him.
