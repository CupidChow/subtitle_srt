=The Antidote to Love=
=Episode 2=

2
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,100
The hemostatic remedy
of the Office is quite potent.

3
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,260
Miss, bear with it.

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,040
Who are you?

5
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,800
We've never

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,380
met before.

7
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,380
Tell one more lie,

8
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,720
and I'll make your pain a hundredfold.

9
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,320
I...

10
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,900
I'm just a medicinal slave
of the Office.

11
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,500
What's your name?

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,740
Medicinal slaves of the Office

13
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,880
have only numbers,

14
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,120
not names.

15
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,660
From this day forward,

16
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,440
you are now the medicinal slaves
of the Office.

17
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,560
You have only numbers,

18
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,870
not names.

19
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,380
(Yi Jiu)

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
Number?

21
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,860
(Yi Jiu)

22
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,240
Do you think

23
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,360
you can kill me?

24
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,740
Don't think saving me

25
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,460
means I'll be grateful.

26
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,700
You're no different from them.

27
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,060
You brought me back here

28
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,700
just to humiliate me.

29
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,560
Of course, I want you dead.

30
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,260
Your Highness,

31
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,820
those at the Office who drank

32
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,860
medicinal slaves' blood

33
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,880
all died from poisoning.

34
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,520
You poisoned them?

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,400
Yes.

36
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,840
(Those who trample on human life)

37
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,000
(want to use my blood to live longer.)

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,260
(Today,)

39
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,300
(the Fatal Herb will end your lives.)

40
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,540
They'd drunk our blood for years.

41
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,260
They humiliated us.

42
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,340
They all deserved to die.

43
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,700
I made them pay.

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,500
Keep a close eye on her.

45
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
(Zhao He,)

46
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,760
(you survived today.)

47
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,580
(Consider yourself lucky.)

48
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,360
Miss,

49
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,130
you'll stay here for now.

50
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,060
If you need anything, call me.

51
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,420
My name is Shen Wushuang.

52
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,740
Thank you.

53
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,440
I suggest you behave yourself.

54
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,720
If this happens again...

55
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,800
What then?

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,730
Will you kill me?

57
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,980
You can do it right now.

58
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,660
There are no maids here.

59
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,960
Apply the medicine yourself.

60
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,180
(Holy Land of the Moon Clan)

61
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,500
(Zhao He,)

62
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,600
(you wiped out the Moon Clan
five years ago.)

63
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,840
(I became a medicinal slave
and endured torment.)

64
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,220
(Now,)

65
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,780
(you've forgotten your sins.)

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,740
(I will make you pay in kind.)

67
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,500
(Emperor Sheng of Dawei)

68
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,500
Your Majesty.

69
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,800
Where is the medicinal slave?

70
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,380
Where is she?

71
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,020
Didn't I order you to bring her back

72
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,540
to make the immortality elixir for me?

73
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,220
Please calm your anger.

74
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,940
I meant to prove her efficacy

75
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,180
at the Eternity Feast,

76
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,500
but to my surprise,

77
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,380
Prince Ning seized her in public.

78
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,840
He took her away?

79
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,320
Your Majesty,

80
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,260
Minister Wang is dead.

81
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,400
What?

82
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,300
Dead?

83
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,180
Yes.

84
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,700
Poison took his life.

85
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,200
Your Majesty,

86
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,700
the time is not yet ripe.

87
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
The slave's blood...

88
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,380
Chief Diviner,

89
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,590
you once said

90
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,720
the immortality elixir

91
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,060
can grant me eternal life.

92
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,260
I care not if she lives or dies.

93
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,860
You must find her to make the elixir.

94
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,160
Yes.

95
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,560
Get out of my sight.

96
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,960
Demoness, show yourself!

97
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,380
- Come out!
- Blood for blood!

98
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,400
Come out!

99
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
Kill her!

100
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,720
Show yourself!

101
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,400
What's all this noise about?

102
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,260
It's her.

103
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,060
It's her blood

104
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,420
that poisoned my master.

105
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,900
Guards, take her away.

106
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,410
How dare you!

107
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,240
Don't you dare take her away from here.

108
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,500
A life for a life.

109
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,400
My master died unjustly.

110
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,560
This demoness must die today.

111
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,620
Over the years,

112
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,200
countless medicinal slaves
have died at the Eternity Feast.

113
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,980
Who has ever spoken for them?

114
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,980
Are medicinal slaves' lives
worth nothing?

115
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,640
They're seen as lowly.

116
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,540
How could they compare to my master?

117
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,120
Kill her!

118
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,600
End her life!

119
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,840
- Demoness!
- Go!

120
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,900
Leave!

121
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,480
- Kill her!
- Go!

122
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,900
Kill her!

123
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,200
- Let go!
- Demoness!

124
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,980
Don't you dare act rashly!

125
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,200
My master died so tragically.

126
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,960
Master!

127
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,100
Your Highness.

128
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm ordered to capture Yi Jiu.

129
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,460
Please don't interfere.

130
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,210
What if I refuse?

131
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,900
Well...

132
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,620
Everyone, look!

133
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,700
Prince Ning disregards
the backbone of the court.

134
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,410
He shields this murderous demoness.

135
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,680
In Dawei,

136
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,160
such a backbone does not exist.

137
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,620
Wushuang.

138
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,500
(Ledger)

139
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,800
This

140
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,360
is the proof of their crimes.

141
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,860
(Ledger)

142
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,140
In the 28th year of Hongzhen,

143
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,540
Mr. Cao abused his power for lust.

144
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,080
Every woman's name and deal
is listed here.

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,980
There's this one as well.

146
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,620
It details how Minister Wang
trampled on lives.

147
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,060
All of this was done by your master.

148
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,520
See for yourself.

149
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,600
Your Highness,

150
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
even so,

151
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,900
His Majesty ordered
the medicinal slave be caught.

152
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,360
Your Highness,

153
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,890
do you wish to defy the imperial edict?

154
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,640
I will explain this to Father myself.

155
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,120
Go now.

156
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,080
He,

157
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,520
you worked all night yesterday

158
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,720
just for this matter?

159
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,500
Why are you so protective of her?

160
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
Are you taking
the ghost marriage seriously?

161
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,860
He.

162
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,060
(Zhao He,)

163
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,080
(you were the one who kept me here.)

164
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Your Highness,

165
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,400
matters with Miss Yi Jiu are settled.

166
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,640
You defied the edict to keep her here.

167
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,200
Is she the one from your painting?

168
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,020
How is the investigation I assigned?

169
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,260
I only found the North Army involved

170
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
never returned.

171
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,700
Rumor has it they were all killed.

172
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,100
Everyone says I wiped out the Moon Clan.

173
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,580
But I remember nothing of that.

174
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,120
Wushuang,

175
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,840
she is connected to my lost memory.

176
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,860
Keep a close watch on her.

177
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,380
Yes, Your Highness.

178
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,180
(If she's not the one from
the painting,)

179
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,580
(then who could she be?)

180
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,460
(The Fatal Herb from the feast
grows stronger inside me.)

181
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,420
(Now I can't even hold
the medicine bottle.)

182
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,990
(I must leave the mansion
and get the antidote soon.)

183
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,360
General Wushuang,

184
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,810
the Lantern Festival is in two days.

185
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,040
It's also my wife's birthday.

186
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,780
I promised to take her
to see the lanterns.

187
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,420
Could someone cover my shift for me?

188
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,620
Few men are as thoughtful as you.

189
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,900
Okay, you can go.

190
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,110
Thank you, General Wushuang.

191
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,290
(Lantern Festival.)
