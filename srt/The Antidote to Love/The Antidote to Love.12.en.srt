2
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,170
Ms. Yun Yao.

3
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,100
You're awake.

4
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,360
My young master carried you back.

5
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
I have to say

6
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,820
you feel heavier

7
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,060
after a few days.

8
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,340
I'll go right after packing up.

9
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,840
I'll take my leave.

10
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,240
No need to trouble you.

11
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,060
Wait, why are you leaving?

12
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,180
I...

13
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,500
My fireplace broke. Can you check it?

14
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,280
How did it suddenly stop working?

15
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,900
Young Master,

16
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,140
wasn't the fireplace just replaced?

17
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,540
It's not broken.

18
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,420
Really?

19
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,880
Yesterday, it rained.

20
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,600
The roof kept leaking all night.

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,760
We need someone to fix it.

22
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,520
Or else when it rains, it'll pour in.

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,560
Young Master.

24
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,100
You don't even have to ask.

25
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,500
I had a mason fix it overnight.

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,560
You did a great job.

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,400
Actually, I meant

28
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,580
this window here.

29
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,760
Yes, that's right.

30
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,640
I was just talking about this window.

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,160
This side, that side, and over there.

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,260
They let the wind in.

33
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,620
With this weather,
the wind howls nonstop.

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,660
It's easy to catch a chill.

35
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,500
Young Master.

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,000
A draft-free house is too costly.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,740
We can't afford it.

38
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,540
Young Master, are you hungry?

39
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,100
Oh, right.

40
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,980
But I've still got other things to do.

41
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,160
There's really no time to cook.

42
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,520
Exactly, what should we do?

43
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,100
Well...

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
Thank you so much.

45
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,000
Then...

46
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,120
I'll go prepare the meal.

47
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,480
Thank you.

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,180
Thank you for sheltering me.

49
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,420
Young Master.

50
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,560
Do you think she noticed

51
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,380
you meant to let her stay?

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,000
Was my acting

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
really that unconvincing?

54
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,240
You were just too slow to react.

55
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:16,340
(Mourning)

56
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,440
He, I'm here.

57
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,400
I promised

58
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,560
to protect Yun Yao with you.

59
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,160
Your Highness,

60
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,460
please eat something.

61
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,880
Your Highness.

62
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,100
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

63
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
Your Highness, you...

64
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,420
Why are you all standing here?

65
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,220
Why aren't you training?

66
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,880
Even my orders are ignored now?

67
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,440
Train!

68
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,980
I'll train with you.

69
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,660
He, you must train well.

70
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,200
Don't worry. I'll keep you safe.

71
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,020
Ms. Yun Yao, it's time to eat.

72
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,780
Lately, the world is in chaos.

73
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,280
News keeps flooding in like waves.

74
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,720
It truly leaves me

75
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,340
struggling to keep up.

76
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,320
I can barely keep up too.

77
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,100
Look.

78
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,180
My attendant

79
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,920
is good at finding excuses to slack off.

80
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,380
Young Master.

81
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,310
At least wait till I'm gone

82
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,100
before speaking ill of me.

83
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,500
I have dignity, you know.

84
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,700
Why are you rambling on?

85
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,900
What did I even say about you?

86
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,980
Let me give you a hand.

87
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,760
Alright.

88
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,340
Two chickens.

89
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,540
Four rabbits.

90
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,800
Eighteen legs.

91
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,660
Two chickens?

92
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,700
Help me check this.

93
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,500
Has she figured it out yet?

94
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,680
Young Master, look.

95
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,460
She's counting on her fingers.

96
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,860
Stop looking. Continue.

97
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
Continue.

98
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,640
Come on, give me one more.

99
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,580
Here.

100
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,580
My sow hasn't been eating lately.

101
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,030
Even animals can't cheer her up.

102
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,840
Any way to help her?

103
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,560
The sow is quite moody
while having animals.

104
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,140
Did you see it? She smiled.

105
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,020
She did smile.

106
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,560
She smiled. She really smiled.

107
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,300
The chief of the Star Sect

108
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
is feeling down over animals?

109
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,960
It's truly hard to believe.

110
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,680
Go on, keep going.

111
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,060
This is our third meeting.

112
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,180
I know she has nowhere else to go.

113
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,000
She's always so proud.

114
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,900
I won't make her ask for help.

115
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,680
Aren't I thoughtful and charming?

116
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,800
Just now,

117
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,720
you tore this off for me?

118
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,540
Yes.

119
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,480
This is my diary!

120
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,510
I...

121
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,690
Young Master.

122
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,980
Stop running!

123
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,940
Your Highness,
we've searched everywhere.

124
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,640
We couldn't find the dagger

125
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,320
the Consort used to threaten Prince Qi.

126
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,360
It seems someone took it.

127
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,240
As for the North Army soldier who died,

128
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,820
he took his own life by poison.

129
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,380
It seems Zhe's death

130
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,000
was not so simple after all.

131
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,260
Wushuang,

132
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,100
there's something I can't figure out.

133
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,980
Her blood could bring me back
from death.

134
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,980
Why did it fail to save Zhe?

135
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,480
Your Highness, did you already suspect

136
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,020
Prince Qi wasn't killed by the Consort?

137
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,180
Let's go.

138
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,720
I know

139
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,600
you did those things

140
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,600
earlier today

141
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,500
to cheer me up,

142
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,160
but right now,

143
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,880
what I want most to know

144
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,720
is how Zhe died.

145
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,560
No need to rush.

146
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,740
Have some tea first.

147
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,220
Are you alright?

148
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,460
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,560
This sharp pain

150
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,160
feels so familiar.

151
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,970
Young Master,

152
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,460
this is what I found at the old yard
in Cao'ao Village.

153
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,310
Leave us for now.

154
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,180
Alright.

155
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,330
This is a silver needle from the Office.

156
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,640
Yun Yao.

157
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,500
Perhaps

158
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,000
the pain came from this silver needle.

159
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
Someone wanted to use you

160
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,140
to kill Zhao Zhe.
