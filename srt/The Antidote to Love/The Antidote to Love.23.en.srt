2
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,260
Wait.

3
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,340
He.

4
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,040
He.

5
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,080
Yun Yao.

6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,540
Zhao He.

7
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,560
Do you still remember this?

8
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,960
Next time you're in danger,
don't just run.

9
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,980
Learn to protect yourself
when you need to.

10
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,480
Alright.

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,200
I hope I won't need it.

12
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,650
This is my gift to you.

13
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,850
Today,

14
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,340
take one more step,

15
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,400
and you'll regret it.

16
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,980
Yun Yao.

17
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,500
Zhe is my brother.

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,460
I can't just watch him die.

19
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,300
He.

20
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,800
Go now or you'll lose your life.

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,040
Please, let him go.

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,960
If you must, take my life instead.

23
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,840
Spare my brother, please.

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,500
He.

25
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,620
He.

26
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,860
Leave now.

27
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,660
Just go. Leave me.

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,940
No!

29
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,760
He!

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,500
He.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,820
He, please. Go now.

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
You slave.

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,060
Do you know
what your clansmen looked like

34
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,420
when I was about to kill them?

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,500
They were pitiful.

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,420
Shut up.

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,040
So bleak, so helpless.

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,420
However,

39
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,060
I didn't even blink.

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,760
My blade fell without pause.

41
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,400
Then I killed them all.

42
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,360
Every last one of them.

43
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,300
Zhao Zhe.

44
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,040
None of the Moon Clan deserve to live.

45
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,480
You deserve that.

46
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,600
Your clan will never rise again.

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,280
Zhao Zhe!

48
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,320
Zhao Zhe!

49
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,220
Zhe.

50
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,540
- He.
- Zhe.

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,340
I have no regrets for giving everything

52
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,020
to the one I love most.

53
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,040
You always kept me safe before.

54
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,840
Now, it's finally my turn.

55
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,420
I'll go first.

56
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,940
Zhe.

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,960
Zhe...

58
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,280
Zhe.

59
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,000
Zhe...

60
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,220
Zhe.

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,240
Zhe...

62
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,340
Zhe.

63
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,560
Zhe, wake up.

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,400
Zhe...

65
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,020
Zhe.

66
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,840
Zhe...

67
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,280
Please, wake up.

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,520
Zhe.

69
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,680
Zhe...

70
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,400
Wake up, Zhe.

71
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,440
Zhe.

72
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,980
Zhe...

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,740
(Zhe,)

74
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,660
(I failed to keep you safe.)

75
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,180
(I failed to guide you well.)

76
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,620
(It's my fault.)

77
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,460
He, this wooden carving looks like you.

78
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,980
It's a gift from me.

79
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,360
Let it keep you company from now on.

80
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,600
It'll always be by your side
just like I do.

81
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,700
Alright?

82
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,650
Thank you.

83
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,430
Zhe.

84
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,500
I promise you.
From now on, I won't let you be bullied.

85
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,860
The blood of the foe has been shed.

86
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,420
May the Sacred Pool remain unharmed.

87
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,750
The spirits of the dead can now rest.

88
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,740
The nightmare that haunted
the world has gone.

89
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,260
Let the Sacred Pool bear witness.

90
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,540
Today,

91
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,460
as the Saintess of the Moon Clan,
I vow to the deceased:

92
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,420
I will honor our ancestors' will

93
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,940
and restore our homeland.

94
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,640
Our glory shall rise again.

95
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,160
Tell me.

96
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,400
How do you wish to punish me?

97
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,440
It pains me to see you suffer.

98
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,560
It hurts me to see you become

99
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,140
such a weird creature.

100
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,180
Yet it was you

101
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,080
who made me this way.

102
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,160
You're the one who locked me in.

103
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,780
You kept me from seeing him
one last time.

104
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,220
We were like sisters.

105
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,540
Aren't you too harsh on me?

106
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,280
I don't understand.

107
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,540
We survived together

108
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,520
and endured so many bitter days.

109
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,380
But what about him?

110
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,420
He was the one who took us
to the Office and tortured us.

111
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,560
Why did you help him?

112
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,620
I willingly did so.

113
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,500
From the moment I came near you
on the wedding day,

114
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,400
I was watching you for him.

115
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,840
I reported your every move to him.

116
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,720
I even made the silver needle

117
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,140
that made you kill Zhao Zhe.

118
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,980
Every time...

119
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,980
I managed to save him every time.

120
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,640
I managed to save him every time.

121
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,380
Why did I fail this time?

122
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,100
Why wasn't I there with him

123
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,620
when he died?

124
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,760
Yun Zhi.

125
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,020
Come to your senses.

126
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,780
He was the one who led the massacre
of the Moon Clan.

127
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,540
He took so many innocent lives.

128
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,620
He's not worth your sorrow.

129
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,780
He is worth it.

130
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,200
On the day of the massacre,

131
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,100
he killed my worst enemy

132
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,500
right in front of me.

133
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,120
He killed my father

134
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,160
who had been tormenting me.

135
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,850
What do you mean?

136
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,220
Stop right there.

137
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,500
You finally came back.

138
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,740
Where's the money?

139
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,100
I have no money.

140
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,340
No money?

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,300
Useless thing, you have no money?

142
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,580
Father, please stop gambling.

143
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,400
We have no money left.

144
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,060
Enough.

145
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,900
You jinx, are you blaming me
for gambling?

146
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,320
You're a jinx just like your mother.

147
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,360
Is that all you've got?

148
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,800
Listen, this won't cover it.

149
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,260
If I don't get the money for the debts
three days later,

150
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,340
I'll sell you to a brothel. Got it?

151
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,020
Get lost.

152
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,360
You good-for-nothing.

153
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,790
Three days are up. Where's my money?

154
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,780
Do you have a death wish?

155
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,800
Give me a few more days.
I'll find a way.

156
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,320
Right.

157
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,120
I still have a young daughter.

158
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,040
If I can't pay, you can have her.

159
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,580
I thank him.

160
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,020
I thank him for freeing me
from that cage.

161
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,960
Now you can see it.

162
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,160
You and I are not the same.

163
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,720
You were the revered Saintess
of the Moon Clan,

164
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,660
while I was the insect
being crushed underfoot,

165
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,540
living a miserable life.

166
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,780
Since I was a child,

167
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
I'd gotten used to it.

168
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,940
I'd been used to living
in darkness and torment,

169
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,960
so the Office

170
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,540
meant nothing to me at all.

171
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,480
Only Zhao Zhe

172
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,920
made me feel protected.

173
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,700
I'd even let him hurt me

174
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,640
and be his little rabbit.

175
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,720
Stop deceiving yourself.

176
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,940
This isn't love.

177
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
He doesn't love you at all.

178
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,660
He loves me,

179
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,020
and I love him too.

180
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,310
You simply don't understand.

181
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,160
- Yun Zhi.
- You don't understand.

182
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,060
Yun Zhi, listen to me.

183
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,460
Someone who truly loves you

184
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,040
would never cause you harm

185
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,500
or take advantage of you.

186
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,860
They'd never put your life in danger.

187
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,620
The one who pulled you from despair

188
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,180
was never him at all.

189
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,160
It was you.

190
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,700
