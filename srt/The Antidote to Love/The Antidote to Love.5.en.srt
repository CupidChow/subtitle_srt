Yun Zhi.

3
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,130
Yun Zhi.

4
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,320
You're still alive.

5
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
How did you end up here?

6
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,520
Prince Ning went to the Office
for your Life Deed

7
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,290
and took the chance to save me as well.

8
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,220
What?

9
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,420
(Life Deed)

10
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,560
Your Highness.

11
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,840
Here is Miss Yi Jiu's Life Deed
that you need.

12
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,960
We've prepared it.

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,700
What did you do to her?

14
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,620
Yi Jiu.

15
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,540
Is Yi Jiu still alive?

16
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,240
You know Yi Jiu?

17
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,140
Your Highness.

18
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,540
We lack ladies at the mansion.

19
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,980
Why not take her with us?

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,340
(Life Deed)

21
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,020
Yun Yao.

22
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,540
What has happened lately?

23
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,980
Why are you marrying Prince Ning?

24
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,660
Did he force you into this?

25
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,300
Yun Zhi.

26
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,340
To kill him myself,

27
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,620
I've waited five years.

28
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,020
That day I left the Office,

29
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,840
fate let me cross paths with him again.

30
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,020
And now,

31
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,340
it's finally the perfect moment.

32
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,740
What's this?

33
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,180
This is the antidote to Fatal Herb.

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,220
Take it,

35
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,900
and your vital energy will return.

36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,460
You'll be just like anyone else.

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,300
Yun Yao, are you okay?

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,580
(Zhao He,)

39
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,580
(you'll die tonight.)

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,840
you have to catch the slave soon.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,660
Otherwise, the consequences

47
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,610
won't just fall on the Office
that you've worked so hard for.

49
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,500
