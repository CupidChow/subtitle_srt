(Wanted Notice)
Have you heard this?

3
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,360
The God of War of Dawei fell
for a demoness.

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,440
He handed over his military power
and fled with her.

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,080
I heard the demoness's blood
carries the Gu poison.

6
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,280
Anyone who drinks it
obeys her every word.

7
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,600
The God of War must've been bewitched.

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,010
Demoness.

9
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,700
(Wanted Notice)

10
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,060
What took you so long?

11
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,080
Sorry for being late.

12
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,880
Didn't I tell you to watch that slave?

13
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Where is she now?

14
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,080
Where?

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
Are you alright?

16
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,700
Where is that slave now?

17
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,960
Yun Yao plans to take him
to the Moon Clan for sacrifice

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,060
to revive the Sacred Pool.

19
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,980
They've already set out.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,800
That slave wants to kill my brother?

21
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,120
No way.

22
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,520
She must die by my hand.

23
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
What is going on?

24
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,100
Something's wrong with your blood.

25
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,320
Prince Ning already knows who you are.

26
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,160
I won't let any harm come to you.

27
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,100
As for this matter,

28
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,980
let me handle it.

29
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,160
Alright.

30
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,540
I want your dear friend

31
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,260

It's a plague.

49
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,420
- Granny.
- Excuse me.

50
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,380
Granny.

51
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,680
May we please have some water?

52
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,020

Granny.

55
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,420
Seems the whole village is infected.

56
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,480
Granny.

57
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,220
Please, don't leave me.

58
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,940
She's been sick for a long time.

59
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,120
Granny, please don't leave me.

60
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,060
Granny.

61
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,300
Stay with me.

62
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,660
Don't be afraid.

63
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,340
She's infected too.

64
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,020
You're just like the Yun Yao

65
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,040
I remember from before.

66
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,900
She'd give everything to save lives.

67
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,500
I'm not as kind as you think.

68
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,420
I saved her,

69
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,440
but my heart is still bitter.

70
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,060
I hate myself for being so weak

71
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,960
that I can't even bear
to see Dawei people die.

72
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,800
Let's go.

73
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,840
It's the ptomaine.

74
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,560
Ptomaine?

75
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,340
The water is tainted.

76
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,120
Ordinary plagues

77
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,520
don't spread this fast.

78
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,920
Ptomaine...

79
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,030
Someone put powder made
from the bodies

80
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,000
of the infected in the water.

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,680
It not only spreads faster,

82
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,440
but in severe cases,

83
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,800
it may cause mutation.

84
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,340
Granny, Granny.

85
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,220
Don't be scared.

86
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,160
Granny.

87
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,360
Good girl.

88
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,820
Your granny will be back soon.

89
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,460
Where did she go?

90
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,480
She...

91
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,560
She's watching over you.

92
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,480
Back where we're from,

93
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,000
there's an old legend.

94
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,080
It says when loved ones pass,

95
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,080
they turn

96
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,160
into a beautiful bubble,

97
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,020
drifting and floating

98
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,660
up above the Sacred Pool.

99
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,160
Then they'll become a shining star,

100
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,720
choose the brightest wish among ours,

101
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,890
and try their best to make it real.

102
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,860
Really?

103
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,760
Has Granny become a star too?

104
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,300
Can she hear my wishes?

105
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,600
Of course.

106
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,140
Maybe Granny

107
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,660
is now the brightest star above.

108
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,300
She's listening closely to your wish

109
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,210
and getting ready to grant it.

110
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,580
Then I hope Granny returns soon.

111
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,700
May our villagers never be apart again.

112
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,620
Let us always stay together.

113
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,840
Good girl.

114
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,980
Lie down and get some rest.

115
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,240
Granny has been laid to rest.

116
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,780
Back then,

117
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,140
I was just like her.

118
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,820
I saw my loved ones pass away.

119
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,860
I must help her wish come true.

120
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
Someone caused this plague.

121
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,020
Something will happen soon.

122
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,840
So,

123
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,060
we must act at once.

124
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,700
Here's the plan.

125
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,160
You follow the well

126
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,660
and find where the water begins.

127
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,080
I'll check the bodies in the village

128
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,540
to see if there's another way.

129
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,740
It's much too risky alone.

130
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,700
Time is running out.

131
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,740
We can't let more people suffer.

132
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,180
Wait a moment.

133
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,320
Wan.

134
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,390
Please let me borrow this.

135
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,560
Take this whistle.

136
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,060
If danger comes, blow it.

137
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,400
I'll come right away.

138
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,280
Alright.

139
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,350
What are you doing?

140
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
Are you trying to hide the evidence?

141
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
So many died in a single night.

142
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,380
You must be behind it.

143
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,380
I know her face.

144
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,800
She's the demoness from the notice.

145
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,460
Let's kill her. Kill her.

146
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,060
- Kill her.
- Kill her.

147
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,940
Fine.

148
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,380
But even if you kill me,

149
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,020
the plague won't be stopped.

150
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,380
No more talk.

151
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,540
Seize her now.

152
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,820
- Catch her.
- Catch her.
