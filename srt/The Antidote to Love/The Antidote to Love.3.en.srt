The white snow.

00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,120
The moon shines

4
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,020
on the white snow.

5
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,940
What's the next line?

6
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,620
Lanterns bloom like silver trees.

7
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,320
Nicely done.

8
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,820
Why are you here?

9
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,640
Stop disturbing my lantern writing.

10
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,120
Lantern?

11
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,310
Tomorrow is the Lantern Festival,

12
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,880
the grandest festival here.

13
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,900
He takes me every year.

14
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,250
This is what a lantern looks like.

15
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,520
I've been at the Office so long

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,420
that I've never celebrated the festival.

17
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,920
You've missed out on a lot.

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,920
On the Lantern Festival,

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,200
everyone in the city
goes out to see lanterns,

20
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,280
and the streets
are filled with all kinds.

21
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,660
Telling you won't change a thing.

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,020
You won't be coming anyway.

23
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,560
The Lantern Festival.

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
Your Highness.

25
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,460
It's time to see His Majesty.

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,880
Let's go.

27
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,430
Father.

28
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,790
These are the proof
of the officials' crimes.

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,600
Is this the answer you give me?

30
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,260
Father.

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,760
The slave Yi Jiu deserves punishment.

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,340
But the ones she killed

33
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,740
were truly wicked men.

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,340
Wicked?

35
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,620
That slave

36
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,220
killed so many court officials.

37
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,260
It's up to me to decide her fate.

38
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,420
Your Majesty, those medicine slaves

39
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,620
have all been executed.

40
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,180
He.

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,800
Let me tell you this:

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,600
These people

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,380
are the lowest medicinal slaves
in Dawei.

44
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,790
The one you're protecting
is no different.

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,600
If I want her gone,

46
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,980
she must die.

47
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,800
Father, please calm your anger.

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,290
Two days.

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,260
Father, grant me two days.

50
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,020
I promise to give you a proper answer.

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,040
Two days.

52
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,820
You have only two days.

53
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,320
(Seems I'll need)

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,680
(another plan to kill him.)

55
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,460
Li, His Highness will return soon.

56
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,720
Is his soup ready yet?

57
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,260
Almost done. It's coming right up.

58
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,300
Don't worry.

59
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,060
(Zhao He.)

60
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,880
(This drop of toxic blood
is enough to kill you.)

61
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,940
Your Highness.

62
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,780
His Majesty...

63
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,620
Fire! Fire!

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,360
Come! A girl's inside!

65
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,520
Save her!

66
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,520
Fire! Help!

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,180
- What's wrong?
- A girl's inside! Hurry!

68
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,120
Put out the fire!

69
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,440
- Put out the fire!
- Move!

70
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,840
- Fetch water!
- Put out the fire!

71
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,280

73
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,410
- Yi Jiu.
- Your Highness.

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,280
You can't go in.

75

76
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,750

If you care, just show it.

116
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,920
Why make things so complex?

117
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,220
Such a pretender.

118
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,080
Your Highness,
the festival draws many this year.

119
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,480
We've sent more guards to patrol.

120
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,120
Make sure to keep the people safe.

121
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,720
Yes.

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,880
You're dressed so brightly today.

127
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,440
It's not for you.

128
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,320
You're still a young lady.

129
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,820
Yet you're always in armor and helmet.

Where are we going?

135
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,420
To see the lanterns.

136
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,800
