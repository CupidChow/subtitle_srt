2
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,140
On the 15th day of the 4th month,
Year of Ding Mao,

3
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,460
I woke up from a dream.

4
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,200
Gazing up at the bright moon,

5
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,300
I seemed to hear
an old friend's whisper,

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,980
yet the words slipped through my grasp.

7
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,300
How frustrating.

8
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,500
On the 8th day of the 10th month,
Year of Jia Wei, I walked the streets.

9
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,550
In the bustling crowd,

10
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,980
a sense of déjà vu struck me,

11
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,670
yet old memories stayed out of reach.

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,700
I couldn't help but feel sad.

13
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,740
You wrote down

14
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,160
everything?

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,200
Whenever something comes to mind,

16
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,460
I make sure to write it down.

17
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,520
Yun Yao.

18
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,300
Give me a little more time.

19
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,080
I promise to find the truth for you.

20
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,960
I've heard

21
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,170
he's told you everything.

22
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,120
This comb here

23
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,540
seems unfamiliar to me.

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,990
It seems to be bought
at the Lantern Festival.

25
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,830
Your Highness.

26
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,780
These are the daily things
you asked me to get for Miss Yi Jiu.

27
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,180
Everything has been bought.

28
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,910
I believe

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,440
she can help me regain my memories.

30
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,440
There were so many doubts
about the past.

31
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,270
I've investigated
as you ordered for so long

32
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,770
but still found nothing useful.

33
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,320
I thought I'd know the truth

34
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,480
if I regained my memory.

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,520
If it wasn't me
who destroyed the Moon Clan,

36
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,100
then who could it be?

37
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,700
If we never find a clue,

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,680
there will always be a rift
between you and the Consort.

39
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,340
Keeping her close by your side

40
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,160
might bring...

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,700
No matter what plot lies behind this,

42
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,240
I must uncover the truth

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,300
for Yun Yao

44
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,840
and the Moon Clan.

45
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,700
General Wushuang, what's this for?

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,800
His Highness has not slept all night
in the study.

47
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,220
So, I brought him some food.

48
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,820
(Gathering herbs in the hills;
stones pile high, vines winding long)

49
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,740
Set the food over there.

50
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,520
Yun Yao.

51
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,700
Didn't you say you'd give me an answer?

52
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,300
Can you tell me

53
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,230
what truly happened that year

54
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,250
when I went to the Moon Clan?

55
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,540
On the 5th day of the 8th month,
Year of Fenggu,

56
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,180
I received your letter.

57
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,320
In it, you said

58
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,200
your father agreed to our union,

59
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,460
and you'd come to marry me.

60
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,020
In truth,

61
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,120
Father first refused our marriage.

62
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,240
That girl has bewitched you.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,800
I sent you to investigate the Moon Clan

64
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,110
not to be swept up in romance.

65
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,960
When I was wounded,

66
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,580
it was the Saintess of the Moon Clan

67
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,000
who saved me with her blood.

68
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,520
So what?

69
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,140
They've practiced sorcery for years

70
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,420
to beguile and deceive the minds.

71
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,660
That's not true.

72
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,600
The Moon Clan is honest and kind,

73
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,140
not at all as the rumors claim.

74
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,020
Enough.

75
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,440
But three days later,

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,560
Father suddenly decreed

77
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,020
to approve our marriage.

78
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,300
On the wedding day,

79
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,680
I did wear my armor,

80
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,800
led the North Army,

81
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,450
and left for the Moon Clan to marry you,

82
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,680
but we were ambushed on the road.

83
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,780
I remember nothing else

84
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,000
after that.

85
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,820
That day, I saw

86
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,380
that you destroyed my clan in armor.

87
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,680
If that wasn't you,

88
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,190
who could it be?

89
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,780
That's what I've been trying
to find out.

90
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,520
All these years,

91
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,820
I've searched for survivors
of the North Army,

92
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,940
but there's no news so far.

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,960
Yun Yao,

94
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,340
do you believe me?

95
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,780
I've seen the bamboo scrolls
in this room

96
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,980
and the writings on them.

97
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,940
I've heard your scattered memories.

98
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,640
Every word

99
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,980
leads back to my clan.

100
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,610
I'd rather believe the truth

101
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,860
than believe you.

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,440
Don't worry.

103
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,860
The truth

104
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,820
will come to light soon enough.

105
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,700
If I truly have erred,

106
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,780
you can punish me however you want.

107
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,460
Yun Yao.

108
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,900
Yun Yao.

109
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,140
This is from General Wushuang.

110
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,300
It will rain heavily tonight.

111
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,870
Warm yourself by the fire.

112
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,450
Got it.

113
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,820
Thank you.

114
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,580
Yun Yao.

115
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,560
The floor is cold.

116
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,540
Go rest on the bed.

117
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,960
(Prince Ning's Mansion)

118
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,840
There have been many thefts
in the city lately.

119
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,300
Tell the men to stay alert.

120
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,560
Strengthen the patrols.

121
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,040
Yes, General Wushuang.

122
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,560
Wushuang.

123
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,480
Your Highness.

124
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,260
I haven't seen Zhe lately.

125
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,100
Where is he?

126
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,770
His Highness...

127
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,120
He hasn't appeared for days.

128
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,360
I heard you haven't been eating well.

129
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,780
What's going on?

130
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,500
You're too old

131
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,540
to have me feed you now.

132
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,620
He,

133
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,260
why did you bring back
the woman who hurt you?

134
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,020
She's from another clan.

135
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,140
Many things

136
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,380
aren't as simple as you think.

137
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,380
She's my wife now.

138
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,900
I have my reasons

139
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
for doing this.

140
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,220
What reasons?

141
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,420
She is tied to my memories.

142
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,780
He,

143
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,940
did something come back to you?

144
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,600
Not yet.

145
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,460
Since you

146
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,340
can't let her go,

147
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,180
I'll treat her as my sister-in-law.

148
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,100
But if she tries to hurt you again,

149
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,900
I won't let her off.

150
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,060
Alright, alright.

151
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,340
I understand.

152
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,280
Remember to drink your congee.

153
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,380
(Office of Divination)

154
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,980
I beg you.

155
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,320
Please, let me go.

156
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,340
I'm begging you.

157
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,420
Beg me?

158
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,740
If you wish to beg someone,

159
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,580
beg your dear friend.

160
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,540
She's now risen to glory.

161
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,660
This medicine

162
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,780
can only be made using you all.

163
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,460
Milord.

164
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,860
Milord.

165
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,700
Seems we must try something stronger.
