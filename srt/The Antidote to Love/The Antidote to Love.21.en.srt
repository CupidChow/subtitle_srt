00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,460
Alright.

3
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,740
We're safe here for now.

4
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,260
I'll leave these ladies to you.

5
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,410
Make sure they reach
the Moon Clan safely

6
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,590
and meet up with Ms. Yun Yao.

7
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,540
Don't worry.

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,100
Aren't you coming with us?

9
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,660
I still have matters to handle.

10
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,900
Farewell.

11
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,100
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,420
Is it okay that we leave

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,060
without saying goodbye?

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,320
If we say goodbye,

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,320
it'll be even harder to part.

16
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,100
Mr. Liu drew me a map last night.

17
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,660
Let me take a look.

18
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,440
They truly are kind.

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,940
We should visit them again someday.

heavy snow fell in Dawei.

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,040
I took Zhe with me

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,140
and slipped out of the imperial palace.

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,220
We ran off to build snowmen
and have snowball fights.

45
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,140
That day, we ended up soaked
from head to toe.

46
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,920
When we returned,
Mother scolded us badly.

47
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,120
She even made us kneel as punishment.

48
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,880

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,000

77
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,120
We're back.

78
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,440
It's good you're back.

79
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm glad you're back.

80
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,260
It was him.

81
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,360
Yes, he wiped out our clan back then.

83
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,060

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,080

to honor the lost souls of the Moon Clan

87
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,180

93
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,580
it kept me going.

94
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,940
Now, I return it to you.

95
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,100
Come on.

96
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,900

99
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,260
It has Softening Powder in it.

100
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,940
Why?

101
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,620
I'm waiting for someone.

102
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,760
Who are you waiting for?

103
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,100
Your younger brother.

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,540
Zhao He.

105
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,820
All along this journey,

106
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,420
it must have been hard lying to me.

107
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,300
Actually, I knew long ago

108
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,900
that Zhao Zhe is the Chief Diviner.

109
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,020
He is the true foe of the Moon Clan.

110
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,020
No.

111
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,700
It was me.

112
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,060
It was me.

113
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,820
From that very day,

114
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,740
I knew in my heart

115
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,880
that you'd been deceiving me all along.

116
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,500
Oh, right.

117
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,060
On the back of his neck,

118
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,340
there is a bean-sized brown birthmark.

119
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,940
It was me.

120
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,900
I led the attack on the Moon Clan
on the wedding day.

121
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,500
I told you before:

122
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,700
Your life belongs to me.

123
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,020
I want you to live
and reach the Moon Clan.

124
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,060
So, you acted with me all the way

125
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,140
just to lure Zhe here.

126
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,380
That's right.

127
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,300
I've given you many chances,

128
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,740
but you never spoke up.

129
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,100
