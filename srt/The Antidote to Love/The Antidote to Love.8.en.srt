2
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,430
(Could there be any news of him here?)

3
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,000
The young master of the Sword Sect
hired killers

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,040
but ended up slain himself.

5
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,140
He left behind over 380 foes.

6
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,860
They hope to find the killer
in seven days.

7
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,140
He deserved it.

8
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,840
Pan Wei, the richest in Dawei,
vanished mysteriously.

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,360
His family's vault was robbed.

10
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,700
There are three suspects,

11
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,060
and they're his three wives.

12
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,580
His second wife is the most suspicious.

13
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,580
Find the proof of her affair
with the pawnshop owner in three days.

14
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,900
How absurd.

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,320
What are you doing?

16
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,080
Helping you sort the news.

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,020
Come on.

18
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,830
Do you know the news

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,890
is more valuable than gold

20
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,960
to the Star Sect?

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,240
If word gets out about this,

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,400
your life could be in danger.

23
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,740
I don't really care

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,280
about the consequences.

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,220
Young Master, a guest is here.

26
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,060
The news you want is here.

27
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,020
You're still alive.

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,140
Do you know the crime
of hiding the Consort?

29
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,520
She has her own legs to walk on,

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
yet you blame me?

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
If I hadn't tipped you off,

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
would you know she's here?

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,600
Come back with me.

34
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,960
Why should I?

35
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,580
Your Highness,

36
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,800
the city is in turmoil,

37
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,820
and danger is everywhere.

38
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,800
Your life could be at risk
at any moment.

39
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,920
Only His Highness can protect you.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,080
Don't you want to kill me?

41
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,000
Only by staying near me

42
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,380
will you have a chance.

43
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,190
How cruel this is.

44
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,280

Have you remembered everything?

84
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,640
I remember our lives

85
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,060
among the Moon Clan five years ago.

86
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,660
You told me your name was Yun Yao.

87
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,500
You sheltered me,
despite your people's doubts.

88
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,630
You even saved me with your blood.

89
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,760
You dressed me in your unique clothing

90
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,960
and took me to celebrate
the Shangsi Festival.

91
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,060
Under the holy tree of the Moon Clan,

92
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,320
we made so many promises.

93
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,400
I even promised you

94
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,180
that I'd return to marry you.

95
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,020
That's enough.

96
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,660
I don't want to hear anymore.

97
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,780
Why did you

98
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,440
destroy my entire clan?

99
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,920
I wish I knew why myself.

100
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,940
We once loved each other so deeply.

101
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,040
Your people treated me like kin.

102
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,400
How could I ever harm them?

103
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,920
You're still lying to me.

104
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,340
No.

105
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,060
The Moon Clan

106
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,520
lived hidden in the valley

107
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,200
and never meddled with the world.

108
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,940
However,

109
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,640
one night changed everything.

110
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
All the men, children,

111
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,450
and elders were slain.

112
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,280
The women were seized
and sent to the Office

113
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,220
and forced to become the lowest slaves.

114
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,840
They suffered day after day.

115
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,780
It's been five years.

116
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,220
I've been repenting for it every day.

117
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,960
Guilt never leaves me.

118
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,600
It was me.

119
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,780
I was the one who brought you back.

120
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,080
It happened because of me.

121
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,560
It was I who brought ruin
to the Moon Clan.

122
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,760
Why did you lie to me?

123
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,280
Why? Why did you deceive me?

124
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,060
Why? Why?

125
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,800
- Why lie to me?
- I'm sorry.

126
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,640
Why? Why did you lie to me?

127
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,500
Why?

128
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,380
Why? Why?

129
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,320
Why?

130
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,260
- Tell me. Why?
- Yun Yao.

131
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,760
Yun Yao.

132
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,630
Tell me why.

133
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,490
Why?

134
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,370
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm sorry, Yun Yao.

136
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,640
I've let you down.

137
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,780
Tell me why.

138
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,940
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,160
I've failed you.

140
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,310
I've failed the Moon Clan.

141
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,880
I just recalled what happened
five years ago.

142
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,300
But I can't remember

143
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,420
why the Moon Clan was wiped out.

144
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,540
You can't remember?

145
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,010
Your Highnesses.

146
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,760
We've finally found you two.

147
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,580
Let me show you something.

148
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,240
Don't follow us.

149
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,380
(As the clouds drift gracefully beneath)

150
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,660
(The day is as dark as the night)

151
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,140
(The deer calls in joy,
grazing on wild mugwort)

152
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,900
These are the findings
from my years of searching.

153
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,160
Every record tied
to the Moon Clan is here.

154
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,280
But there's no record of me
leading the massacre.

155
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,000
After that incident,

156
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,800
the North Army fell apart.

157
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,270
Those who attacked the Moon Clan

158
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,800
all vanished without a trace

159
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,840
or news.

160
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,940
Yun Yao.

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,160
