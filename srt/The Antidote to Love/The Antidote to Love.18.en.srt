Here.

20
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,060
Luckily,

21
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,460
the fever's gone.

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,640
You've been staying with me?

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,620
Are you hurt?

24
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,980
It's raining

25
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,820
outside.

26
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,800
I'd like to get some fresh air.

27
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,580
Come on, be careful.

28
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,460
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings.

29
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,300
Hello, everyone.

30
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,640
This way.

31
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,480
Your Highness,
we're heading out to buy groceries.

32
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,720
Do visit our home when you can.

33
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,620
Sure.

34
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,820
Watch your step.

35
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,340
Here, take it slow.

36
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Everyone,

37
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,360
Prince Ning and the Consort

38
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,680
have answered harm with kindness

39
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,880
and saved all of us.

40
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,820
By our local custom,

41
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,980
if a couple ties the knot,

42
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,380
shares a bridal chamber here,

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,660
and has a cup of harvest wine,

44
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,800
they'll receive the blessings
of the Harvest Goddess

45
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,700
and soon have a child.

46
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,020
What do you all think?

47
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,980
That'll be great.

48
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,580
All right, then.

49
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,280
You go set up the room.

50
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,540
You go prepare the meal.

51
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,700
Let's all get moving.

52
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,100
- Sure.
- Let's go.

53
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,500
Here comes a wedding.

54
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,140
(Happiness)

55
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,580
This is our third wedding.

56
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
Come on.

57
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,280
Let's drink together.

58
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,260
The first time

59
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,680
happened when the Moon Clan
was slaughtered,

60
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,740
blood flowing everywhere.

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,260
The second time

62
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,400
happened at your mansion.

63
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,520
I stabbed you there.

64
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,080
But do you know?

65
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,880
Right at that moment,

66
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,720
I actually hesitated a little.

67
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,500
But now, this time,

68
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,560
there's no hatred left.

69
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,640
There are only you,

70
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,380
me,

71
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,100
and peace.

72
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,980
How did the task go?

73
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,880
Prince Ning saved her.

75
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,480
You're useless in success

76
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,840
but quick to ruin things.

77
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,560
What a disappointment.

78
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,100
Go ahead and kill me.

79
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,180
Do you think I won't dare?

80
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,000
You're infected too?

81
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,840
Zhao Zhe.

82
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,780
Zhao Zhe.

83
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,580
Zhao Zhe.

84
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,340
Zhao Zhe.

85
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,520
Zhao Zhe.

86
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,660
Come here.

87
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,340
I...

88
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,560
I'm sorry.

89
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,900
