2
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,200
(Yun Yao.)

3
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,660
(I'll turn your clansmen into puppets)

4
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,820
(and have them die with you.)

5
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,420
He.

6
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,220
He.

7
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,900
Are you all right?

8
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,360
You lowly slave.

9
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,660
Release my brother at once.

10
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,220
I'm the one you want.

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,500
- Zhe.
- Indeed.

12
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,480
All of this

13
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,700
was part of my plan.

14
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,880
Such a cunning woman.

15
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,800
Look.

16
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,660
You ignored my warnings

17
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,640
and risked everything to shield her,

18
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,280
yet now she traps us both here.

19
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,220
I should've killed you long ago.

20
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,880
Enough.

21
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,260
Yun Yao, he's just a child.

22
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,860
He made a mistake.

23
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,180
He, don't beg her.

24
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,640
Stop talking.

25
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,220
Yun Yao.

26
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,980
Zhe is too young to know this.

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,300
Let me take his place.

28
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,500
Let me die instead of him.

29
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,920
Let me take his place, please.

30
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,280
I beg you. Please let him go.

31
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,200
Yun Yao.

32
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,040
Yun Yao.

33
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,920
Stop your brotherly show now.

34
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,980
Kneel by the Sacred Pool

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,640
to repent before the lost souls
of the Moon Clan.

36
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,820
Guards.

37
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,780
Take him away.

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,480
Yun Yao.

39
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,570
Yun Yao.

40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,520
He.

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,360
How is he now?

42
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,580
I've placed him under house arrest.

43
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,500
Not bad for him.

44
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,640
Once he wakes up,

45
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,960
the ceremony will be over.

46
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,700
By the way,

47
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,140
how are the women who were controlled?

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,620
They're still unconscious.

49
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,780
But don't worry.

50
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,680
They'll wake up by tomorrow.

51
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,320
Thank you.

52
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,040
Thank you for saving them.

53
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,300
It was thanks to Ms. Yun Zhi's help.

54
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,700
However,

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,720
I feel something's off with Yun Zhi.

56
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,980
Zhao Zhe.

57
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,660
You're here.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,040
Are you all right?

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
Untie me at once.

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,520
I must kill that slave.

61
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,780
It's the Millennium Iron.
I can't untie you.

62
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,320
But don't worry.

63
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,980
I'll find a way to save you tomorrow.

64
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,100
Yun Zhi.

65
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,620
Why do you do so much

66
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,580
for me?

67
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,240
Who let you touch my rabbit?

68
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,220
Get lost.

69
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,020
(That was the first time)

70
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,160
(I saw a different side of you.)

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,840
Move.

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,060
What are you doing?

73
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,700
How dare you fight back?

74
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,780
Let go of me. Let me go.

75
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,360
No.

76
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,820
Don't you dare touch her.

77
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,620
(From that moment on,)

78
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
(in that sunless place,)

79
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,260
(it was as if hope had returned)

80
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,100
(just before darkness could swallow me.)

81
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,260
(I tell myself)

82
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,340
(that I'd do anything for you.)

83
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,920
Milord, she's here.

84
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,500
Will you become my spy?

85
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,620
Yes.

86
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,860
Then go to Prince Ning's Mansion

87
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,500
and keep an eye on her.

88
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,860
You and I are like the shadows
beneath this tree,

89
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,280
bound by the trials of this world.

90
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,300
All I wish for you

91
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,380
is to have someone to lean on

92
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,540
and someone to walk beside you.

93
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,550
Divine spirits above,

94
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,200
please accept my sacrifice

95
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,500
and hear our plea.

96
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,720
May your light always grace
the Moon Clan.

97
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,100
May your blessings last
through the ages.

98
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,700
We seek your shelter and guidance.

99
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,060
Please grant us wisdom and strength

100
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,100
to protect our homeland

101
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,620
and let the Moon Clan thrive under you

102
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,140
for endless ages

103
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,200
with flourishing fortune.

104
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,560
Zhao Zhe.

105
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,940
Zhao Zhe.

106
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,040
Is anyone here? Open the door.

107
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,020
Is anyone here?

108
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,820
Please open the door.

109
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,200
Moon Deity, bless us.

110
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,700
I am Yun Yao

111
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,460
who defied the divine oracle

112
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,900
and caused great disaster.

113
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,520
The Sacred Pool ran dry,

114
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,460
and our people lost their lives.

115
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,640
Today,

116
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,780
with your blessing,

117
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,380
the foe shall be brought down

118
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,740
and the blood of their hearts
will be taken

119
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,900
to honor the Sacred Pool

120
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,040
and the lost souls of the Moon Clan.

121
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,560
The auspicious hour has come.

122
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,640
Zhao Zhe!

123
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
