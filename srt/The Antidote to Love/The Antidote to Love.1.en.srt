2
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,460
(Prince Ning's Mansion)

3
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,320
By His Majesty's decree,

4
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,960
as Prince Ning has passed too soon,

5
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,080
(Prince Ning, Zhao He)
and loneliness awaits in the underworld,

6
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,340
this medicinal slave shall be sealed

7
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,340
in the coffin with the Prince

8
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,220
to comfort the God of War's soul.

9
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,620
(Yi Jiu, medicinal slave)
They chose me for the burial?

10
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,300
(A day earlier, Office of Divination)

11
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,900
Hatred runs deep, buried for ages.

12
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,940
One elixir is a pool of withered bones.

13
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,980
(Chief Diviner)

14
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,920
Push them in.

15
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,920
Bring in the next group.

16
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,320
Many medicinal slaves have died.

17
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,840
(Li Zhong)
These slaves' blood cures all poisons.

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,730
It's priceless outside.

19
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,100
Are you questioning me?

20
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
It's you.

21
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,200
She will do.

22
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,500
Send her to Prince Ning.

23
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,680
Mr. Li,

24
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,920
can this slave's blood

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,240
(Prince Qi, Zhao Zhe)
keep my brother's body from decay?

26
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,720
Absolutely.

27
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,340
From the pool of Withered Bones,

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,360
only she crawled out.

29
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,060
(No.)

30
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
(I cannot die.)

31
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,000
The auspicious hour has come.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
Seal the coffin.

33
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,380
He,

34
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,060
you fell for Dawei on the battlefield;

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,180
your deeds shine bright.

36
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,280
They shall be remembered for all time.

37
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,340
The God of War of Dawei

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,240
will endure forever.

39
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,400
(Now that I survived Withered Bones,)

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,960
(my blood can revive the dead
and heal flesh.)

41
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,000
(Only if you come back to life)

42
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,480
(will I have a chance to live.)

43
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,200
(Wake up now.)

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,440
(Please, wake up.)

45
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,940
(Shen Wushuang, aide)
Your Highness.

46
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,040
Who are you?

47
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,580
(It's him.)

48
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,940
Zhao He!

49
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,420
(Zhao He doesn't know me now.)

50
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
He.

51
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
He!

52
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,700
(Prince Ning's Mansion)

53
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,160
He.

54
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,600
At last, you're awake.

55
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,680
Prince Ning, fortune favors you.

56
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,920
You came back to life.

57
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,280
Zhe.

58
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,300
Where is she?

59
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,420
Who do you mean?

60
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,880
The one who saved me.

61
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,640
She?

62
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,220
The Office of Divination took her back.

63
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,420
Today is their Eternity Feast.

64
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,580
Eternity Feast?

65
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,720
It's said the Office hosts

66
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,180
this grandest feast for the nobles.

67
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,480
On this day,
they bathe with sacred water

68
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,060
and soak their hands in the morning dew
from Mount Snow.

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,160
Fresh blood is poured
into the golden goblet

70
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,640
and served to honored guests.

71
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,940
Their medicinal slave's blood
can neutralize poisons

72
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,990
and is said to grant a longer life.

73
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,140
(Minister Wang)

74
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,960
Those who drink it

75
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,880
feel light as a swallow
and stay youthful.

76
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,140
That's why this banquet

77
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,920
is called the Eternity Feast.

78
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,640
Minister Wang,

79
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,320
how does it taste?

80
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,840
Let me tell you.

81
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,340
The most potent effect

82
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,490
comes from the blood of her heart.

83
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,140
Then I'll take her heart blood now.

84
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,180
You should've arrived long ago.

85
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,240
I heard that five years ago,
the Moon Clan was wiped out,

86
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,420
and you were wounded
and lost your memory.

87
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,470
This medicinal slave's blood

88
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,060
may help you regain your memory.

89
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,180
Your Highness,

90
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,820
please drink the medicinal slave's blood

91
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,420
right after it's drawn.

92
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,020
It's most nourishing now.

93
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,090
Your Highness,

94
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,140
please.

95
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,760
Zhao He,

96
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,500
what do you intend to do?

97
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,120
My North Army braves the cold
at the borders,

98
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,240
risking our lives in battle,

99
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,500
while you parasites

100
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,680
indulge in this debauched feast,
lost in pleasure.
