2
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,760
Here, have another sip.

3
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,120
If my wound never heals,

4
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,210
will you have to look after me forever?

5
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,840
Keep dreaming, Liu Chunsheng.

6
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,060
Once you're well, we'll settle this.

7
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,540
Drink your medicine.

8
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,320
I asked Mrs. Liu for some new remedies.

9
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,840
I've been feeling much better lately.

10
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,900
Thank you for testing
all these remedies with me.

11
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,760
When you're well,
I won't have to tend to you.

12
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,300
Oh, right.

13
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,540
This is for you.

14
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,900
For me?

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,120
What is it?

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,180
It's a crossbow.

17
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,200
It may be small, but it's powerful.

18
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,000
Next time you're in danger,
don't just run.

19
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,840
Learn to protect yourself
when you need to.

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,000
Alright.

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,600
I hope

22
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,220
I won't need it.

23
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,520
Let's exchange this for money tomorrow

24
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,020
for Mr. Liu to heal.

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,280
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

26
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,400
I'm here to tend your wound.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,360
I'll come back later.

28
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,920
It's all right.

29
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,860
Zhao Zhe.

30
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,600
Zhao Zhe.

31
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,880
Useless fool.

32
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,480
Aren't you already healed?

33
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,650
Why are you still here?

34
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,140
This Cold Palace

35
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,420
looks even more run-down now.

36
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,450
My brother left too.

37
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,040
Everything has changed.

38
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,360
This Cold Palace

39
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,200
is where my brother and I grew up.

40
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,420
We spent countless long days here.

41
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
But now,

42
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,420
he left without a second thought
with that slave.

43
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,620
His heart belongs to her alone.

44
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,310
I know.

45
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,250
I know he let you down.

46
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,040
I can give you

47
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,860
whatever he could give you.

48
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,650
I'll do anything for you.

49
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,800
Very well.

50
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,940
Then let's begin.

51
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,500
Didn't you say you'd seen Jiang Lingyun?

52
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,260
Before leaving,
Ms. Yun Yao gave me a task.

53
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,800
(Rescue the Moon Clan girls)

54
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,840
I need your help.

55
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,580
I'll go right now.

56
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,580
(Office of Divination)

57
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,160
My stomach aches.

58
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,570
I need to use the outhouse.

59
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,640
Stop. Where are you going?

60
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,540
I'm just going to the outhouse.

61
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,900
I can't hold it anymore.

62
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,740
Go on.

63
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,600
Hey, shift change.

64
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,560
Alright.

65
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,340
Sir, what's wrong?

66
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,000
It's me.

67
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,800
What took you so long?

68
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,740
No more talking.

69
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,000
Did you get it?

70
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,340
Hurry up and go.

71
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,300
Hurry.

72
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,320
- Be careful; keep up.
- Hurry.

73
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,280
Be careful.

74
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,980
Go, go, go.

75
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,820
Go.

76
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,900
Everyone, stay sharp.

77
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,140
Play it by ear.

78
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,140
Stop.

79
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,000
Where are your travel permits?

80
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,940
Sir, our travel permits.

81
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,420
Why are all of you women here?

82
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,740
To be frank,

83
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,900
these ladies are all my concubines.

84
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,800
All your concubines?

85
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,860
That's quite a number.

86
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,020
Well, I'm rather handsome.

87
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,540
Can't you see that?

88
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,060
Tch, I've never seen anyone
so shameless.

89
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,260
Mind your words.

90
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,820
Greetings, General.

91
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,060
What's the matter?

92
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,480
General,

93
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,560
I noticed so many women here.

94
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,080
It seems suspicious.

95
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,940
What's there to suspect?

96
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,340
Isn't it common to have many concubines?

97
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,060
That's true.

98
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,680
Go then.

99
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,080
Miss Wushuang,
you're truly kind and lovely.

100
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,160
