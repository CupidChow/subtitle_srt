=The Antidote to Love=
=Episode 19=

2
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,840
Why didn't you use the antidote?

3
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,340
The antidote...

4
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,260
The antidote was lost.

5
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,480
You must stay alive.

6
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,160
As long as that slave lives,

7
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,280
you'll have to keep
a close watch on her.

8
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,860
Your Highness.

9
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,460
Your eyes...

10
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,780
I'm fine.

11
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,320
Don't worry.

12
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
There is a herb

13
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,960
on the Moon Clan border for eyes.

14
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,500
I'll make sure he recovers.

15
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,160
Wushuang.

16
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,840
Take care on this journey.

17
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,320
The North Army

18
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,520
can't be without you.

19
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,460
Though I don't know your task,

20
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,420
the North Army will await your return.

21
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,800
General Wushuang.

22
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,800
What are you waiting for?

23
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
Wan.

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
Keep your wrist nimble.

25
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,700
Like this.

26
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
When I grow up,

27
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,440
I'll fight like you on the battlefield

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,480
to defend our home.

29
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,940
Alright.

30
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,880
It's nothing.

31
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,920
Wait a moment.

32
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,780
General Wushuang.

33
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,040
Sorry for being late.

34
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,820
Let's go.

35
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,180
General Wushuang.

36
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,500
Please look after Wan.

37
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,860
Let's go.

38
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,800
Come on.

39
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,240
Lift your foot to go up a stair.

40
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,160
Alright.

41
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,120
Watch your step.

42
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,140
Wait here. I'll fetch some water.

43
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,240
Be careful.

44
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,800
Who's there?

45
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,360
Who is it?

46
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,800
Take one more step and I'll strike.

47
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,980
Go away.

48
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,360
Let's go.

49
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,580
Stop picking it up.

50
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,580
I told you to stop.

51
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,160
I'm sorry, Yun Yao.

52
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,940
My cultivation is gone,

53
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,720
and I can't see anymore.

54
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,120
I can't protect you.

55
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,420
That's just right.

56
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,860
I'll protect you instead.

57
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,400
I've told you before:

58
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,600
Your life belongs to me.

59
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,700
I want you to live
and reach the Moon Clan.

60
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,180
What's wrong?

61
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,600
I remember there was a brook

62
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,280
that led to the mountain ahead.

63
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,000
Why is the brook gone?

64
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,840
There's a wooden hut over there.

65
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
Let me go ask about it.

66
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,200
Come on.

67
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,680
Excuse me.

68
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,220
May I ask something?

69
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,940
Why has this brook ahead been filled?

70
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,760
It's painful to speak of.

71
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,480
A few years back, the clan village
beyond that mountain

72
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,720
was wiped out overnight.

73
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,860
The blood turned the brook red,

74
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,520
and the air reeked of blood for days.

75
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,820
The villagers
couldn't bear it any longer,

76
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,040
so they filled it.

77
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,560
It's true.

78
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,180
Back then, that place

79
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,340
was lush with grass and water.

80
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,080
Well,

81
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,380
do you know another way through?

82
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,720
There is another way,

83
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,700
but you'd have to go around the mountain

84
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,020
and go through from the other side.

85
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,140
That path's not easy to find.

86
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,120
Stop rambling, old man.

87
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,720
Go and show the children the way.

88
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
Thank you, ma'am.

89
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,660
Thank you, sir.

90
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,340
This young lady is so gentle.

91
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,920
She's quite pretty, too.

92
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,440
She reminds me of my younger days.

93
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,680
Stop flattering yourself.

94
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,320
Do you think you can compare to her?

95
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,560
Liu Chunsheng, what do you mean?

96
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,380
Do you regret marrying me?

97
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,660
No, I wouldn't dare.

98
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,760
Sorry about that.

99
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,380
I'll head inside and get ready.

100
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,740
Why not sit and have something to eat?

101
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,940
No need.

102
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,900
Thank you, ma'am.

103
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,520
Watch your step.

104
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,680
Lift your foot.

105
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,800
Lift your foot.

106
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,040
Careful, the ground is uneven.

107
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,980
Watch out for the stones.

108
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,520
This way.

109
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,440
Mr. Liu,

110
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,400
how much farther is it?

111
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,140
We're almost there.

112
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,920
Watch out for the stones ahead.

113
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,320
Lift your foot higher.

114
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,820
To the right.

115
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,680
What's wrong?

116
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,480
Mr. Liu?

117
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,380
Mr. Liu, are you alright?

118
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,820
I'm fine.

119
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,680
Who would put

120
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,920
an animal trap here

121
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,480
without even a mark?

122
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,940
Mr. Liu.

123
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,980
Your wound could get infected.

124
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,540
- Let me help you home.
- No.

125
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,700
That won't do.

126
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,840
This...

127
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,940
Yun Yao.

128
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
Help me over there.

129
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,280
Careful.

130
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,120
Go left.

131
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,300
To the left.

132
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,480
Let me carry you.

133
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,120
Careful.

134
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,880
One, two, three, go.

135
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,400
Is it here?

136
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,240
Yes, yes.

137
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,300
That's it.

138
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,340
Mrs. Liu.

139
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,720
What happened?

140
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,280
What happened to your foot?

141
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,080
I'm fine.

142
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,460
It's just a minor injury.

143
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,960
I got caught by an animal trap.

144
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,560
How many times have I warned you
to be careful?

145
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,520
Yet you're still so careless.

146
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,660
Mrs. Liu, this isn't the time for blame.

147
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,200
Do you have Baihua Grass and Zihua Herb?

148
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,240
Mr. Liu's wound needs tending.

149
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,740
Yes, I have plenty at home.

150
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,420
I'll fetch them now.

151
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,940
