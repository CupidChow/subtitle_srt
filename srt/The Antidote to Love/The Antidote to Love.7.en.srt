00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,360
I'm treating your wound.

4
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,480

Let me tell you.

7
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,280
This cut is pretty deep.

8
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,240
If you don't treat it soon,

9
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,450
it could get infected.

10
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,110

11
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520

will bring calamity to our clan.
