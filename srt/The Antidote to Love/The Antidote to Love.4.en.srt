=The Antidote to Love=
=Episode 4=

2
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,300
(Star Sect)

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,500
Who's there?

4
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,860
What do you want to pawn?

5
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm a traveler from afar,

6
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,780
here to pawn the moonlight

7
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,220
and clear wind.

8
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,380
Oh, we have a rare guest.

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,060
(Jiang Lingyun, Star Sect)

10
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,140
May I ask

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,080
what you want to buy?

12
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,300
The antidote to the Fatal Herb.

13
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,660
We don't trade with money here.

14
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,700
Besides,
the antidote is beyond precious.

15
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,740
What will you offer

16
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,040
in exchange?

17
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,760
My blood.

18
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,200
How odd. I have blood too.

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
What makes yours so special?

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,620
The Star Sect knows everything.

21
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,360
Have you ever heard

22
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
of the medicinal slave
made by the Office?

23
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,880
Drink their blood,
and you'll live longer

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,000
with forever youth.

25
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,100
If you give me the antidote
to the Fatal Herb,

26
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,680
I'll give you the slave's blood
that is desired by all.

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,040
Will you take

28
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,880
this deal

29
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,360
or not?

30
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,300
Yi Jiu.

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,980
It's time to go back.

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,640
Go back?

33
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,820
Was it not you who handed me

34
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,640
to Prince Ning after all your effort?

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,240
Prince Ning?

36
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,720
At the Eternity Feast, you killed many.

37
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,020
He can shield you for a while,

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,040
but can he shield you forever?

39
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,380
I don't need his protection.

40
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,260
Even if it means death,

41
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,160
I won't go back to that filthy place
with you.

42
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,620
Very well.

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,560
Even if you become a corpse today,

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,320
I'll still take you back with me.

45
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,040
If you don't come over now,

46
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,060
I'll have to resort to violence.

47
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,560
Your Highness.

48
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,020
That's twice now.

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,240
You do enjoy saving damsels, don't you?

50
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,460
But this damsel you rescued

51
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,260
has got a plan of her own.

52
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,700
If you keep her by your side,

53
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,400
she'll bring trouble for sure.

54
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,460
It's not your place

55
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,060
to discipline my woman.

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,380
Your woman?

57
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,800
Don't tell me you see her
as your consort.

58
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,320
Let me remind you.

59
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,820
His Majesty used her to die with you.

60
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,260
Say one more word,

61
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,040
and I'll kill you.

62
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,440
Get lost!

63
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
I'm involved in a murder case.

64
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,880
And I have many enemies.

65
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,060
The Office won't let me go.

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,560
Since you know, stay close to me.

67
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,360
Don't try any more tricks.

68
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,380
Miss Yi Jiu.

69
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Where have you been?

70
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,700
Your Highness.

71
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,760
These are the daily things
you asked me to get for Miss Yi Jiu.

72
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,260
Everything has been bought.

73
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,620
Don't you want to see the lanterns?

74
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,060
Come with me.

75
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,610
I'll hang it here.

76
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,040
- Sure.
- Have you finished?

77
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,100
Hang it a bit higher.

78
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,720
- OK.
- Let me help you.

79
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,860
Tie it a bit tighter.

80
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,800
(Have a son soon)
Tie it once more.

81
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,780
The lantern market is as bright as day.

82
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,860
The people are reunited like the moon.

83
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,460
In the Moon Clan,

84
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,120
when the moon

85
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,860
is full,

86
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,580
we make wishes at the Sacred Pool.

87
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,200
What do you do in Dawei?

88
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,540
In Dawei,

89
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,280
we hold the Lantern Festival.

90
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,760
Lanterns fill every street.

91
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,480
The celebrations last all night.

92
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,700
The city glows with light.

93
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,800
The lantern market is as bright as day.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,500
The people are reunited like the moon.

95
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,560
Yun Yao,

96
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,800
I want to take you to Dawei.

97
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,600
Let's appreciate the lanterns together.

98
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,520
I'll tell Father that I'll marry you.

99
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,580
We'll spend our lives together,

100
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,260
always by each other's side.

101
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,400
Will you marry me?

102
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,820
You can't go back on your word.

103
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,240
I won't.

104
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,540
(With vast lands and rivers,
together we seize the stars.)

105
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,040
(Together with you,
we're never to be parted.)

106
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,920
Make a wish.

107
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,520
If I expect nothing,

108
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,420
then nothing will fail me.

109
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,400
No expectations

110
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,700
means

111
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,860
no disappointments.

112
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,560
Your Highness,

113
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,960
you told the Chief Diviner
that I'm yours just now.

114
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,820
So,

115
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,420
can you protect me forever?

116
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,460
Just now,

117
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,760
I was only joking.

118
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,780
(Happiness)

119
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,180
Put it on the windows.

120
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,490
- On every window.
- Yes.

121
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,240
You're off to the side.

122
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,180
Move a bit east.

123
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,280
These hands only know battle.

124
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,900
I've never done such careful work.

125
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,520
Hurry up, hurry up.

126
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,140
What are you doing?

127
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,340
Miss Yun Yao.

128
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,860
Your Highness, please accept the decree.

129
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,820
By His Majesty's decree:
As two days are up,

130
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,180
we have come now

131
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,560
to take the slave Yi Jiu away.

132
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,100
Guards, take her away.

133
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,220
How dare you!

134
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,300
There is no slave here.

135
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
From this moment on,

136
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,100
she

137
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,400
is my consort.

138
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,400
You...

139
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,740
Tell Father:

140
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,380
This is my answer to him.

141
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,800
Let's go.

142
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,440
Do you want to ask me

143
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,260
if marrying you

144
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,280
is just to keep you safe?

145
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,040
That's true,

146
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,680
but it's not the whole reason.

147
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
Five years ago, I was wounded.

148
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,240
Since then, my memory is gone.

149
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,580
People call me a hero
who defeated the Moon Clan,

150
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,400
but I recall nothing from that time

151
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,160
until the day you saved me.

152
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,360
You look just like the girl
in my painting.

153
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,180
So, I thought

154
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,040
you might be tied to my lost memories.

155
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,480
In that case,

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,340
you might be disappointed.

157
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,520
I'm not the one you seek
in your painting.
