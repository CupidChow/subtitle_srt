00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,980
=The Antidote to Love=
=Episode 15=

2
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,660
I didn't expect you to come.

3
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,000
Have you found Zhe's body?

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,640
Zhe's body is at the Office.

5
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,580
The Chief Diviner did all that.

6
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,020
You...

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,160
What have you found out?

8
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,180
I've gotten back

9
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,220
the memory of your clan's tragedy.

10
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,860
(How should I tell him)

11
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,770
(that Zhao Zhe caused all of this?)

12
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,220
Actually...

13
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,280
It was me.

14
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,000
I led the attack on the Moon Clan
on the wedding day.

15
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,060
Since you say so,

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,960
prove it.

17
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,100
On the wedding day,

18
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,860
the entire Moon Clan

19
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,350
was celebrating the Saintess's marriage.

20
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,020
I led the North Army's elite inside.

21
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,760
That day,
the place was decked in flowers.

22
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,420
It was very lively.

23
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,420
When they saw me,
the Moon Clan welcomed me warmly.

24
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,170
Right then, I gave my order

25
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,740
to kill everyone there.

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,620
Every single member of the Moon Clan

27
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,960
would follow the wedding
into the afterlife.

28
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,540
I hadn't even dismounted

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,920
before I struck someone down
with my sword.

30
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,160
Ms. Li didn't even have time to cry out

31
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,900
before she got slain.

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,840
Blood splattered
across the wedding scene.

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,940
It stained everything crimson.

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,320
Blood dripped from the tip of my sword,

35
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,760
leaving long streaks on the ground.

36
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,620
The screams of terror...

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,760
The frantic rush to escape...

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,760
You can't imagine how thrilling it was.

39
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,760
Then there was Wang

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,160
who tried to ambush me from behind.

41
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,920
But he was no match for me.

42
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,620
With one swing,
I parted his head from his body.

43
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,740
Blood surged in a crimson wave.

44
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,660
One by one, they all fell before me.

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,520
Enough.

46
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,340
Stop it.

47
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,020
Why did you do all this?

48
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,380
Because the blood of Moon Clan women
cures all illnesses.

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,560
Though you saved me in the Moon Valley,

50
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,480
I came with the task
of the massacre of the clan.

51
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,680
This was all my plan from the start.

52
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,540
Shut up.

53
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,740
This was all your plan, huh?

54
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,380
Very well.

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,720
Then I want you

56
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,580
to kneel before the Sacred Pool
and repent.

57
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,280
I will kill you myself.

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,140
Your blood will be offered

59
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,420
to honor every soul lost
from the Moon Clan.

60
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,250
Let's eat.

61
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,100
How nice.

62
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,940
Your Highness, you're back.

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,340
I've been looking for you
since yesterday.

64
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,980
I found the true survivor
of the North Army.

65
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
Come on.

66
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,860
Sit down.

67
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,220
Your Highness.

68
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,440
Since you lost your memory,

69
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,540
you haven't joined us for a drink.

70
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,420
Is there something to celebrate?

71
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,180
It's been a while since we've talked.

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Tonight,

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,760
let's drink till dawn.

74
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,160
- Cheers.
- Sure.

75
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,220
Let's drink till dawn.

76
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,580
- Cheers.
- Come on.

77
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,660
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

78
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,420
I've seen each of you grow

79
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,340
with my own eyes.

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
Zhen Hu.

81
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,360
I remember you used to be timid.

82
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,340
Now you've become a true leader.

83
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,920
- Good.
- Not really.

84
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,280
It's all thanks

85
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,300
to your helpful guidance.

86
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,070
- Xiu Feng.
- Yes.

87
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,700
Do you recall this scar?

88
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,280
It happened when you slipped up.

89
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,900
I took a blow for you.

90
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,840
So, on the battlefield,

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
never let your guard down.

92
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,360
Your Highness, with you here,

93
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,490
when danger comes,

94
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,710
you'll always shield us first.

95
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,760
Isn't that right, everyone?

96
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,660
Yes.

97
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,180
What if one day I'm gone?

98
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,580
Your Highness.

99
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,620
Is something troubling you?

100
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,400
It's nothing, just a jest.

101
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,320
Wushuang.

102
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,840
You're the only female general

103
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,620
in the North Army.

104
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,140
If not for me,

105
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,560
you wouldn't have joined in two years.

106
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,320
(Recruitment Office)
The first year,

107
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,580
you won the contest,

108
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,900
but they said you weren't strong enough.

109
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,600
They claimed you'd be at a disadvantage

110
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,540
on the battlefield.

111
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,170
Then came the second year.

112
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,480
You stood by the Conscription Notice
in front of my mansion,

113
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,210
(North Army Conscription Notice)
searching,

114
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,780
but your name was nowhere to be found.

115
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,480
Stop looking. Leave.
Your name's not there.

116
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,620
Do you want to join the North Army?

117
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,660
Can I?

118
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,700
Come with me.

119
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,400
When the battle began,

120
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,480
you fought just like men.

121
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,400
You are braver and wiser than most.

122
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,700
Wushuang,

123
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,460
I was right about you.

124
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,180
Everyone here today

125
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,020
is the pride of the North Army.

126
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,940
In my heart, you are all heroes.

127
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,520
We have fought side by side

128
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,820
to defend the nation.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,120
Every drop of our blood

130
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,200
and every act of loyalty

131
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,640
have built the North Army's name.

132
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,500
Your Highness,

133
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,980
what do you want to say?

134
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,020
North Army, hear my command.

135
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

136
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,300
From this day forward,

137
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,580
Shen Wushuang

138
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,640
will be your new commander.

139
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
Your Highness,

140
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,800
I am unworthy

141
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,480
of such a heavy duty.

142
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,200
Your Highness, are you leaving us?

143
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,600
Your Highness, you are our general.

144
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,580
We swore to follow.

145
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,080
- That's right.
- Yes, Your Highness.

146
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,620
We can't do this without you.

147
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,220
Are you ignoring my orders now?

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,600
This is the North Army's command token.

149
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,240
It commands all our troops.

150
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,100
It stands for our army's honor.

151
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
Take it.

152
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,020
Take it.

153
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,800
Soldiers of the North Army,

154
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,700
one day,

155
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,140
Wushuang will lead you into battle

156
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,620
to defend our home and country.

157
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,960
Please remember this:

158
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,700
Wherever I may be,

159
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,760
my heart

160
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,640
will always be with the North Army.

161
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,160
(All of this)

162
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,520
(happened because of me.)

163
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,920
(Let me)

164
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,640
(bear all the consequences.)

165
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,940
Give me a little more time.

166
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,020
I promise to find the truth for you.

167
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,540

It's definitely him.

187
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
What a poor judgment.

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,680
Come on, let's get to work.

Here.

(Wanted Notice)
Have you heard this?

191
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,460
The God of War of Dawei fell
for a demoness.

192
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,220
He handed over his military power

193
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,540
and fled with her.

194
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,200
I heard the demoness's blood
carries the Gu poison.

195
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,080
Anyone who drinks it
obeys her every word.

196
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
The God of War must've been bewitched.
