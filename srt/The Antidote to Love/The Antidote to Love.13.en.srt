=Episode 13=

2
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,600
Someone wants to use you

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,960
to kill Zhao Zhe.

4
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,440
That doesn't make sense.

5
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,960
Why kill Prince Qi?

6
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,120
Why do it in the name
of the North Army?

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,100
After careful thinking,

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,640
I don't think the neck wound by accident

9
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,060
was fatal.

10
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,220
Maybe he was poisoned.

11
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,840
Why look at me?

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,020
I'm not all-knowing.

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,660
If we want the truth,

14
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,080
there's just one way.

15
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,980
- Let's go.
- Where to?

16
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,300
Come on.

17
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,620
Milord.

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,680
Milord.

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,080
Our hidden guard sent word:

20
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,940
Those two are on the move.

21
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,820
That slave truly is something.

22
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,820
You know what to do next.

23
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,260
Yes.

24
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,940
Hey, what are you up to?

25
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,400
Barging into Prince Ning's Mansion?

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
There are so many guards there.

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
I can't fight them all.

28
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,720
(Prince Ning's Mansion)

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,520
Thank you for your hard work.

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,480
Here, have some food.

31
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,740
(Prince Ning's Mansion)

32
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,460
This is it.

33
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,080
Are you serious?

34
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,660
I am the chief of the Star Sect,

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,500
yet you want me to crawl
through a dog hole?

36
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,380
Then go force your way in.

37
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,780
Well...

38
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,360
I'll crawl.

39
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,380
How do you expect me
to crawl through this?

40
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
Over here.

41
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,700
Seriously? You plan to open the coffin?

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,760
The burial is set for tomorrow.

43
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,640
Now is the best chance.

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,800
Why do I always get dragged into this?

45
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,220
Why do I have to help you
open the coffin?

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
Fine.

47
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,760
Let's do it.

48
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,580
Your Highness.

49
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,780
Long time no see.

50
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,020
Zhe's spirit has not returned.

51
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,220
Yet you barged into the mourning hall.

52
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,340
What are you after?

53
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,500
Chase them.

54
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,180
This is bad. The body is missing.

55
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,180
Zhe.

56
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,160
Where's Zhe?

57
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,620
Look.

58
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,960
You misunderstood Ms. Yun Yao.

59
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,920
Now isn't the time to argue.

60
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,200
Finding Zhe's body comes first.

61
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,160
Is your hand okay?

62
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,880
No need for you to worry.

63
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,400
Let's head out first.

64
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,260
(Mourning)

65
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,200
This time, we won't crawl
through holes, right?

66
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,300
Stop talking nonsense.

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
I helped you a lot today.

68
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,540
You owe me a grand meal
when we're back.

69
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,200
The Office's counting rod.

70
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Why is it here?

71
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,460
(Office of Divination)

72
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,700
Where is the Chief Diviner?

73
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,160
Chief Diviner.

74
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,360
Come out now.

75
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,980
Your Highness.

76
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,240
Where is he?

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
The Chief Diviner is not here.

78
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,160
Tell me the truth.

79
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,500
He's truly not here.

80
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
What matter angers you so?

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,280
Where is my brother's body?

82
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,180
Why aren't you questioning
the medicinal slave who killed him?

83
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,260
Instead, you came to cause trouble here.

84
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,940
It seems you have a death wish.

85
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,320
You've worn that mask for so long.

86
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,040
Let me help you remove it today.

87
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,500
Let me teach you some
self-defense techniques.

88
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,580
When someone holds you down,

89
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,940
just pretend to give in at first

90
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,260
and then use your elbow to break free.

91
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,320
If anyone ever bullies you,

92
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,360
this is how you deal with them.

93
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,940
Don't move.

94
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,920
If this wound gets infected,

95
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,300
you could lose your hand.

96
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,860
What a big wound.

97
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,140
Wrap around more times,
and it'll heal.

98
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,540
Just kidding.

99
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,220
By the way,

100
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,280
this is important.

101
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,100
Outside Prince Qi's mourning hall,

102
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,860
the North Army stands guard everywhere.

103
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,300
Who could have stolen his body?

104
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,880
Perhaps

105
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,620
he never died at all.

106
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,060
Clever.

107
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,100
What we see may not be true,

108
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,710
just like Prince Qi's death.

109
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,800
The annihilation of the Moon Clan

110
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,500
might be the same.

111
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,470
I will never forget

112
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,640
what I saw back then.

113
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,880
All these years,

114
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,800
if not for my hatred for Zhao He

115
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,900
and my obsession with the truth,

116
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,500
I couldn't have survived

117
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,300
in the cruel Office of Divination.

118
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,800
Without that,

119
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,680
I would've broken long ago

120
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
and died in that dark place.

121
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,740
Someone's here for you.

122
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,160
Is your hand alright?

123
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,260
It's nothing.

124
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,440
I've found something new

125
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,520
about Zhe's death.

126
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Tomorrow,

127
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,940
I'll give you an answer.

128
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,430
I don't need your answer.

129
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,940
All I'm doing

130
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,080
is to clear my name.

131
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
General Wushuang.

132
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,640
Your Highness.

133
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,180
His Highness hasn't returned
since last night.

134
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,320
No one can find him.

135
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,580
Did he come to see you?

136
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,340
He did come to me last night

137
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,960
and said he had some new clues

138
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,660
about Zhe.

139
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,540
General Wushuang.

140
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,680
You look in a hurry.

141
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,040
Is there something urgent?

142
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
The North Army survivor
last time was fake.

143
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,340
Someone made it happen.

144
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,540
I've found the true survivor.

145
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,380
He gave me a vital clue.

146
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,620
(Zhengwu Gate)

147
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
Your Highness.

148
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
You've tailed me all day.

149
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,740
Did you find anything unusual?

150
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,720
