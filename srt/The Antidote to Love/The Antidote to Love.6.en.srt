2
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,400
Beneath the moon,
silence stays with me in the woods.

3
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,080
A wisp of bamboo shadow
drifts without a trace.

4
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,360
The evening wind and gentle rain
warm the night with tea.

5
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,920
Stars fade on cold nights,
leaving my heart clear.

6
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,620
Where did she go?

7
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,100
I'm the only one left
in this bamboo yard.

8
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,340
May I ask

9
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,700
who you're looking for?

10
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,120
No more talk with him.

11
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,100
Search the place.

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,460
Who are you?

13
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,780
Jiang Lingyun

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,480
from the Star Sect.

15
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,560
How dare you pose as Mr. Jiang?

16
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,920
If you're you're Jiang Lingyun,

17
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,520
then I must be his father.

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,800
The Leaf Dart.

19
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,460
It's truly Jiang Lingyun.

20
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,740
Sorry.

21
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,740
Sorry to intrude.

22
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,220
Wait a moment.

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,920
What do you take this place for?

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,200
Coming and going as you please?

25
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,860
Get lost.

26
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,160
Who are you?

27
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,820
Miss, are you alright?

28
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,360
Young Master.

29
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,300
Someone's fainted.

30
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,260
Who is it? Why the fuss?

31
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,060
(It's her.)

32
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,800
The medicinal slave made by the Office.

33
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,360
Drink their blood,

34
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,480
and you'll live longer

35
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,380
with forever youth.

36
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,480
Take her to a room first.

37
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
You're awake.

38
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
It's you.

39
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,180
(The latest news)

40
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,860
(Prince Ning was attacked
by his consort)

41
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,040
You're haunted in your bridal attire.

42
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
That's quite intriguing.

43
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,180
(He's unfathomable.)

44
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,540
(I can't have him see through me.)

45
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,260
I'm just

46
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,800
a medicinal slave that escaped

47
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,960
from the Office.

48
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,680
I fell for a scholar.

49
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,720
On our wedding day,

50
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,570
my husband was killed.

51
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,660
(Prince Ning was attacked)

52
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,420
(by his consort)
They want to take me back.

53
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,860
Well, you are truly

54
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,320
quite unlucky for your spouse.

55
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,380
You can leave now.

56
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,460
Thank you for saving me.

57
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,800
Sir,

58
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,860
may I

59
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,060
stay here for a few days?

60
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,720
We never keep idle guests here.

61
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,760
Hurry up and leave.

62
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,330
I accidentally spilled your meal today.

63
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,330
I...

64
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,540
I'll make you another serving.

65
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,600
Where's the kitchen?

66
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,080
It's over there.

67
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,060
Young Master.

68
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,760
She's putting on an act for us.

69
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I know.

70
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,560
Then why not call her out?

71
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,660
Won't her stay

72
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,200
bring trouble to us?

73
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,220
Life is dull as it is.

74
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,360
I just want

75
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,160
to keep a little joy

76
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,460
for myself.

77
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,960
You're playing with fire.

78
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,260
No more talk.

79
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,260
Get her a new dress.

80
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,030
She's ugly

81
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,940
in red.

82
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,340
Alright.

83
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,000
Your Highness.

84
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,280
Where is Yi Jiu?

85
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,260
I don't know.

86
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,360
You're her friend.

87
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,540
How could you not know?

88
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,660
My brother treated her well,

89
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,000
yet she hurt him so deeply.

90
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,100
Speak. Where is she?

91
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,160
Speak. Where is she now?

92
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,760
I have no idea.

93
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,980
Your Highness.

94
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,020
Please calm down.

95
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,840
How am I supposed to be calm?

96
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,120
My brother lies in a coma

97
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,560
because of these wretched
medicinal slaves.

98
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,680
Your Highness.

99
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,000
I've sent people to find Miss Yi Jiu.

100
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,480
For now,
His Highness's health comes first.

101
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,240
We must wait patiently.

102
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,560
If anything happens to my brother,

103
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,620
I will never let you off.

104
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,200
Lock her up.

105
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,960
Young Master.

106
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,300
Why isn't it ready yet?

107
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,480
She's been at it all night.

108
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,580
Coming.

109
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,320
Please taste it.

110
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,780
Blue looks best.

111
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
It's nothing.

112
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,220
How is it?

113
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,900
I asked for flower pies.

114
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,400
This is just a pie.

115
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,400
Where are the flowers?

116
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,940
Flowers

117
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,020
and pies.

118
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,400
What I want is flower-filled pies.

119
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,220
Not flowers and pie.

120
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,440
You have high standards.

121
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,640
Even a simple pie needs fresh flowers.

122
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,240
Fresh blossoms and a tasty filling.

123
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,020
Flower pie.

124
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,280
Will you eat it or not?

125
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,280
Sir.

126
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,940
What are the red threads
and bamboo tubes for?

127
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,090
I can gather

128
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,440

149
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,580
I found him while gathering herbs.

He was wearing armor.

151
