00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,637
CHARACTERS AND PLACES ASSOCIATED
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,728
Did you follow me home?

3
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,317
-Are you nuts?
-Why do you keep changing your words?

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,152
Why?

5
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,739
You told me to do everything by the book,

6
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,576
but then reprimanded me for
being too by the book.

7
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,205
Even today, the victim's life
comes before the evidence.

8
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,541
He could've died
if we preserved the scene!

9
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,544
Are you challenging me?

10
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,379
What a nutjob.

11
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,512
I'll be cut from the force anyway.

12
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,307
I have nothing to lose.

13
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,935
Mr. Oh Yang-chon.

14
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,250
What's next?

15
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,628
What comes after Mr. Oh Yang-chon?

16
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,421
You grabbed me by my shirt.

17
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,340
What will you do next?

18
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,430
Next...

19
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,188
You didn't think about it, right?

20
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,857
You called my name and grabbed my shirt,

21
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,441
but you didn't think further, right?

22
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,277
You idiot.

23
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,736
You're so reckless.

24
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,489
You just do things in a blind fury.

25
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,907
What will you do next?

26
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,495
Are you going to beat up a fellow cop?

27
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,290
You scumbag!

28
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:53,047
You remind me of a hairtail fish.
All you are is long. You idiot.

29
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,467
Maybe I should just fry you up
and eat you.

30
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,721
I can't believe you're my partner.

31
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,851
Answer me before you leave.

32
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,896
You should answer all my questions.

33
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,522
I've got nothing to lose now.

34
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,322
Why are you walking around
in the middle of the night?

35
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,908
Take a cab if there's no bus.

36
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,619
Did you walk for three hours

37
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,912
from the hospital to here?

38
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,707
Don't you have cab fare?

39
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,792
Doesn't Jang-mi give you money?

40
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,884
I'm talking to you.
Why aren't you answering me?

41
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,435
Why are you still standing there? Go home!

42
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,401
Are you still unaware of why

43
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,278
you got such a low score?

44
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,365
Is that it? Huh?

45
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,993
Yes.

46
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,913
Last Monday.

47
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,291
Also, two weeks ago
on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday.

48
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,752
You were late for roll call

49
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,796
by 5, 3, 7, and 4 minutes.

50
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,923
Right?

51
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,591
I wasn't late for work, but--

52
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,969
Would it kill you to clean up the bathroom
after roll call?

53
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,137
Who would do you harm?

54
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,765
And when you caught the congressmen--

55
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,310
I did as you said
and followed the DUI checkpoint manual.

56
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,479
The congressmen refused
to take the sobriety test, so--

57
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,565
So until then your score
wasn't good nor bad, it was average.

58
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,902
You did a good job
and took care of things by the book.

59
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,031
But what did you say to me
after arresting the congressmen?

60
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,449
You said you were sorry.

61
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,827
Are you stupid?

62
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,955
You don't even know

63
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,582
if you did something right or wrong.

64
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,503
You just say you're sorry
without a sense of duty.

65
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,924
So you,
who doesn't know his ass from his elbow,

66
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,011
went from average back to poor.

67
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,555
Do you understand now?

68
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,900
He just says what he wants to say.

69
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,488
I asked what was wrong with
saving someone before the evidence,

70
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,865
but why didn't he answer me?

71
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,871
I bet he has nothing to say.
Because I'm right.

72
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,417
What an asshole.

73
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,462
Tell me.

74
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,132
Did you walk to and from the hospital
every day?

75
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,555
Why did you buy hairtail?

76
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,350
I remembered your mom used to like it,

77
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,894
so when I saw it, I bought some.

78
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,231
Since when did you care about...

79
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,067
You shouldn't have beat her up back then.

80
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,038
Hey, what are you doing?

81
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,331
Can I stay the night?

82
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,502
The last bus already left,
and there are no cabs in the area.

83
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,755
It's too far to walk downtown,

84
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,256
and it's cold.

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,967
Are we friends?

86
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,928
We're not, but still.

87
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,055
It's too cold.

88
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,100
Let me stay just one night.

89
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,190
I'm Lieutenant Oh Yang-chon's subordinate,
Yeom Sang-su.

90
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,155
Please let me stay for one night.

91
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,532
I can't get a ride home.

92
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,174
No matter how much I think about it,
that kid is out of his mind.

93
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,804
I've never seen a crazy jerk
like him before.

94
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,014
What a nutjob.

95
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,440
This is so annoying.

96
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,943
Every day it's the same shit.
What the hell?

97
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,992
All day I deal with drunk people
and give out parking tickets,

98
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,704
and now I'm cleaning after
the drunk people after hours.

99
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,206
Nothing's working out.

100
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,876
Just mop it up
and finish it off with a dry rag.

101
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,297
If a drunk person slips on the wet floor
while doing their business,

102
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,424
you'll get your wish,
and we'll have a big accident.

103
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,176
I can take care of it.

104
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,928
Do you think I can't even clean up right?

105
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,724
What are you looking at?

106
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,060
You think you're the only smart one.

107
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,151
Imagine if you had to deal with
an old mentor and drunk teenagers all day.

108
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,821
Hey, if a domestic violence

109
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,490
or disturbance case is reported,

110
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,034
don't take the call before me, you bitch.

111
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,913
Loyalty is about sharing big cases
or cases we can learn from.

112
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,164
You just can't take them all.

113
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,044
I'll apply for the Violent Crime Unit
after the probationary period.

114
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,796
You only care about making good records.

115
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,131
You're such a disloyal bitch.

116
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,227
You can have the gift certificate
I got for working

117
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,646
on the homicide case.

118
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,732
What's your problem?

119
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,873
A person

120
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,709
died.

121
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,839
She didn't just die.

122
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,051
She got stabbed all over her body.

123
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,054
There was blood all over her place,

124
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,348
and her body was covered in blood.

125
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,977
Do you really want to see that?

126
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,231
Do you envy me that much
because I saw that?

127
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,364
Dad! Dad...

128
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,743
Dad...

129
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,579
<i>Dad!</i>

130
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,790
I've never seen

131
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,669
anyone bleeding that much in my life.

132
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:53,175
I know we learned at the academy
that such things happen

133
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,845
around us all the time,

134
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,471
but I thought they were just scaring us.

135
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,308
I had no idea that I'd get to witness it
right before my eyes.

136
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,689
Does such a brutal case

137
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,110
only appeal to you

138
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,656
as a means to get more points
and a better review?

139
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,706
You'd better not

140
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,959
talk about performance or reviews

141
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,379
in regard to a case where
someone got hurt or killed ever again.

142
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,967
If you do, you'll get to see
how nasty and mean I can be, you bitch.

143
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,872
EPISODE 5

144
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,397
Hey, Jeong-o! Let's go home.

145
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,076
<i>We provide services to remove keepsakes
left by the deceased. Don't worry.</i>

146
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,245
<i>What if I see a ghost?
Will you get rid of it for me?</i>

147
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,251
My dad will wake up. Just leave it on.

148
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,336
<i>What's the point of living
if you're going to die?</i>

149
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,464
<i>Take this.</i>

150
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,308
AWARD FOR ACHIEVEMENT

151
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,228
You've received an award.

152
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,230
I've received more than one.

153
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,237
My favorite part of the police charter

154
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,074
is the line about how
it's the police's duty to protect the life

155
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,952
and property of every citizen.

156
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,873
What kind of nonsense
will you spew this time?

157
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,084
Why are you talking about the charter
in the middle of the night?

158
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,630
About what happened today,

159
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:23,511
I prioritized life over evidence.
What's wrong with that?

160
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,476
How can evidence come before life?
Do you think it's right?

161
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,438
No one complimented me
even though I saved someone's life,

162
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,233
and you're not even talking to me.

163
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,860
The captain of the forensics team
even hit you.

164
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,696
I deserved that slap in the face.

165
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,204
We must move with a partner
in emergencies, but I ignored that rule.

166
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,625
I was like, "You do whatever you want.
I'll do the same."

167
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,589
No matter how stupid your partner seems,
a partner is still a partner.

168
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,176
It was my fault for ignoring you.

169
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,097
Had you called me

170
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,392
when you heard the victim
moaning in pain in the restroom...

171
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,228
Had I ordered you to do so,

172
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,606
you would've saved a life,
and I would've gotten the evidence.

173
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,984
We would've killed two birds
with one stone

174
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,444
and finished everything exactly
according to the manual.

175
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,363
Don't you think so?

176
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,663
You're right.

177
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,922
There's no such thing as a stupid mentee.

178
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,260
We should always blame their dumb mentors
who didn't teach them right.

179
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,972
Hence, everything that happened today
is my fault,

180
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,391
your dumb mentor.

181
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,900
But now that we're a team...

182
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,485
Are we going to be okay?

183
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,739
I think I'm in deep shit.

184
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,287
I feel the same way.

185
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,788
You little...

186
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,125
Why are you laughing?

187
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,388
By the way, I heard you were married.

188
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,725
But why do you live with your father,
not your family?

189
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,539
<i>I knew you'd be here.</i>

190
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,979
<i>Why do you look so upset?</i>

191
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,440
<i>Did something happen?</i>

192
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,113
<i>Hey, I actually...</i>

193
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,992
Don't go to the hospital today.

194
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,663
Your legs hurt, right?

195
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,457
No, they're fine.

196
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,084
Then why do you have pain relief patches
all over your body?

197
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,713
Why do you have to walk
for five to six hours

198
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,758
to the hospital and back every single day?
It's so bad for your knees.

199
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,135
<i>She'd never do that.</i>

200
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,305
Take a taxi or the bus
if you want to go to the hospital today.

201
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,639
Okay?

202
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,642
Okay?

203
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,394
<i>Really?</i>

204
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,189
<i>You really didn't see anything?</i>

205
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,857
Gosh, seriously.

206
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,736
Don't go to the hospital today, okay?

207
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,781
If you can't walk because
your knees get all messed up,

208
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,075
Jang-mi and I'll have to suffer
while taking care of you!

209
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,163
Since when were you so good to Mom?

210
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,792
Do you know why I became a cop?

211
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,128
To lock up men like you
who beat up other people.

212
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,765
You used to beat her up while drunk.

213
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,145
What's the point of being good to her now
when she's going to die soon?

214
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,148
What's the point of buying hairtail fish?

215
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,246
I told you not to buy the farm.
Why did you buy it?

216
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,290
If you hadn't,

217
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,918
she wouldn't have collapsed
while picking weeds in the sun!

218
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,922
What kind of man talks so much

219
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,590
in front of the dining table?

220
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,592
You're so full of shit.

221
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,721
Goodbye!

222
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,140
I'm sorry I'm late.

223
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,434
There were too many people
at the doctor's. You should go.

224
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,644
Next time, come on your day off,
not on a day you work.

225
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,605
If you did a good job, I wouldn't come.

226
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,940
I'm exhausted from working,
but I come here from Seoul.

227
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,868
Also, clean the kitchen whenever you can.

228
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,828
It's always a mess.

229
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,415
I come here after a long day's work,
and I have to work again. It's exhausting.

230
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,918
Just quit if it's that exhausting.

231
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,378
Why are you bragging anyway?

232
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,715
What's so exhausting about
a job so many people do?

233
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,342
Even your sick mother is working.

234
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,969
So if you're exhausted, just quit already!

235
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,698
What if I quit because it's exhausting?

236
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,535
Can you pay back the loan
for the coffee shop?

237
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,372
A job like everyone else's?

238
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,501
Aside from cops,
who else sees dead people?

239
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,047
Do you have any idea how grueling that is?

240
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,517
She always seems irritated these days.

241
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,353
It's not like she earns a lot anyway.

242
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,278
<i>It's not my place to speak,</i>

243
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,698
-but your father--
-Don't speak if it's not your place.

244
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,741
You are too harsh on your father.

245
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,119
Stay out of it
and be good to your own father.

246
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,121
I don't have a father to treat well.

247
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,459
He passed away.

248
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,216
How did he pass away?

249
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,635
He would still be young if he were alive.

250
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,470
It was a hit-and-run.

251
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,974
The killer was caught, and it was a cop.

252
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,601
Funny, right?

253
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,021
Is that true?

254
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,029
I'm asking because I'm worried.

255
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,573
Did you join the force

256
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,200
to get back at the police?

257
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,923
Why are you breathing so heavily?

258
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:22,841
Do you have asthma?

259
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,932
You should rest.

260
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,769
I'll rest when I want to.

261
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,577
Talk about useless pride.

262
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,667
I really hate him.

263
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,761
Yang-chon, did you know five years ago,
Lieutenant Lee said he wanted

264
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,429
to go to the Violent Crime Unit.

265
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,598
I told him not to because he was too old.

266
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,518
I know that's why he's like that.

267
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,980
You and Han-sol are ridiculous too.

268
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,734
Hongil Division is notorious

269
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,195
for being one of the most difficult
divisions around,

270
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,614
so why would you accept him?

271
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,616
You should've sent him to
the quiet countryside.

272
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,577
What if that old man breaks a few bones
or gets hurt?

273
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,371
Will you take responsibility for that?

274
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,540
Why would I have to do that?

275
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,669
He's more than equipped
to take care of himself.

276
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,087
Isn't that right?

277
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,841
Has my old age ever got in the way

278
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,009
of you or this division?

279
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,512
Do you think you'll stay young forever?

280
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,763
Come on.

281
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,099
You were my first mentor.

282
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,268
I'm just worried about you,

283
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,812
and I want you to stay safe.

284
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,522
Stay out of my life.

285
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,233
I couldn't care less about
your good intentions.

286
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,492
Lieutenant Lee isn't doing great.

287
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,786
He's retiring soon,

288
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,580
and his son divorced recently.

289
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,957
Those who retire are said to be

290
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,750
just as stressed as those with cancer.

291
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:21,710
Try to understand.

292
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,883
This taser gun,
when used according to the manual,

293
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,843
will ensure the safety

294
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,679
of the people and the police
in the safest way possible.

295
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,849
The safest parts of the body
to use the taser gun are...

296
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,728
You must refrain from shooting
the taser gun at the heart, head, face,

297
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,688
and genitals.

298
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,023
Shoot towards the arms and legs.

299
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,441
Repeat!

300
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,027
"You must refrain from shooting
the taser gun at the heart, head,

301
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,570
face, and genitals.

302
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,655
Shoot towards the arms and legs."

303
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,116
The range of this taser gun

304
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,243
-is 6.5m.
-Are you still mad at me?

305
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,871
Do I look like I have to time
to focus on you?

306
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,664
Be aware of the range at all times.

307
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,042
In order to use the taser gun properly,

308
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,753
the most important thing
is target practice.

309
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,421
How can we practice often?

310
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,881
We're tired as it is.

311
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,634
-Practice with a BB gun at home then.
-Pop, pop.

312
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,762
Stop it!

313
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,013
Sorry.

314
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,891
Regardless of whether we're exhausted,

315
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,726
or we need to travel far to practice

316
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,728
because there aren't any shooting ranges
near us,

317
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,773
-if there's an accident--
-Whether we were after a culprit

318
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,399
or on the job,

319
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,735
our country won't protect us.

320
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,195
It's all on us.

321
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,740
So stop complaining,
cut back on sleeping, and spend your money

322
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,951
to practice at the shooting range. Got it?

323
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,410
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

324
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:38,954
Your superiors are right.

325
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,249
Our country won't look out for us.
We must protect ourselves.

326
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,835
So stay focused
and use the taser with care.

327
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,087
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

328
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,255
Lastly...

329
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:49,923
The taser must not be used

330
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,718
on pregnant women or children under 14.

331
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,970
Repeat!

332
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,431
"Don't use a taser gun on a pregnant woman
or children under 14."

333
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,100
HONGIL PATROL DIVISION

334
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,144
How can we help you?

335
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,147
Ma'am!

336
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,984
What brings you here?

337
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,443
Please have a seat.

338
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,530
My gosh! You haven't been acknowledged us

339
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:17,200
even if we bump into each other,
so I thought you had forgotten about us.

340
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,744
So what brings you here?

341
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,372
No reason. I just wanted to see you.

342
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,165
Goodness.

343
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,835
Ma'am!

344
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,673
You shouldn't have.
I bet it was expensive.

345
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,757
Who are you?

346
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,847
It's only for you.

347
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,853
Ma'am, it's Lieutenant Lee Sam-bo.

348
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,188
Don't you remember me?

349
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,941
We said hi on the streets a few days ago.

350
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,192
It's Sam-bo.

351
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,404
About 20 years ago,
Han-sol and I carried Han-soon.

352
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,198
Nothing happened to my Han-soon.

353
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,743
Nothing bad happened to her.

354
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,369
Who are you

355
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,997
to speak of my Han-soon?

356
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,123
You jerk.

357
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,085
Ma'am?

358
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,795
Ma'am.

359
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,422
Ma'am!

360
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,926
What's going on? Who is she?

361
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,014
Oh, her.

362
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,850
About 20 years ago,

363
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,519
when Han-sol and I were here,

364
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:31,441
there was a case where a stepfather
sexually assaulted his stepdaughter.

365
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,277
The mother witnessed it,

366
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,654
and the two of them drank cleaning bleach.

367
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,699
The landlord called, and we went over.

368
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,452
The lady you just saw was the mom.

369
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,121
Oh, my goodness.

370
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,749
Why doesn't she recognize me?

371
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,084
Obang Junction, Sungwon-gil 27.

372
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,003
A mother in her 30s has collapsed
at Speed Internet Cafe.

373
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,755
<i>The child is alone.</i>

374
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,256
<i>Obang Junction, Sungwon-gil 27.</i>

375
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,884
<i>A mother in her 30s has collapsed
at Speed Internet Cafe.</i>

376
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,344
<i>The child is alone.</i>

377
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,513
Patrol 18, Patrol 18 on the case.

378
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,473
Who called it in, Officer Song?

379
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,101
<i>The report was made by
the 22-year-old part-timer.</i>

380
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,311
<i>Her name is Kim Yeong-nam.</i>

381
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:12,232
<i>The mother, who is in her 30s,
suddenly collapsed while using a computer,</i>

382
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,817
<i>leaving the child alone.</i>

383
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,486
<i>Women & Juvenile Affairs
and the EMTs were both alerted.</i>

384
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:37,966
Is it tasty?

385
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,468
Give me one.

386
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,057
It's so tasty.

387
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,359
ANGEL JU-YEON, LEVEL 39

388
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,820
Captain An.

389
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,033
Lieutenant Oh Yang-chon
wants to see you outside.

390
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,122
Stay close to the child.

391
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,669
Take photos of everything here,
both as a whole and close up.

392
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,045
Yes, ma'am.

393
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,219
You can have it.

394
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,530
BAREUN PHARMACY

395
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,034
PRESCRIPTION, CHO HYE-EUN

396
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,079
Thank you for your cooperation.

397
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:05,011
I sent you everything I got
from the part-timer.

398
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,515
The woman practically lived here
for almost ten months.

399
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,683
She lives in the study room
behind this building.

400
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,393
She has depression.

401
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,104
The bag was full of pills.

402
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,524
She filled the prescription
and didn't take any.

403
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,819
Where did she get the money to live on?

404
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,571
I saw her prescription,
and it cost her 500 won.

405
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,990
She's on welfare.

406
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,666
I checked the kid as soon as I arrived.

407
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,417
He has severe atopy.

408
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,420
He didn't get abused by his mom, but...

409
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,136
He wants to pee.

410
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,145
The problem is, he wasn't treated

411
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,607
and was neglected for a long time.

412
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:04,571
The mom named her online character
Ju-yeon, after the kid.

413
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,408
She abandoned him in reality
and cared for him online.

414
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,201
That's escapism.

415
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,787
Neglect is abuse too.

416
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,499
-Neglect is abuse.
-Mister, I finished peeing.

417
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,257
Let's wash your hands.

418
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,603
We must send the kid to a facility.

419
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,772
I called one. Someone should be here soon.

420
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,743
So,

421
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,579
how long are we going to do this?

422
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,831
It's awkward and annoying.

423
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,501
Let's end the awkward and annoying bit.

424
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,213
Let's get divorced.

425
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,425
How can you say that
outside the bathroom of a crime scene?

426
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,224
Fine.

427
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,143
Let's meet when I'm off duty.

428
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,479
Let's meet and...

429
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,566
Fine, we'll get divorced or... Damn...

430
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,403
-We can go on living separately--
-The officer from the facility is here.

431
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,573
Go to the study room and pack
what the mom and child might need.

432
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,117
Hi, this is An Jang-mi.

433
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,577
Yes.

434
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,162
Come into the Internet cafe.

435
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,455
I'll call when I'm off duty.

436
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,791
Let's spend a long time together.

437
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,793
Let's eat and have tea.

438
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,589
The officer from the facility--

439
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,300
Is almost here. I heard from the bathroom.

440
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:57,225
Did you hear my wife
ask me for a divorce too?

441
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,786
Gosh. She collected her medication
instead of taking them.

442
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:18,830
It's so annoying.

443
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,375
In the end, the law will probably
let her off with probation.

444
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,877
Then the kid will continue
being neglected.

445
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,964
How is neglect different from violence?

446
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,383
Our country sucks.

447
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,677
It's only great for the adults.

448
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,014
What mom neglects her kid to play games?

449
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,849
What kind of a bitch does that?

450
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,019
If she can't raise him,
send him to an orphanage.

451
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,186
Don't talk.

452
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,647
Your voice is getting into the video.

453
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,193
What was that? Did you say
she should send her kid to an orphanage?

454
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,737
Whether the parents are good or bad,

455
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,572
living with them
is better than being at an--

456
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,491
Would a kid who barely
gets to eat feel the same?

457
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,251
What's up with him?

458
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,513
What's this?
She kept her sleeping pills separately.

459
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,809
If we were late,
this could've been really bad.

460
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,372
Hello.

461
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,416
The passenger isn't wearing her seatbelt,

462
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,668
and you watched TV as you were driving.

463
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,962
I forgot. Could you let us off this once?

464
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,172
Please show me your ID.

465
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,550
-You didn't have your seatbelt on?
-I didn't realize. I forgot.

466
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,358
We'll be on standby here today.

467
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,069
A team requested assistance
with a drunk at a--

468
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,403
Are you in charge?

469
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,866
Today, we will be on standby here.

470
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,536
This is work too.

471
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,955
Murder and violence crimes
isn't the only kind of work.

472
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,957
This is being productive too.

473
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,589
Did you see them?

474
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,592
See? They're going to take care of
the convenience store drunk.

475
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,392
He has a few screws loose.

476
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,185
He keeps staring at his phone.

477
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,605
He asked to go to Dohwa 1-dong's
Community Center, so I took him there.

478
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,607
But he wouldn't get out,
nor would he pay me.

479
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,859
Then he suddenly cursed

480
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,695
and even spit at me.

481
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,334
Sir, get out of the taxi.

482
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,297
You didn't pay your fare,
and you refuse to get out.

483
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,175
If you don't cooperate,
I'll have to drag you out.

484
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,968
Hello? Sir?

485
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,928
I'll give you five seconds.

486
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,723
Did you see that?

487
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,767
I'll count to five.

488
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,686
One,

489
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:29,937
two,

490
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,773
three, four.

491
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,816
Stop counting.

492
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,369
Let's go to the bathroom, sir. Get out.

493
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,373
Your pants are wet, and it's cold.
You'll catch a cold.

494
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,628
Let's get you changed,
and go someplace warm. It's cold here.

495
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:54,962
Come along.

496
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,632
Come along.

497
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,434
It's cold. Let's go.

498
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,062
It's so cold.

499
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,072
He's mentally disabled.

500
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,951
Consider this your good deed for the day,

501
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,869
and wash your car with this.

502
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,666
When you receive a call,

503
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,920
calmly assess the situation first. How can
a cop lose her temper right off the bat?

504
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,881
Couldn't you tell that he wasn't normal?

505
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,676
His phone was around his neck,
his shoes were mismatched

506
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,927
and he couldn't understand us.

507
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,596
He was drooling too.
He's obviously not normal.

508
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,682
We shouldn't use the term "not normal".

509
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,810
We are able-bodied,
and he has disabilities.

510
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,104
Those are the correct terms to use.

511
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,023
How ignorant.

512
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:02,905
Geez, at least she knows something.

513
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,931
Dad, you're up?

514
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,143
It's only 5 a.m.

515
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,145
<i>I have a busy day ahead
with a lot of orders.</i>

516
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,565
<i>Look at you. You're wearing your uniform.</i>

517
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,608
Yes.

518
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,153
Dad,
let me introduce you to my colleagues.

519
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,407
This tall guy here lives downstairs
from me.

520
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:51,829
This girl here is my roommate.
She can be a little standoffish.

521
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,126
Dad, what's Mom doing now?
And what about Tae-yang and Hye-min?

522
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,419
<i>They're still asleep.</i>

523
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,755
<i>I have to work now. Let's talk later.</i>

524
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,006
Yes, sir.

525
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,353
Why didn't you say hello to my dad?

526
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,075
I wasn't in the mood
to say hello to your dad.

527
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,452
I didn't have dinner,

528
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,829
my mentor made me park
the patrol car so he could sleep,

529
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,039
and we have a ton of cases.

530
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,626
All I do is issue tickets
for traffic violations.

531
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,839
My mom, who has a panic disorder,
is ignoring my calls because she's mad.

532
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,096
Seeing the homicide scene
must've been traumatizing.

533
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,141
I've also seen a person covered in blood,

534
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,686
so I know how traumatizing it can be.

535
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,981
My dad is disabled.

536
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,234
He lost a hand.

537
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,570
I saw it happening.

538
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,869
I'm sorry I said you're
calculating and obnoxious.

539
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,917
See you in two days.

540
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:31,762
How are you feeling?

541
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,933
-I'm just...
-Just what? Tell me.

542
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,313
To be honest,

543
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:46,152
I think you'll scold me when you hear it
because you're so competent

544
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,238
and you have varied experience
such as the Violent Crime Unit.

545
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,912
But being a cop is scary.

546
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,628
Today,
I issued traffic tickets all day long.

547
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:09,258
I complained to Sergeant Kang and asked
why we didn't report to a case,

548
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,180
but frankly, I had a relaxing day.

549
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,974
Aren't I a total slacker?

550
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,393
No.

551
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:25,149
To tell you the truth,
homicide cases scare me as well.

552
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,736
I'm sure that's how all cops feel
even though no one says it.

553
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,780
Aren't I right?

554
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,783
Chief and Captain,
isn't being a cop scary at times?

555
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,745
No, I'm not scared.

556
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,122
Why? Are you scared, Jeong-o?

557
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,125
The solution is simple. Just quit.
How can you be a cop when you're scared?

558
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,213
-Just go home and watch the kids.
-Goodness.

559
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,968
He can be a jerk. That's just how he is.

560
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,141
She needs some real consolation because of
the homicide case from the other day.

561
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,773
What Captain Eun said isn't wrong.

562
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:12,363
How can we call ourselves police officers
if we're scared of working on cases?

563
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,700
Can I eat that if you don't want it?

564
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,173
It's okay. You can be scared.

565
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,928
But just remember this. Citizens can
avoid things when they're scared,

566
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,974
but we, the police, must investigate
all cases even if we're scared.

567
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,685
Just make a choice.

568
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,187
Run away because you're scared,

569
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,898
or look into the case
even though you're scared.

570
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,317
What will you do?

571
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,288
I still want to

572
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,332
look into cases.

573
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,763
It is scary. It sure is.

574
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:25,978
This is hot.

575
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,816
<i>Why won't you eat?
You worked hard all night.</i>

576
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,235
I don't want to. I don't have an appetite.

577
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,030
If you don't eat, I won't eat either.

578
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,057
All right, I'm sorry. I'll eat.

579
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,184
Get up already. Let's eat, okay?

580
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,353
I don't want to eat.

581
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,564
You said you haven't eaten
since your early morning shift.

582
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,108
-What if you get sick?
-I'm sleepy.

583
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,069
Leave me alone.
Eat something and go to bed.

584
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,947
Don't fall asleep yet.
I'll go fix a meal for us.

585
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,582
Mom.

586
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:15,921
I cooked instant noodles.
Let's eat noodles.

587
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,882
Sang-jun!

588
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,611
Where did you get this?

589
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,779
You don't need to know.

590
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,408
Did your friend give it to you again?

591
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,368
Yes.

592
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,372
You little prick. You took money
from your friends again, didn't you?

593
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,457
Yes, I did. So what?

594
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,625
You punk.

595
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,253
I'm going to teach you
a serious lesson today.

596
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:59,173
You hit your friends
and take money from them every day.

597
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,300
Did I teach you to do such bad things?
Did I?

598
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,344
Then what am I supposed to do?
Both Sang-su and I are hungry.

599
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,473
After Dad died, you don't cook for us.
All you do is drink.

600
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,475
You're jobless, and you have no income!

601
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,393
Is that your excuse
for acting like a punk?

602
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,938
Why are you hitting me?
Who do you think you are?

603
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,107
You have no right to hit us!

604
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,943
You don't cook for us, you're jobless,
and all you do is drink!

605
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,071
I hate you.
I'd much rather live in an orphanage.

606
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,449
Send me and Sang-su to an orphanage.

607
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,201
Send us to an orphanage!

608
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,540
Sang-jun!

609
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,088
That little jerk...

610
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,592
I'm having a hard time too.

611
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,475
You thought I wasn't going to eat, right?

612
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,437
No, I knew that you were
trying to trick me to make me eat.

613
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,150
You're such a good son.
I raised you so well.

614
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,194
I don't like when you touch my head.

615
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:03,904
Don't be so difficult.

616
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,663
It's Sang-jun.

617
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,998
I talked to him the other day.
You talk to him. I'm okay.

618
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,752
Hey, Sang-jun. It's been a while.

619
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,222
<i>I remember that day, of course.</i>

620
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,516
<i>Had a cop like me caught you back then,</i>

621
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,518
<i>you'd have ten counts of theft
on your record now.</i>

622
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,852
<i>Stop making things up.</i>

623
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,521
<i>I only did it twice.</i>

624
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,939
<i>Only twice, my ass.</i>

625
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,525
<i>I clearly remember
at least five incidents.</i>

626
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,319
<i>That's not true. I was a good kid.</i>

627
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,072
<i>You're right.</i>

628
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:52,035
<i>So what's going to happen to that boy
from the Internet cafe?</i>

629
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,457
<i>I don't know.</i>

630
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,296
<i>I know there's nothing I can do,
but I can't stop worrying about him.</i>

631
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,174
<i>I had you when our mom neglected us,</i>

632
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,260
<i>but he's all alone.</i>

633
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,763
<i>Children can't live alone.</i>

634
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,437
-Pass the ball!
-Kick it over!

635
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,448
Let's go!

636
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,159
Nice pass.

637
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:44,004
We should've gone to
a nice restaurant or coffee shop

638
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,339
instead of staying home.

639
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,634
Let's go out. It's even snowing outside.

640
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,817
APPLICATION FOR DIVORCE
AND CUSTODY OF CHILDREN

641
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,747
Next time, you bring the papers to me.

642
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,040
I can't agree to a divorce.

643
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,292
Take me to court.

644
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,295
Just like the movie, <i>The War of the Roses</i>,

645
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,631
we'll make a whole mess of things.
You and me. Shit.

646
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,566
Not even a judge would understand this.

647
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,324
Come on.

648
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,326
What did I...

649
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,829
What did I do that was so wrong?

650
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,331
Did I hit you?

651
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,500
Did I cheat on you?

652
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,877
Or did I not provide for our family,
or was I--

653
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:09,172
Just because you didn't hit me
or cheat on me,

654
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,924
and you earned money for this family,

655
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,635
doesn't mean that
I have to stay miserable.

656
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,179
Can't you just let it slide?

657
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,639
Why...

658
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,267
Why is everything so complicated with you?

659
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,645
I love you, and I'm happy.

660
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,815
I don't love you, and I'm miserable.

661
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,811
I thought that

662
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,815
I'd need you desperately
at least once in my life.

663
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,567
But it turns out

664
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,402
that I didn't.

665
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,823
I could do everything on my own,
without you.

666
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,910
When I gave birth,

667
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,745
when our kids were sick,

668
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:28,627
when I took care of my parents,
who grew ill and collapsed

669
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,714
after raising our kids for us,

670
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,008
and

671
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,719
their funeral.

672
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,349
I was able to do all of it alone,
without you.

673
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,901
Of course,

674
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:02,202
it would've been nice to have you
by my side

675
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:07,290
whenever I was scared, terrified,

676
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,293
or desperate.

677
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,588
However,

678
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,635
you were never by my side. Not even once.

679
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,596
You son of a bitch.

680
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,450
I was working too.

681
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,621
Jang-mi.

682
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,000
I wasn't fooling around.

683
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:54,921
Still...

684
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,050
Still, I'm sorry.

685
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,511
I really am.

686
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,769
While I was scattering my parents' ashes,

687
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,648
I let go of any fondness that

688
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,276
I still had for you.

689
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,534
I can't live with you anymore.

690
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,552
I've been good to you until now, right?

691
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:46,514
If that's the case, the least you can do
is give me this divorce.

692
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,621
You may have been a crappy husband,

693
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,166
but you are a great cop.

694
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,587
What happened to Ho-cheol

695
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,257
was just an accident.

696
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,096
Why would you bring that up?

697
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,432
If someone jumped into the ocean,

698
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:33,478
even if he was a drunk,
you had to save him because you're a cop.

699
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,983
You can't be responsible
for a freak accident.

700
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,985
Cops are human too.

701
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,655
I don't want you to feel guilty

702
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,701
about what happened to Ho-cheol.

703
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,709
Pass it here!

704
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,547
Aren't you cold?

705
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:53,892
Tomorrow, my mom is coming for me.

706
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:01,149
Good for you. I'm glad she's coming.

707
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:05,945
But I don't want to go to
the Internet cafe.

708
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,051
Do you want it?

709
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,707
Chew it 50 times.

710
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:15,014
What? You gave the boy your business card?

711
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,602
Geez.

712
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,066
Do you think you're Superman?

713
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,069
What can you do for him?

714
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,573
Are you going to run to him when he calls?

715
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,658
Or give him your monthly salary,
instead of your mom?

716
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,869
What can you do for him?

717
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,788
I won't do what I can't

718
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,290
and do what I can.

719
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,543
I can't stand doing nothing at all.

720
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,551
I don't know about this.

721
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,069
Hello, Captain An,
it's Yeom Sang-su from Hongil Patrol.

722
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,988
About the video I sent you of the child...

723
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,156
I showed it to her.

724
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,159
I suggested she send the kid to a facility

725
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,703
and get professional help herself.

726
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,164
I even threatened to take her to court.

727
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,665
But

728
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,044
she'd rather die than give up her son.

729
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,464
There's nothing
we can do to keep her here,

730
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,841
<i>so we let her go.</i>

731
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,135
<i>Prosecutors will indict her
for child neglect--</i>

732
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,095
What if something goes wrong before then?

733
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,933
If the mom's healthy,
then the kid's better off with her.

734
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,770
But that woman needs help.
She's in no condition to raise a kid.

735
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,314
<i>He'll have to fend for himself and he's</i>

736
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,316
just a kid.

737
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,860
-He can do nothing on his own.
-Silence.

738
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:52,820
<i>I'll tell you clearly.</i>

739
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,075
What you and I must do as a police officer

740
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,826
ends as of this moment.

741
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,829
<i>The instant this call ends,</i>

742
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,957
<i>you should forget about
the Internet cafe kid.</i>

743
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:08,336
Do not cling to this case. If not,
you won't be able to solve other cases.

744
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,878
Hurry up.

745
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,381
Hurry up. I need to get out.

746
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,842
Hurry, hurry.

747
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,596
Come up faster.

748
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,523
Hello?

749
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,067
Is this the police?

750
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,996
Who turns the siren on in an emergency?

751
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,248
The perp could get away if he's nearby.

752
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,792
Don't you know protocol?
Turn the siren off.

753
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,547
Turn your hazard lights on.

754
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,678
Myeong-ho, where are you?

755
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,641
I checked the security footage
from nearby.

756
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,225
Thanks for your help.

757
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,187
We'll go to where the woman disappeared.

758
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,314
It's a blind spot,
so we can't see anything.

759
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:52,940
We'll arrive at the scene soon.

760
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:57,487
It has only been ten minutes
since the call came in.

761
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,781
In that time,
she couldn't have gotten far.

762
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,157
Okay.

763
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,083
I see Captain Eun is already here.

764
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,490
You're here early.

765
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,284
The boys are getting
the witness' statement

766
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:48,663
-and knocking on doors.
-Is that from multiple people?

767
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,498
At a glimpse,

768
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,875
I see yellow hair,

769
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,086
black hair and curly hair.

770
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:59,924
It looks like illegal prostitution
with foreign women.

771
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,219
There was blood trickling down
the woman's legs.

772
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,264
I think a pervert used a horrific item.

773
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,392
The woman was afraid of getting arrested
for illegal prostitution,

774
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,935
so she ran away without reporting it.

775
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,187
-Where's Forensics?
-They're on their way.

776
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,691
If we don't find
the victim or perpetrator--

777
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,651
It'll become a long-term investigation.

778
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,946
Even if we run the hair samples for DNA,
if he doesn't have a record,

779
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,365
there's no guarantee we'll catch him.

780
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,996
Myeong-ho.

781
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,374
Okay.

782
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:35,626
Where to?

783
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:39,172
No, I'd never seen her before.

784
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,842
Do you know how many

785
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:46,179
Southeast Asian women
live in this apartment block?

786
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,222
I don't know.

787
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,266
I never saw anyone.

788
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,435
Did you?

789
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,937
I think I saw someone in the elevator.

790
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,522
Which floor did she get off at?

791
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,817
I don't remember that.

792
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,837
I checked security cameras nearby,

793
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,130
and she ran this way.

794
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,808
<i>Someone else cleaned up the blood.</i>

795
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:35,770
<i>The security footage
shows her holding her phone</i>

796
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,897
<i>and contacting someone.</i>

797
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,277
<i>The water trail ends in front of unit 816.</i>

798
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,321
<i>I'll go alone.</i>

799
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,906
<i>We'll stand guard.</i>

800
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:41,020
I'm Captain An Jang-mi from Mahyeon
Police Station's Women & Juvenile Affairs.

801
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:42,897
Hongil Patrol Division?

802
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,066
Yes, ma'am.

803
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,401
I'm Officer Han Jeong-o.

804
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:52,114
How did you

805
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,075
find this place?

806
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:57,411
I was going through the list of tenants.

807
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,289
In the list, the crime scene, unit 512,

808
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,916
and this place, unit 816,

809
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:05,211
were both recorded as company offices.

810
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,255
One is called EM,

811
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,633
the other is called CM.
Although they have different names,

812
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:12,843
the CEO's name was the same.

813
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,345
So I came here to check.

814
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,086
Someone's inside.

815
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,630
How does it look from the outside?

816
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,340
There are bars on the windows.

817
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,591
That means

818
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,428
they can't escape through the window.

819
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:00,349
This is the police. Please open up.

820
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,937
We know you're inside.

821
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:06,939
Open up!

822
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,986
If you don't open the door,
we'll force our way in.

823
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:13,446
Open the door.

824
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:20,703
What's this about?

825
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,624
I didn't do anything wrong.

826
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,085
I have a passport.

827
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:30,880
What is this about?

828
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,632
-What is it?
-Please calm down.

829
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:37,011
Don't come in!

830
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,358
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

831
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:05,915
<i>Blood was seen being washed off
in unit 816.</i>

832
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:09,752
<i>That means the victim took a shower there</i>

833
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,378
<i>only a few minutes earlier.</i>

834
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:14,423
<i>Those who took the woman are nearby</i>

835
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,258
in our district.

836
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:19,095
Illegal prostitution in our district?

837
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,347
Captain An will have her hands full.

838
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:24,350
There's no evidence of solicitation,

839
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,310
and the suspect
and victim are on the loose.

840
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:29,271
The women had passport, student IDs,
and legal documents,

841
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:31,732
so we can't even hold them.

842
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:35,152
I think something is going to happen
in our district.

843
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:42,159
Han Jeong-o,
you didn't hesitate once today.

844
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,285
Weren't you scared?

845
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,748
Even though I am, I'll keep doing my job.

846
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:53,504
Don't look too far for a role model.
Just be like Captain An.

847
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,288
EUN GYEONG-MO

848
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,582
<i>Be careful.</i>

849
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,252
Han Jeong-o.

850
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:36,964
You grew up well.

851
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,341
You really did.

852
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:46,557
Lieutenant Lee,
how are things on your end?

853
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:50,352
We got into a car accident
on our way to the scene,

854
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,687
so we're waiting for tow truck.

855
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:52,813
Stop it already.

856
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,356
-<i>How is everything?</i>
-Enough already.

857
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,858
Please calm down.

858
01:09:57,151 --> 01:10:00,571
We're good over here,
so take care of yourselves.

859
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:01,780
Let him go.

860
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,283
What an asshole.

861
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,702
I can't let him get away with this.

862
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,120
Sir, please.

863
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,414
Just end things here.

864
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:12,333
Those inside took a beating too.

865
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:16,253
I paid for all the damage
that asshole caused at the bar,

866
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,506
but he didn't even thank me!
That son of a bitch!

867
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,926
I should beat him up and pay a settlement.

868
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,677
Sir, please.

869
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:26,722
Do you think that's appropriate
to say in front of the police?

870
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,185
Calm down already.

871
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,646
I was calming him down,
but now I have calm you too?

872
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,690
-What's that?
-She's a pig, that's what.

873
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,235
We came here because it was famous.

874
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:41,779
We shouldn't have come
to this crappy neighborhood.

875
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,031
-Fuck. How annoying.
-Let's just go.

876
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:47,368
Don't drink and drive!

877
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:52,790
Who does he think he is cussing
at his elders? How disrespectful.

878
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:54,166
Damn it.

879
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,503
The man inside has calmed down now,

880
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,213
so I'll head back.

881
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,424
I'm tired after pulling a double shift.

882
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,592
-Take it easy.
-Good job.

883
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:04,718
Good job, sir.

884
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,482
We're your backup.

885
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:20,442
I came on foot since the entry was jammed.

886
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,195
Sergeant Kang
is trying to find another route here.

887
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,406
Patrol 21 will take the call.

888
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,242
I'm exhausted.
Why would you take that call?

889
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,911
-Aren't you going home?
-It's on the way back.

890
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:39,378
Your job is to make sure
the man inside gets home.

891
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:41,797
The owner asked us to do that.

892
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:45,843
<i>Sergeant Kang, where are you?</i>

893
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:51,056
I'm on my way,
but the alley is packed with cars.

894
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,392
I need to turn back.

895
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:56,437
How is everything?
I heard things dialed down.

896
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,273
<i>Don't take any action alone.</i>

897
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:02,735
Always be on guard when he's still drunk.

898
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:06,905
Don't let your guard down just because
things have settled. Be alert.

899
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:10,617
Yes, sir.
I'll be on alert until you arrive.

900
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:15,164
Can you come inside?

901
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:19,376
He keeps asking for more liquor.
I'm scared all by myself.

902
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:35,392
Can you stay here while I clean up?

903
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,291
I can't believe you.

904
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:00,918
What's your relation...

905
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:03,629
I'm his wife.

906
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,716
-Honey, let's go home.
-Let go.

907
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:12,012
Sir, now that your wife is here,
you should go home.

908
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,722
Let's go.

909
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:14,807
Let go of me!

910
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:20,270
For someone so pathetic,
I'm surprised you have a wife.

911
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,147
What did you just say?

912
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:23,774
-Sir, please.
-Honey...

913
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:24,858
Get out of my way!

914
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,361
You!

915
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:29,905
Take that!

916
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:36,412
-Stop it.
-Move!

917
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,377
-No, don't.
-Move!

918
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:46,839
Die!

919
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,758
Die, you son of a bitch!

920
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:51,677
Die!

921
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:53,762
Get up.

922
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,764
Die, you bastard!

923
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:56,849
Die!

924
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,291
Oh, my god! What is this?

925
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:23,917
Oh, no!

926
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:25,794
Honey? Honey!

927
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:27,754
Honey?

928
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,091
Honey! Honey, wake up!

929
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:33,635
Honey!

930
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,763
What did you do?

931
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:39,391
My wife is pregnant!

932
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,727
Honey, wake up.

933
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:43,896
Our poor baby...

934
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,850
<i>I don't need your worries or consolations.</i>

935
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,894
When something happens,
no one will be on our side.

936
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,312
<i>You did nothing wrong.</i>

937
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:27,856
<i>Protocol didn't come to mind
at that moment.</i>

938
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,733
In this case,
Jeong-o will be investigated.

939
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:31,693
Let's go together.

940
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:33,570
<i>I tried, but I couldn't do it.</i>

941
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,155
-You look good.
-Can't we rethink this?

942
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,533
This is what you hate, isn't it?

943
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:41,203
You're a woman...
You'll just lose your job.

944
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:43,580
But I have a wife and a kid.

945
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,583
<i>Officer Han, just come clean.
You didn't know the protocol, did you?</i>

946
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:54,174
